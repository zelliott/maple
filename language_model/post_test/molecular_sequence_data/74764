zzso of some zzso family zzso channels by protein zzso C zzso regulates their zzso and zzso and adjusts firing patterns of auditory zzso in response to zzso Nevertheless, little is known about the zzso of zzso a channel that is widely expressed throughout the nervous system and is the dominant zzso family member in auditory zzso We have cloned the zzso for the zzso channel from mouse brain and have expressed it in a zzso cell line and in zzso zzso to characterize its zzso properties and zzso by zzso zzso currents activate at positive zzso and undergo zzso with time zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased current zzso and removed zzso of zzso zzso and a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso prevented the effects of the zzso zzso of the first 78 zzso acids of the N zzso of zzso produced zzso currents suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially by zzso of sites in this zzso To identify potential zzso sites, we investigated the response of channels in which zzso in this zzso domain were subjected to zzso Our results suggest that zzso at positions 3 and 9 are potential zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations of model zzso suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso may allow zzso to maintain action potential height during stimulation at high zzso and may therefore contribute to zzso changes in the intrinsic zzso of zzso such as those of the auditory zzso
