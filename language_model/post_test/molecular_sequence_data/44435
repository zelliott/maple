zzso zzso acid type C zzso receptors are believed to be composed of zzso zzso Although zzso 1 and zzso 2 are over zzso similar, the zzso currents generated by zzso 1 receptors in zzso zzso are significantly greater than those generated by zzso 2 zzso In this study, zzso zzso containing different portions of human zzso 1 and human zzso 2 were created to zzso sequences zzso robust zzso 1 zzso Our results indicate that these sequences reside in a 100 zzso acid domain in the zzso of zzso 1, and may involve zzso zzso Since the zzso also contains zzso assembly signals, zzso 1 receptors may be formed more efficiently than zzso 2 zzso zzso this study zzso our understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso in the zzso
