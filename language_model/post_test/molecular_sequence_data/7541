The most abundant surface zzso on the zzso stage of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the structures of two new zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and investigated the nature of zzso zzso in the previously characterized zzso of zzso major zzso and zzso These molecules contain a zzso chain, made up of repeating zzso beta zzso units and a zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso occurs in the extent to which the zzso repeat units are zzso with different zzso side zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the most complex zzso characterized to date, as most of the repeat units are zzso with more than 19 different zzso side zzso All of these side zzso including the novel major zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso are linked to the zzso position of the backbone zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso repeat units are partially zzso zzso with single zzso zzso that are linked, zzso to the zzso position of the zzso in the backbone zzso zzso is also evident in the spectrum of zzso zzso that cap the zzso zzso of the zzso chains of these zzso Finally, analysis of the zzso major zzso showed that, while some strains contain zzso which are highly zzso with side chains of beta zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso the zzso of other strains zzso zzso major zzso are essentially zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso side chains and cap structures can mediate zzso attachment to a number of different receptors along the zzso of the zzso zzso The possible significance of zzso zzso on the ability of these zzso to zzso a number of different zzso zzso is zzso
