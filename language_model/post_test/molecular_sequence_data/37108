The zzso growth factor zzso gene is highly regulated and responsive to zzso stimuli that control cell zzso We have identified five putative nuclear zzso zzso binding sites within the zzso growth factor zzso zzso promoter region by sequence zzso We have analyzed the potential role of zzso family members in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analysis demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso proteins of the zzso bound to the zzso promoter at four out of five of these zzso However, it was found that zzso could not zzso the zzso by zzso experiments with each zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso promoter zzso zzso Treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor zzso which could degrade the zzso and then result in zzso of zzso to nucleus, did not enhance zzso promoter reporter gene zzso Also, zzso did not induce zzso expression at the protein zzso These results indicate that even though zzso zzso can bind to the putative sites, there is no evidence that zzso zzso the zzso promoter zzso
