The passage of zzso class I heavy chains through the zzso zzso is promoted by association with beta 2 zzso zzso zzso In order to analyze the structural basis of this phenomenon, processing and cell surface expression of zzso class I molecules have been investigated in the beta zzso zzso human melanoma cell line zzso zzso with either the human or mouse beta zzso zzso These natural structural zzso of beta zzso display zzso zzso acid sequence zzso In comparison with a human beta zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the mouse beta zzso gene zzso express zzso class I molecules that are processed with zzso altered zzso and are present on the cell surface at reduced zzso The zzso expression of zzso class I heavy chains zzso by zzso cells reflects a zzso in heavy chain stability since cell surface expression of zzso class I zzso was increased following incubation at 30 degrees zzso The increased cell surface expression paralleled accelerated processing of zzso class I heavy chains by zzso zzso In contrast, no induction in either cell surface expression or processing of zzso class I heavy chains was observed for the beta zzso zzso parent cell line, which remained zzso class I zzso zzso when cultured at 30 degrees C, or the zzso human beta zzso zzso which expressed equivalent levels of zzso class I zzso on the cell surface at 37 degrees C and 30 degrees zzso Further zzso of the zzso induction of zzso class I zzso expression was accomplished by treatment of the zzso zzso with zzso this latter effect appears to be active at a zzso step for zzso cells since zzso was not as potent a zzso zzso at 30 degrees C as it was at 37 degrees zzso These results indicate that zzso class I heavy chains expressed by zzso cells are subject to zzso and zzso stabilization that increases their affinity for the structural zzso of beta zzso and promotes zzso of the zzso class I zzso to the cell zzso Furthermore, beta zzso zzso zzso class I heavy chains undergo stabilization that is not associated with enhanced cell surface zzso indicating that the zzso of putative zzso zzso class I zzso is a process dependent upon association with beta zzso
