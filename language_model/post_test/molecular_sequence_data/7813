The zzso genes of zzso zzso are expressed under zzso zzso zzso is regulated by both zzso assembly cues and zzso zzso In this paper we define the sequences required for the expression of the zzso zzso a new class of zzso 54 zzso zzso This promoter type is expressed in the middle portion of the cell cycle and regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso demonstrates that an integration host factor zzso site is required for zzso levels of zzso of the zzso zzso In addition to containing a conventional upstream zzso element zzso this promoter is unusual in that it also requires sequences zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso start site for zzso levels of gene zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso and zzso contribute equally to the regulation of zzso zzso The presence of two intact elements in the promoter results in a fourfold increase in promoter activity compared with a promoter containing only one intact element, suggesting that these two elements may function zzso to activate zzso
