Recently, a new zzso B virus zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in which one zzso zzso motif of the zzso promoter had zzso most frequently by both zzso and zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso zzso The clinical significance of this zzso is as yet zzso In our present study, the zzso zzso zzso was sought in zzso from zzso blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a zzso region of zzso Also, because the zzso zzso generates a zzso zzso site zzso we zzso the zzso products with zzso to see if zzso would occur at this specific zzso Our results mostly zzso the earlier report but we found a zzso frequency of zzso zzso blood donors positive for the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in these zzso zzso were slightly decreased compared to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal zzso serum zzso zzso zzso levels, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious zzso in these otherwise zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the zzso zzso zzso in an extensive number of clinical zzso
