zzso zzso are important zzso and stress related zzso We identified 27 putative genes zzso zzso in the zzso zzso via in zzso techniques and four zzso Only seven of the zzso and segments of the zzso were zzso zzso The zzso included members of family 19 zzso zzso zzso of zzso II of zzso and members of family 18 zzso zzso III of zzso Some similar zzso were detected on adjacent regions of the same zzso and seem to result from zzso zzso Most of the genes expressed were identified from zzso libraries from plants exposed to zzso or zzso stresses but also from libraries from zzso not exposed to zzso We isolated proteins from zzso of zzso in the presence or absence of the symbiotic root colonizing fungus zzso zzso strain zzso and analyzed the activity of zzso zzso using an zzso activity zzso The activity bands were identified by zzso using the database from our in zzso zzso The identities of the zzso changed depending on whether or not zzso was zzso One activity band of about 95 zzso appeared to be a zzso between an zzso and any of several different zzso The identity of the zzso component appeared to be dependent upon zzso
