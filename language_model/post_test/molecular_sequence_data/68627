A comprehensive analysis of the energetic importance of the 31 zzso buried at the interface between human growth hormone zzso and the zzso binding domain of its zzso zzso has been carried out to assess the roles of contact zzso in modulating the affinity and zzso of zzso Each zzso in zzso was converted to zzso and the zzso and affinity were measured using a zzso zzso This detects binding of the zzso hormones to the immobilized zzso by changes induced in zzso zzso The data generated on the zzso match affinities obtained by zzso zzso in zzso The study shows that only one-quarter of the zzso buried at the interface can account for the majority of the binding zzso These zzso cluster near the center of the structural zzso The role of these zzso is predominantly to slow zzso because most of the effect of the zzso zzso is to increase the zzso not to slow the zzso The hormone associates about 10,000 times slower than expected from random diffusion but 1000 times faster than may be expected if one zzso strict orientation restraints for a productive zzso zzso interactions partly zzso association because zzso at zzso zzso most affect association and together contribute a factor of about 20 to the zzso The data suggest that the hormone and zzso associate by diffusion and zzso to form an ensemble of weak zzso zzso From these a bound complex is produced that is stabilized by only a small proportion of the zzso We suggest that zzso energies and/or zzso interactions within the free hormone or zzso may be so favorable that little energy is gained at most zzso upon zzso The fact that the functional binding zzso is much smaller than the structural zzso suggests it may be possible to design smaller hormone zzso
