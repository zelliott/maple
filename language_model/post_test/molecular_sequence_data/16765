zzso mice are highly susceptible to experimental zzso zzso zzso induced with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso mice are zzso zzso and zzso to zzso are associated with a high precursor frequency of zzso zzso T cells in the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso resistance in zzso mice, we determined the precursor frequency of zzso zzso T cells in both strains by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice had similar zzso of zzso T cells in the zzso peripheral zzso However, in zzso mice, the majority of zzso zzso zzso cells were in the zzso population, whereas there were more zzso cells in the zzso population of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso facilitated the expansion of zzso zzso cells with production of T helper 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso treatment before zzso resulted in zzso induction in these otherwise resistant zzso These data indicate an important role for zzso zzso cells in genetic resistance to zzso
