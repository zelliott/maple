In zzso cells, zzso spliced by a zzso that produces a zzso zzso linkage contain a zzso group adjacent to the zzso zzso This zzso is transferred to zzso to give zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is subsequently zzso to zzso zzso zzso The latter reaction is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso previously identified in zzso and zzso In the work presented here, we describe cloning of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso Properties of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similar to those of wheat zzso In addition to their transformation of zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the apparent zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that zzso in zzso is zzso by a single copy gene that is zzso at different levels, in all zzso zzso that were zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso showed that zzso is localized in the zzso Based on zzso specificity and products generated, the plant zzso differs from other known zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not have recognizable structural similarity or motifs in common with proteins deposited in public data zzso
