Limited information is available on zzso Indian zzso C sensitivities to zzso zzso during the course of natural zzso In the present study, a total of 37 complete envelope clones zzso were amplified at different time points predominantly from the plasma of five Indian patients with recent zzso infection and zzso viruses were examined for their magnitude of sensitivity to zzso plasma zzso during natural course of zzso 

zzso low levels of zzso were consistently detected with zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso B and African zzso C zzso envelopes, zzso clones obtained from four patients were found to be resistant to zzso The majority of the zzso clones were resistant to zzso and zzso due to the absence of the minimal motifs required for zzso recognition, but were sensitive to zzso Nonetheless, zzso clones from one patient were found to be sensitive to zzso zzso for zzso C, and one zzso clone exhibited unusual sensitivity to zzso suggesting spontaneous exposure of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso clones were closely clustered within zzso Variation in the potential zzso zzso pattern also appeared to be different in patients over the course of zzso Interestingly, we found that the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso correlated positively with increased sensitivity to soluble zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with increased zzso sensitivity were able to efficiently zzso zzso cells expressing low zzso 

Our data showed considerable variations in zzso zzso of these early zzso zzso C zzso in each of these patients and indicate greater exposure to zzso of zzso that showed increased zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso clones obtained from a single patient at different time points were found to retain sensitivity to zzso zzso that binds to zzso binding site in zzso in contrast to zzso obtained from other zzso However, we did not find any association between increased zzso sensitivity of zzso obtained from this particular patient with their degree of exposure to zzso
