zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells are considered to be similar to bone-marrow derived mast cells and to zzso mast cells zzso the latter of which may be involved in inflammatory zzso zzso zzso cells are not able to accumulate zzso and zzso zzso under regular growing zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso which zzso mast cell zzso of zzso also inhibited zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso release while it induced synthesis of rat mast cell zzso zzso II and triggered processes leading to zzso of zzso zzso Cell viability was also retained in the presence of zzso whereas zzso cells did not survive past 6 days of zzso zzso did not affect the expression of zzso for zzso of zzso E zzso zzso but led to increased expression of zzso for, and synthesis of zzso II, which is a marker protein for zzso Many of these zzso showed zzso with zzso blue after 3 days of growth, stained red with zzso blue zzso with zzso after 8 days of growth, and contained electron dense zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells have the capacity to progress to a more mature state and may lend themselves to further analysis of a growth zzso with action similar to that of zzso
