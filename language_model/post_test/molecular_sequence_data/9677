The zzso protein of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso a dramatic reorganization of the zzso zzso Two zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso are the only cellular proteins known so far to bind directly to zzso This interaction is zzso by a zzso zzso the zzso zzso We identify zzso a motif repeated zzso within the primary sequence of zzso as the core of the consensus zzso for zzso zzso This motif is also present and functional in at least two cellular zzso zzso and zzso which are in this respect major zzso zzso of zzso The functional importance of the novel zzso interaction was examined in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding sites on zzso reduces bacterial zzso and strongly zzso zzso zzso Taken together we demonstrate that zzso binding is a paradigm for a novel class of zzso zzso interactions involving a zzso zzso that is clearly different from those described for zzso and zzso zzso This class of interactions appears to be of general importance for processes dependent on rapid zzso zzso
