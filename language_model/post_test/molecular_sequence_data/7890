zzso oxide zzso is an zzso zzso involved with various aspects of zzso physiology ranging from zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso NO is zzso from zzso by NO zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso located at zzso position zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein of 152 zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to rat zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso protein contains putative binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity is zzso dependent when expressed in cell zzso An alternative zzso zzso pattern also exists for zzso which is identical to that for zzso zzso zzso These structural and functional observations demonstrate remarkable conservation of zzso between zzso and zzso
