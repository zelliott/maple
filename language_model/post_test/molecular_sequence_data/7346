We have isolated a zzso for an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and determined its complete zzso zzso Both zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence analysis of this zzso showed significant similarity with a previously reported, partial sequence of an zzso zzso zzso and the complete sequence of human zzso Further, the in zzso translated zzso zzso zzso gene product was specifically zzso with a zzso zzso against human zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that there was little change in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso differentiation from zzso to the in zzso grown zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed a simple zzso organization for the zzso zzso zzso gene with more than one copy of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first complete sequence of an zzso for zzso to be reported in the zzso
