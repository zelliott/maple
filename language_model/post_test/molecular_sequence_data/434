The zzso of zzso peptides containing adjacent zzso has been studied by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and theoretical zzso The experimental results show that zzso zzso peptides cleave at the zzso zzso bond and generate the zzso zzso when adjacent zzso are the zzso zzso The major zzso occurs at the zzso zzso bond and produces the zzso zzso when adjacent zzso are not the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso fragmentation pathways of zzso zzso zzso have been investigated at the zzso and zzso levels of zzso The zzso and energies of transition state species and zzso interaction are also zzso
