zzso binding to the egg zzso zzso in zzso is a zzso zzso process that is generally species zzso The guinea pig zzso protein zzso has a required function in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of guinea pig zzso zzso is located on both the zzso plasma membrane and zzso zzso We report here the isolation and sequence of a full-length zzso for zzso (available from zzso under zzso number zzso The derived zzso acid sequence shows a mature protein of zzso zzso acids containing six zzso zzso sites and twelve zzso eight of which are tightly clustered near the zzso zzso The sequence indicates zzso is a novel protein with no relationship to the mouse zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and no significant zzso with other known zzso The two zzso zzso plasma membrane and zzso zzso could arise because one form of zzso is zzso and zzso targeted at different zzso zzso zzso two different forms of zzso could be zzso Our evidence thus far reveals only one sequence coding for zzso Southern blots of guinea pig zzso DNA indicated there is a single zzso zzso Northern blots showed a single size zzso message zzso zzso zzso and no sequence zzso were found among the zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern blots reveal the presence of a zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso DNA, showing the zzso gene is zzso among zzso Since genes for zzso zzso are also zzso among zzso the general features of zzso and zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso may have been zzso zzso Species specificity may result from limited changes in these zzso either in their binding zzso or in other regions that affect the ability of the binding zzso to zzso
