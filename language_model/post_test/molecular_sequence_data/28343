The three-dimensional solution structure of a zinc finger zzso acid binding motif has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of a synthetic zzso corresponding to a single zinc finger from the zzso protein zzso yielded distance and zzso angle constraints that were used to generate structures from distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics zzso The zinc finger is an independently folded domain with a compact zzso structure in which the zinc atom is bound by two zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso backbone fold consists of a zzso zzso starting as alpha and ending as zzso zzso packed against two beta strands that are arranged in a hairpin zzso A high density of basic and polar zzso acid side chains on the exposed face of the zzso are probably involved in DNA zzso
