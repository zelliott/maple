We modified an existing selection for zzso interactions based on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Using shotgun zzso scanning in conjunction with this selection, we analyzed the interaction of the nuclear zzso zzso with two peptides derived from nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso A large binding zzso stretching between and including the charge clamp zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was identified as necessary for zzso zzso To zzso protein stability from the propensity to form a zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso generated by shotgun scanning were further processed using a zzso screen measuring their in zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that many of the zzso that make up the binding zzso of zzso are also crucial for the stability of the zzso
