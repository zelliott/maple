zzso P genes are transcribed into two zzso which differ from each other by either one zzso and zzso zzso or two zzso and zzso zzso G zzso and which code for either the P or V zzso The G insertions always occur within a short run of zzso and a zzso mechanism for the insertions has been suggested in which the viral zzso zzso copies a template C zzso during zzso zzso Support for this mechanism was obtained by varying the reaction conditions during zzso virus zzso synthesis in zzso A zzso model is proposed which accounts for how the ratio of inserted to zzso zzso is controlled, and why some zzso insert one G and others two zzso when insertions zzso
