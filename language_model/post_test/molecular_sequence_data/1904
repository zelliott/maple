zzso of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso is zzso through a specific interaction between the major viral structural zzso zzso and an zzso packaging zzso zzso Many studies have investigated this process in zzso although the specific examination of the zzso interaction in this context is difficult due to the variety of other viral functions involved in zzso assembly in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to directly examine the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso In this system, zzso zzso regions exhibiting zzso zzso binding were zzso All zzso regions were located 3' to the viral zzso donor sequence of the viral zzso zzso No single short zzso sequence within zzso supported strong zzso zzso Instead, an zzso comprised of nearly the entire zzso region was necessary to demonstrate an appreciable zzso interaction in the zzso zzso zzso These finding support the notion that two zzso zzso and zzso are not sufficient to form a core zzso zzso zzso
