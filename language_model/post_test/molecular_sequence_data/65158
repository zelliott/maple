Although previous studies have already shown that both zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso are provided by a single zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the mechanism by which this occurs remains zzso Evidence presented here indicates that this zzso property is actually a result of two distinct zzso products alternatively generated from a single transcript of this zzso Except for an zzso zzso acid extension, these two zzso have the same zzso sequence and function exclusively in their respective compartments under normal zzso zzso gene zzso further suggest that this leader zzso can function independently as a zzso targeting signal and plays the major role in the zzso zzso of the zzso Additionally, whereas the short protein is zzso initiated from a traditional zzso zzso the longer zzso is generated from an upstream zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso appears to be the first example in the zzso wherein a functional protein zzso is initiated from a naturally occurring zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso initiation might be a mechanism existing throughout all zzso
