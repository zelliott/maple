zzso receptors include zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have a single MR and duplicate zzso that show variable sensitivities to zzso and zzso How these receptors compare functionally to zzso MR and zzso and the evolutionary significance of maintaining two zzso remains zzso 

We used up to seven steroids (including zzso cortisol and zzso zzso to compare the zzso specificity of the zzso binding zzso of zzso receptors between a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso fish zzso zzso a zzso model for steroid regulation of neural and behavioral zzso Variation in zzso sensitivity was considered in a broader zzso context by examining the zzso sensitivity of MR and zzso from the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso model for zzso zzso Both zzso species had a single MR and duplicate zzso All zzso were sensitive to zzso consistent with the hypothesis that zzso was the initial zzso of the ancestral zzso Variation in zzso zzso zzso to nine identified zzso acid zzso zzso rather than zzso relationships based on zzso zzso 

The zzso sensitivity of duplicate zzso in zzso is highly zzso in the context of their evolutionary zzso a property that likely led to zzso and maintenance of two zzso
