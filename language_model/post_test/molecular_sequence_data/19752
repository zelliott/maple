Cell fusion zzso by zzso virus requires three zzso zzso zzso and zzso but zzso is cell type zzso B cell fusion requires interaction between zzso class II and a fourth virus zzso zzso which complexes zzso with zzso zzso cell fusion requires interaction between zzso and a novel zzso cell zzso and is blocked by excess zzso We show here that zzso interacts directly with zzso and that point zzso in the region of zzso recognized by an zzso that zzso zzso zzso and B cell fusion significantly impact both the core fusion machinery and zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at zzso 594 completely abrogates fusion with either B cells or zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso acid at zzso zzso reduces fusion with zzso cells, greatly enhances fusion with B cells and allows low levels of B cell fusion even in the absence of zzso
