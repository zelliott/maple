The zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso protein zzso which promotes zzso zzso and zzso repair in zzso and zzso We cloned the zzso gene from the zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso of this gene in a zzso zzso zzso strain partially zzso the survival rate after zzso zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited properties typical of the zzso including the zzso of binding to zzso DNA zzso (one zzso of zzso per 3 zzso and DNA specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An inefficient zzso and very low zzso for zzso interaction position zzso closer to zzso than to zzso Judging by zzso zzso alone was zzso more zzso at 37 degrees C than its zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it maintained zzso zzso and DNA zzso activities up to 52 to 54 degrees C, whereas zzso was completely inactive at 47 degrees zzso A quick nucleation and an efficient zzso formation in the strand exchange reaction promoted by zzso occurred only at temperatures above 42 degrees zzso These reaction characteristics suggest that zzso is dependent on high temperatures for zzso
