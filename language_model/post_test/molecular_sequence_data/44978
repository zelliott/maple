zzso structural information of a plant zzso zzso zzso which was zzso from zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso was obtained by sequencing a series of zzso zzso permitting the cloning of the corresponding zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence was zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso of Mr zzso which is consistent with the size of the zzso zzso zzso There is a significant similarity with zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from various zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains consensus sequences for zzso centers and a putative zzso zzso zzso In addition, another zzso zzso highly zzso to zzso at both the zzso and zzso acid sequence levels, was zzso zzso would zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso of Mr zzso and has molecular characteristics similar to those of zzso zzso was expressed at a high level in roots, which was closely correlated with zzso results using zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was expressed at a higher level in zzso than in zzso We propose each zzso may have a unique function during plant zzso
