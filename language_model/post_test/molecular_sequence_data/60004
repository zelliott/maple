The hypothesis is presented that at least four families of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso evolved from bacterial zzso channel zzso Details of this hypothesis are organized around the recently determined crystal structure of a bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Each of the four identical zzso of this channel has two fully zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus an intervening hairpin segment that determines the zzso selectivity zzso zzso The zzso sequences appear to contain four sequential zzso motifs zzso which are likely to have arisen from gene zzso and fusion of the single zzso motif of a bacterial zzso channel zzso The zzso of zzso motifs is supported by a statistical comparison of the zzso profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments formed for each protein zzso Furthermore, these quantitative results indicate that the zzso family of zzso has remained closest to the zzso zzso zzso Strong sequence evidence is also found for zzso between the zzso zzso of numerous bacterial zzso channels and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which in turn are zzso to known zzso zzso of other zzso The case for zzso between bacterial zzso channels and the four families of zzso zzso is further supported by the accompanying zzso in which the patterns of zzso conservation are demonstrated to be similar to each other and consistent with the known zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso
