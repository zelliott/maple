A rat kidney zzso library was screened using an zzso zzso probe derived from an zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso Band 3 zzso zzso Ten zzso representing a single class of zzso and zzso the kidney Band 3 zzso zzso were zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that kidney Band 3 is a truncated version of zzso Band zzso The zzso acid rat kidney protein is virtually identical to mouse zzso Band 3 except that it lacks the first 79 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 of the Band 3 zzso which are included in zzso Band 3 zzso are not present in the kidney zzso The zzso regions of kidney Band 3 transcripts contain sequences from the third zzso and zzso 4 and 5 of the Band 3 zzso The sequences from zzso 4 and 5 that serve as untranslated sequences in the rat kidney zzso have the potential to zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso Band 3 but are not part of an open reading zzso the apparent translation initiation site zzso to zzso 80 of mouse zzso Band 3 zzso Northern zzso zzso studies indicate that two additional Band 3 zzso which differ in size from the major zzso pair transcript in zzso are expressed at low levels in kidney and zzso
