zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of zzso a key zzso in the regulation of zzso Several genes zzso distinct zzso zzso that differ in their tissue distribution and zzso zzso In this paper, we present the isolation of a zzso from a human zzso zzso library that encodes a zzso zzso zzso data show an open reading frame of zzso zzso that zzso for a protein of 469 zzso zzso This has a calculated molecular weight of zzso and zzso similarity with rat zzso zzso with complete conservation of the zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso localized zzso zzso gene zzso in human zzso 3 at bands zzso A Northern zzso analysis of different rat zzso showed the presence of a zzso zzso expressed specifically in zzso In zzso zzso cells, the human zzso zzso drives expression of an zzso with a molecular weight of zzso This zzso shows clear zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide evidence for a new zzso gene coding for a human zzso zzso
