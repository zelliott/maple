zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso plays a role in defense during soybean zzso Here, we show that zzso is expressed in a zzso and zzso regulated zzso The expression of zzso is distinct from that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of soybean during zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso fused to the zzso reporter zzso was expressed specifically in developing zzso but not in the zzso from the zzso stage of transgenic tobacco and zzso zzso Furthermore, light affected the zzso expression pattern in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso revealed that soybean nuclear proteins as well as zzso zzso zzso a high mobility group protein zzso were bound zzso to the zzso containing zzso motifs identified in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the soybean nuclear proteins binding to the two zzso and zzso repeat were prevalent in seeds of 2-4 zzso in zzso In contrast, the nuclear proteins binding to the zzso motif and zzso zzso expression were more prominent in seeds of 4-6 zzso in zzso zzso we propose that factors binding to the zzso or zzso repeat initiate zzso expression during zzso
