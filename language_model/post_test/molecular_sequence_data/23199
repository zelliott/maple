Relatively little is known about the importance of zzso acid interactions in protein and zzso zzso Here we examine whether zzso that are zzso in zzso zzso become fixed via zzso in other zzso zzso zzso divergence at zzso zzso acid sites is zzso However, approximately zzso of the zzso at these sites carry the exact same zzso zzso acid found in zzso zzso zzso Hence zzso zzso must have zzso Surprisingly, the fraction zzso is not affected by zzso zzso These results support a zzso process that allows compensated zzso acid zzso to become rapidly fixed in zzso with large zzso
