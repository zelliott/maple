zzso and zzso zzso were remodeled by replacement of their zzso portion with a zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso pairs derived from human zzso zzso By use of the resulting zzso one can delete a target DNA that has been inserted into the zzso site, deleting the buffer sequence at the same time, after zzso with an appropriate restriction zzso that zzso at the zzso zzso After the zzso portion of the buffer sequence is zzso off at the unique zzso site existing at its end, the zzso can be zzso for zzso sequencing from the deleted end of the target zzso Thus the remodeled zzso enable deletion of zzso by this simple zzso
