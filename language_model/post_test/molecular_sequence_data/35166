A high prevalence and diversity of avian influenza zzso viruses were detected in a population of wild zzso sampled during summer 2011 in California, providing an opportunity to compare results obtained before and after virus zzso We tested zzso zzso samples prior to culture by zzso real-time zzso and by amplifying and sequencing a zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso Each sample was also zzso into zzso chicken eggs, and full zzso sequences were determined for cultured zzso While low zzso zzso values were a good predictor of virus isolation from eggs, samples with high or zzso zzso values also yielded zzso Furthermore, a single passage in eggs altered the occurrence and detection of viral zzso and mixed infections zzso zzso zzso were detected less frequently after zzso There is no gold standard or perfect reference comparison for surveillance of unknown zzso and true zzso are difficult to distinguish from false zzso This study showed that sequencing samples prior to culture increases the detection of mixed infections and enhances the identification of viral strains and sequences that may have changed or even disappeared during zzso
