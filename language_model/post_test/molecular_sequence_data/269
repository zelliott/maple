A zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from soil of zzso Korea, and its exact zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 30 degrees C and pH zzso in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso type based on zzso with partial substitution of zzso acid by zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso The zzso type was zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as major fatty zzso Major polar lipids were zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data and differential zzso properties demonstrated that strain zzso is distinguishable from recognized zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
