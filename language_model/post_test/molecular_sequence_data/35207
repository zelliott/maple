To clone an zzso gene and investigate its cellular and zzso zzso based on previous research which has identified part of zzso sequence interacting with zzso of zzso 

zzso and Northern zzso were applied to clone the zzso gene and detect the expression of its transcripts in various human zzso and brain zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso were applied to detect expression of zzso protein in cultured zzso zzso zzso was applied to study the expression of zzso protein in various human zzso and brain zzso 

zzso cloning of zzso zzso reading frame and its sequence assembly were zzso Three transcripts (1 zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso of zzso were found to express in various human zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso expresses in zzso of cultured zzso cells and various human zzso and brain regions including cerebral cortex, zzso muscle, peripheral zzso liver and zzso 

The cloned zzso gene encodes zzso a novel zzso interacting zzso Three transcripts of zzso are expressed in various human zzso and brain zzso zzso is a zzso zzso
