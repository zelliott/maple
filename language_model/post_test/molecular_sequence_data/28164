A series of zzso that links the rat muscle zzso zzso promoter to the bacterial zzso zzso gene was zzso These zzso were introduced into zzso mouse zzso zzso cells to zzso sequences that are important for zzso of the zzso zzso gene during zzso zzso A zzso zzso element responsible for induction of zzso zzso expression during zzso was localized to a zzso region from zzso to zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso Analysis of transient expression experiments using promoters zzso by deletion indicated the presence of multiple functional zzso within this zzso regulatory zzso A DNA zzso spanning this region was used in zzso I protection zzso Nuclear extracts derived from C2 zzso protected three regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this zzso from zzso which indicated there may be three or more zzso factors that interact with the zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that factors able to bind specifically to zzso zzso and zzso are present in a wide variety of zzso and cell zzso zzso expression zzso demonstrated that elements in regions E1 and zzso but not necessarily zzso are required for full zzso zzso
