zzso edited zzso were selected by the zzso chain reaction and zzso In the case of zzso zzso 102 out of 106 clones displayed patterns of editing that were consistent with a strictly progressive 3' to zzso editing process, as predicted by the guide zzso model of zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso III zzso 177 out of 304 clones displayed strictly progressive 3' to zzso patterns of zzso However, the remaining zzso zzso clones displayed unexpected patterns in which upstream editing preceded downstream editing, zzso were inserted at sites not normally zzso and zzso zzso were zzso We suggest that many of these zzso are produced by normal 3' to zzso editing of the zzso zzso with incorrect guide zzso zzso
