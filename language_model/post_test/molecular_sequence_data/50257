zzso lens nuclear extracts contain a factor that binds to position zzso to zzso of the rat gamma zzso promoter zzso This factor protects the sequence zzso in a footprint zzso zzso to this region is crucial for zzso promoter activity in rat lens cells, but this sequence was unable to act as an zzso when cloned in front of a zzso zzso A region directly upstream from this zzso zzso between position zzso to zzso acts as a strong zzso of promoter activity in zzso zzso This zzso effect is zzso by zzso zzso Our data provide evidence for two regulatory elements in rat gamma zzso gene zzso an zzso sequence active in lens cells and a zzso sequence active only in zzso zzso The factor that binds to the zzso sequence could be detected only in lens cells and may be a zzso of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso
