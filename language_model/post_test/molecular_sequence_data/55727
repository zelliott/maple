zzso engineering studies of zzso zzso have been hindered by the lack of an efficient procedure for zzso this zzso The novel scheme presented here has led to the isolation of chicken zzso third domain zzso at a level of 22 zzso pure zzso zzso coli culture zzso The gene coding for zzso was fused to the 3' end of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was placed under control of the strong zzso and translation signals of the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso the cells harboring the target zzso efficiently zzso the protein zzso of the total soluble zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to zzso was then liberated by zzso zzso zzso zzso at a genetically engineered zzso zzso located at the zzso junction zzso lacks an internal zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso all indicated that the zzso zzso has properties identical to those of zzso isolated from its natural zzso The expression system was easily adapted for the production of zzso U zzso zzso The expression zzso was zzso for zzso of turkey zzso third domain zzso which differs from zzso by three zzso acid zzso Since many other avian zzso zzso also lack zzso zzso this approach should be suitable for large-scale production and isotope labeling of zzso zzso zzso with a variety of zzso zzso
