zzso processing depends in part on the ability of nascent transcripts to fold into the desired zzso zzso of the group I zzso from zzso was used to assess the folded state of zzso zzso transcripts when zzso in zzso A simple method for zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso reaction was zzso The zzso alone is fully active when transcribed at 30 degrees C, suggesting that the active structure is both zzso and zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso however, were less than completely active in zzso Full activity, as judged by both the initial rate and the extent of product formation, was restored by brief incubation at 95 degrees C and rapid cooling in the presence of zzso zzso This result did not depend on the length of the precursor zzso in any simple way, but correlated loosely with the presence of intact zzso zzso When transcribed in the absence of cellular zzso a significant portion of the zzso appears to be trapped in a zzso that does not readily undergo the first step of zzso
