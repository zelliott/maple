The highly variable second zzso of the red deer zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso genes were cloned and zzso Eight different expressed zzso sequences were isolated from four unrelated red zzso Either two or three different zzso sequences were isolated from each individual, demonstrating that more than one zzso gene is expressed in red zzso This is consistent with other zzso which also have multiple expressed copies of the zzso zzso The sequences ranged in similarity from zzso to zzso with an average similarity of zzso this indicates that at least one of the zzso genes is highly zzso
