A low affinity zzso for zzso immune complexes, zzso gamma zzso is expressed on human zzso cells as an integral membrane zzso anchored through a zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso the zzso is anchored through a zzso zzso zzso The protein on zzso cells has a molecular mass 6-10 zzso larger than that on zzso and, unlike the latter, is resistant to zzso zzso C zzso zzso gamma zzso transcripts isolated from zzso and zzso cells of single donors revealed multiple single zzso differences, one of which converts an in frame zzso termination zzso to a zzso zzso The resulting open reading frame encodes a longer zzso domain for zzso gamma zzso in zzso cells, contributing to its zzso zzso Two nearly zzso linked genes that zzso these transcripts have been cloned for zzso gamma zzso one of which zzso is zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso sites have been mapped to two single zzso in the zzso zzso These genes are transcribed in a cell zzso fashion to generate the alternatively anchored forms of this zzso
