In zzso zzso the cellular prion protein zzso zzso a change in zzso to become the zzso prion protein zzso which forms infectious deposits in the zzso zzso the zzso transition of zzso to zzso might be linked with zzso zzso in the zzso structure of a fraction of the zzso zzso We tested a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of human zzso for the occurrence of spontaneous chemical zzso The only zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso acid and zzso acid with a zzso of about 12 zzso The same zzso modifications were found in zzso zzso full-length zzso On aging, zzso zzso of zzso zzso per mole of protein was detected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso Mass zzso and zzso degradation of zzso fragments identified zzso in the zzso flexible part of the protein to be partially converted to zzso acid and zzso zzso A second modification was the partial zzso of zzso which is only present in zzso
