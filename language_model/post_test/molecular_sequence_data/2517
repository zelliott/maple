We isolated and zzso a zzso clone zzso the bovine zzso to zzso zzso a major cellular zzso for protein zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso base pairs predicted a protein of 335 zzso acids zzso zzso Despite this predicted size, the protein migrated on zzso gels with an apparent molecular weight of zzso after expression of the zzso in cells lacking the zzso It was highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso zzso consensus zzso and included a zzso basic domain containing the known protein zzso C zzso zzso Two zzso species zzso and zzso zzso were most highly expressed in brain, spinal cord, zzso and zzso in parallel with the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the likelihood of a single gene coding for this zzso We propose the name zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso for this zzso
