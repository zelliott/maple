The zzso face of the zzso zzso zzso is made up of one zzso terminal and three zzso zzso connecting six of the seven zzso zzso Neither the zzso three-dimensional structure of this zzso zzso nor any other cell surface zzso is zzso In this work, the structures of peptides containing the zzso acid sequence of the first and second zzso zzso of zzso have been zzso Both zzso show ordered structures in zzso In both zzso the ends of the zzso zzso unwind and form a zzso The zzso of the two zzso are remarkably similar, even though their sequences are zzso These data suggest a structural motif for short zzso in zzso zzso The zzso structures of these zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso indicate that the primary sequences of these zzso stabilize the zzso These data further suggest that the zzso may contribute to the folding of such membrane proteins during their synthesis and zzso into zzso
