By use of zzso specific for human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a typing system for zzso zzso zzso in several zzso species has been zzso The amplified zzso locus is zzso to the human zzso gene zzso Like the human counterpart, the zzso zzso element contains a zzso zzso simple zzso repeat zzso zzso length zzso of this simple repeat sequence in some zzso should allow efficient association studies in a multiplex approach, especially including zzso class II zzso On the protein level the zzso regions display little zzso in the zzso comparison among zzso The zzso acid zzso are not concentrated in the putative zzso determining regions, suggesting evolutionary zzso In addition, the simple repetitive element has been preserved in the same zzso location for more than 7 zzso zzso zzso Similar evolutionary persistence has already been demonstrated for a zzso repeat stretch in the second zzso of the zzso zzso The reasons for these parallel developments in evolution are so far not clear, but they may point to a biological meaning if not function of the zzso simple repeat zzso
