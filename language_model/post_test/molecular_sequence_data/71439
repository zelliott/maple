zzso zzso zzso zzso a wide range of zzso zzso While some species are limited to a single host group, such as zzso zzso which zzso zzso other species of this zzso such as zzso zzso zzso a wide range of zzso species from mice to zzso During an investigation of zzso infection in cattle on a farm in northern Poland, we identified an infection caused by zzso zzso in addition to known infections with zzso zzso and zzso zzso This new infection was identified based on the size of the zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso as well as by analysis of the molecular sequence of the variable region of the zzso zzso This finding demonstrates the complex host specificity and circulation in the environment of zzso zzso
