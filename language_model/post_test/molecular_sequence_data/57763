zzso is a molecular zzso involved in protein export from zzso zzso It is a highly zzso charged, zzso zzso protein with a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso It has two zzso it maintains precursors of some exported proteins in a zzso compatible with export, by preventing them from zzso or from folding into their zzso stable state in the zzso and it delivers both nascent and completed precursors to zzso one of the components of the export apparatus that are on and in the plasma zzso zzso recognizes completed precursors of soluble zzso not by direct interaction with leader sequences but by virtue of the property, imposed by their leader zzso that they fold zzso zzso there is a kinetic zzso between folding and interaction with zzso Only those zzso that fold slowly interact significantly with this molecular zzso even though it is able to bind a wide variety of non-native zzso zzso studies with zzso peptides indicate that each zzso zzso has a binding site that can interact with flexible peptides having a net positive charge and a length of about ten zzso which may depend on the charge zzso zzso of the zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso indicates that simultaneous interaction of multiple peptides causes a zzso change that exposes a zzso site on zzso This zzso region is thought to contribute an extra binding site for zzso zzso of zzso A model of zzso binding to zzso precursors is zzso
