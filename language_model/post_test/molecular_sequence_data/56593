The zzso protein from zzso zzso is a DNA zzso which zzso in the repair of zzso DNA and is inhibited in the presence of DNA containing zzso zzso This protein is also involved in zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso and is essential for cell viability in the absence of DNA zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein also exhibits a zzso zzso activity in which there is a significant preference for a partial zzso hybrid rather than a partial duplex DNA zzso which suggests that this protein might be involved in DNA repair within zzso active zzso Finally, the zzso protein contains the zzso motif and shares high zzso acid sequence similarity with the DEAD family of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it might also possess an zzso zzso zzso
