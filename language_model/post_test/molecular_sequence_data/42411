The zzso of distinct zzso committed to the production of zzso with different zzso activities supports the view of a zzso and specialization of function in the B cell repertoire and is consistent with the hypothesis of a zzso layered immune system; as originally proposed by zzso and zzso On the basis of the data by zzso and zzso in the human fetus and our data in the adult, and in agreement with the findings of zzso et zzso and Hardy et zzso in the zzso we propose that the human B cell repertoire includes at least three distinct B cell zzso zzso cells, which develop from zzso in the fetal zzso district, namely the zzso and are maintained in adult life by virtue of their zzso nature; zzso cells, zzso of which can be found in the zzso district and, perhaps, adult bone zzso and, finally, B-2 cells, which arise in the fetal liver and are continuously replenished in adult life by zzso in the bone zzso zzso zzso The different B cells types are distinguished by their differential expression of surface zzso and, perhaps, zzso and zzso their differential expression of zzso zzso and the different classes and zzso of the zzso they produce zzso zzso zzso zzso play a major role in zzso and constitute the zzso equivalent of the zzso forms in various zzso disorders, such as zzso and zzso which are often associated with the production of zzso zzso to self zzso Human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are responsible for the production of natural zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and adult, and can give rise to the zzso cells characteristic of several zzso disease zzso Our recent findings suggest that while in healthy subjects the majority of natural zzso zzso is zzso in V genes in zzso zzso some zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso V zzso in a fashion consistent with an zzso process of selection of such zzso The nature of the zzso involved in these selection processes remains to be zzso Under possibly different circumstances, the application of an zzso process of zzso selection to zzso and/or zzso cells, previously committed to natural zzso production, can result in the generation of zzso high affinity and possibly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
