Plant zzso zzso factors play an important role in response to zzso and zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso factor was isolated from zzso This zzso factor showed zzso and zzso identity at the DNA and zzso acid sequence levels, respectively, with zzso zzso zzso and was therefore designated zzso zzso analysis and structure comparison indicated that zzso protein belongs to group zzso The zzso protein was shown to be located in the nucleus based on green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso analysis further indicated that zzso protein binds specifically to the zzso zzso The expression profile of zzso in response to treatment with zzso salicylic acid or pathogen zzso zzso is rapid and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher tolerance to water stress induced by zzso than zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrated that the zzso gene is involved in the response to zzso zzso In addition, the role of zzso protein in regulating the expression of two stress response zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso
