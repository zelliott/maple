We have cloned an zzso zzso gene and a zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a portion of the zzso zzso zzso I gene as a probe, and determined their zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was 435 zzso acids in length and the coding region was interrupted by an zzso The zzso lacks a hinge region and a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was identical to the zzso zzso zzso previously reported, with the exception of three zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso show zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso box and zzso zzso putative zzso binding sites were observed in the zzso upstream regions of both zzso The cloned zzso genes were expressed in zzso zzso and the gene products were zzso The optimal temperatures of zzso and zzso were 60 degrees C and zzso degrees C, zzso The optimal zzso of these zzso were zzso zzso and zzso had distinct zzso zzso zzso showed high activity toward zzso whereas zzso showed high activity toward zzso cellulose zzso
