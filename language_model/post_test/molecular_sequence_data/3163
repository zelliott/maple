zzso recruitment zzso zzso are zzso interaction zzso found extensively in proteins that play important roles in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study we identified a novel human zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso domain with high similarity to the zzso domain of zzso We demonstrate that zzso interacts physically with zzso and zzso regulates zzso zzso generation in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso binds also to zzso and zzso two other recently identified zzso which bind to the zzso domain of zzso and zzso regulate its zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed mainly in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This pattern of expression is consistent with zzso expression in the same cells and zzso zzso was also found to zzso regulate zzso zzso by zzso stimulation and by zzso expressed zzso suggesting that this protein may control cell zzso zzso with these results, stable expression of zzso in zzso or zzso cells zzso the cells to zzso zzso zzso of zzso can also induce zzso in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso represents a new signaling zzso involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
