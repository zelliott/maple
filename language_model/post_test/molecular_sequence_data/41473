zzso zzso between the zzso domain and the cap domain of the zzso zzso fold zzso show remarkable diversity in zzso zzso and zzso Recent investigations have suggested that the zzso might be involved in zzso and zzso recognition in many zzso from the zzso zzso fold zzso To foster a deep understanding of its role in zzso stability, and divergent evolution, we here zzso investigated the function of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso by loop zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that the upper part of the zzso zzso zzso was of great importance to zzso zzso Single zzso in this region could fine-tune the activity of zzso as much as zzso and any deletions from this region rendered the zzso completely zzso The lower part of the zzso zzso zzso was capable of enduring extensive deletions without loss of zzso The shortened zzso in this region were found to show both improved activity and increased stability zzso We therefore speculated that the zzso especially the lower part, would be a perfect target for zzso engineering to zzso the zzso properties, and might present a hot zone for the divergent evolution of zzso zzso Our findings may provide an opportunity for better understanding of the mechanism of divergent evolution in the zzso zzso fold zzso and may also guide the design of novel zzso for industrial zzso
