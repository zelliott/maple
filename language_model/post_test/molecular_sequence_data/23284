zzso gene function frequently zzso investigations of the zzso roles of zzso zzso This is the case for zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso function of zzso zzso zzso thereby regulating zzso zzso by zzso zzso mice, however, exhibit no evident zzso zzso to the redundant function of three other zzso zzso Here we show that in the zzso zzso zzso only one zzso of the zzso gene exists, which gives rise to two alternatively spliced zzso zzso and zzso differing at their zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is essential for embryonic zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso is specifically required for proper zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This latter zzso could be precisely correlated with a previously unknown zzso zzso activity, which is present in the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed not only the zzso of distinct zzso zzso but also the definition of a novel function for this zzso in zzso zzso
