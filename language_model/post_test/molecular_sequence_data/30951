The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express an zzso zzso activity which is abolished after differentiation of these zzso We have examined the ability of the zzso zzso gene products to zzso the viral early zzso zzso promoter in this cell zzso Surprisingly, as shown both by infection and zzso experiments, the zzso promoter was zzso to viral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso being recovered only after differentiation of these zzso This zzso restriction did not zzso to a lack of zzso gene zzso nor to a zzso of any of the major zzso factors involved in zzso zzso promoter zzso In these differentiated zzso cells, zzso promoter zzso zzso with a modification of zzso resulting in its ability to zzso interact with the zzso Our observation that such a modification neither occurs in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso et zzso 1989, zzso zzso 8, zzso nor at early times after infection of these cells suggests that a viral product is required together with the zzso activity to induce this modification of zzso The implication of an zzso gene product in this effect is zzso
