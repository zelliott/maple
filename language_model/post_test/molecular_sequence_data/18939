zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso is a unique but less characterized member of the family of protein zzso zzso zzso that plays a role in male zzso gene zzso zzso is the only known zzso member that zzso the zzso but not the zzso of the target zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso in zzso zzso genes from five different species were cloned and expressed in zzso coli and zzso insect zzso Four gave soluble proteins from zzso cells, of which two were homogeneous and one gave zzso The mouse zzso structure was solved by the single anomalous zzso method using a crystal soaked with zzso that zzso to beyond zzso zzso The crystal belonged to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso and one zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The structure of another crystal form belonging to space group zzso was solved by molecular zzso
