Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a prairie soil in Minnesota and subjected to characterization by means of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences were determined following zzso amplification and zzso A zzso analysis, based on comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene zzso indicated that the organisms consistently formed a zzso distinct zzso within the radiation of the zzso zzso of the family zzso The levels of zzso zzso sequence similarity between the zzso and the type strains of recognized zzso species ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The highest levels of sequence similarity were found between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics supported the zzso relationships between the organisms and members of the zzso zzso However, a broad range of zzso and genetic data revealed that the zzso should be classified as novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
