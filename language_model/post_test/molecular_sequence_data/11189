zzso zzso is a member of the segment polarity gene family in zzso which plays an important role in the early zzso patterning zzso A human zzso of zzso zzso has recently been zzso Here, we report the cloning of a second human zzso of zzso (called zzso by zzso library zzso The human zzso gene encodes a predicted zzso zzso acid protein which exhibits zzso zzso acid identity with mouse zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected in 30 human cell lines and 2 primary cell zzso zzso zzso was detected in normal human breast zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there was no difference in zzso zzso level between normal breast zzso and zzso In human zzso samples, zzso was expressed equally in matched normal zzso zzso and zzso The data indicates that zzso is widely expressed in human cells and supports the notion of a new zzso gene family for zzso which may have a widespread role in signal zzso
