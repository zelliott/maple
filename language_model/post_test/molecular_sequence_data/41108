This work aims to improve the zzso stability of alkaline zzso from zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso Based on an analysis of the zzso structure, five zzso zzso zzso Met zzso Met zzso Met zzso and Met zzso were selected as the zzso sites and individually replaced with zzso In the presence of 500 zzso zzso at zzso for 5 zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso retained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the original activity, zzso zzso the alkaline stability, zzso stability, and zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso were also zzso The pH stability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso remained unchanged compared to that of the zzso zzso while the stable pH range of the zzso zzso was extended from pH zzso to zzso for the wild type to pH zzso to zzso for the zzso The zzso zzso lost its activity after incubation at zzso for 2 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso retained less than zzso of the activity, whereas the zzso zzso retained zzso of the activity under the same zzso Compared to the zzso zzso the zzso values of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while that of the zzso zzso increased slightly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism responsible for the increased zzso stability, alkaline stability, zzso stability, and zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso was further analyzed with a structure zzso The zzso zzso were also constructed, and their zzso properties were zzso The resistance of the zzso zzso and the zzso to zzso and zzso was also zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso has great potential in the zzso and textile zzso
