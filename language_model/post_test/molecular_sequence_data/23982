In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso and zzso zzso They resemble zzso a zzso zzso protein that is critical for zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of the first unique zzso indicated that zzso zzso increased as early as 6 h after P deprivation zzso whereas nitrogen deprivation zzso had no zzso The zzso zzso level increased exclusively under zzso an increase first noted by 2 days in zzso In spite of zzso and zzso effects on expression of zzso and zzso there appeared to be zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Total zzso acid zzso activity increased under both zzso and -N within 2 days of zzso Further, the zzso zzso reported to be a zzso zzso showed no increase in zzso zzso in response to zzso and a zzso reduction in the response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso with this pattern, there was no increase in acid zzso activity in zzso plants deprived of P or zzso However, when deprived of zzso zzso plants accumulated much higher levels of zzso zzso disruption of zzso resulted in altered expression of at least one nitrate zzso zzso Further evidence of zzso between N and P responses was altered expression of zzso genes in zzso
