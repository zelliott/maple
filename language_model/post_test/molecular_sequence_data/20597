A zzso zzso zzso functions at the zzso between zzso zzso and the attachment of zzso to protein zzso During this process, the zzso interacts with both a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Although a major goal when investigating an zzso is to identify its zzso recent evidence indicates that the zzso dictates the type of zzso modification that will occur on the zzso There are approximately 30 zzso identified in the human zzso many of which remain to be zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso can interact with 10 different zzso The ability of zzso to interact with multiple zzso is likely to be a common feature among other zzso and zzso zzso We and others have also found that certain zzso show a preference for attaching either the first zzso to a zzso zzso or zzso to itself zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in dictating product zzso zzso when investigating the functions of an zzso it is zzso to identify all zzso that interact with the zzso so that these can be used in zzso zzso zzso We describe a method used to identify all the zzso that interact with zzso Defining the set of zzso that interact with other zzso and zzso zzso will open the door for zzso models and lead to a better understand of zzso zzso
