zzso zzso sequencing has been performed on zzso amplified transcripts from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso from 30 patients with acute intermittent zzso were the source of zzso of the seven separate point zzso zzso three were silent, whereas four resulted in zzso acid zzso Three of these changes involved highly zzso zzso zzso and the remaining one a zzso zzso One of these zzso was predicted to cause structural zzso in the protein zzso The application of this method to affected families allows the direct identification of these zzso zzso thus permitting the unequivocal detection of zzso
