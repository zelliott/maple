zzso is a widely used zzso drug whose zzso mechanism is incompletely zzso We have used zzso zzso as a model system to understand zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso form fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene that zzso zzso sensitivity on zzso is necessary zzso for a functional zzso zzso and for the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso encodes two alternatively spliced channel zzso that share zzso binding and zzso zzso and are members of the family of zzso zzso channel zzso An zzso zzso forms a zzso channel that is zzso and zzso These results indicate that: zzso an zzso zzso channel mediates fast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso property of zzso derives from its activity as an zzso of zzso zzso channels in essential excitable cells such as those of the zzso
