The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso b and zzso of the zzso complex were extended with a segment to zzso a zzso tag linked to their zzso sequence allowing a zzso affinity zzso of the zzso zzso were made in zzso in a zzso background using zzso zzso The modified zzso zzso were transferred to a zzso zzso zzso and this was used to transform the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed normal rates of zzso zzso prepared from these cells showed zzso of turnover of the zzso complex on flash zzso which were essentially the same as those from zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso complement and spectral and zzso properties by zzso zzso showed no marked difference from the wild zzso zzso were zzso and mixed with zzso zzso A modification of the standard zzso protocol in which zzso replaced zzso increased the activity zzso zzso modified the zzso properties of zzso zzso suggesting zzso displacement and zzso when this zzso is used at high zzso The zzso zzso contained all four zzso in an active zzso zzso This construction provides a facile method for preparation of zzso or zzso zzso complex, for zzso and structural zzso
