zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder zzso by insulin deficient diabetes zzso and zzso zzso in a novel zzso zzso were found in nearly all patients and zzso with the zzso The zzso gene is expressed in all tissue types studied and the zzso protein product is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a combination of reporter zzso and in zzso and in zzso zzso factor binding zzso to zzso the regulation of expression of the human zzso gene in zzso derived zzso A single zzso start site was mapped and a minimal promoter identified within 25 zzso upstream of this zzso This minimal promoter contains two DNA binding motifs zzso zzso for the zzso factors zzso and binding of both zzso and zzso was demonstrated at both motifs in zzso and in zzso The presence of intact zzso boxes is essential for minimal promoter zzso Thus, zzso factors of the zzso family are important regulators of the zzso zzso A further zzso control region was identified containing three zzso box binding zzso all demonstrated a reduction in expression after zzso One zzso box represented part of a predicted zzso stress response zzso
