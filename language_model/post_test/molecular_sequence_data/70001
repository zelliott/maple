The sites and the sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso human and rat zzso during the limited zzso with zzso and zzso were determined by sequencing the zzso zzso of the peptides produced and comparing them to the zzso sequences of zzso human and rat zzso Major zzso sites of bovine zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso sites of human zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1831 with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso Those of rat zzso included zzso zzso 1776, zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as in bovine zzso Thus, zzso from various species presents well localized and zzso regions particularly sensitive to zzso The most sensitive region extended for 30 zzso after zzso zzso Another major cluster of zzso was centered around zzso zzso this region was only partially sensitive in human zzso A zzso zzso site lay at the zzso zzso of the zzso Most zzso sites occurred within the inserted sequences that disrupt the zzso tandem repeats of zzso and either contain or are located near zzso zzso Several zzso sites lay in proximity of early zzso or zzso zzso zzso or of putative zzso zzso zzso While a predominantly zzso secondary structure and a rigid three-dimensional structure were predicted for the zzso repeats, stretches of predicted zzso zzso and irregular structure were zzso in the regions surrounding the zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of zzso regions of zzso inherently sensitive to zzso which most likely represent zzso regions of the primary structure, possibly forming zzso at the surface of zzso
