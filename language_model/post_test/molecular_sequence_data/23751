Our goal was to develop mimics of zzso highly zzso to induce an efficient immune response against the zzso form of zzso and sufficiently different from the natural zzso to bypass the tolerance barrier in zzso With the aim of obtaining a zzso zzso construct as a means of evoking the precise immune responses required in zzso we zzso artificial mimics of the zzso protein composed of two zzso repeat units of inverse orientation and a universal zzso zzso To zzso these zzso zzso zzso we followed a zzso approach using zzso zzso based on zzso zzso A stem zzso was first zzso bearing two zzso masked zzso After successive zzso two zzso bonds can be specifically zzso The proposed strategy proved to be concise and zzso and allowed the synthesis of the zzso protein in a very satisfactory zzso The different zzso were tested for their ability to generate zzso able to recognize the zzso zzso
