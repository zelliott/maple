The normal pattern of zzso expression in zzso is altered in zzso as well as in zzso diseases such as psoriasis and wound zzso Under these circumstances, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Very little is known regarding zzso regulators involved in this zzso To investigate the nuclear factors that participate in regulation of expression of the zzso zzso we have characterized the binding sites for nuclear proteins on the promoter DNA of the zzso gene by gel zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso We found four nuclear protein binding sites in the zzso gene zzso Two are near the zzso box, but their ability to bind zzso or zzso nuclear extracts is independent of the zzso zzso protein zzso The third binding site is a large zzso The sequences of these three sites do not zzso to any described target sequences for characterized zzso zzso The fourth is an zzso site, the target sequence for the zzso zzso and zzso All four sites are independent of the previously characterized zzso growth zzso element, zzso These findings suggest that there may be two parallel pathways of induction of zzso zzso One proceeds through the zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso zzso the other, through the zzso site and the zzso zzso may be related to induction in zzso zzso
