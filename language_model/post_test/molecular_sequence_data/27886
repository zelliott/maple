The zzso zzso immune complexes were isolated from plasma of systemic lupus zzso zzso patients and DNA fragments separated from immune complexes were subjected to molecular zzso The resulting zzso DNA clones showed a molecular size of zzso base pairs, a high zzso and zzso content, high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also clusters of G + zzso and A + zzso zzso These clones zzso randomly to total human zzso The zzso of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso from zzso was examined with a cloned zzso zzso zzso A competitive zzso zzso showed that human zzso zzso had at least one magnitude higher affinity to the cloned DNA than to the native DNA zzso In order to characterize the factors that were recognized by zzso human G + zzso and also A + zzso 100 zzso DNA fragments were zzso and their base sequences zzso The zzso showed a higher affinity to the G + zzso DNA zzso zzso G + zzso than to the A + zzso DNA zzso zzso G + zzso When zzso in zzso zzso in G + zzso fragments were zzso zzso the zzso increased up to zzso The native zzso zzso from zzso patients also showed preferential binding to G + zzso zzso These observations suggested that human zzso zzso may recognize some unique structures around the G + C regions or G + C clusters of zzso
