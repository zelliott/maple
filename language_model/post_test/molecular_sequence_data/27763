The zzso sequences of two zzso expressed zzso genes from the sea star zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso is expressed in eggs and early zzso The muscle zzso gene zzso is expressed in tube feet and zzso Both genes contain an zzso coding region interrupted by three zzso at zzso 41, 121 and zzso Gene M contains two additional zzso at zzso 150 and zzso The zzso position at zzso zzso although present in higher zzso zzso has not been reported in zzso genes from zzso The M gene coding region has zzso zzso zzso to the Cy zzso and differs from the Cy zzso gene in 13 of 375 zzso acids zzso 11 of which are found in the zzso half of the zzso The zzso half of the M gene contains a significant number of muscle zzso zzso Even though there is only 1 zzso change in the first 150 zzso there have been limited zzso at many zzso zzso sites which may indicate selection pressure upon the secondary structure of the zzso and/or a biased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals have been identified in the zzso and 3' zzso zzso The presence of zzso and 3' zzso junction sequences in the zzso zzso region of the Cy gene suggests the potential for an zzso zzso
