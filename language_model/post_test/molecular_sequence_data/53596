The folding and assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the association of two structurally distinct zzso per zzso A prominent and zzso zzso interaction in class alpha zzso is formed by the packing of the zzso side chain of zzso from domain I into a zzso pocket in domain zzso zzso studies have shown that partial zzso of the zzso near zzso occurs as an initial fast event during the unfolding zzso of human zzso zzso et zzso zzso 37 zzso zzso Wallace et zzso zzso zzso 336 zzso zzso The contribution of zzso toward zzso the zzso interface was investigated by mutating it to either a zzso zzso or zzso zzso and determining the functionality zzso and zzso zzso zzso and stability zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The replacement of zzso did not impact on the zzso gross structural zzso zzso the zzso was zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso the native state with zzso exerting the greatest zzso zzso zzso as well as the protein concentration dependence of the zzso unfolding transitions for zzso zzso suggest the presence of a zzso intermediate at equilibrium that is not observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso monitored by zzso zzso zzso was zzso and corresponded to the global unfolding of the protein during which the zzso intermediate unfolds to two unfolded zzso The similar unfolding zzso data for zzso and zzso zzso indicates that the global unfolding event was not affected by zzso acid zzso We propose that the packing interactions at the zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the zzso domain zzso II interface of class alpha zzso
