zzso is a zzso factor that belongs to the zzso family of DNA binding zzso In this study, we show by Far Western zzso analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with zzso Using zzso zzso protein as a probe, we screened a B cell zzso expression library and isolated a number of clones zzso zzso interacting zzso Three of these clones zzso DNA binding proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso one clone encodes a zzso zzso and another clone encodes a zzso zzso We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor implicated in inflammatory zzso We found that deletion of the zzso 28 zzso acids of zzso disrupted zzso beta physical zzso This deletion zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso beta zzso zzso domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two zzso In transient expression zzso we found that zzso and zzso beta can functionally cooperate to zzso activate zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso and zzso beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the zzso or affinity of each other's DNA zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is due to each protein independently influencing the zzso zzso zzso
