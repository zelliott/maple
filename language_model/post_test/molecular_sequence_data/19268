zzso of plant DNA in feces provides a promising, yet largely zzso means of documenting the diets of elusive zzso Here we demonstrate the promise and pitfalls of this approach using DNA extracted from zzso samples of wild western gorillas zzso zzso and black and white zzso monkeys zzso zzso From these DNA extracts we zzso zzso and zzso small segments of zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso and plant nuclear DNA zzso The obtained sequences were compared to sequences generated from known plant samples and to those in zzso to identify plant zzso in the zzso With further zzso this method could provide a basic evaluation of minimum zzso dietary diversity even when knowledge of local zzso is zzso This approach may find application in studies characterizing the diets of zzso zzso zzso species or zzso zzso relationships in an zzso
