A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or yellow, zzso and zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from the zzso Channel and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could grow in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso at zzso zzso and at pH 6-9, and grew zzso at 28 zzso pH 8, in natural seawater zzso The respiratory zzso were zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0 zzso zzso : 1 G, summed feature 3 zzso : zzso : zzso zzso : 0 zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences of members of the family zzso showed that strain zzso formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the stable cluster containing type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso marina zzso zzso % zzso In addition to the large zzso zzso gene sequence differences, zzso can also be distinguished from the reference type strains zzso marina zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by several zzso characteristics and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso is suggested to represent a novel species of a new zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
