The zzso M zzso heavy chain constant region genes of Russian sturgeon zzso zzso zzso sturgeon zzso zzso zzso sturgeon zzso zzso Chinese sturgeon zzso zzso and Great sturgeon zzso zzso were cloned and analyzed with molecular biology and zzso zzso We cloned zzso zzso acid sequences by zzso using the specific zzso then determined the characteristics and functions of the zzso acid zzso The gene contains four constant region zzso zzso zzso of which zzso zzso were the most zzso in zzso heavy chain constant region domain and had the highest identity within all the experimental zzso According to the analysis of the zzso tree, the variation expectation value zzso and species differentiation time zzso in the zzso zzso we found that Chinese sturgeon and the other five sturgeon form one whole zzso of the tree, while, among the five left, zzso sturgeon and zzso sturgeon, Russian sturgeon and zzso sturgeon zzso from zzso zzso itself forms three other zzso This result can clearly explain the relations of zzso status, geographical distribution and evolution among the species zzso
