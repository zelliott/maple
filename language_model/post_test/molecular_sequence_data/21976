zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso of zzso is zzso expressed in large zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species derived from zzso are suggested to serve a role in host zzso We report that zzso zzso a crucial zzso of the zzso zzso also stimulates expression of zzso zzso and protein in large zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to fourfold zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of small interfering zzso zzso completely blocked this zzso We cloned the region from zzso to zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso To reveal zzso zzso zzso we performed transient expression zzso using a reporter gene driven by serially truncated zzso promoters in zzso zzso zzso elements were located between zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso sequence zzso element present at zzso to zzso zzso exhibited this zzso promoter zzso zzso caused zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso and produced a zzso complex that was recognized by zzso zzso The introduction of zzso zzso of zzso which did not interact with zzso completely canceled the zzso promoter activity of the region from zzso to zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso zzso 2 inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity of the zzso to zzso zzso region, zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, also suggesting a crucial role of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our results support a potential contribution of zzso to zzso host defense and inflammation in the zzso
