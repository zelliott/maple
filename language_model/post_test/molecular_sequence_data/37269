zzso disease zzso is a common zzso disorder characterized by zzso of the zzso The seemingly unrelated multiple zzso zzso type 2 zzso 2) is an zzso dominant disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Yet, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are associated with both zzso 2 and zzso In the former, zzso zzso in a limited set of zzso is found, zzso in the latter, zzso zzso are zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is associated with only zzso of a zzso series of isolated zzso and little is known about zzso to sporadic zzso We have found previously that specific zzso zzso zzso coding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso were strongly associated with zzso whereas zzso associated with zzso 14 zzso zzso were associated with zzso In this study, we describe three novel zzso 1 zzso and, together with the coding zzso zzso the data suggest the presence of distinct ancestral zzso for zzso and sporadic zzso in linkage zzso with a putative founding zzso zzso The data are consistent with the presence of a very zzso zzso founder locus approximately zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso but the failure of the zzso to span the locus presents challenges in modeling mode of transmission or zzso We zzso that this founding locus is germane to both isolated zzso and zzso but also that different zzso in this locus would zzso to one or the zzso
