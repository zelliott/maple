zzso of the zzso protein with zzso DNA zzso was analyzed by challenge with the zzso zzso which can cleave the DNA zzso We found that zzso protein zzso zzso by the radical at a defined distance from the zzso zzso The zzso was at the 11th zzso in many zzso zzso may be intermittent since a second zzso was induced at the 22nd or 21st zzso This specific zzso was observed under optimal conditions for filament formation, zzso pairing and strand zzso zzso in zzso was, however, decreased by replacement of zzso by zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso replacement of zzso protein by a zzso zzso zzso or an increase in zzso zzso We propose that zzso protein zzso a special structural zzso such as bending, perhaps zzso on zzso and that this altered site plays an important role in zzso pairing and strand zzso
