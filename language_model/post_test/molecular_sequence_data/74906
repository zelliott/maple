A zzso containing the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was isolated from a zzso zzso DNA library using the zzso probe zzso The gene and the surrounding regions were cloned into zzso zzso 130 and zzso zzso 131 zzso zzso A zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso is zzso The zzso sequence predicts that zzso 4 is probably derived from a precursor protein with a zzso and basic zzso leader zzso zzso zzso 4 contains 209 zzso acid zzso and the predicted molecular mass is zzso zzso This zzso presents zzso zzso with two distinct zzso A high zzso content of zzso was predicted from the zzso zzso 4 shows zzso with the b zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso
