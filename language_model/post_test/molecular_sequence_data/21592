We identified 2 novel genes zzso different zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso in zzso zzso which invades the human zzso zzso The zzso gene expression was temporally increased along with the zzso development and its protein product was detected in almost all parts of adult worms including zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was temporally maintained at a zzso level and largely restricted within interior parts of various zzso The zzso forms of zzso proteins exhibited reducing activity against various zzso in the presence of either zzso or zzso zzso as a reducing zzso although they preferred zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso A zzso kinetic study demonstrated that the zzso proteins followed a zzso zzso equation with the zzso efficiencies zzso ranging from 103 to 104 zzso zzso somewhat lower than those for other zzso studied zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns and zzso zzso specific to zzso and zzso might suggest different zzso functions of the zzso zzso in protecting the worms against zzso zzso
