zzso of several synthetic zzso peptides by zzso isolated zzso zzso II zzso and by cellular and nuclear extracts containing zzso activity has been zzso Especially the synthetic zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II was found to serve as an excellent zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso reduces the rate of zzso zzso zzso stimulation of DNA zzso induced by the proteins in the zzso Since the zzso itself is also significantly zzso in such zzso it is supposed that it serves as a competitive zzso for the zzso of proteins in the extracts whose zzso seems to be a prerequisite for their activity in the zzso zzso This points to the involvement of zzso and zzso of zzso in the process of zzso
