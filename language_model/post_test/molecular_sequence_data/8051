We have isolated a gene from a library of nuclear DNA for a zzso zzso protein (named zzso for zzso zzso by zzso with Cab for zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence with other zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein sequences shows that structural and functional features, zzso the arrangement zzso zzso of the two A and B zzso zzso and the putative zzso zzso sites, are shared by both zzso and zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso a very strong identity is found among zzso in the C zzso suggesting a major function associated to this specific zzso Nevertheless, the primary structure of the zzso does not seem affected by the zzso composition in zzso As in the few other examples currently known, we confirm that the zzso genes are zzso and are part of a zzso zzso Northern zzso performed on zzso zzso from zzso zzso give evidence that the zzso gene is zzso at a zzso level and that no expression can be observed in the zzso
