In the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex regulatory circuits control nitrogen metabolism and sulfur zzso The expression of entire sets of zzso structural genes that zzso zzso zzso is zzso when favored sulfur or nitrogen sources are zzso These structural genes are zzso by global zzso regulatory proteins and often are also controlled by zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso The recent isolation of regulatory genes and representative structural genes of these circuits has provided significant new insight into the operation of both the nitrogen and the sulfur regulatory zzso which involve zzso DNA binding zzso promoter control zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
