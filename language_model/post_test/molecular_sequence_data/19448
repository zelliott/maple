zzso zzso zzso is a zzso agent of invasive disease, such as meningitis and zzso Several interactions exist between zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso has been reported to bind zzso in a zzso manner, but the responsible protein has not yet been zzso To define the binding site on zzso for zzso zzso full-length zzso and four zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequences and zzso specificity for zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso to a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso b zzso and zzso strains were investigated using a whole cell zzso and flow zzso zzso binding was detected in 50% of the zzso zzso strains zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso did not interact with zzso Finally, mapping experiments using the zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso were involved in the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Thus, by using zzso zzso and zzso with defined zzso zzso we have confirmed that zzso specifically binds zzso and that this binding involves the zzso zzso zzso
