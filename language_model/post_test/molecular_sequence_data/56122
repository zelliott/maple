A panel of zzso synthetic peptides was zzso to map the zzso zzso of zzso zzso type b outer membrane protein zzso recognized by three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to recognize distinct zzso localized within zzso 60 to 88, 165 to zzso and 400 to zzso of mature zzso zzso Since zzso zzso was shown previously to be protective against certain zzso zzso type b zzso in the infant rat model of zzso its zzso zzso was further characterized by using truncated zzso zzso Fine mapping of the zzso zzso by competitive zzso studies revealed that it was localized within zzso 184 and zzso
