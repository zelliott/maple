To examine the regulation of nerve growth factor zzso gene expression with respect to neural zzso we examined the effects of T zzso zzso on zzso zzso in cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the amount of zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso had no significant zzso zzso and zzso produced marked increases in zzso zzso levels in zzso as demonstrated by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso was greater in zzso zzso than in growing zzso Neither increase in zzso incorporation nor any zzso change was observed during the treatment with zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso and zzso on zzso synthesis was completely inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso specifically trigger a cascade of events to regulate zzso synthesis in zzso independent of cell zzso
