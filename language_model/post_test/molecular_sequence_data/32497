Type 2 diabetes, a major risk factor for zzso is associated with a cluster of zzso risk factors, many of which can be mechanistically linked with underlying zzso fatty acid metabolism and elevated plasma zzso fatty acids zzso Thus, we tested the hypothesis that elevated zzso zzso zzso metabolism at the levels of zzso synthesis and gene expression in zzso zzso derived zzso zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso inclusions that are positive for oil red O and zzso Parallel studies with zzso show zzso zzso of zzso zzso neutral zzso almost exclusively as zzso the rate of zzso zzso increases as zzso zzso convert to foam zzso zzso of zzso zzso with higher zzso of zzso zzso versus zzso was associated with enhanced zzso of zzso and increased expression of zzso fatty acid binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass and activity also zzso These observations suggest a zzso link between sustained zzso in zzso zzso and foam cell formation that may be zzso by enhanced zzso increased zzso of modified LDL, and zzso formation of zzso which may be zzso
