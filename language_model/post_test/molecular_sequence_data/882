To investigate the association between a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in intro 3 of the zzso gene and the risk for Parkinson's disease zzso in Chinese, particularly the relation between this zzso and the age of onset of zzso zzso 

zzso was diagnosed according to the criteria of Core Assessment Program for zzso zzso All patients and controls were examined by two zzso and were of the Han ethnic zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and sequencing were used to determine the zzso of each zzso 

A total of 312 zzso patients (including 99 zzso zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 236 controls were zzso The zzso zzso was not found in this zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of the C zzso and zzso zzso were higher in total zzso group but were not statistically different from those of the control group zzso and zzso zzso After being zzso by age of zzso the frequency of zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso group with an onset age at or below 45 years old zzso compared with that in the control group zzso Similarly, C zzso was much higher zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group zzso than that in the control group zzso The linear trend analysis showed that both the zzso zzso and C zzso increased significantly in the zzso group with the increase of the onset age zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, there was no difference in the zzso of zzso and zzso between the zzso zzso patients and zzso 

The above results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a genetic risk factor for zzso zzso in zzso
