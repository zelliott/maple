The effect of introducing zzso acid zzso in an zzso was examined both at the zzso and zzso zzso A series of zzso of the model zzso of sequence zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso Four zzso contained a single change of an zzso by the corresponding zzso one zzso contained two zzso and another one contained only zzso zzso A zzso analogue was also zzso in which the 2 zzso zzso were replaced by zzso zzso The parent zzso and zzso zzso were injected into mice after zzso zzso to small zzso zzso containing zzso zzso A as zzso The substitution of zzso to zzso or zzso was found to change neither the zzso nor zzso properties of the resulting zzso In contrast, the substitution of zzso zzso and zzso by the respective zzso drastically altered the zzso of the modified zzso Each of the six zzso induced an immune response with an unusually high level of zzso zzso The zzso produced zzso zzso which reacted with the zzso zzso as well as with the all zzso and the parent protein zzso in solution but not with zzso containing one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso produced against the all zzso reacted with the free all zzso but not with the other zzso containing zzso in position zzso 134, and zzso
