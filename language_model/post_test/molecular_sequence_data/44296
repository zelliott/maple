The economics of large-scale production of fuel ethanol from biomass and zzso requires the efficient zzso of all the zzso derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso component of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids are major side chains in zzso of the grasses and hardwoods that have been targeted as potential zzso for the production of cellulosic zzso The amount of these acids is similar to that of zzso which is now being viewed as another potential zzso in the production of zzso zzso This study compared the zzso distribution associated with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso (as sole carbon and energy zzso by zzso coli B zzso zzso and two different zzso zzso strain in which pet expression was via a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso integrated zzso strain zzso zzso batch zzso were conducted using a modified LB medium with zzso zzso zzso or zzso with the zzso for pH control at either zzso or zzso The zzso host culture produced only zzso acid from zzso but zzso of zzso yielded a mixture of ethanol, zzso and zzso zzso with zzso acid being the zzso zzso The ethanol yield associated with zzso zzso by both zzso was similar, but zzso acid was a significant zzso zzso the pH from zzso to zzso increased the rate of zzso zzso but it also decreased the ethanol mass yield from zzso to zzso zzso primarily because of an increase in zzso acid zzso In all zzso there was good closure of the carbon mass balance, the exception being the zzso bearing zzso zzso that produced an unidentified product from zzso The metabolism of zzso by this metabolically engineered construct remains zzso The results offered insights into zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso and engineered zzso zzso distribution for metabolism of zzso acid by the zzso zzso zzso coli B and zzso strain zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is not solely responsible for the production of zzso from zzso and that zzso zzso zzso may play a significant role in the metabolism of zzso
