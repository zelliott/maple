zzso zzso which was isolated from garden soil in Japan, was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene and the zzso protein revealed that the closest relative of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso and Shaw zzso with zzso and zzso % zzso zzso The two strains had similar zzso zzso with zzso 7 as the major zzso system, zzso zzso DNA zzso content and 15 : 0 zzso 15 : 1 zzso 17 : 0 iso zzso and summed feature 3 as the major fatty zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be clearly differentiated from other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be easily distinguished from zzso zzso by zzso features zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso represent two separate species of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso with the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
