Recent studies have shown that there are multiple clinically important members of the zzso section zzso that are difficult to distinguish on the basis of zzso features zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Identification of these organisms may be clinically important, as some species vary in their zzso to zzso zzso In a prior study, we zzso zzso sequence typing to describe zzso zzso as a species distinct from zzso zzso The sequence data show that the gene zzso zzso zzso has high zzso zzso at zzso regions but is zzso among zzso of the same zzso These data were used to develop a zzso zzso length zzso zzso method that rapidly and accurately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso three major species within the section zzso that have previously been implicated in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso generated unique zzso zzso the results were validated by screening a collection of clinical strains and by in zzso analysis of the zzso sequences of zzso zzso deposited in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a simple method for the identification of clinically important, similar zzso of zzso zzso within the section zzso
