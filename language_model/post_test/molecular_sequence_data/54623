Phase variation of the major zzso surface membrane zzso the zzso zzso zzso with its counterpart, the zzso zzso was recently discussed as a result of DNA inversion occurring at specific zzso zzso Two similar zzso repeats to the ones within the zzso locus were found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3; one within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and another in the adjacent zzso zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate on both zzso and protein level that DNA inversion at these zzso repeats leads to alternating expression between zzso and the zzso zzso hypothetical zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains revealed that it is highly zzso among both species and that it also includes the zzso of zzso A third zzso repeat region in zzso is proposed to serve as an additional potential inversion site from which zzso genes can zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso events in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 are dynamic and zzso leading to a broad spectrum of zzso variation by which the zzso may evade host immune zzso
