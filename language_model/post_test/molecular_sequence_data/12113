A zzso zzso fragment, containing three open reading zzso has been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso The first gene zzso zzso the zzso protein PA of the zzso zzso complex, a protein of 159 zzso acids with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso The second gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is composed of zzso zzso zzso The third gene contained the zzso of the gene for zzso zzso zzso All gene products shared high similarity with the corresponding proteins from zzso zzso In both genes zzso and zzso the zzso termination zzso zzso was found zzso indicating the presence of zzso in both zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are organized as one zzso Unlike zzso coli, no stable secondary structures of the corresponding zzso were found immediately downstream of the zzso zzso to direct an zzso of zzso into the zzso and zzso transcripts of zzso zzso Instead, a secondary structure was identified in the zzso region of zzso
