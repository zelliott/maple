zzso zzso zzso are critically important in the zzso metabolism of a diverse array of zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported the cloning and zzso of the zzso zzso the first reported member of the zzso family from zzso and have demonstrated important species differences in zzso activity and tissue zzso In the present study, the cloning of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and their expression across zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso proteins in lung and liver zzso from all test zzso with relative weak signal detected from the koala, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso in zzso lung was comparable to that of zzso with significant higher activities detected in zzso liver and zzso compared to zzso A zzso zzso lung zzso complete zzso designated zzso which encodes a protein of 510 zzso acids and shares zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity to human zzso was cloned by zzso chain reaction zzso The results demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso that shares several common features with other published zzso however the zzso zzso zzso contains four extra zzso acid zzso at the zzso a fundamentally zzso zzso anchor of all zzso zzso
