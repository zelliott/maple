zzso is a zzso zzso with human zzso and zzso constant regions and zzso variable zzso It recognizes the zzso zzso a pan zzso zzso zzso trials in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown significant efficacy with a primary response rate of zzso and a secondary response rate of zzso after repeat treatments in prior zzso The selection for zzso tumor cells that no longer express zzso may compromise repeated zzso We have identified a patient who developed a transformed NHL that lost zzso protein expression after two courses of therapy with zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of B cells (as defined by zzso and surface zzso expressed surface zzso A biopsy from the zzso tumor after two courses of zzso revealed a diffuse large cell NHL where zzso of B cells expressed zzso with no evidence of bound zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso identified identical variable sequences in the initial and zzso zzso confirming the association between the two zzso Literature and database review suggests that approximately zzso of diffuse large cell zzso express zzso which suggests that these tumors rarely survive without zzso This is the first identified case of loss of zzso expression in a zzso that has relapsed after zzso therapy, although several other cases have since been zzso Considering the significant number of patients treated with zzso zzso this may occur only rarely and is unlikely to zzso zzso therapy with zzso zzso in the majority of zzso However, because many patients have relapsed after zzso zzso therapy and have not been zzso to identify clones with zzso zzso zzso we do not currently know the true frequency of this zzso When possible, patients should undergo evaluation for zzso expression before repeated courses of zzso zzso
