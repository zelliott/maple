In this study, we report one zzso zzso zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso (named as zzso was isolated from environmental river waters in Korea, and showed broad zzso to other bacterial species in the family zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological properties and complete zzso of zzso were simultaneously zzso The complete zzso of zzso composed of linear zzso DNA of zzso zzso with zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso 69 putative zzso 33 zzso zzso regions and 24 zzso zzso A high degree of similarity to other zzso zzso zzso was found in most zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was further compared with T4 zzso and the closest relative, zzso zzso zzso and the result demonstrated that it could be classified as a new member of the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated at different doses of zzso of infection using one each of virulent strain that possesses the zzso gene and zzso resistant strain, and the results proved to be efficient for the reduction of bacterial zzso Based on these results, zzso may have the potential for reducing the impacts of virulent or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in aquaculture and may also advance our understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
