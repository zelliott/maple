While zzso appear to be involved in the local zzso regulation of zzso zzso their specific role is zzso In yellow perch zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso in zzso and this induction requires gene zzso zzso the perch model was used to isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated for 32 h with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids were isolated from the tissue and used for differential display zzso zzso From zzso 5 bands were eventually obtained that were verified by Northern analysis to be consistently zzso by zzso at 32 zzso Using these bands, full-length zzso were obtained by library screening and completely zzso Based on similarity to known zzso four of the zzso presumably zzso for perch forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The fifth zzso obtained from zzso most likely encodes for an egg protein and will be reported zzso Each of the zzso was used to probe Northern blots of zzso zzso taken at 0, 12, 24, 32 and 42 h of incubation with zzso This zzso Northern analysis verified that all four were zzso by 32 zzso In addition, zzso and zzso transcripts began to increase by 12 zzso while zzso and zzso transcripts remained elevated through 42 zzso On Northern blots of zzso from other perch zzso zzso was found in all zzso zzso zzso was zzso specific, and zzso zzso was also present in the zzso and zzso Multiple transcripts were observed for zzso but the zzso form induced by zzso was only found in high abundance in the zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report that specifically characterizes zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso
