Patients with systemic zzso associated with multiple myeloma zzso exhibit zzso light chains and fragments which have been identified as zzso zzso Since a relatively small proportion of patients with multiple myeloma develop zzso comparison of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso and zzso zzso light chains and the structural characterization of the zzso proteins are required to understand the relationship between structure and zzso We determined the primary structure of a zzso zzso zzso Jones protein obtained from a patient zzso who had systemic zzso associated with multiple zzso We identified eight zzso acid replacements unique to this patient among the zzso zzso zzso zzso and which are also rare among the known zzso type light chains of zzso Three of these zzso were within the framework regions and may act to destabilize the structure to promote a putative zzso zzso In contrast to light chain fragments in the zzso which were processed in the variable region, mass zzso analysis of the zzso proteins isolated from zzso zzso deposits in this patient, revealed that they were all truncated within the constant region and corresponded to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the predicted three-dimensional model of this protein suggested that these fragments may be generated by a zzso specific for the zzso sides of basic zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso acid zzso at highly zzso zzso may convert zzso to zzso zzso light chain zzso
