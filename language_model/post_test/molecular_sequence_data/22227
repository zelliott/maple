zzso skin zzso are rich in zzso peptides that act as important components of an innate immune zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso skin zzso precursor cloning technique that zzso rapid access to these genetically zzso molecules and effects their subsequent identification and structural characterization from the zzso zzso zzso this approach on a skin zzso library from a zzso zzso Chinese species of frog, we identified a family of novel zzso zzso zzso named zzso that belong to previously identified families zzso zzso and zzso found predominantly in the skin zzso from frogs of the zzso zzso These data further substantiate the zzso robust nature of applying parallel zzso and zzso analyses on zzso defensive skin zzso that can be obtained in a zzso zzso zzso In addition, the present data illustrate that rapid structural characterization of zzso skin zzso peptides can be achieved from an zzso species without prior knowledge of primary structures of zzso zzso
