Investigation of the large zzso domain family of zzso regulators has revealed a molecular mechanism by which highly related zzso factors sharing common zzso motifs act to functionally discriminate their zzso DNA zzso Studies of two classes of zzso zzso domain factors zzso and zzso indicate that functional specificity on their native response elements is achieved by accommodating different zzso spacing between zzso oriented zzso core zzso zzso The preferred orientation of the zzso domain of the zzso factors on their native response elements appears to be opposite that of zzso and zzso Members of zzso zzso class exhibit remarkable flexibility in DNA site recognition zzso core motifs spaced by 0, 2, or 3 zzso whereas zzso zzso class is highly constrained zzso core motifs with a spacing of 3 zzso The molecular zzso of the constraint in DNA site selection appears to be imparted by 3 zzso acid zzso in the zzso basic region in concert, with zzso 2 of the zzso zzso domain which together are involved in minor groove and possibly zzso backbone zzso Similar mechanisms may zzso differential flexibility in spacing and orientation for diverse families of zzso zzso
