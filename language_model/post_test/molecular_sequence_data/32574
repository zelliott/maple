The zzso zzso is released during zzso of protein C zzso We measured the effect of a synthetic zzso with an zzso acid sequence similar to that of the natural zzso on zzso from healthy individuals using zzso zzso We found that this synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso it diminishes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed weak interaction between the synthetic zzso and zzso Our findings suggest that this synthetic zzso may interact with a zzso located on the zzso cell zzso
