zzso zzso 3 zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, is produced in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso experiments have identified a key biological role in initiating zzso descent during fetal zzso Additionally, zzso has an important function in zzso male and female germ cell zzso These actions are zzso via its recently identified zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the structural features that are responsible for the interaction of zzso with its zzso its solution structure was determined by zzso zzso together with in zzso zzso of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso was found to adopt a characteristic zzso fold in solution but is a highly dynamic zzso The four zzso of this zzso zzso are zzso and additional zzso exchange is evident in the molecular zzso zzso zzso were used to identify the key zzso of zzso that are responsible for the interaction with the zzso of zzso These include zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso playing a secondary role, as evident from the synergistic effect on the activity in double and triple zzso involving these zzso Together, these zzso acids combine with the previously identified critical zzso zzso to form the zzso binding zzso The current results provide clear direction for the design of novel specific zzso and zzso of this zzso
