zzso a family of zzso zzso animal zzso have been shown to zzso signaling processes leading to zzso zzso zzso and zzso through their ability to interact with zzso zzso To date 16 human zzso zzso recognition zzso have been established by sequence analysis and found to be expressed in several zzso Given the divergent functions of these zzso it is of vital importance to understand common and differential features in order to search for specific zzso of individual members of the human zzso zzso In this work we performed an integrated zzso analysis of all individual members of the human zzso zzso In the first place, we have built zzso models for zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein 13 zzso and zzso protein for which no experimental structural information is zzso We have then performed classical molecular dynamics simulations of the whole 15 members family in free and zzso states to analyze protein and zzso interaction zzso Our results show that all zzso adopt the same fold, and the zzso recognition zzso are very similar with structural differences located in specific zzso These differences are reflected in the dynamics zzso where mobility differences translate into zzso values which significantly influence their zzso zzso Thus, zzso selectivity appears to be modulated by subtle differences in the zzso binding zzso Taken together, our results may contribute to the understanding, at a molecular level, of the structural and zzso zzso that distinguish individual human zzso
