The paper presents results obtained in zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso in which the pairs of strands with identical bases are parallel and have a zzso symmetry zzso All possible models of base binding to yield a zzso complex have been zzso The zzso angles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are consistent with the zzso of zzso energy for zzso zzso have been determined using the results of zzso of zzso energy calculated at zzso zzso Potential energy is shown to depend on the structure of base complexes and on the mutual orientation of unlike zzso zzso biological functions of zzso zzso are zzso
