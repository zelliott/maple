zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previously, we showed that protein zzso zzso activity increased significantly during rat liver zzso In the present study, in zzso zzso zzso during liver zzso was zzso The presence of zzso or zzso zzso in proteins varied significantly at the early stage of zzso after partial zzso The nature of the 31 proteins that showed significant variations in zzso zzso were identified using zzso and zzso Many of these proteins were zzso stress-related or zzso proteins that exhibited significant variations in zzso zzso without changes in their expression zzso The zzso of some of the zzso proteins under zzso stress such as zzso zzso 3 decreased with increased levels of zzso zzso whereas normal levels of protein zzso were recovered as zzso zzso zzso Taken together, this study demonstrated that zzso zzso events in zzso during the early period of rat liver zzso may participate in the regulation or protection of protein activities, thus presenting a significant new insight into the biology of zzso cells at the zzso modification level and into a key population of proteins involved in these zzso
