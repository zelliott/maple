Although it is becoming well known that zzso zzso and the zzso involved in their metabolism play a critical role in zzso systems, little is understood of their significance in zzso zzso A novel protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is most similar to a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but also shows similarity zzso zzso to various other putative zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso activity was displayed at an zzso strength of 200 zzso a pH of zzso and a temperature of 55 degrees zzso In order to zzso its zzso specificity and zzso of zzso zzso zzso a combination of kinetic and zzso zzso zzso studies were zzso The data indicated that zzso has a general specificity for zzso zzso zzso but can also zzso molecules containing high energy zzso bonds in zzso zzso is unique from other microbial zzso in that it zzso zzso the zzso position of zzso zzso Furthermore, it can produce zzso via a highly unique and ordered zzso of sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, reverse zzso zzso was used to determine that zzso is zzso zzso and together with zzso analysis, was used to gain an understanding of its zzso zzso
