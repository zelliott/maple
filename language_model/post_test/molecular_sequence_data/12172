The hairpin zzso derived from the negative strand of the satellite zzso of tobacco zzso virus, belongs to the class of small zzso zzso that cleave zzso to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso these zzso in the reverse reaction to form zzso Rate and equilibrium zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso steps in the kinetic mechanism were determined using a series of hairpin zzso pairs that differed in the sequence and length of the zzso zzso zzso All hairpin zzso zzso with rate zzso of approximately zzso zzso at pH zzso in 10 zzso zzso at 25 degrees C, regardless of the length or sequence of the zzso zzso A rate constant of approximately 3 zzso was determined for an zzso zzso reaction in which both zzso products were supplied to the zzso in zzso Thus, the hairpin favored zzso over zzso by zzso when the zzso was saturated with zzso zzso zzso rate zzso for zzso zzso and products were comparable to values reported for other zzso zzso but were somewhat slower than binding rates typical of small zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso were much slower than zzso rate zzso for all zzso Because virtually every zzso that was bound was zzso before it could zzso zzso values were not the same as zzso zzso Instead, zzso reflected the ratio of zzso and zzso binding rate zzso and had the same value of approximately 30 zzso for all zzso zzso based on zzso determined free energy parameters for simple zzso zzso indicated that complexes between zzso and zzso products were slightly less stable than simple zzso with the same zzso In contrast, affinities between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso products were stronger than expected for simple duplexes by about zzso zzso evidence of stabilizing interactions in addition to those contributed by zzso base zzso This kinetic and zzso study demonstrates that the kinetic mechanism of the hairpin zzso is distinct from the kinetic mechanisms of other zzso zzso and provides a foundation for further exploration of the hairpin structure and zzso zzso
