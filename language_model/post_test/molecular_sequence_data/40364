A short zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil on zzso Island, zzso A zzso study was undertaken to establish the zzso position of this zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso formed an evolutionary lineage within the radiation of the zzso zzso In particular, it formed a zzso lineage with zzso zzso zzso zzso with which it shared the highest sequence similarity of about zzso However, zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso was distinct from its closest zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso contained zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso had a cellular fatty acid profile containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso with zzso as the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content of the strain was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso evidence, the strain is separate from previously described members of the zzso zzso and represents a novel species in this zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
