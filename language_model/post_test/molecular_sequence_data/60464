We have identified expression of zzso zzso gamma chain zzso zzso in human prostate and have shown that it originates from zzso cells of the prostate and not from zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso delta chain zzso gene is silent in human zzso The major zzso transcript in prostate has a different size than the transcript expressed in zzso zzso and blood zzso It is expressed in normal prostate zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso cell line zzso The zzso originates from an zzso zzso zzso and it is initiated within the zzso sequence directly upstream of the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso transcript consists of the zzso and zzso gene zzso and it has an untranslated sequence including a zzso signal and zzso sequence at the zzso The finding that prostate zzso cells express a high level of a transcript from a gene that was thought to by exclusively expressed by zzso is highly zzso
