The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on its ability to zzso the zzso reduction of bovine insulin zzso The protein has a molecular mass of zzso zzso determined by zzso mass zzso a zzso of zzso and its primary structure was obtained by automated zzso degradation after zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The sequences of known bacterial zzso were aligned at the active zzso zzso has an identity ranging from 45 to zzso with all sequences except that of the unusual zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene coding for zzso was isolated by a strategy based on zzso gene amplification and cloned in a zzso downstream of a zzso promoter zzso the zzso clone was used as the expression zzso for zzso zzso The expression was zzso by varying both the time of cell growth and the time of exposure to the zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso represents zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso CD zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is endowed with a higher zzso heat stability than the zzso from zzso zzso zzso experiments showed a lower content of bound water in zzso than in zzso coli zzso and a transition temperature zzso 10 degrees C higher for zzso The three-dimensional model of the oxidized form of zzso was constructed by a comparative molecular zzso technique, using zzso coli zzso and zzso strain zzso zzso as reference zzso Increased networks of zzso and shorter zzso emerged as major features of the zzso structure compared with those of the template zzso The findings are discussed in the light of the current knowledge about molecular zzso of protein zzso
