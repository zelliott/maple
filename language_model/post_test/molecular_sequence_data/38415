zzso or zzso sequences have been found to occur in both zzso and zzso zzso Such repeated sequences are usually short and present at several functionally important regions in the zzso However, long zzso sequences are rare and are a major source of zzso zzso The zzso zzso instability is believed to be due to zzso or hairpin formation and subsequent zzso of this structure by zzso zzso Here we present both genetic and physical evidence that long zzso sequences zzso zzso generate zzso breaks zzso at a high frequency during zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso formation depends on the primary sequence of the zzso repeat and the location and length of the repeated zzso The zzso formation at the zzso requires all of the gene products that are known to be responsible for zzso formation at the normal zzso zzso Since zzso are initiators of nearly all zzso zzso events, most of the zzso breaks appear to be repaired by zzso zzso Our results suggest that short zzso sequences are highly stable in zzso In contrast, long zzso sequences make the zzso unstable by inducing zzso and such sequences are usually removed from the zzso by zzso zzso zzso
