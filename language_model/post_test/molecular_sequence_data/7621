Previous deletion zzso studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso requires the eight zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso recognition zzso and sequences in zzso far downstream of the zzso zzso We now demonstrate that replacement of all of zzso upstream of the zzso recognition sequence with zzso sequences still allows zzso in zzso Thus, other than the eight zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso However, deletion of the zzso signal sequence zzso zzso suggesting that entry into the zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso was not blocked by zzso A, and zzso could occur in zzso in the presence of dog zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso occurs in the zzso zzso Four zzso deletions in zzso were zzso defective in zzso as were two zzso in which zzso sequences were zzso for zzso suggesting that most of zzso is zzso A series of substitution zzso were constructed in which all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were collectively zzso all standard zzso require at least one of these zzso in their active zzso No single zzso was zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not a zzso zzso of the zzso indicated that the zzso contents were not required for zzso zzso It seems most likely that zzso zzso is zzso by a host zzso zzso zzso zzso quite possibly zzso and that zzso is required to present the zzso recognition sequence in the correct zzso to the host zzso for zzso
