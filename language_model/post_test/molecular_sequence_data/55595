X linked zzso with zzso M zzso which is zzso by zzso together with excess zzso production reflecting an impairment of the zzso heavy chain class switch of B zzso has been mapped to zzso We report zzso linkage data in six families with zzso which show that the most likely position for the gene is close to zzso with a maximum zzso score of zzso The finding of zzso between zzso and both zzso and zzso implies that zzso is not zzso to X linked zzso zzso These data will be useful in genetic zzso in families and will also be useful in testing candidate zzso
