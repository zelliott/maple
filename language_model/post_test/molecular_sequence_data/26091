We used functional zzso and zzso synthetic nuclear zzso signal peptides of zzso T zzso zzso to human serum zzso zzso zzso to zzso their binding to proteins of rat liver zzso on Western zzso zzso of 140 and 55 zzso zzso and zzso were exclusively recognized by zzso zzso zzso Free zzso peptides zzso for the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso whereas free zzso zzso which differed by a single zzso acid from the wild type, zzso less zzso The two proteins were zzso from zzso by either low or high zzso strength zzso We zzso zzso and raised zzso zzso in chicken against the protein excised from zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso as judged by their zzso with a single nuclear protein band of 140 zzso on Western blots of zzso zzso of whole zzso zzso zzso zzso on fixed and zzso Buffalo rat liver zzso cells with zzso zzso exhibited a distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also bound to zzso in a similar pattern on fixed and zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso It is possible that zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso and functions as a nuclear import zzso
