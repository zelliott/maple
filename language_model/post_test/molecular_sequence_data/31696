This study was conducted to explore zzso zzso communities inhabiting a toxic weed zzso zzso zzso from zzso of northwestern zzso The effects of plant tissue and growth stage on zzso zzso were zzso zzso were recovered from zzso of the samples, with a total of zzso zzso 41 operational zzso units zzso were identified, consisting of 40 zzso belonging primarily to zzso and 1 zzso belonging to zzso zzso and zzso were the orders contributing the most species to the zzso zzso The total colonization frequency and species richness of zzso zzso were higher in roots than in leaves and zzso In addition, for the plant zzso the structure of zzso communities differed significantly by growth stages of leaf emergence and zzso for the plant growth zzso the structure of zzso communities differed significantly by plant zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso serves as a zzso for a wide variety of zzso zzso that can be isolated from various plant zzso
