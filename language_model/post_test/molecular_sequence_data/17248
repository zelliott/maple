A zzso in the sodium channel zzso was identified in a small Italian family with zzso inherited generalized zzso with zzso zzso plus zzso The zzso zzso alters an zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the sodium channel alpha zzso The zzso decreased zzso of the alpha zzso by zzso which normally causes a negative shift in the zzso dependence of zzso in zzso There was less of a shift with the zzso channel, resulting in a 10 zzso difference between the zzso and zzso channels in the presence of zzso This shift increased the magnitude of the window zzso which resulted in more persistent current during a zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso expressing the zzso channels will fire an action potential with a shorter onset delay in response to a threshold current injection, and that they will fire multiple action zzso with a shorter zzso zzso at a higher input zzso These results suggest a zzso relationship between a positive shift in the zzso dependence of sodium channel zzso and spontaneous seizure zzso zzso interaction between the zzso zzso domain of the zzso alpha zzso with the zzso or zzso zzso was first demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for beta zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells confirmed the interaction between the zzso zzso of the alpha and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso this interaction, demonstrating a novel molecular mechanism leading to seizure zzso
