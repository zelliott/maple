The linear zzso DNA zzso of zzso as it is present in infectious zzso needs to be zzso after infection of host cells and before DNA zzso zzso zzso have to be zzso into linear zzso molecules during zzso maturation and are most probably the zzso for inversion of the short segment relative to the long segment of the bovine zzso 1 zzso zzso Those regions of the zzso zzso which are functionally involved in these processes have been analyzed at the molecular level by cloning and sequencing the zzso zzso the fusion of both zzso from zzso zzso and the junction between the short and the long zzso zzso On the basis of the simple zzso arrangement of zzso it was zzso that the zzso of zzso zzso by a hypothetical zzso zzso activity may be specified by a sequence at the left end of zzso (An zzso which is located zzso to a reiterated beta element that makes up the zzso site zzso The relationship of those elements in zzso and the comparison to similar regions of other zzso indicate consensus sequence elements which are functionally important for zzso and zzso of viral DNA during maturation of zzso
