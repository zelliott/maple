zzso zzso is a particular type of error caused by DNA zzso believed to occur both in bacterial and zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that deletion events can occur in zzso coli by replication zzso between short zzso and that the main zzso coli zzso DNA zzso III zzso is prone to such zzso In this work, we present evidence that the two other DNA zzso of zzso coli, DNA zzso I and DNA zzso II, as well as zzso of two zzso T4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso in zzso whereas DNA zzso from another zzso zzso does zzso Furthermore, we have measured the strand displacement activity of the different zzso tested for zzso in the absence and in the presence of the zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso and we show that: zzso zzso having a strong strand displacement activity cannot slip zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso devoid of any strand displacement activity slip very efficiently zzso zzso II and T4 zzso and zzso stimulation of the strand displacement activity by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or by a zzso that affects the 3' zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso II zzso and zzso pol zzso is correlated with the zzso of zzso We propose that these observations can be interpreted in terms of a model, for which we have shown that high strand displacement activity of a zzso diminishes its propensity to zzso
