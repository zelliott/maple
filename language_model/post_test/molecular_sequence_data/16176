zzso of nerve growth factor zzso is normally restricted to cells derived from the neural crest in a zzso regulated zzso We analyzed promoter sequences for the human nerve growth factor zzso gene and found that the zzso promoter resembles others which are associated with zzso expressed genes that have zzso and zzso zzso Unlike these other zzso the initiation of zzso occurred at one major site rather than at multiple zzso The zzso nature of the nerve growth factor zzso promoter may account for the ability of this gene to be transcribed in a diverse number of zzso cells after gene zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene indicated that structural features are precisely divided into discrete zzso
