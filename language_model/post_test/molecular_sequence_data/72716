zzso in the DNA mismatch repair zzso gene zzso zzso a novel zzso of zzso for some zzso of zzso zzso Mice deficient in zzso are susceptible to zzso but defects in this gene have not been identified in human zzso zzso To determine if the zzso these mice develop are related to a particular zzso of human zzso we evaluated 20 clinically ill zzso zzso mice ranging in age from 2 to 13 zzso The zzso tumors comprised a single zzso entity representing the zzso counterpart of precursor zzso T cells and closely resembled human precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the expression of three zzso zzso associated genes showed that zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso (also known as zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso tumors, zzso The zzso zzso model of precursor zzso zzso was substantiated by the finding of a nearly identical expression profile of zzso zzso and zzso in 10 zzso cases of human zzso zzso evidence for zzso abnormalities in human zzso was established by sequence analysis of zzso 13 of zzso which revealed coding region zzso in 2 of 10 zzso Our findings zzso defects in the zzso system with the zzso expression of zzso specific zzso and define a new zzso of human zzso
