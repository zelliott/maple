We describe an approach to the synthesis of peptides from segments bearing no protecting groups through an zzso zzso method to capture the zzso segment as a zzso that then zzso an zzso zzso transfer to the zzso component with formation of a zzso zzso Two zzso zzso methods to give the zzso zzso intermediate were achieved by either a zzso exchange zzso by a zzso and an zzso or a zzso by C zzso acid reacting with a zzso zzso zzso With this approach, unprotected segments ranging from 4 to 37 zzso were coupled to zzso solution to give free peptides up to 54 zzso long with high zzso
