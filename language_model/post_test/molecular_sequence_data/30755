In contrast with the complex series of zzso choices that generate the various zzso zzso of the neural zzso zzso alternative zzso of zzso zzso does not contribute to additional molecular zzso A single regulatory unit in zzso DNA, mapping to a 5 zzso zzso fragment, controls the expression of all major zzso size zzso DNA sequence analysis of a 2 zzso zzso spanning the two major identified zzso initiation sites zzso and 188 zzso from the zzso zzso and translation start zzso indicates that the regulatory unit does not possess classical zzso or zzso zzso The region of the putative promoter exhibits a zzso content and a high frequency of the zzso zzso both characteristics of a zzso tiny zzso Introduction of zzso zzso zzso into human and zzso zzso cell lines defines an active promoter region of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This region of zzso DNA contains consensus sites for the interaction of known zzso zzso
