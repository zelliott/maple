zzso zzso when deprived of zzso generates zzso from zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso by the zzso zzso Under conditions of low oxygen tension, the zzso zzso zzso binds to a site centered zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was enhanced two- to zzso by zzso zzso This zzso effect zzso in zzso on the zzso regulator zzso and, in zzso on an zzso binding site centered at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein to this site was demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso This zzso recognition site contained a zzso zzso which deviated in only 1 base from the common sequence motif zzso found in other zzso binding sites of zzso zzso Furthermore, an alignment of all known zzso binding sites confirmed that they consist of two directly repeated zzso In the absence of zzso zzso did not induce the arc zzso suggesting that zzso alone does not activate the zzso zzso According to a model proposed, zzso makes physical contact with zzso and thereby zzso initiation of arc zzso
