Most zzso zzso space proteins are zzso as a precursor zzso and the zzso extension of zzso acids that served as the leader sequence is removed after import by the action of a zzso called zzso processing zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been solved very recently, and it has been shown that synthetic leader peptides bind with zzso in an extended zzso However, it is not known how zzso recognizes hundreds of leader peptides with different primary and secondary structures or when during import the leader is zzso Here we took advantage of the fact that the structure of the leader from rat liver zzso zzso has been determined by zzso to possess two zzso portions separated by a three zzso acid zzso zzso When the zzso was deleted, the leader formed one long continuous zzso that can target a protein to the zzso space but is not removed by the action of zzso zzso of two and three leaders were fused to the precursor protein to determine the stage of import at which processing occurs, if zzso could function as an zzso zzso and if it would process if the zzso site was part of a zzso Native or zzso deleted zzso were zzso zzso into isolated zzso zzso or processing with zzso expressed zzso was zzso It was concluded that processing did not occur as the precursor was just entering the zzso space, but most likely coincided with the folding of the zzso Further, finding that zzso could not take place if the processing site was part of a stable zzso is consistent with the crystal structure of zzso Lastly, it was found that zzso could function at sites as far as 108 zzso from the N zzso of the precursor zzso but its ability to process decreases zzso as the distance zzso
