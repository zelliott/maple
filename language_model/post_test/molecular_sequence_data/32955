zzso protein 2 zzso also known as zzso zzso protein zzso is a novel zzso protein that is frequently zzso in various zzso However, its cellular functions remain zzso A previous study has shown that its protein level begins to increase during zzso and zzso at zzso after which it decreases zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso bundling related to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in cell cycle arrest during zzso due to a zzso in zzso separation and subsequent formation of a zzso zzso We also show that degradation of zzso during zzso exit is zzso by the zzso complex bound to zzso and that the zzso box motif near the N zzso is necessary for its zzso Compared to the wild type, expression of a zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased the occurrence of zzso defects and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in the assembly and maintenance of zzso zzso presumably by regulating zzso zzso and its destruction during zzso exit serves an important role in the completion of zzso and in the maintenance of zzso zzso in the next zzso
