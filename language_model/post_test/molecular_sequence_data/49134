zzso is zzso expressed in greater than zzso of all breast zzso yet its function as a tumor zzso is not fully zzso Recently, studies have shown that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso possibly in a complex that promotes the zzso of zzso junctions and the invasion of zzso Here we show that the deletion of zzso expression from zzso transgenic mice results in a significant increase in the time to zzso zzso tumor zzso Analysis of zzso tumors on a zzso zzso background shows a zzso complex formation between zzso and zzso that can be observed in both the membrane and the zzso of transformed zzso Analysis of primary human zzso revealed that this zzso interaction occurs in both primary and zzso tumors, but is dramatically increased in zzso zzso zzso of zzso domain peptides to the invasive zzso and zzso cell lines increases their invasive zzso and these peptides zzso with both zzso and the focal zzso protein zzso primarily at sites of membrane invasion into a collagen zzso These data indicate a potential mechanism for zzso promotion of invasive zzso in the breast through the zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso
