zzso zzso is a zzso fungus infecting over 200 different plant zzso We use a molecular genetic approach to study the process of zzso degradation by the zzso Recently, we described the cloning and characterization of an zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso which is required for full zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of five additional zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso The identity at the zzso acid level between the six zzso of zzso zzso varied from 34 to zzso zzso analysis, by using a group of 35 related zzso zzso and as an zzso one plant zzso resulted in the identification of five zzso groups of closely related zzso The zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso could be assigned to three different zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed the presence of the complete zzso gene family in other strains of zzso zzso as well as in other zzso zzso zzso gene expression of the gene family members was found in zzso grown in liquid culture with either zzso or zzso acid as the carbon zzso
