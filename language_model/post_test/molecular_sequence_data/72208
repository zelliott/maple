zzso in the fatty zzso zzso gene zzso are responsible for zzso syndrome zzso zzso et zzso zzso In this study, the expression and the zzso organization of the zzso gene are zzso The gene spans approximately 31 zzso and consists of 10 zzso and 9 zzso All zzso junction sequences match the classical zzso zzso Both zzso zzso protection zzso and primer extension study suggest that the zzso initiation site is located 195 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso No zzso zzso box can be found in the zzso sequence of the zzso but a zzso box was found 58 zzso upstream of the putative zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region revealed numerous potential binding sites for zzso factors zzso and zzso and one putative zzso binding zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from various zzso revealed two zzso species, with sizes around zzso and zzso zzso that are derived from the differential use of two zzso zzso Although this gene is expressed in a variety of human zzso the expression level of zzso in the liver and skeletal muscle appears to be higher than that in other zzso zzso
