zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were removed, and material from them was extracted and zzso using two sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso sequence zzso The peak zzso fraction from the second column appeared to contain two peptides with the sequences zzso and zzso based on zzso analysis and on the absolute requirement for the zzso in the zzso These two zzso respectively, have been given the names zzso and zzso due to similarity with previously identified lobster peptides F1 and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and augment synaptic transmission at a zzso zzso and evidence is presented for the zzso release of these peptides from the zzso zzso
