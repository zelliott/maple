A substantial body of evidence suggests involvement of the human zzso zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a severe heart disease of significant public health zzso zzso signal zzso is dramatically altered due to zzso resulting in an impairment of zzso zzso The important role of genetic factors in idiopathic zzso zzso zzso recently zzso we analyzed this prime candidate gene for genetic variation in carefully selected patients and zzso In this preliminary study, 18 single zzso zzso were observed, 17 of which were located in the zzso and zzso region of the coding zzso resulting in 7 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso resulted in 11 different zzso zzso zzso the zzso carrying the zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso in a zzso or zzso form were observed significantly more frequently in the group of zzso zzso The present results may provide a clue on the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso and add zzso interesting information on nature, distribution, and evolutionary aspects of sequence variation in human zzso zzso zzso
