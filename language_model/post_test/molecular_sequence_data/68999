The effect of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso on human factor zzso was studied in zzso The zzso caused a rapid loss in factor zzso zzso activity by the action of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso G in the zzso as demonstrated by the use of specific zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso inhibitor and the zzso G inhibitor preserved zzso and zzso of the zzso activity, zzso zzso protected factor zzso completely from the zzso zzso zzso zzso G and zzso zzso from zzso each destroyed the zzso activity of factor zzso when added to a zzso zzso There were, however, no effect on factor zzso activity when zzso G was added to zzso zzso gel zzso in the presence of zzso indicated that zzso and zzso G zzso the zzso in the same manner, producing zzso zzso of low molecular mass and a single large product of 48 zzso zzso of factor zzso with calcium zzso inhibited the zzso action of zzso and zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso and zzso G from activated zzso may be partly responsible for the loss in factor zzso activity that is observed during zzso
