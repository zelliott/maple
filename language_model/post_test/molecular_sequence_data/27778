The 3' region of the zzso zzso zzso gene contains an zzso element which is excised from the zzso during zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso sites which border the element in zzso cells and the rearranged zzso zzso In zzso cells, the element was flanked by zzso direct repeats which were identical to the repeats present at the ends of the zzso element in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso Although zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso are quite distinct in many ways, the overall sequence similarity between the two strains for the regions zzso was zzso Like the zzso strain zzso element, the zzso zzso element was excised in zzso to produce a functional zzso gene and a free zzso element which was neither amplified nor zzso The zzso strain zzso zzso gene is located at the zzso end of the zzso element and is required for zzso of the element in zzso The zzso zzso element also contained an zzso gene which could complement a defective zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not contain the equivalent of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
