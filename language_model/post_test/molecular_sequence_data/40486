A zzso of the prion zzso zzso zzso bearing a zzso implicated in familial prion disease, forms zzso that have been shown to induce prion disease when injected zzso into transgenic mice expressing full-length zzso containing the zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso hydrogen exchange zzso to probe the organization of the zzso in its zzso zzso We determined the extent of hydrogen exchange first by tandem zzso liquid zzso and mass zzso zzso and then by zzso zzso Although single zzso resolution is afforded by zzso zzso zzso is well suited to the study of natural zzso because it does not require labeling with zzso active zzso Thus, natural zzso obtained from infected animals can be compared with model systems such as zzso zzso studied zzso In our study, we find two segments of sequence that display a high level of protection from exchange, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, there is a region that displays exchange behavior consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso zzso We discuss our data with respect to several structural models proposed for infectious zzso zzso and highlight zzso as one of the few techniques well suited to studying natural zzso
