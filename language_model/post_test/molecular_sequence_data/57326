zzso animals containing rearranged heavy or light chains are used to study the process of zzso which characterizes the maturation of the zzso zzso zzso mice contain five copies of a zzso coding for a light chain produced in response to the zzso zzso We have selected zzso from secondary responses that express the zzso as the only light zzso Some of these zzso contain zzso copies carrying zzso known to improve zzso zzso We have zzso the expression of the five zzso copies in those zzso We report here that the zzso zzso process can affect the successful expression of zzso zzso zzso When zzso that improve the zzso affinity appear in one zzso zzso zzso selection zzso cells that zzso the other copies at multiple levels of gene zzso including examples where nonsense zzso correlate with a drop in zzso zzso zzso
