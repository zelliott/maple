The process of zzso chain initiation by zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso In this complex phase of transcription, short zzso are zzso and released from the zzso complex in a reaction termed zzso zzso The zzso zzso many cycles of zzso initiation prior to completion of the initiation process, which is signaled by the zzso of the zzso away from the promoter, release of zzso factor, and formation of an zzso complex in which the zzso is zzso zzso We have studied the parameters that affect escape from the promoter by zzso coli zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A1 promoter, the zzso zzso zzso promoter, and the zzso promoter zzso zzso The latter site contains a synthetic initial transcribed region that reduces its ability to zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be zzso up to zzso in zzso by addition of the zzso coli transcript zzso factor zzso or zzso but these factors have little effect on zzso from the normal zzso A1 or zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso coli strain lacking zzso and zzso we were also able to show stimulation of zzso by the zzso factors from the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The stimulation of zzso chain initiation by zzso factors, together with their known zzso properties in the zzso zzso reaction, suggests some specific models for steps in the zzso initiation zzso
