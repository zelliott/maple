The zzso zzso 3' end encodes the zzso tail zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso region also encodes the zzso zzso and zzso protein in overlapping reading zzso We studied the zzso in the CT coding region in 46 clinical specimens and in 2 reference strains by sequencing and by zzso The aims were to zzso the zzso of zzso CT and the evolution of proteins expressed from overlapping coding zzso 

A zzso reduction of the length of the CT region affected the zzso zzso and zzso strains in zzso due to a premature stop zzso in the zzso zzso In clinical samples this wasn't observed, but the CT length varied due to insertions and zzso We noted 3 zzso and 3 variable regions in the zzso The zzso regions were those containing zzso involved in zzso zzso the potential zzso CT region implicated in the zzso zzso and the potential end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The variable regions were the potential zzso Kennedy region, the potential zzso zzso zzso two and the beginning of the potential zzso zzso zzso zzso A very zzso region was coded downstream of the premature stop zzso observed in zzso suggesting a membrane spanning zzso Interestingly, the zzso that are responsible for the zzso of the CT don't impact rev and zzso However, in the zzso coding region zzso resulted only from zzso changes that impacted zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and Rev zzso part are subject to major length variations in both clinical samples and cultured zzso The zzso zzso CT contains variable and zzso zzso These regions don't affect the rev and zzso zzso acids composition which zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso
