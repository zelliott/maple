To evaluate the relationship between zzso oxide zzso and zzso we zzso 4 human zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 normal zzso zzso for the presence of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso Using an zzso against zzso we observed zzso zzso if zzso in the zzso samples, but not in normal zzso When we incubated zzso samples with zzso against both zzso and human zzso zzso zzso a zzso marker, we found that while most zzso cells were stained with zzso zzso only a few were stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso showed that zzso zzso was expressed in the samples of zzso but not in normal zzso The sequence of zzso message in the zzso samples was identical to that previously detected in a human colon cancer cell zzso These results suggest that zzso in human zzso is mostly derived from tumor cells, rather than zzso and that it may play a direct role in zzso
