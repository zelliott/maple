zzso is an zzso zzso that is zzso in zzso disease, a fatal form of progressive zzso zzso In order to perform its function, zzso forms a functional complex with zzso a zzso zzso that zzso targeting of zzso to its corresponding zzso While zzso zzso has been zzso there are no data on the evolutionary lineage of zzso 

After an extensive search for zzso zzso we found that zzso is present in all zzso species and a zzso in contrast with the broader species distribution previously reported for zzso These data suggest that in addition to forming a functional complex, zzso and perhaps zzso may also have independent zzso In addition, we found that zzso shares significant identity with the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso containing family of zzso We present experimental evidence that both zzso and zzso share some zzso for zzso although they produce zzso chains with different zzso However, zzso zzso were not zzso zzso by the zzso zzso 

We found that zzso and zzso are not zzso in the same zzso In addition, we found that zzso shares significant identity with the zzso zzso zzso The latter result suggests a common origin for zzso and zzso and provides insights into possible functional relationships between both zzso
