The coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome contains a small envelope zzso zzso with putative involvement in host zzso and virus zzso To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to form a TM zzso Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the zzso putative zzso domain of E protein zzso forms several zzso TM zzso a zzso a zzso and two zzso zzso Further, these interactions were found to be zzso zzso zzso we have studied multiple zzso labeled zzso peptides zzso in model zzso zzso using the zzso parameters derived from infrared zzso zzso We show that the zzso of zzso is consistent with a regular TM zzso Further, the zzso parameters obtained unequivocally zzso to a zzso model, by comparison with previous zzso We have independently confirmed that the full zzso of E protein can also zzso as zzso after expression in zzso zzso This interaction must be zzso at least zzso at the TM zzso The model we report for this zzso zzso bundle may explain some of the zzso properties of protein zzso and should be the basis of zzso efforts in future functional zzso
