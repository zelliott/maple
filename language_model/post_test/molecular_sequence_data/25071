Clinical studies have shown that zzso of urine concentration of degradation products of zzso zzso of type I collagen provide a selective marker to assess bone zzso zzso for zzso fragments have been described using zzso generated against an eight zzso acid synthetic zzso zzso In this study, we describe development of a rat zzso zzso against a synthetic linear zzso zzso which we isolated and characterized from zzso urine by zzso zzso An zzso procedure was developed to evaluate the efficacy of this zzso to measure bone zzso and characterize urinary degradation products of zzso type I zzso The measuring range of zzso was zzso zzso with a detection limit of 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean spike and dilution zzso range between 90 and zzso In assessing the clinical performance, we observed approximately zzso higher values for zzso patients zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso women zzso zzso Z score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso power to assess subtle changes in bone turnover between zzso and zzso women compares well with the commercially available markers of bone zzso zzso of zzso concentration in a population including normal and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso shows a strong correlation with zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso patients, a zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in zzso concentration was observed after 3 months of treatment with zzso as compared with zzso zzso The zzso developed in this study displays a slightly different zzso than that reported previously using eight zzso acid zzso zzso In addition, isolation and characterization of circulating forms of zzso from healthy children by zzso zzso revealed the presence of two novel urinary fragments corresponding to zzso acid sequence zzso and zzso in addition to the previously known two fragments composed of two zzso chains linked together by a zzso zzso The origin of the zzso zzso could not be explained by the known mechanisms involved in collagen degradation, indicating that it could be a product of zzso handling of zzso fragments generated from zzso The preliminary clinical data suggest that the new zzso may be useful for further investigation of the clinical importance of measurement of these type I collagen degradation zzso
