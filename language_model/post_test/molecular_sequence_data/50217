The relative degree of both equilibrium binding and of ultraviolet light induced zzso formation for the zzso zzso zzso V with two zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The experiments reveal that zzso V zzso under equilibrium conditions, and zzso in the presence of zzso applied zzso light, more efficiently with the alternating zzso sequence zzso than the zzso duplex at identical zzso V to DNA duplex zzso zzso I zzso of zzso containing duplexes derived from the zzso duplex, identified and isolated using gel shift zzso employing zzso zzso gels, confirm that zzso V zzso can be formed with zzso zzso but suggest that zzso formation with either zzso or zzso zzso is also zzso
