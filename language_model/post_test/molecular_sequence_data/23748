The design and discovery of selective zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso have been actively pursued in order to develop therapeutic cancer zzso By means of a consecutive zzso protocol involving zzso zzso zzso experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the characteristic structural and dynamic properties that distinguish zzso from zzso in its zzso with selective zzso The results for all three zzso zzso under investigation show that the zzso motion of a zzso loop of zzso is zzso out in the presence of the zzso whereas their binding in the zzso active site has little effect on the loop zzso It is also found that the binding preference of zzso selective zzso for zzso over zzso stems from the reduced zzso accessibility in the active site of the former due to the formation of a stable zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso side chains at the top of the zzso zzso Besides the differences in loop flexibility and zzso accessibility, the dynamic zzso of the hydrogen bonds between the zzso and the side chain of the zzso zzso at the bottom of the active site also correlate well with the relative binding affinities of the zzso for the two zzso These results highlight the usefulness of this zzso approach in evaluating the selectivity of a zzso zzso and demonstrate the necessity of considering protein flexibility and zzso effects in designing new selective zzso zzso
