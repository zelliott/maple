A conservative zzso at position 374 in a zzso zzso zzso zzso switched the preferred zzso zzso from zzso to zzso To understand how selectivity was zzso zzso for 18 different zzso acids were zzso at position 374 in each of two different zzso channels zzso and zzso the host channel for zzso After injection of zzso into zzso zzso less than half of the zzso zzso expressed functional zzso In both zzso and zzso channels with the zzso zzso zzso Val or zzso expressed zzso pores while channels with the zzso polar zzso zzso or zzso expressed zzso zzso Val or zzso stabilized while zzso or zzso zzso blockade by internal zzso zzso confirming the importance of zzso interactions for zzso zzso blockade was dependent upon the charge carrier and was more effective in the presence of the zzso having the larger zzso The results are consistent with a model in which the side chains at position 374 form a filter for zzso and zzso zzso and a site for blockade by internal zzso
