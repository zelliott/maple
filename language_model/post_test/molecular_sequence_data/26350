The bovine zzso virus zzso is zzso zzso and genetically related to the zzso zzso of zzso which includes human and zzso zzso viruses and other zzso zzso associated with debilitating diseases of domestic zzso There are many parallels in the biology and zzso characteristics of zzso infections with those of zzso that make its development as a model of zzso infection and disease potentially zzso In order to obtain a better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso disease, two biologically active zzso of zzso were zzso cloned and zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the form of the zzso zzso It contains the zzso zzso structural zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, in the zzso central region, between and overlapping pol and zzso there are five potential coding regions for zzso zzso three are analogous to zzso zzso and rev in zzso and two, called W and Y, are unique to zzso There is no coding region analogous to zzso in zzso zzso comparisons of two functional zzso obtained from the DNA of cells carrying an infection from a single virus isolation indicate that the zzso of zzso is highly variable within a single biological zzso Moreover, the greatest number of zzso occur in the zzso zzso The results suggest the presence of multiple zzso which may be of significance in defining the disease potential of a zzso zzso These clones will be useful in zzso the zzso cycle and mechanisms of zzso of zzso in various animal zzso
