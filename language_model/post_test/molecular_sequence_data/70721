The three-dimensional structure of rat pancreatic zzso A expressed in zzso coli was zzso The backbone zzso of certain critical zzso are significantly different in this zzso compared to its bovine zzso However, the core structure of rat zzso A is similar to that of the other members of the pancreatic zzso zzso The structural variations within a loop bordering the active site can be correlated with the subtle differences in the zzso activities of bovine and rat zzso for different zzso The most significant difference in the backbone zzso was observed in the loop zzso This loop incorporates the zzso zzso site which is responsible for zzso A to zzso S conversion in the bovine zzso The rat zzso does not get zzso under identical zzso zzso zzso of this region of the rat zzso in the active site of zzso shows zzso zzso although the bovine pancreatic zzso A appropriately fits into this active zzso It is therefore zzso that the local zzso of the zzso zzso the specificity of zzso
