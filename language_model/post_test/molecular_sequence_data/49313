zzso processing of proteins such as the Ras zzso which contain a zzso zzso motif (where C stands for zzso a for zzso and X is one of several zzso zzso includes zzso zzso removal of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, we report the presence of two distinct zzso activities in membrane extracts from zzso zzso which are sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A protein similar to the zzso and zzso zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a hypothetical gene zzso found in zzso zzso zzso I, probably accounts for the zzso zzso An zzso of zzso the zzso responsible for the zzso maturation of Ras zzso and other zzso zzso probably accounts for the zzso activity, even though the gene for zzso has not been previously identified in this model zzso We have identified a previously overlooked gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for a zzso protein zzso with zzso sequence identity to human zzso We show that both zzso and zzso have the ability to promote production of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso in zzso and to cleave a zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are bona fide zzso zzso and support the evolutionary conservation of this zzso system in zzso
