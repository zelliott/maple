zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene and is required for its zzso The zzso and the zzso sequence of zzso were cloned successfully from the giant panda zzso zzso using zzso technology and zzso zzso they were both zzso and zzso The length of the cloned zzso zzso was zzso zzso it contained an zzso frame of 456 zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso The length of the zzso sequence is zzso zzso it contains four zzso and three zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso sequence shares a high degree of zzso with those of Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the giant panda with those of these other species revealed that the zzso of giant panda is highly zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and is zzso identical with the zzso This degree of conservation of zzso suggests evolutionary zzso zzso prediction shows that there are two zzso sites, three protein zzso C zzso sites, two zzso zzso II zzso sites, four zzso sites, two zzso sites, and one zzso protein zzso signature in the zzso protein of the giant zzso The zzso gene can be readily expressed in zzso zzso When it was fused with the zzso zzso zzso it gave rise to zzso of an expected zzso zzso in good agreement with the predicted molecular zzso The expression product obtained can be zzso for studies of its zzso
