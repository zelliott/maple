zzso are unusual DNA elements which include a gene zzso a zzso DNA zzso a DNA zzso and an adjacent site at which a wide variety of zzso resistance and other genes are found as zzso One or more genes can be found in the insert region, but each gene is part of an independent gene zzso The inserted genes are expressed from a promoter in the zzso sequences located zzso to the zzso and zzso are thus natural expression zzso A model for gene zzso in which circular gene zzso are inserted individually via a single zzso zzso event has been proposed and verified zzso The gene zzso include a gene coding region and, at the 3' end of the gene an imperfect zzso zzso a zzso zzso The zzso elements are a diverse family of elements which function as sites recognized by the DNA zzso zzso zzso of individual genes thus represents a further mechanism which contributes to the evolution of the zzso of zzso bacteria and their plasmids and zzso Members of the most studied class of zzso which include the zzso gene in the zzso zzso are believed to be mobile DNA elements on the basis that they are found in many independent locations, and a discrete boundary is found at the outer end of the zzso zzso However, the length of the zzso segment is variable in the zzso examined to date, and it is likely that this zzso has arisen as the result of zzso and deletion zzso Though the true extent of the zzso segment remains to be determined, it seems likely that these zzso are mobile DNA zzso The second known class of zzso comprises members of the zzso zzso zzso
