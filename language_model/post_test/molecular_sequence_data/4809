The final step in zzso zzso zzso of cell surface proteins consists of a zzso reaction in which zzso zzso donors are zzso for zzso signal sequences in nascent zzso In previous studies we described a human zzso cell zzso termed class K, that accumulates fully assembled zzso units but is unable to transfer them to zzso processed zzso In further work we showed that, unlike zzso zzso zzso from these cells are unable to support zzso interaction of zzso with the small zzso zzso or zzso and that the cells thus are defective in zzso In this study, using a modified zzso zzso transient zzso system in conjunction with a composite zzso prepared by zzso extension of an existing zzso zzso we found that the genetic element affected in these cells zzso to the human zzso of zzso a gene affected in a zzso zzso strain exhibiting similar zzso of zzso donors without zzso zzso gives rise to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso both zzso a protein of 395 zzso acids that varies in cells with their ability to couple zzso to zzso The gene spans approximately 25 zzso of DNA on zzso zzso zzso of class K cells with zzso zzso their zzso of zzso precursors and restores zzso processing of zzso zzso Also, zzso restores the ability of zzso from the zzso cells to yield an active zzso in the presence of a zzso which is considered to be an intermediate in zzso by a zzso
