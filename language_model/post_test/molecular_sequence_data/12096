To select the gene coding for an zzso zzso an zzso dependent strain zzso zzso was transformed with a zzso zzso zzso library, and colonies growing at a low zzso concentration were zzso zzso sequencing of the responsible zzso insert revealed the presence of a previously zzso zzso zzso open reading frame of zzso II with zzso to known zzso zzso extra dosage and zzso zzso of this gene were constructed in a strain lacking the general zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso was measured during growth in synthetic complete zzso The following observations prompted us to name the gene zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso while the zzso of 8 other zzso acids was zzso or slightly zzso Introduction of zzso on a zzso zzso leading to a gene dosage of two or slightly more, caused a 50% increase in zzso zzso and a smaller increase for zzso and zzso However, when the 29 zzso zzso of the zzso copy of zzso were zzso the cells more than doubled the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso while no or little increase in zzso was observed for the other 8 zzso zzso
