A computer program for predicting DNA zzso from zzso sequence was used to identify circular structures in zzso and cellular zzso An zzso pair circular structure was located in a control region near the center of the zzso of the human zzso virus type I zzso This unusual structure displayed relatively smooth zzso zzso throughout its zzso The structure is zzso in diverse zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which implies that it is under selective zzso A search of all sequences in the zzso data base was carried out in order to identify similar circular structures in cellular zzso The results revealed that the structures are associated with a wide range of sequences that undergo zzso including most known examples of DNA inversion and zzso zzso zzso zzso structures were also associated with replication and zzso systems where DNA looping has been implicated in the generation of large zzso zzso Experimental evidence for the structures was provided by studies which demonstrated that two sequences detected as circular by computer zzso formed zzso closed circles during zzso reactions in zzso when compared to zzso fragments, bent fragments with zzso shapes, and total zzso zzso In addition, a single zzso substitution in one of these sequences rendered it less zzso as seen by computer analysis and significantly reduced its rate of zzso zzso These results permit us to speculate that zzso circular structures facilitate DNA looping during formation of the large zzso complexes that are involved in zzso and zzso zzso and in other zzso zzso
