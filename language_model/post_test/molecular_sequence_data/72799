Many zzso regions in human zzso have been identified, while there are only a limited number of reports for amplified genes in a single zzso We recently isolated four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 500 zzso of zzso artificial zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso base pairs and had about zzso zzso with the corresponding sequence of mouse zzso We report here the structure of human zzso zzso and we report that the amounts of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were elevated in zzso with the zzso
