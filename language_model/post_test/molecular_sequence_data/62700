The mechanisms by which zzso factors, which are not themselves tissue zzso establish zzso patterns of zzso in zzso are zzso Nor do we understand how zzso cues are integrated to provide regionally distinct zzso of gene expression within the developing zzso We describe regulation of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a regulatory zzso light chain of the zzso apparatus in cardiac zzso This gene is expressed from the onset of cardiac differentiation in the zzso zzso and is expressed throughout all the zzso both before and after heart chamber zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we have identified an 82 zzso zzso within the zzso promoter region of the gene that is necessary and sufficient for zzso expression of an zzso zzso This zzso is composed of two zzso sites and a composite zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso site is essential for zzso expression and that zzso expression also requires the presence of at least one adjacent zzso zzso The overlapping zzso site within the zzso appears to act primarily as a zzso of zzso zzso although it may also have a positive zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso promoter drives pan zzso expression of a zzso in mice, despite the more restricted patterns of expression of zzso zzso zzso We speculate that a common regulatory mechanism may be responsible for zzso expression of zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso of which could have given rise to more restricted patterns of expression within the heart of higher zzso
