zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is an zzso dominant disorder characterized by zzso zzso of zzso cells in pulmonary zzso which leads to elevated pulmonary zzso pressure, zzso heart failure and zzso zzso zzso in the bone zzso protein type II zzso gene zzso have been found to zzso a majority of zzso zzso More than 140 distinct zzso have been identified in zzso cases and in idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso cases, but only one zzso has been reported in Chinese zzso 

A zzso pedigree of zzso and another 10 patients with zzso were zzso In the family, two of the 9 surviving and one deceased family member were diagnosed as zzso The entire zzso region and zzso boundaries of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso using DNA samples from affected zzso zzso sequencing of zzso products was performed on both the sense and zzso zzso To confirm the segregation of the zzso within the family and exclude the presence of the zzso in normal subjects, the relevant zzso was amplified by zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso 

In the Chinese pedigree with zzso an zzso transition at position 1157 in zzso 9 of the zzso gene was identified which resulted in a zzso zzso We confirmed the segregation of the zzso within the family and excluded the presence of the zzso in a panel of 200 zzso from normal zzso No zzso was detected in zzso in the other 10 patients with zzso 

This zzso acid substitution occurs at a zzso acid that is highly zzso in all type II zzso zzso The nearly zzso zzso forms an zzso pair with an zzso zzso at position zzso thereby helping to stabilize the large zzso zzso of zzso at position zzso is the most frequently observed zzso zzso in zzso but until now no zzso at position zzso have been found in zzso The predicted functional impact of the zzso zzso and its absence in healthy controls support the zzso as the cause of zzso
