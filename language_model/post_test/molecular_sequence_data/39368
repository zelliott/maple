The zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso during zzso was observed by using zzso of zzso region of zzso to the green fluorescent protein zzso A fusion with a putative zzso motif zzso formed a fluorescent ring around the zzso of the wild type strain, as expected from the known location of the intact zzso in the dormant zzso zzso formed a similar fluorescent ring around the zzso of the zzso zzso which has a severe zzso in the coat structure, and of the zzso zzso which lacks a zzso zzso unique to the spore zzso zzso whereas the fusion could not attach to the spore of the zzso zzso By contrast, a fusion without the motif zzso could not be recruited around the zzso of the zzso zzso though it appeared to be accumulated on the outside of the spore of the wild type zzso Since zzso was shown to degrade only the zzso with zzso zzso these results suggested that a proper zzso of zzso requires a strict interaction between the motif of the zzso and the zzso structure of the cortex, not the formation of normal coat zzso
