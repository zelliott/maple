A gene zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso an unusual type of zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence exhibits similarities to the sequences of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and higher plants and also exhibits similarities to the sequences of putative zzso proteins in other bacterial zzso Here, we studied the effect of zzso gene zzso on the zzso zzso protein expression zzso Total zzso zzso proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and the results revealed that six proteins of the wild type were not detected in the zzso zzso and that nine proteins observed in the zzso zzso were zzso in the wild zzso zzso analysis showed that the integral outer membrane protein zzso was larger and had a more zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which is consistent with the theoretical change in zzso for zzso not processed at the zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight data indicated that in addition to zzso the zzso protein may serve as a zzso for zzso processing by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso provided strong evidence that the observed effect on proteins depended on zzso of the zzso gene zzso We show that zzso in zzso zzso is involved in the processing of proteins such as zzso and zzso and that zzso of zzso has a zzso effect on zzso protein zzso To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of both a zzso zzso and different zzso proteins in a zzso zzso
