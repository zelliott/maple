We have isolated three zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors from the zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and we have studied their expression patterns in the developing and adult zzso This analysis showed that zzso and zzso zzso with zzso delineate the zzso divisions of the zzso zzso and that zzso exhibits a typical and specific zzso of expression in the zzso and zzso zzso The expression patterns of these three zzso when compared in details with those of their zzso zzso reveal both zzso and differences in the basic organization of the developing zzso and zzso zzso
