zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role in cell zzso zzso and in an early stage of zzso Despite the characterization of the zzso zzso extensive study in aquatic organisms has not been carried out so zzso Here, we performed the molecular and zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to understand its zzso properties and zzso zzso The olive zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso and encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of 86 zzso All the characteristic zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso hands, an zzso zzso region, and a C2 zzso were found to be present in zzso The zzso expression analysis of zzso showed that zzso is predominantly expressed in the brain, eye and heart zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was noted to be zzso and zzso The structural features and zzso characteristics of zzso were found to be similar to those of zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of the expression analysis and zzso characterization of zzso zzso
