In humans, the gene for the V zzso domain is produced by the zzso of one of 40 functional V zzso segments and one of five functional J zzso zzso We have zzso the sequences of these zzso segments and of zzso rearranged V zzso genes to determine the repertoire of main chain zzso or zzso structures, they zzso Over zzso of the sequences zzso to one of four zzso structures for the first zzso binding loop zzso and one zzso structure for the second zzso binding loop zzso zzso diversity produces some variation in the length of the third zzso binding loop zzso and in the identity of zzso at the V zzso zzso zzso However, this is limited and zzso of the rearranged sequences zzso to one of three known zzso structures for the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso structures selected during the primary response are zzso during affinity zzso the key zzso that determine the zzso of the zzso binding zzso are zzso or undergo conservative zzso The implications of these results for immune recognition are zzso
