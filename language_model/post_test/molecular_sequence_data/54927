The innate immune response provides our first line of zzso against zzso Over the course of evolution, pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to either avoid zzso or to limit the effectiveness of the innate immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso proteins in the zzso that contribute to immune evasion and aid the establishment of viral zzso For example, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the innate immune response against the zzso zzso the likely structure of proteins involved in immune evasion enables potential mechanisms of action to be zzso To understand more fully how zzso zzso the innate immune system we have zzso widely available zzso tools to analyze the primary protein sequence of zzso and to predict its secondary and zzso zzso We found that zzso is predicted to be almost entirely zzso and may possess similarity to zzso repeat containing zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be a viral zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso may inhibit the innate immune response by zzso interacting with its target protein and zzso the recruitment of protein zzso and/or zzso changes required for immune zzso
