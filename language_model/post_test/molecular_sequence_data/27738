The ability of zzso protein A zzso to bind to the zzso part of zzso has been used for the zzso of a number of zzso gene products as fusion zzso Both the zzso promoter and signal sequence function in zzso coli, as well as in a number of zzso bacteria, which zzso comparisons of the expressed specific products in different zzso The expression system developed for zzso coli yields zzso of the fusion protein to the growth zzso which makes zzso coli a competitive alternative to zzso bacteria for the expression of zzso zzso The human zzso hormones zzso growth factors zzso I and II were expressed using the protein A system in zzso coli and zzso zzso Despite a high degree of structural zzso large differences in the yields were observed in the two zzso This zzso the importance of investigating different bacterial hosts for a particular protein zzso
