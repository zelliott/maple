The innate immunity of zzso to microbial invasion is zzso by a network of zzso mechanisms involving both the long-lasting highly specific responses of the zzso immune system and a zzso chemical defense system based on a series of zzso zzso peptides that are analogous to those found in zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso by zzso cells of the zzso surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as by the zzso zzso of the skin reportedly cause the zzso of numerous zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso as well as of cancer zzso zzso peptides isolated from zzso have three characteristic zzso They are relatively small zzso zzso acid zzso basic zzso or zzso and zzso Although these peptides differ widely in length and zzso acid zzso they may be grouped in four broad families based on characteristic structural zzso Although the precise mechanism of action of these peptides remains to be zzso their zzso effect very likely results from their capacity to form channels or pores within the microbial membrane in order to zzso the cell and impair its ability to carry out anabolic zzso This secondary, chemical immune system provides zzso with a repertoire of small peptides that are promptly zzso upon zzso easily stored in large zzso and readily available for zzso zzso
