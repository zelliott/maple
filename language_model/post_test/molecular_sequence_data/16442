Studies of mouse models for zzso zzso have led to the identification of a zzso locus for skin tumor development zzso in the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso This zzso region shows a loss of zzso or an zzso imbalance in mouse skin and pancreatic zzso zzso and has been associated with zzso The zzso marker zzso which has the strongest linkage to skin tumor zzso was used to screen a bacterial artificial zzso zzso library, leading to the identification of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the most tightly linked zzso These genes are members of a zzso zzso that includes the neighboring genes zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in skin zzso zzso cells led to suppression of tumor growth in nude zzso The neighboring genes zzso and zzso also have potential roles in zzso and zzso tumor development, and several genes in this locus may be candidates for the zzso zzso
