zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso plays an important role in energy metabolism by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso alpha has also been identified to play a role in the zzso metabolism by zzso key zzso factors of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, we show that zzso alpha serves as a zzso for the liver X zzso zzso zzso known to contribute to the regulation of cellular cholesterol zzso In transient zzso studies, zzso alpha amplified the zzso zzso of the zzso alpha promoter in a human brown zzso line and in zzso cells via an zzso response element described zzso zzso zzso via a natural zzso response element from the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter was also enhanced by zzso alpha in a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso signature motif zzso of zzso alpha was essential for zzso of zzso zzso zzso This motif is located in the vicinity of the binding region for a putative zzso described zzso The zzso sequesters zzso alpha from zzso alpha and the zzso zzso and this zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso shown to abolish the zzso of zzso alpha by zzso zzso had only a moderate zzso effect on the zzso of zzso These results identify zzso alpha as a bona fide zzso zzso and zzso distinct zzso of zzso alpha and/or additional zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso
