zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and two zzso have been identified in the zzso of Japanese zzso zzso zzso The genes were classified into four zzso according to the similarity of the zzso acid zzso In each zzso members showed high sequence similarity not only to each other but also to zzso of other fish zzso The number of members in each OR zzso was roughly estimated to be from 3 to 10 by zzso Southern zzso zzso The genes of all four OR zzso were shown to express on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso Two major features of fish OR genes were found by comprehensive and comparative analyses on OR genes of Japanese zzso and other fish species including zzso zzso and zzso First, the zzso tree zzso of representative zzso members suggests the existence of several zzso genes common to the zzso of many fish zzso Second, when all members of zzso zzso identified in each zzso of the tree are zzso the members of a single species comprise a zzso zzso This means that zzso sequence zzso that is, zzso among zzso genes of the same zzso in a species, is higher than zzso zzso that is, zzso between zzso genes of different zzso This suggests that the zzso members of a species have evolved zzso Taken together, fish OR genes have evolved from a limited number of zzso genes common to most fish species, and several genes in a zzso have zzso evolved in each species from each zzso
