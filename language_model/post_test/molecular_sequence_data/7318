zzso are a severe and stereotyped zzso response to injury that occur in several forms of zzso that progress to zzso zzso The key zzso step that leads to zzso zzso in unknown, but zzso zzso the zzso system, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are known to zzso This study was designed to determine whether zzso is zzso locally, and in what molecular zzso and whether zzso known to promote zzso synthesis are present in the zzso zzso zzso with bovine zzso basement membrane develop cellular zzso by 14 days and zzso zzso and zzso by 35 zzso In zzso zzso was performed with zzso specific for sequences common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso or sequences specific for the alternatively spliced segments zzso zzso and zzso Throughout the time period zzso 21, and 35 zzso all zzso and zzso zzso contained cells with strong zzso signals for total and zzso zzso with the strongest signals present in large cellular zzso at day zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso abundance within zzso zzso at 35 zzso zzso deposition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso both known to promote zzso zzso were found in cellular zzso zzso 14 and zzso and were still present, but greatly diminished, in the sclerotic phase zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso predominate in cellular zzso whereas in the zzso stage, mainly the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso and zzso
