In addition to their essential zzso role in protein zzso zzso zzso participate in numerous other functions, including regulation of gene expression and zzso acid zzso via zzso zzso zzso we describe a class of zzso zzso zzso proteins based on the zzso core of the contemporary class II zzso zzso whose members lack zzso activity but are instead essential components of the first zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the function of zzso in zzso zzso was assisted by comparative zzso a technique that revealed a link between the presence or the absence of zzso and a systematic variation in the length of the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso and three other lines of evidence support the direct involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso of an zzso deletion of zzso from zzso coli (which does not possess zzso requires both zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso during affinity zzso provides evidence of direct physical zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This observation of a common protein domain linking zzso acid zzso and protein synthesis implies an early connection between the zzso of zzso acids and zzso
