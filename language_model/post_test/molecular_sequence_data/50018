The malaria zzso zzso zzso unlike its human host, zzso type II fatty acid zzso in which steps of fatty acid zzso are zzso by independent zzso Due to this difference, the zzso of this zzso are a potential target of newer zzso Here we report the functional characterization of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is soluble and zzso The zzso of the zzso for zzso was estimated to be 75 zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso exhibited negative zzso for its interaction with zzso We have also modeled zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso This model provides a structural rationale for the specificity of zzso towards its zzso zzso
