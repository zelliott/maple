zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) form a family of extensively studied zzso proteins that were already used for zzso analyses at the protein sequence level zzso In this paper we report the determination of six zzso gene sequences of zzso and two of zzso These sequences have been used with zzso zzso in zzso analyses that supported a group including zzso and zzso zzso a group of zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso and a group of zzso sequences containing the Arabian camel pancreatic zzso gene and Arabian and zzso camel and zzso zzso 1 genes of unknown zzso In all analyses the pig was the first zzso zzso This zzso tree is compatible to published trees derived from a number of other zzso The differences to those trees obtained with zzso protein sequences can be explained by the influence of convergence of pancreatic zzso from zzso camel, and zzso and by taking into account the information from third zzso positions in the zzso zzso The evolution of sequence features of zzso such as the distribution of positively charged zzso acids and of potential zzso sites is described with regard to increased zzso zzso zzso that is observed in several zzso and zzso zzso which may have no role in zzso or zzso zzso
