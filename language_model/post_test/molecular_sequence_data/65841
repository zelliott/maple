In the pol gene of bovine zzso virus zzso there is a zzso located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso that is not found in zzso pol gene and encodes a zzso zzso with zzso to zzso We have expressed two zzso IN versions that differ in their zzso zzso The longer version, containing the zzso zzso did not show any zzso zzso processing and strand transfer IN activities and performed only the zzso zzso zzso the shorter version, lacking the zzso zzso performed all three activities and is most likely similar to the viral zzso A comparison between zzso IN and the well-studied zzso zzso with zzso that mimic the zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and another bovine zzso zzso disease virus, revealed that the extra zzso sequence beyond the zzso zzso is probably less important for IN activities than the sequence upstream to the zzso
