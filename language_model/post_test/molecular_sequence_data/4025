In many zzso expression of zzso zzso can be strongly inhibited by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso The use of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies had lagged well behind its utility in lower animals because uninterrupted zzso duplexes longer than 30 base pairs trigger generalized cellular responses through zzso of zzso protein zzso Recently it was demonstrated that zzso can be made to work in cultured human cells by introducing zzso synthetic duplex zzso zzso 20 base zzso through zzso zzso We have explored several strategies for expressing similar short interfering zzso zzso duplexes within cells from zzso DNA zzso because this might allow long-term zzso suppression in cells, and potentially in whole zzso zzso suppression of target gene product levels is achieved by using a human zzso small nuclear zzso zzso promoter to drive nuclear expression of a single zzso zzso The zzso parts of the transcript consists of a 19 base pair zzso stem with the two strands joined by a tightly structured loop and a zzso 3' zzso at the end of the zzso zzso The simplicity of the zzso expression cassette and its widespread zzso in human cell types suggest that this mode of zzso delivery could be useful for suppressing expression of a wide range of zzso
