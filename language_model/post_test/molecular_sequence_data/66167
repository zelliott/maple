zzso protection zzso zzso employing zzso sets are powerful tools to simultaneously measure zzso of several different zzso We used BD zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso gene expression in brain and zzso tissue of zzso Depending on the zzso protocol used, we observed differences in the relative amounts of transcripts for zzso protein 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Isolation and sequencing of the zzso specific gene from the zzso zzso revealed two zzso insertions in the probe that are not present in the natural zzso zzso We show that these insertions cause zzso zzso degradation of the protected zzso zzso yielding a zzso indistinguishable in size from that specific for zzso thus leading to zzso of zzso expression as well as zzso of zzso gene expression zzso
