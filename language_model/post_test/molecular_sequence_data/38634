The zzso protein is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso genetic switch in zzso zzso Based on zzso acid sequence analysis alone, zzso has been assigned to the zzso family of zzso zzso We show that zzso acid zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to highly zzso members of the zzso motif of zzso zzso render zzso incapable of zzso the zzso element in zzso The zzso zzso reduced the ability of zzso to bind to zzso in zzso or in zzso while the substitution zzso resulted in a protein unable to bind independently to the half sites located at the left end of zzso in zzso zzso These data confirm that zzso is an zzso and suggest that zzso zzso has a role in binding to a specific component of the zzso zzso
