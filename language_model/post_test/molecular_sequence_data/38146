The zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso in human skeletal muscle has been associated with a pathological zzso related to defects in the zzso zzso In the best studied case, zzso zzso was not apparent in cultured zzso this observation raised the conclusion that no molecular zzso was in the zzso sequence coding for the zzso To get more insight in the zzso mechanism that is involved in zzso zzso 1 zzso we have determined the whole structure of the corresponding human zzso On the basis of the corresponding mouse gene structure and the human zzso zzso we designed long extension zzso zzso using the whole zzso DNA as a zzso zzso regions were isolated and the zzso and surrounding zzso zzso The zzso and 3' zzso of the gene were determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso 1 human gene is made up of 9 zzso and spans about 33 zzso A whole panel of zzso parameters was set and is now ready to be used for specific amplification upon patients' zzso zzso The analysis of the putative promoter sequence was zzso It revealed the presence of a zzso zzso element zzso an zzso the zzso factor, and a nuclear respiratory factor 2 zzso binding zzso These sites, according to results from literature, could be involved in the functional zzso of the gene zzso
