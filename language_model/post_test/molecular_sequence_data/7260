The gene zzso zzso translation zzso factor 1 alpha from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been cloned using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso analysis of zzso revealed eight zzso bands and suggested that zzso resides on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA sequence with the zzso sequence of zzso verified the presence of three zzso the first one occurring five zzso from the start of zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence zzso a protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing high identity to a variety of zzso zzso A strong zzso bias, similar to that observed in highly expressed zzso zzso was evident in zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter region showed some sequence similarity to the well-studied zzso promoter from zzso zzso including a region from zzso to zzso This region exhibited high zzso to a promoter upstream zzso sequence zzso in zzso zzso Such sequences have been shown to be essential promoter elements in genes coding for the highly expressed components of the zzso translation zzso
