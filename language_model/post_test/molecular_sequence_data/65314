Two zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso isolated from soil samples from zzso Republic of Korea, were studied to determine their zzso zzso The cells of the two bacteria were zzso zzso zzso straight zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that both zzso should be placed in the zzso zzso of the family zzso Their zzso zzso gene sequences showed similarities of zzso % to those of type strains of the zzso zzso The values for zzso zzso between both strains and type strains of closely related zzso species were below 34 zzso The fatty acids of the novel strains were similar to those of species of the zzso zzso Both strains had zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence, together with the zzso zzso values and zzso zzso indicated that strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, are zzso The type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
