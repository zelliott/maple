zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised of loosely zzso sequences of approximately 100 zzso acid zzso are a functional protein motif found in many zzso and zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso interact with protein zzso C zzso and that zzso zzso zzso by zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso domain interaction in zzso Using pure zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso zzso domain interacts with zzso with high affinity zzso zzso 39 zzso Unlike other tested zzso zzso zzso which binds to several zzso zzso zzso with zzso for binding to the zzso domain apparently because their binding sites on the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso The minimal zzso sequence within the zzso zzso domain was found to zzso roughly to the second and third zzso of the zzso zzso of known zzso zzso On the other hand, the C1 regulatory region of zzso containing the zzso and zinc zzso sequences was found to be sufficient for strong binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso that interacts with the C1 region of zzso inhibited the zzso domain interaction, whereas the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of zzso which has a single zinc zzso motif instead of the two tandem zinc zzso sequences present in conventional and novel zzso zzso does not bind zzso Thus, as expected, zzso domain binding with zzso was not zzso with by zzso Further, zzso that are known to attack the zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not affect this zzso domain zzso In contrast, the presence of zzso zzso of zzso induced less than a zzso increase in zzso domain zzso These results indicate that zzso binding to zzso zzso involve the zzso region of the zzso zzso domain and the C1 region of zzso and agents that interact with either of these regions zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso domain and zzso binding to the C1 region of zzso might act to regulate zzso domain zzso
