Gap junctions are among the most widely distributed cell structures involved in zzso zzso Recently completed zzso sequencing projects including species from all major zzso have demonstrated the existence of three distinct gene families, the zzso zzso and zzso as molecular building blocks of gap zzso zzso In the present study, the authors have addressed the molecular complexity of gap junction gene expression in the zzso zzso a remarkably complex sensory organ built by diverse zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso library and zzso DNA library screening and/or zzso technology, the authors have zzso in addition to the four previously reported zzso seven novel zzso and four zzso transcripts resembling two zzso zzso This result demonstrates the presence of two distinct gap junction type gene families and indicates a remarkable molecular and functional diversity of gap zzso zzso in the fish zzso
