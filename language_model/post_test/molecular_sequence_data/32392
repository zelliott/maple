The zzso of the bacterial spore zzso zzso is a crucial event in spore zzso It has been suggested that zzso and zzso which are zzso among zzso are to be considered putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, little is known about the details of the zzso process by these zzso during zzso except that zzso functions as a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso spores of a zzso zzso zzso that lacks the zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to zzso zzso were identified by zzso acid analysis and mass zzso The results suggest that zzso is most likely a zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso activity confined to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, it appears that during zzso of zzso zzso spores, zzso causes merely small and local changes in the zzso structure, which are necessary before zzso can zzso
