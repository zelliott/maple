A multiplex zzso zzso has been developed to detect and differentiate the closely related prawn zzso zzso virus zzso from Australia and yellow head virus zzso from zzso zzso using zzso to zzso sequences in the zzso gene amplified a zzso zzso region of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso using a zzso sense primer and either a zzso or zzso zzso primer to a divergent sequence zzso amplified a 277 zzso region of the primary zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso primer with a zzso zzso primer to another divergent sequence allowed the viruses to be distinguished in a single zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced detection sensitivity between zzso and zzso and zzso or zzso zzso was zzso in approximately 10 zzso zzso organ total zzso The multiplex zzso zzso was also able to zzso zzso and zzso zzso mixed over a wide range of zzso to simulate potential zzso zzso The zzso of the test was examined using zzso samples from zzso zzso prawns infected either chronically or acutely with zzso or zzso and collected at different locations in Eastern Australia and Thailand between 1994 and zzso zzso (406 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso generated in all cases, including five zzso zzso samples in which no primary zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified minor variations in the regions targeted by the zzso zzso zzso However, none occurred at positions that critically affected the zzso
