zzso of dengue virus 2 zzso to zzso zzso cells protein was zzso A 48 zzso zzso zzso cells protein zzso was detected in a virus overlay zzso zzso The binding occurred only to the zzso cells zzso protein fraction and it was inhibited by free zzso zzso was shown to bind to zzso E in the zzso studies and using mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso masses of the zzso that matched to zzso and zzso chains were zzso These findings suggest that zzso through zzso E binds directly to a 48 zzso zzso or zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso
