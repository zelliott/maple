zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso organic zzso zzso zzso are organic zzso pumps that have been linked to zzso drug zzso We previously reported the isolation of three human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study we describe the fourth zzso zzso We zzso zzso a human zzso reported to zzso a 453 zzso zzso zzso and found that it represents a fused transcript composed of zzso sequences and partial sequences of a novel zzso The complete coding sequence of this novel zzso which we designated zzso was zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in terms of zzso acid identity and sharing a common zzso in which approximately 17 zzso spanning zzso are distributed within three membrane spanning zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso expression is restricted to kidney and zzso These observations suggest that zzso may function as an organic zzso zzso involved in cellular zzso and possibly in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso Isolation of zzso helps to define the zzso zzso of zzso
