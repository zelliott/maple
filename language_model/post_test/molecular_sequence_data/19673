The zzso zzso 2A zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This study demonstrates the novel finding that both the zzso zzso and the zzso domain with zzso zzso participate in zzso 2A zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso 2A with replacement of its zzso with that of zzso 1 resulted in less effective zzso of zzso indicated by its lower zzso association rate constant compared to zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso formed complexes with zzso but at lower levels compared to that with zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of a portion of the zzso zzso suggested a role for the zzso in regulating relative amounts of zzso 2A that enter the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain with intact zzso zzso was necessary for zzso These findings indicate that the zzso and the zzso region both participate in zzso 2A zzso of zzso
