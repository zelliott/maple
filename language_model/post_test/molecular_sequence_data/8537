The zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso are probably involved in the zzso of zzso disease and several other zzso zzso To obtain a tool for studies of these zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was produced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso beta zzso molecules and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with both zzso and zzso Panel cell studies with zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso bound only to cells expressing zzso beta zzso or zzso irrespective of the accompanying zzso alpha chain zzso zzso alpha zzso or zzso alpha zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso and the broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited binding of zzso zzso mapping employing zzso with single zzso zzso of zzso beta zzso indicated that position 37 may be of some importance for zzso zzso A triple zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to bind zzso suggesting a crucial role for one or more of these zzso in the zzso However, the expression of the zzso beta chain could not be formally proved, as none of the zzso zzso recognized this zzso
