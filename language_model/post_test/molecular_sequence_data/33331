zzso are important ultraviolet light zzso in many plants and contribute substantially to the quality and zzso effects of fruits and derived plant zzso To study the regulation of zzso synthesis in fruit, we isolated and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso reporter zzso established zzso to be a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso and several other promoters of zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of its zzso zzso and confirmed the function of zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso throughout grape berry development revealed its expression during flowering and in skins of zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso of zzso and expression of zzso In addition to its zzso regulation, zzso expression was light zzso implicating zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso indicated zzso putative light regulatory units in promoters of both genes from different zzso By analysis of the zzso zzso acid zzso we identified the previously described zzso domain and an additional sequence motif zzso in several plant zzso zzso The described motifs have been used to identify zzso zzso factors from other plant species zzso involved in the regulation of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso factor controlling zzso synthesis in zzso
