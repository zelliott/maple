The effect of a zzso stretch which has the potential to form an unusual triplex DNA structure on gene expression has been analyzed by measuring the activity of zzso as a reporter gene in zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso carrying the zzso zzso which has a potential triplex DNA region expressed about twofold more zzso activity than that carrying the zzso zzso Since the expression of zzso has been shown to be affected by template zzso in zzso this in zzso observation suggests that the inserted zzso stretch zzso the zzso of zzso regions by forming unusual DNA structure to keep the template at the zzso favorable for the expression of zzso
