zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso block budding of transport zzso from the zzso zzso was cloned by zzso of the zzso zzso and encodes a zzso protein located in the zzso particulate component of cell zzso zzso is released from this particulate fraction by high salt, but not by zzso zzso or zzso Some zzso is localized to the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is incorporated into transport zzso derived from the zzso that are formed in an in zzso zzso budding zzso zzso binds to zzso a zzso zzso coat zzso as shown by the zzso interaction zzso and affinity studies in cell zzso These findings indicate that zzso associates with zzso as part of the transport zzso coat zzso zzso analysis of zzso identifies three functionally distinguishable zzso One domain is defined by the five zzso zzso clustered in the middle of zzso Each of these zzso can be zzso by the central domain of zzso expressed zzso The zzso of zzso is critical for zzso function since zzso of zzso causes a lethal zzso zzso This lethal function maps to the zzso of the zzso defining a second functional zzso A separate function for the zzso domain of zzso is shown by its ability to bind zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso engages in multiple zzso interactions both on the zzso membrane and as part of the coat of a completed zzso
