A novel zzso zzso human zzso sequence was isolated from fetal liver zzso using the zzso zzso Within this zzso was zzso an uninterrupted zzso of zzso zzso zzso a predicted zzso protein of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da and an zzso point of zzso An zzso cellular zzso motif was identified within the putative zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso with a specific zzso probe revealed differential levels of expression of zzso zzso transcripts in 35 human zzso and cancer cell lines, with strongest signals observed in fetal brain and zzso adult zzso zzso brain and zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso To reflect this feature, the novel gene was designated zzso for zzso expressed in normal and zzso zzso Furthermore, an alternative zzso event within zzso involving a 129 zzso alternative zzso zzso 43 zzso was found in fetal liver and in several human cancer cell zzso Based on the predicted zzso zzso two peptides were designed and zzso to raise rabbit zzso zzso which detected a distinct protein band of zzso zzso in Western blots of human cell zzso zzso zzso of human cells with the same zzso indicated zzso cell membrane zzso with some zzso zzso
