The heat shock promoter is useful for regulating zzso expression in small zzso zzso In zzso zzso downstream gene expression can be greatly induced throughout the body by raising the temperature from zzso degrees C to zzso degrees zzso By manipulating the local temperature within an zzso spatial control of zzso expression is also zzso One such way for inducing heat shock response in targeted cells is by using a laser zzso under the zzso In addition, random mosaic expression by transient gene expression and transplantation of the transgenic zzso into a wild type host can be considered a powerful tool for studying gene functions using this zzso In this paper, we review the applications of the zzso heat shock protein promoter as a gene expression tool and for lineage labeling and zzso zzso zzso
