To study the zzso controlling expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which appears during rat zzso zzso zzso this zzso were cloned and identified with an zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso rat zzso cells, which have been shown to possess high levels of tumor zzso was used as template to zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to protect internal zzso Two different synthetic DNA zzso were added zzso to the zzso to insure correct orientation for expression from the zzso promoter of zzso A library of 100,000 independent members carrying zzso greater than 1 zzso was zzso From this library, two apparently identical tumor zzso zzso differing only in size, were identified with an indirect zzso zzso The larger of the zzso clones identified, zzso was chosen for further zzso Interestingly, since tumor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso directs synthesis of a functional tumor zzso in the bacterial zzso The zzso sequence has been confirmed by comparison to the zzso acid sequence of tumor zzso zzso from zzso zzso
