Human zzso zzso is a zzso protein that functions as a type III sodium zzso zzso and as the zzso for zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso Human zzso zzso another type III sodium zzso zzso is a highly related protein that functions as a zzso for zzso zzso leukemia virus but not for zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to function as discrete viral receptors with unique properties presumably is reflected in critical zzso differences between these two zzso Early efforts to map the zzso within zzso that is important for virus binding and/or entry relied on infection results obtained with zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso These attempts to zzso the zzso zzso site were hampered because they were based on zzso not zzso zzso and therefore, receptors that bound but failed to facilitate virus entry could not be distinguished from receptors that did not bind zzso Using a more accurate zzso model for zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso we have identified zzso domain one zzso of the human zzso zzso as being important for zzso binding and zzso
