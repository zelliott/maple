zzso virus zzso zzso was isolated in 1961 from zzso mice at zzso field station, zzso zzso zzso Attempts to zzso zzso within a recognized zzso of the zzso have generated contradictory zzso Studies by different researchers suggested some similarity to zzso virus and zzso virus, whereas another investigation characterized zzso zzso as a zzso virus zzso Because of the lack of consensus, we have conducted an independent biological and molecular characterization of zzso zzso growth zzso reached maximum yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic zzso pattern of viral protein zzso Interestingly, zzso did not induce zzso zzso effects in zzso cells until 4 days zzso and generated viral plaques only after 8 zzso We determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso by using a combination of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies zzso and zzso A unique zzso sequence of zzso zzso containing 185 zzso including the 90 genes zzso in all zzso was zzso zzso has an interesting panel of open reading frames zzso related to the evasion of host defense, including two novel genes zzso zzso zzso zzso each present in duplicate zzso zzso analysis revealed the highest zzso acid identity scores with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso grouped as an independent branch within this zzso which clearly excluded its zzso as an zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso could represent a new zzso zzso
