In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a global zzso regulator whose expression is strongly induced by zzso in zzso and remains zzso expressed in mature zzso In the present study, zzso of zzso partially suppressed zzso differentiation by zzso zzso at an early zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically bound in zzso to the promoter regions of zzso while quantitative zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso strongly affected the transient increase of zzso expression that occurs shortly after nitrogen zzso Overall, the results suggest a connection between iron zzso and zzso differentiation via zzso by modulating the expression of zzso
