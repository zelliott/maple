A novel and simple approach for rational design of zzso mimics has been zzso zzso zzso zzso structure zzso has been subjected to molecular zzso using the zzso data available on structural fragments of the zzso The analysis indicated four different low energy zzso and the spatial arrangement of terminal zzso of the zzso antennae were zzso with zzso carrying zzso by applying weak constraints between the zzso parts in zzso on a large array of zzso to zzso The five zzso exhibiting the best fit with the four minimum energy zzso of the zzso were zzso by solid phase zzso assembly using zzso zzso zzso zzso as building zzso The zzso was zzso protected zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were subjected to zzso analysis for zzso and in order to investigate the zzso zzso of the zzso bonds to zzso The zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of zzso protein to zzso from zzso zzso They were found to be weak zzso showing no indication of zzso interaction with the zzso zzso
