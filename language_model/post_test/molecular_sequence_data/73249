We recently found that zzso domain 2 zzso 2) of zzso zzso exhibits cryptic zzso zzso In order to locate the zzso site, a number of synthetic peptides which represents the primary structure of the zzso 2 domain were characterized as to their ability to decrease the zzso of zzso melanoma cells to zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is situated between the previously identified adhesive sites, zzso and II, decreased the cell zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso activities of zzso showed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be indispensable for the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso activity is closely associated with the zzso zzso that is usually buried within the zzso 2 domain structure because of its zzso zzso
