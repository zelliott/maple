zzso expressing two reporter genes and a variable gene junction were used to study zzso virus zzso zzso zzso scanning for the zzso start signal of the downstream gene zzso We found that zzso could scan the template efficiently as long as the initiating zzso of zzso zzso zzso was preceded by the zzso zzso region zzso zzso and the last 3 zzso of the upstream gene end signal zzso 3' zzso The end of the leader sequence zzso zzso which precedes zzso could also be used for zzso zzso but this sequence was considerably less zzso zzso the distance between zzso and zzso (up to 200 zzso led to the progressive loss of zzso zzso in which half of zzso expression was lost for each 70 zzso of intervening zzso Beyond 200 zzso zzso expression was lost more zzso Our results suggest that there may be two populations of zzso that scan at gene zzso which can be distinguished by the efficiency with which they can scan the zzso template for zzso
