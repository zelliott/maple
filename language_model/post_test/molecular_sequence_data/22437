zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequences of the cloned genes revealed the close relation of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The consensus sequences for coordination of the metal zzso found in zzso were also zzso in the gamma zzso of zzso Here, we showed that the zzso contained one zzso atom per zzso zzso zzso zzso spectrum suggested that the zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso signal characteristic of zzso zzso which closely resembled that of the zzso zzso Mass zzso for the zzso zzso containing the zzso motif of the zzso gamma zzso indicated that the zzso zzso at position 131 was zzso oxidized to a zzso zzso From these results, we concluded that zzso and zzso form a novel zzso and/or zzso protein family having zzso modified zzso zzso
