The purpose of this investigation was to develop specific zzso zzso to rat zzso zzso zzso and to use the zzso zzso to further characterize rat zzso Five zzso corresponding to different regions of rat zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were chemically zzso by solid phase methods and zzso to zzso by reverse phase high performance liquid zzso The synthetic peptides were coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso production was monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso showed zzso with the entire rat zzso zzso however, the extent of the zzso of each zzso with rat zzso was dependent on the zzso state of rat zzso zzso directed to zzso acids zzso showed the best zzso toward each of the zzso states of rat zzso zzso zzso generated to the entire rat zzso protein specifically recognized the zzso zzso acid sequence but showed limited zzso with synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso of rat zzso zzso to zzso acids zzso of rat zzso were specific for zzso as demonstrated by their recognition of rat zzso mouse zzso and human zzso and by their lack of zzso with rat zzso zzso and growth hormone and with a series of other synthetic peptides to rat zzso and rat zzso zzso The zzso of human zzso was restricted to zzso zzso directed to zzso acids zzso of rat zzso The chemically zzso peptides representing various regions of rat zzso did not show significant interactions with zzso zzso and zzso directed to the peptides failed to interfere with the binding of either rat zzso or human zzso to zzso zzso In zzso we have generated a series of zzso zzso for studying the structure of rat zzso The sequence zzso zzso acids zzso of rat zzso was shown to make up at least part of an zzso for rat zzso and to be a region of significant structural zzso with mouse zzso and human zzso
