The T cell receptors zzso in zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso T zzso zzso from two zzso zzso usage was found in V zzso zzso zzso V zzso and J zzso but not in J beta segments or N zzso V beta segments from zzso zzso 4 were zzso and not associated to a particular donor or fine zzso suggesting involvement in recognizing the zzso zzso In contrast, preferential V alpha usage was associated with particular individuals and fine zzso indicating distinct V beta and V alpha recruitment and contribution to zzso zzso zzso beta motifs and J alpha zzso even from different donors, limited zzso diversity, suggesting that zzso usage was determined by the zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso were selected differently at various levels, as indicated by the following zzso Four zzso with similar fine specificity had identical beta and unrelated alpha zzso Similar alpha were associated with unrelated beta zzso and vice zzso zzso using V beta zzso 4 did not globally show zzso predominance of other zzso zzso V alpha 7, one of the preferred V alpha zzso was always associated with V beta zzso other than zzso Sometimes, a zzso showed zzso in elements of one chain to a second zzso or group of zzso and to another in the other zzso These results are best explained by differential selection of zzso elements by different zzso providing a key to the inner structure of zzso zzso zzso
