A zzso designated zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso was isolated from bitter zzso zzso The procedure comprised affinity zzso on zzso blue zzso zzso zzso on zzso S and gel zzso on zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso exhibited marked similarity to that of the zzso zzso zzso previously isolated from bitter zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso translation in a rabbit zzso zzso system with an zzso of 400 zzso a potency lower than that of the previously reported small zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso which also exhibited an abundance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso reacted positively in the zzso zzso yielding a band similar to that formed by the small zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso
