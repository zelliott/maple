A mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was established against a new type of zzso zzso isolated from zzso of zzso zzso zzso The chemical structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had been previously zzso The specificity of zzso was determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be directed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also showed zzso with the stage specific embryonic zzso zzso the zzso being defined to be the zzso terminal zzso zzso On zzso examination, zzso predominantly stained the zzso the external surfaces of worms which have a brush zzso zzso Based on the zzso findings for the zzso liability as to organic zzso and the results of Western zzso analysis of the zzso zzso it was proved that the zzso in the zzso were zzso Considering that the zzso is in direct contact with its zzso tissue through the zzso the membrane surface of which is exposed to the external environment, it is suspected that zzso and zzso on the zzso play functionally important roles in the host zzso zzso
