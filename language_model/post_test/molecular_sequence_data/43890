We isolated and characterized the human zzso protein zzso gene zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is directed from a core promoter found within the first 325 bases of the zzso zzso The zzso gene promoter is responsive to zzso hormone zzso zzso and efficiently zzso by zzso human zzso hormone zzso beta zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter in zzso cells revealed that responsiveness to zzso occurs in sequences zzso zzso pairs zzso of the start zzso Within the zzso region we identified a zzso hormone response element zzso located from zzso to zzso base pairs relative to the zzso start zzso The zzso zzso is composed of two directly repeated consensus zzso separated by a zzso pair space zzso The zzso zzso forms specific complexes with zzso We have shown that a gene active in the zzso zzso and zzso is responsive to zzso zzso may play a role in the regulated transport of substances into the zzso fluid and ultimately the zzso
