zzso plays an important role in growth and development of zzso In the present study, the characterization of the first fish zzso zzso zzso salmon zzso is zzso The zzso gene consists of four zzso spanning a region of 9 zzso that zzso the 214 zzso zzso zzso While the zzso acid sequences of fully processed zzso of salmon and zzso species are very similar, the zzso sequence deviates extensively in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso initiation site of the zzso gene was localized within a 30 zzso region employing zzso Using zzso zzso zzso it was demonstrated that the zzso gene has a relatively strong promoter that contains zzso regulatory zzso
