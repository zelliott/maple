The zzso zzso assembled in zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 2 domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso are composed of zzso zzso neutral and zzso charged zzso After zzso zzso liberation of the zzso from the zzso zzso the zzso mixture was resolved by zzso on zzso zzso zzso mapping of the resulting mixture by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso of the charged species consisted of a series of zzso possessing molecular masses that were consistent with a range of zzso zzso zzso with zzso representing the major zzso The remaining material in the charged fraction contained identifiable zzso zzso that were one or two zzso units zzso and one to four zzso units longer, than those present in the above range of zzso Treatment of the native charged zzso pool with alkaline zzso did not result in zzso zzso showing that zzso are not zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso led to a decrease in the size of all charged zzso by one zzso zzso providing zzso Following this zzso treatment with alkaline zzso resulted in size decreases that were equivalent to the loss of one zzso group from each zzso This demonstrates that all charged zzso isolated contained zzso in zzso bonds to two zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso zzso cells possess the capability of assembling zzso zzso having the zzso zzso present in zzso linkages with two zzso zzso These zzso like the neutral zzso contain considerably smaller amounts of zzso than zzso present in other strains of zzso
