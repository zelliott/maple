Mouse zzso type IV and human zzso proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the zzso zzso The proteins were expressed as full-length zzso as judged by zzso in zzso zzso They were identified by zzso and zzso with zzso against zzso peptides and, for zzso against a zzso zzso In these zzso both proteins gave zzso principally on zzso Both proteins were active zzso zzso zzso a variety of zzso zzso In fresh extracts both proteins contained zzso as shown by Western blots with zzso zzso zzso zzso could be achieved readily using zzso exchange zzso and the zzso zzso zzso could be further zzso to zzso using an zzso zzso Both zzso required a zzso metal zzso for zzso At low zzso of zzso (2 zzso and with zzso II as zzso both zzso were activated by zzso or by zzso No major differences in zzso properties were found between the two isolated zzso in zzso The zzso properties of zzso may be due to its different zzso location, or to the presence of an zzso inhibitor of zzso that does not inhibit zzso or to altered zzso such that it can zzso a unique zzso which is not zzso by zzso
