zzso zzso zzso is the most common form of inherited zzso with an approximate zzso of 1 in zzso individuals zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 1 zzso gene are responsible for about zzso cases of zzso dominant zzso The zzso gene is specifically expressed in the zzso layers of the zzso zzso and encodes a predicted protein zzso by the presence of two zzso zzso zzso known to be implicated in zzso zzso We identified and zzso both in human and in zzso a novel zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso because of its significant sequence similarity to the zzso gene zzso The sequence zzso between zzso and zzso was found to be mostly restricted to the DC zzso and to the zzso region, including the first 350 zzso zzso The zzso gene was also found to be zzso in distant zzso since we identified a zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso as determined by zzso reverse zzso and Northern zzso The zzso expression and the sequence similarity to zzso render zzso a potential candidate for inherited retinal zzso
