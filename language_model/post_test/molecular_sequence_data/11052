A second zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso encodes a precursor protein of 526 zzso acids which contains a zzso acid signal zzso and the coding region is interrupted by 11 zzso The number of potential zzso sites in this product is 12 and the greatest among that of zzso zzso Moreover, this protein shares about zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso are zzso by more than four genes including zzso and a zzso zzso of this zzso
