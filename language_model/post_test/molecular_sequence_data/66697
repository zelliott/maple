zzso are ubiquitous and essential components of zzso zzso particularly the plasma zzso The zzso zzso for the formation of these zzso species is zzso up to the formation of zzso However, a divergence is apparent in the synthesis of complex zzso In animal cells, zzso is a zzso for zzso zzso production via the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Because of the absence of a zzso zzso this essential zzso represents an attractive target for zzso zzso In common with the zzso the zzso zzso (and higher zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso However, zzso of the gene believed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso are not readily identified in the complete zzso data bases of these zzso By utilizing zzso and functional genetic approaches, we have isolated a functional zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso agents of a range of important human zzso zzso of this gene in a zzso cell line led to the synthesis of an zzso species, strongly indicating that zzso zzso activity is zzso Furthermore, the gene product can be specifically inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso functional zzso encodes an zzso that defines a new class of zzso zzso zzso The identification and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso with no zzso zzso will raise the possibility of developing zzso drugs with minimal toxic side zzso
