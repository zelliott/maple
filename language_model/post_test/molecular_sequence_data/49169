We previously showed that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and differentiation of rat zzso zzso zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a protein similar to zzso found in zzso zzso zzso This hypothetical zzso tentatively named zzso has significant similarity with zzso including zzso positions of four zzso zzso involved in the formation of essential zzso bonds in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were produced in zzso coli, zzso and analyzed for their zzso zzso Although they were less active than zzso they zzso induced zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso outgrowth by zzso was inhibited by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso via zzso of a calcium signaling zzso
