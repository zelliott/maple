A general, modular strategy for the first completely zzso synthesis of defined zzso zzso is zzso Six zzso building blocks (four zzso protected zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso were zzso to prepare zzso and zzso zzso in a fully selective zzso zzso of the zzso linkage was controlled by placing a zzso constraint on the zzso acid zzso zzso thereby establishing a new concept for zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso to form zzso acid linkages was completely selective by virtue of C2 participating zzso zzso reactions between zzso zzso exhibited sequence zzso While the union of many zzso zzso acid zzso zzso did not meet any problems, certain sequences proved not zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso building blocks to zzso zzso by addition of either one additional zzso or zzso acid allowed for zzso access to zzso as demonstrated on the example of a zzso resembling the zzso zzso Final zzso and zzso yielded the fully synthetic zzso zzso
