zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, is a critical regulator in the zzso for zzso zzso In particular, zzso is essential for the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso in the mouse zzso leads to complete failure of zzso and zzso It has been zzso that zzso functions by zzso zzso a number of important growth factors and other precursor zzso However, to date, the precise mechanism of zzso action in the zzso particularly during zzso is zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of zzso action in zzso by identifying its zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells were zzso and treated with or without zzso human zzso zzso The proteins zzso by zzso were identified by zzso fluorescent differential gel zzso The candidate proteins were validated as zzso zzso by a number of approaches, including determining their zzso with zzso in zzso in zzso cells in the human zzso A total of 18 protein spots were significantly altered by zzso treatment, 8 of which were assigned clear identities by mass zzso One of these was confirmed to be zzso a key protein involved in organizing the zzso zzso and regulating zzso zzso This study demonstrates a novel approach to identify zzso proteins of zzso zzso and provides important insight into the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso
