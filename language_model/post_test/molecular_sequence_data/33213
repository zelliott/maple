A zzso with high activity at low temperatures has great potential for feed applications, especially in zzso zzso this study used a zzso zzso and zzso zzso to clone a zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso the cause of soft rot of vegetables in the ground or during cold zzso The full-length zzso zzso included an open reading frame of zzso zzso and zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso with a 50% zzso acid identity to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained the active site zzso and HD sequence motifs that are typical of zzso acid zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and displayed the following zzso a high zzso activity at low temperatures zzso over zzso activity at 5 degrees zzso and remarkably zzso zzso zzso zzso activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 2 zzso The optimal zzso activity occurred at pH zzso and approximately 40 degrees C, and the zzso activity rapidly decreased above 40 degrees zzso When compared with zzso counterparts, the zzso not only exhibited a high activity at a low temperature, but also had a low zzso and high zzso These temperature characteristics and kinetic parameters are consistent with zzso zzso To our knowledge, this would appear to be the first report of a zzso zzso and its zzso zzso
