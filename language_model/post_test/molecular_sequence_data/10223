When treated with zzso zzso a natural zzso hormone in fishes, fully grown zzso zzso are induced to mature via the zzso of the zzso factor zzso which consists of zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso B (a regulatory zzso In contrast, zzso is unable to induce growing zzso and zzso zzso to zzso To know the reason growing zzso fail to mature upon zzso treatment, we investigated changes in the components of machinery responsible for zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso against zzso zzso B, and zzso (an zzso of zzso have revealed that the zzso of zzso and zzso are almost constant during zzso zzso B was present in mature zzso but absent in growing and fully grown immature zzso These results, which are identical to those in zzso strongly suggest that zzso B is zzso from stored zzso zzso after zzso stimulation and that its binding to the zzso zzso allows zzso to activate zzso zzso of zzso B protein induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso breakdown in growing zzso as well as in fully grown zzso indicating that zzso present in growing zzso is already zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso B zzso in both zzso and fully grown zzso These results indicate that, as in fully grown zzso growing zzso are already equipped with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and that the appearance of the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for initiating zzso zzso the zzso of growing zzso to zzso is attributable to a zzso in the processes leading to zzso B zzso which include zzso reception on the zzso surface, subsequent signal zzso zzso and zzso the stored zzso B zzso
