zzso from higher plants have not been characterized or cloned so zzso zzso is the first member of this zzso family from a higher plant and was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso based on sequence zzso with the zzso sequence of bacterial zzso particularly those that exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in leaf zzso as shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed from its zzso in zzso active form and exhibits zzso specificity for zzso but also some activity against zzso The zzso zzso was characterized zzso The results show that higher plants have zzso with properties similar to the zzso of certain zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso in which these zzso serve to zzso the plant growth hormone, zzso acid, zzso by the bacteria to colonize their host zzso As zzso is a native zzso in zzso zzso it can no longer be ruled out that one zzso for the zzso of zzso acid involves zzso by zzso
