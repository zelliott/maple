zzso virus zzso contains a zzso zzso linear DNA zzso of approximately 175 zzso pairs with terminal zzso repetitions zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence was determined for fragments from several regions of the zzso including a zzso zzso from the central potentially zzso portion and two fragments within the presumed variable zzso regions which tend to be unique to a given zzso The core sequence contains one partial and two complete open reading frames that are highly zzso and zzso with three zzso zzso within the zzso D zzso of zzso virus zzso The two zzso fragments, encompassing zzso and zzso zzso are respectively located zzso zzso internal to the left and right zzso zzso of the DNA and span the zzso zzso The sequences zzso 25 open reading frames including numerous proteins predicted to be zzso or zzso in infected zzso Several zzso unique to zzso were identified that may be involved in cell attachment, immune zzso and zzso including a novel zzso G zzso zzso In addition, several zzso zzso within the zzso regions of zzso virus DNA that function as host range or zzso factors are lacking within this region of zzso virus including the zzso growth factor, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso associated with host zzso The lack of these functional zzso could explain the characteristic attenuated zzso and limited host range of zzso
