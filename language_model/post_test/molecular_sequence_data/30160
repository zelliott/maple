The purple acid zzso and zzso belong to a diverse zzso class of zzso zzso proteins that includes zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso has been implicated in the delivery of iron to the zzso but the role of the related human type 5 acid zzso that is principally found in resident tissue zzso is not yet zzso To define further the function of this zzso we have isolated and zzso a zzso clone for type 5 acid zzso and investigated expression of its gene in human zzso The zzso clone contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 325 zzso zzso including a signal zzso of 19 zzso and two potential sites for zzso The type 5 acid zzso gene mapped to the short arm of human zzso 19 and was found to have a restriction zzso length zzso on zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso was restricted to zzso zzso and the zzso was induced greater than zzso on transformation of normal human zzso to zzso by culture in zzso zzso Type 5 acid zzso thus represents a tightly regulated system for the study of molecular events in the differentiation zzso of the normal zzso
