zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso mice, is a destructive zzso T zzso disease characterized by zzso infiltrates in the gastric zzso loss of zzso and chief cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies have indicated that a T cell response to the zzso zzso beta zzso is required for the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether a response to the beta zzso zzso is alone sufficient to induce zzso or whether other zzso factors are required, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the gastric zzso zzso beta zzso in beta zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta mice developed zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso observed as a zzso zzso was only detected in zzso mice with zzso zzso There was no apparent immune destruction of the zzso as zzso did not progress to invasion of the zzso or zzso Double transgenic mice, expressing the gastric zzso zzso beta zzso in the zzso and in the zzso were protected from both zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso beta mice appears to be dependent on a T cell response to the zzso zzso beta zzso This is the first example where an zzso initiating zzso has been expressed in another peripheral zzso zzso destruction in the stomach, but not the zzso indicates that zzso factors play a fundamental role in the development of zzso zzso
