zzso zzso is an important cellular event required to prevent zzso and initiate development of the zzso zzso zzso in all animals examined is zzso by a rise in free zzso in the egg zzso at zzso This zzso rise is crucial for all subsequent egg zzso steps, such as cortical zzso zzso which zzso the zzso membrane to prevent zzso The zzso zzso rise is primarily initiated by zzso zzso zzso zzso release from the zzso zzso The genes involved in regulating the zzso zzso release during egg zzso remain largely zzso Here we report on a zzso zzso zzso zzso bones, which is defective in the zzso zzso rise and subsequent egg zzso events, including cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that the egg zzso defects in zzso bones can be rescued by providing zzso or the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso bones is a regulator of zzso zzso release at zzso Interestingly, zzso bones zzso zzso also display defects in zzso axis formation accompanied by a zzso cortical zzso network, which is known to be crucial for zzso axis zzso We provide evidence that the impaired zzso organization is associated with zzso cortical zzso from the earlier egg zzso zzso zzso cloning of the zzso bones gene reveals that a premature stop zzso in the gene zzso zzso I zzso to here as zzso I) zzso the zzso Our studies therefore reveal an important new role of zzso I in regulating the fundamental process of zzso zzso release at egg zzso
