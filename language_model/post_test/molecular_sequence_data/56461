zzso The present review describes the results of a cloning that was successfully employed in the study of zzso nerve zzso in zzso zzso Three intermediate filaments zzso expressed by the zzso fish zzso nerve were zzso zzso By the use of this approach it was possible to resolve the controversial question of whether zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed in the fish zzso zzso zzso Moreover, as a result of the information that emerged from the zzso it was possible to raise zzso zzso zzso and successfully exploit them in order to determine zzso cell zzso lineage and zzso monitor the zzso cell response to injury of the fish zzso zzso and compare it to that of a zzso zzso
