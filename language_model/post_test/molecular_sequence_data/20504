The zzso and zzso genes are unique to zzso and are widely speculated to play a role in tuberculosis zzso However, little is known about how expression of these genes is zzso zzso the regulatory control of genes found exclusively in zzso such as the zzso and zzso gene families, may be key to understanding the success of this zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso approach to zzso zzso and zzso zzso This resulted in the identification of zzso a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso analysis confirmed that disruption of zzso reduced the expression of the zzso and zzso gene pair zzso and zzso defined the zzso zzso and emphasized the lack of global regulation of zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was investigated in the mouse model, where it was demonstrated that the zzso has minimal effect on bacterial organ zzso Despite this, disruption of zzso allowed mice to survive for significantly longer, with substantially reduced lung pathology in comparison with mice infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice with the zzso strain also resulted in extended survival times, suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso of innate immune zzso This is further supported by the finding that disruption of zzso resulted in reduced zzso of zzso zzso by infected zzso zzso In zzso we have demonstrated that disruption of a previously zzso zzso regulator, zzso results in reduced expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso
