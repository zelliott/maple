The signal recognition particle zzso is a zzso complex responsible for targeting proteins to the zzso membrane in zzso the plasma membrane in bacteria and the zzso membrane in zzso In higher plants two different zzso mechanisms have been zzso one zzso for proteins imported to the zzso and one zzso for proteins zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of the protein zzso zzso and zzso An zzso component has not been identified and does not seem to be required for the zzso zzso The zzso mechanism is known to involve zzso but an zzso component has not yet been zzso Several zzso zzso have been zzso recently, making a zzso broad zzso search for zzso zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso from 27 zzso In higher plant zzso no zzso zzso genes were zzso However, eight zzso from red algae and zzso were found to contain an zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso forms a complex in these zzso with zzso reminiscent of the zzso zzso
