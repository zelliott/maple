The expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso in the rat kidney was examined during zzso using Northern zzso analysis and zzso In zzso embryonic zzso zzso day 14 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in isolated zzso whereas zzso was not zzso zzso aligned forming cords before zzso zzso into zzso zzso In late fetal zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso cells, whereas zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation and vascular development in the zzso the effect of zzso human zzso (5 zzso was examined on rat zzso organ culture, a model known to zzso zzso in the absence of zzso After 6 d in culture in zzso defined media, zzso kidney growth and zzso were zzso DNA content was higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) than in paired control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) zzso zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation of zzso zzso cells, as indicated by an increased number of zzso and zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as assessed by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were identified and localized using zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were detected in zzso zzso whereas control zzso were zzso These studies confirmed previous reports indicating that the expression of zzso and its receptors is temporally and zzso associated with kidney zzso and identified zzso expressing zzso and zzso in zzso embryonic zzso The data indicate that zzso expression is zzso in standard culture conditions and that zzso stimulates growth of embryonic kidney zzso by expanding both zzso and zzso resulting in zzso and enhanced zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso development by promoting zzso cell zzso zzso formation, and proliferation of zzso zzso
