The identification of zzso zzso has revolutionized the zzso of zzso and has provided new insight into zzso We used zzso to investigate samples from individuals diagnosed with small round cell tumors of bone, possibly Ewing zzso but which lacked the zzso zzso zzso A new fusion was observed between zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso on the X zzso zzso results were confirmed by zzso and through cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, 24 zzso tumors were identified among a series of 594 zzso zzso Gene profiling experiments indicated that zzso cases are biologically distinct from other zzso particularly Ewing zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso is a powerful diagnostic marker for this zzso of zzso and that zzso of zzso or of truncated zzso activates S phase in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso fusion described here represents a new zzso of bone zzso caused by a newly identified gene fusion zzso
