An in zzso zzso system has been developed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using in zzso generated precursor zzso A partially zzso zzso preparation is capable of precise and accurate zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso reaction produces products having zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of precursor molecules containing deletions within the zzso regions indicates that the zzso zzso does not require intact mature zzso structure in the zzso this is in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso that has an absolute requirement for these zzso The large zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be a primary site for recognition by the zzso however, its removal affects zzso zzso Through a comparison of the structural and sequence features of the zzso zzso and the precursors of other zzso zzso zzso a common element is proposed for the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso
