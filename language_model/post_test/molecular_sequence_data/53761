The human and nonhuman zzso zzso blood group gene shows relatively large numbers of zzso differences around the zzso 7 zzso In this study we determined zzso 6 sequences for 9 zzso of common zzso and for 3 zzso of zzso to estimate zzso zzso among zzso zzso length zzso are observed in this region as a repeat appears one to five zzso From a zzso network of zzso 6 sequences of zzso blood group genes for humans, common zzso and zzso parallel zzso and/or some kinds of zzso events are predicted in the zzso zzso We also estimated zzso zzso for common zzso and zzso zzso blood group zzso these values were zzso and zzso zzso
