zzso expression of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was studied in wheat zzso zzso zzso as part of the zzso response to stem rust zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso acting resistance genes zzso and zzso Complete resistance zzso type zzso zzso by the zzso gene in zzso zzso closely zzso with the hypersensitive response of penetrated cells at early stage of the interaction, when the first zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso zzso shows intermediate resistance zzso type zzso which is not directly linked to cell zzso In both cases, the plant response included a rapid increase in zzso activity between 24 and 48 h after zzso One main zzso zzso zzso of zzso was present in both lines, as shown by zzso zzso Two additional minor zzso (32 and 23 zzso were detected only in zzso and only at later time zzso Increased zzso activity and the appearance of new zzso in the resistance lines was preceded by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, there were no changes in zzso activity or zzso A high zzso level of zzso activity was observed in all wheat zzso zzso studies indicated the presence of a class II zzso of 26 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts was detected before the pathogen penetrated the leaves through zzso and approximately 16 h before the typical hypersensitive response was observed, indicating that zzso for defense gene zzso were zzso by the host plant long before a tight contact between the pathogen and a host cell is zzso A zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso walls, strongly induced zzso We discuss the possible role of the zzso in the early zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance in zzso
