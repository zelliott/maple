The zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with their corresponding zzso end of the viral DNA zzso were examined to define functional group zzso of zzso zzso recognition and zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into the zzso zzso to produce conservative modifications in the surface of the major and/or minor grooves to map the zzso contacts required for zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso CA zzso 4 and 3, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 5) were replaced with base zzso in plus and/or minus zzso For each zzso similar major and minor groove contacts were identified in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Overall, zzso in the minor groove resulted in a greater decrease in zzso activity than the major groove zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso we observed an increase in the zzso activity with an zzso substitution at position 3 of the minus zzso zzso may act to destabilize zzso base pairing and in doing so provide these zzso with a more favorable interaction with the adjacent zzso zzso At position 5, a substantial divergence among the three zzso was noted in the functional groups required for zzso activity, thereby supporting the role of this position in providing some level of zzso zzso
