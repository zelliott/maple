The molecular epidemiology of a zzso cohort in a cluster of 15 villages in southwestern Uganda was investigated by sequencing part of the zzso gag gene and performing zzso mobility zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso data, obtained for 69 and 88 zzso respectively, showed that the zzso A and D viruses were present at a ratio of about zzso No other zzso were zzso Thirteen zzso of 59 zzso for which both gag and zzso data were obtained appeared to be zzso Although both zzso A and D viruses were present in 13 of the villages, their distribution was zzso for example, from zzso data 59% of zzso A viruses were found in the eastern villages, compared with only zzso of zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gag sequences showed a total of five clusters supported by zzso zzso values above or close to zzso Four clusters were sexual partners, but there was no known sexual contact between the persons in the other zzso The DNA sequences showed between zzso and zzso divergence from the cohort zzso A or D consensus zzso The sequences were not closely related to those published for other zzso A or D zzso
