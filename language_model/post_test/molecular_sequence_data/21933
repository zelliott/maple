The zzso complex is required for the assembly and maintenance of the central zzso during late zzso and the completion of zzso It is composed of two copies each of the zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso family), and the zzso zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we are investigating the structural features of the interactions between zzso and zzso motor domain zzso of zzso and zzso We have calculated zzso averaged zzso maps of zzso decorated with zzso motor domain in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used statistical difference mapping to compare these maps among each other and to related maps obtained from zzso decorated with a zzso zzso motor domain from zzso zzso zzso we found distinct structural features in zzso complexes that may directly relate to the functional properties of zzso and zzso Furthermore, we investigated the location, structure, and function of a highly zzso extension of approximately 50 zzso unique to the zzso zzso located in the motor core zzso zzso
