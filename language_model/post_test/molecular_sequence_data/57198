zzso zzso II zzso zzso which activates zzso and zzso by a zzso mechanism during the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso from zzso zzso It is a single zzso chain of zzso zzso and contains zzso as a zzso bound prosthetic zzso zzso II charges itself with zzso but not with the zzso analogue zzso acid via a specific zzso group at the expense of zzso zzso of zzso II with zzso acid in zzso linkage took place, however, only when zzso zzso I zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso In the additional presence of zzso zzso zzso was formed on zzso zzso The latter compound was also formed when chemically zzso zzso acid zzso was added instead of zzso I and zzso zzso This indicates that zzso acid zzso is a free intermediate in the reaction and that charging of the zzso and zzso of zzso are both zzso by zzso II rather than by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid and zzso A, zzso or zzso reacted with zzso II, zzso and zzso with formation of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was zzso which indicates structural constraints in the zzso of free zzso of zzso acid with zzso zzso Such constraints obviously require structural similarity of the artificial zzso to a zzso acid zzso formed on the zzso surface in the course of the zzso Since free zzso A was not involved in the charging of zzso acid or in zzso formation, the zzso group of the zzso zzso is most likely the primary zzso of zzso acid (or zzso in the initiation of zzso zzso zzso
