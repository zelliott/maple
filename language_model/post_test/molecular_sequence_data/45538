The complex mechanism of cell division in zzso is not completely fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in the progression through the cell zzso The zzso proteins were first described as components of the cell cycle machinery in zzso and their action has been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso In the present work we identified zzso a member of the zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the three forms of zzso zzso By using zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activities were zzso The zzso activity level varies depending on the stage zzso being lower in zzso and thus suggesting that different stages have different zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso activities were inhibited by using zzso a known zzso zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated that in the zzso stage, zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was able to rescue the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The functional zzso between the zzso proteins of two evolutionary distant organisms supports the role of zzso as a key regulator in zzso zzso cell zzso
