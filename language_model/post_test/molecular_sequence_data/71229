zzso of zzso zzso by Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells has not been previously zzso However, we observed that zzso cells adhere to one another upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso suggesting that the cells express zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso product with zzso zzso to the zzso domain of human zzso was amplified from zzso zzso A second zzso product amplified from these cells has zzso zzso to the zzso domain of human zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso domain of human zzso Western zzso indicates that zzso cells express a zzso protein recognized by zzso zzso and a zzso protein recognized by an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso of zzso cells was tested by measuring the zzso of zzso zzso across zzso zzso cell zzso by microscopic examination of the cells, and by zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced within 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso which functionally couple to protein zzso C zzso In contrast, zzso cell zzso is not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso which functionally couple to other zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso on the plasma membrane of zzso cells following zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso by removal of zzso zzso abrogates zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso Our demonstration that zzso of only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the unique responses of cells to zzso or zzso zzso stimulation may involve zzso zzso
