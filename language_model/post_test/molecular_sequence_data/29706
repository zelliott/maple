zzso contain a number of zzso zzso binding sites that control zzso binding zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso bind to distinct sites on zzso and can have opposing effects on zzso zzso These effects are presumably brought about by zzso of the shape of the zzso binding zzso To gain insight into the nature of these structural differences, we zzso the zzso zzso binding site with an zzso library of unparalleled zzso A zzso zzso library containing six random zzso acids and the zzso motif present in seven different registers was used to select for zzso that exhibit zzso binding to zzso zzso The library was used to select for peptides that bind to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso were identified which bound selectively in each zzso The zzso peptides had a range of zzso with the only obvious consensus involving a motif that had four zzso zzso bonded in a zzso zzso Interestingly though, the zzso peptides exhibited a well defined consensus motif containing zzso As a first step toward understanding the structural basis for this zzso solution zzso structures were obtained for representatives of both sets of zzso All peptides formed turns, with the zzso motif at the zzso The zzso peptides contained a unique basic patch that zzso from the base of the zzso
