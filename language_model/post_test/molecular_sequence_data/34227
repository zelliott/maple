zzso within the zzso family have been shown to possess inherent stability, making them attractive scaffolds for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic zzso Given its remarkable stability to zzso the zzso zzso zzso B1 was employed as a scaffold to create a large zzso library displayed on the surface of zzso zzso A library exceeding zzso zzso was constructed by zzso seven zzso acids within a loop of the zzso B1 scaffold and screened using zzso cell sorting to identify zzso zzso specific for the active site of human zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited high zzso affinities in solution and slow zzso rates and were able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso inhibitor remained intact after a 2 h incubation both with zzso and with zzso demonstrating that zzso the zzso B1 sequence did not compromise its stability zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced affinity for zzso when compared to the same seven zzso binding zzso constrained by a single zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso libraries derived from the zzso B1 scaffold can yield zzso protein zzso that retain the remarkable zzso resistance associated with the parent zzso More generally, this strategy may prove useful in the development of stable zzso zzso suitable for in zzso zzso
