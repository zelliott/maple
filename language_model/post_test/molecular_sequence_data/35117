The zzso of zzso and zzso is a common mechanism used by many tumor cells to inactive the zzso tumor zzso zzso promoting cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso has emerged as a validated therapeutic strategy for treating zzso with zzso zzso Small linear peptides mimicking the zzso zzso of zzso have been shown to be potent zzso zzso The potential therapeutic use of these zzso however, is limited by their poor stability and zzso Here, we report the engineering of the zzso zzso to efficiently antagonize zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso was able to bind with low zzso affinity to both zzso and zzso showed high stability in human serum, and was zzso to zzso zzso cancer cell lines by zzso the zzso tumor zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso These features make the zzso zzso an optimal scaffold for targeting zzso zzso zzso
