zzso in zzso sorting have been implicated in Alzheimer's zzso zzso traffic is largely controlled by zzso a zzso zzso primarily by zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is selectively deficient in brain tissue from humans with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease mouse zzso zzso zzso causes an enlargement of zzso zzso enhances the zzso processing of zzso precursor protein in these zzso and reduces zzso precursor protein sorting to zzso zzso This trafficking zzso is zzso by zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso for zzso pathway, including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursor protein is zzso and interfering with this process by targeted zzso alters sorting of zzso precursor protein to the zzso zzso of zzso and enhances zzso zzso zzso In addition to establishing zzso zzso as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease, these results clarify the mechanisms of zzso precursor protein trafficking through the zzso system in normal and pathological zzso
