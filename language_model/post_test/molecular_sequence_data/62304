The main part of zzso protein degradation depends on the zzso zzso zzso degrade their zzso into small zzso fragments, some of which are zzso into the zzso zzso and loaded onto zzso class I zzso which are then transported to the cell surface for inspection by zzso A reliable prediction of zzso zzso in a given protein for the identification of zzso zzso would benefit immensely from additional zzso data for the training of prediction zzso To increase the knowledge about zzso specificity and to gain more insight into the relation of zzso activity and zzso to prion disease, we zzso sheep prion protein with human zzso and zzso zzso All fragments generated in the digest were zzso Our results underline the different zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and provide data for the training of prediction programs for zzso zzso Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of zzso zzso of two different zzso of prion protein shows that even small changes in a protein sequence can affect the overall efficiency of zzso processing and thus provides more insight into the possible molecular background of zzso variations and the zzso of prion zzso
