A new method of zzso the similarity between genetic sequences is zzso The method makes use of the finding that sequence comparisons expressed in zzso zzso form have an associated zzso zzso zzso This zzso is represented in the function zzso zzso zzso zzso where S is the zzso zzso represents the window size which is allowed to vary, N is a constant, and D is the zzso measure of zzso By comparing two sequences using this method, a zzso zzso distribution of D values associated with the zzso zzso is zzso The degree of sequence similarity is determined by the distribution of these zzso A set of sequences of evolutionary interest coding for zzso zzso and zzso zzso is compared using this zzso The results confirm evolutionary tree distances calculated using different zzso Since a zzso score can be calculated for each comparison, the method allows for the rapid identification of sequence zzso ranked according to the probability of zzso This unique zzso measure of similarity allows contrasts and comparisons between any two sequence fragments using all available order zzso
