Both zzso zzso and zzso extraction methods, combined with mass zzso generate precise zzso on binding surfaces of full-length zzso identifying sequential zzso or assembled zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso fabrication and application of affinity columns using zzso immobilized zzso with highest flexibility with respect to zzso sources and lowest sample amount requirements zzso zzso Depending on the zzso source, we made use of protein zzso or protein zzso zzso as support zzso These materials are packed in zzso tips and in combination with a zzso zzso zzso form a highly efficient zzso mapping zzso In addition to zzso zzso the influence of zzso structure modifications on zzso binding zzso could be studied in detail with synthetic zzso zzso of zzso peptides was zzso such that mass zzso analysis was feasible after a single zzso zzso zzso peptides were identified by accurate molecular mass zzso or by partial zzso acid sequence zzso In addition, charge state comparison or zzso mobility analysis of zzso zzso peptides enabled investigation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is recognized by a zzso zzso was determined as assembling an zzso motif on an zzso Secondary structure determination by circular zzso zzso and structure modeling are in accordance with the mass zzso results and the zzso behavior of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the full-length zzso
