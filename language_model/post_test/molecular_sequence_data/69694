The power of zzso zzso zzso zzso as regulatory molecules of gene expression is strongly limited by their low cellular zzso and very rapid zzso zzso This study deals with the effect of artificial zzso lipids on zzso cellular zzso and degradation in cell cultures and in human zzso At the zzso levels normally used in zzso gene regulation experiments, a zzso zzso zzso enhances the rate of zzso zzso more than 25 fold, but at lower zzso levels the effect of zzso is zzso These findings are consistent with a mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso zzso degradation by zzso is markedly prevented by zzso both in cultured cells and in human zzso Other zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso exhibit very similar zzso The relatively slight cellular toxicity revealed by zzso lipids contribute to render these molecules very suitable for zzso zzso
