We have isolated the zzso zzso human and mouse zzso of a zzso zzso termed zzso membrane protein 20 zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of human zzso and mouse zzso zzso proteins revealed a high degree of identity zzso whereas resemblance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was less zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso lack zzso regions, as do zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was low in human fetal zzso especially in the zzso In adult zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the majority of zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso which is similar to the zzso targeting signal 1 zzso for protein import into zzso zzso bound directly to the human zzso targeting signal 1 zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for its binding to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells, expressing zzso zzso revealed that zzso is localized in the zzso and in a particulate fraction containing zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso of zzso and zzso a bona fide zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence alignment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed high similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted an zzso effect on the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso system but not in the zzso zzso zzso system, suggesting that zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso removed hydrogen zzso by its zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is imported into the zzso zzso via zzso and may work to protect zzso proteins against zzso zzso Because some portion of zzso might also be present in the zzso zzso may also have a protective effect in the zzso
