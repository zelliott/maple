A zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso mapping strategy for the identification and characterization of isolated and zzso proteins is zzso The method, which employs the combined usage of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for subsequent mass analysis, is capable of rapidly and sensitively examining the components of complex zzso without any zzso or zzso separation zzso zzso sample quantities typically suffice to permit the confirmation of deduced primary structures and/or the identification of possible zzso zzso The data obtained should also prove useful for mass matching and sequence zzso searching of zzso protein sequence data bases of known zzso
