The zzso zzso receptors zzso within the Family C zzso of G zzso receptors are crucial zzso of synaptic zzso However, their closest relatives include a diverse group of sensory receptors whose biological functions are not associated with zzso raising the question of the evolutionary origin of zzso zzso Family C zzso A common feature of most, if not all, functional Family C receptors is the presence of an zzso zzso site localized within the large zzso Venus zzso zzso Here, we used maximum likelihood methods to zzso the ancestral state of key zzso in the zzso zzso pocket of a primordial Family C zzso These zzso were reconstructed in the background of the fish zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso which was not activated by zzso zzso and displayed low sensitivity toward zzso the reconstructed ancestral zzso possessed a pharmacological profile characterized by high affinity for both zzso and selective Group I zzso zzso This pharmacological zzso could be largely zzso by mutating only two zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that this primordial Family C zzso may have arisen early in zzso evolution and that it already was zzso as a zzso zzso for its later use at zzso zzso in zzso zzso
