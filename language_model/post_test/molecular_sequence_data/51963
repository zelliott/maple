Six independent DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been isolated from a library of zzso fragments from mouse zzso 1, spanning zzso bands C2 to zzso These DNA zzso have been mapped by restriction zzso length zzso analysis with respect to 12 marker zzso previously assigned to this portion of mouse zzso 1, in a panel of 251 segregating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene order and zzso distances were determined by segregation analysis to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four of these zzso map within a zzso 1 segment that is zzso to human zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses indicate that one of these anonymous zzso zzso zzso detects DNA fragments highly zzso across zzso These novel zzso zzso should prove useful for linkage and physical mapping of this zzso zzso
