The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso repeat zzso protein that carries 11 tandem zzso in the central zzso zzso in the zzso gene slightly reduced the zzso of zzso zzso on host plants and changed the bacterial zzso leading to the formation of large zzso in a minimal zzso The zzso in the zzso background required the presence of a functional zzso type III zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disappeared from the bacterial surface at the end of the exponential growth phase, when the zzso form into long zzso However, even in the late growth phase, bundled zzso zzso were still observed on the cell surface of the zzso zzso Such zzso were zzso and anchored the zzso cells in the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso accumulated in bacterial cells and did not zzso into plant cells as an zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso genes increased three- to fivefold in the zzso background compared with those in the wild zzso We propose that zzso may zzso regulate the production of zzso zzso on the cell surface of zzso zzso to disperse bacterial cells from zzso In turn, zzso may contribute to the movement of the pathogen in the plant vascular system and, as a consequence, the zzso of zzso zzso
