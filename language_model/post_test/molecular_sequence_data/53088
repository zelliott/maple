zzso zzso repair zzso is the primary zzso for the removal of ultraviolet zzso damage and bulky zzso from DNA in zzso During zzso the zzso is zzso around the damaged site, and incisions are made on the zzso and 3' sides, to release an zzso carrying the zzso zzso synthesis can then proceed, using the intact strand as a zzso The incisions zzso the zzso are zzso by different zzso zzso The zzso incision is made by a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the 3' incision is made by zzso zzso in zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso gene zzso We report here the identification of the genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso we found zzso zzso predicted to produce truncated zzso proteins in each of two zzso zzso These zzso cause defects in zzso zzso repair and hypersensitivity to zzso agents and ultraviolet light, but do not cause hypersensitivity to zzso radiation and do not impair viability or zzso zzso interacts strongly in a zzso zzso zzso with zzso indicative of the presumed requirement for these zzso to zzso to form the functional zzso The zzso zzso gene maps to zzso region zzso The zzso zzso repair gene zzso maps nearby zzso but is distinct from zzso
