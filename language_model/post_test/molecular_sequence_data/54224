zzso DNA interactions play an important role in gene zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso expressed and zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso is intimately involved in gene regulation, helping to establish and maintain zzso architecture and long-range DNA zzso In order to study the effects of manipulating long range zzso interactions in the regulation of the zzso gene zzso we targeted zzso locked zzso acids zzso zzso to a single zzso binding site at an zzso locus in human zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that this zzso zzso altered zzso and zzso zzso II binding at three separate and distinct regions in the zzso zzso This change in protein binding was associated with changes in long-range DNA interactions at the zzso locus and zzso of zzso gene zzso This study describes an efficient and convenient method to manipulate zzso structure and alter gene expression that is regulated by long-range DNA interactions without changing the DNA zzso The use of specific zzso zzso zzso may facilitate our efforts to understand the interactions between zzso architecture and gene zzso
