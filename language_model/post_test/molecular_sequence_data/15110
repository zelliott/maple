A complementary DNA zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso was isolated from cultured cells of the fall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to characterize its zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso which possessed three zzso recognition motifs zzso followed by a zzso auxiliary domain, showed significant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors important in the metabolism of zzso It was found that zzso of zzso gene expression by a zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence led to a marked increase in the production of a reporter protein and the amount of reporter transcript in the cultured zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso full-length zzso open reading frame in the cultured cells led to a decrease in reporter protein production, but the truncated zzso domain lacking the zzso auxiliary domain lost its zzso Analysis using a zzso zzso protein revealed that, unlike zzso zzso zzso most likely shuttling between the nucleus and zzso had the characteristic of being largely distributed in the zzso where it perhaps acts to reduce the amount of zzso and that zzso and zzso were related to its nuclear zzso but zzso to its nuclear zzso Furthermore, the zzso half of the auxiliary domain was also found to be related to its nuclear zzso This study indicates that respective zzso zzso of zzso play distinct roles important to its zzso distribution, and it identified unique systems for the distribution and functional regulation of the zzso family in insect cells, ones which are clearly different from those in zzso zzso
