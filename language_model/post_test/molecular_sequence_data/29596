We have isolated a complementary zzso acid clone that encodes the protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This protein has a putative open reading frame of zzso zzso acids and a predicted size of zzso zzso In addition, 2 zzso active sites, each with a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso retention signal site with a zzso motif were found at the zzso Both sites are typically found in members of the zzso family of zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was markedly increased during zzso stress induced by stimulation with calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which are known to cause an zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso We also examined the tissue distribution of zzso zzso and found pronounced expression in the fat body of zzso zzso regulation studies showed that juvenile hormone, insulin, and a combination of juvenile hormone and zzso (although not zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso A challenge with zzso bacteria also affected zzso and the effect peaked 16 hours after zzso These results suggest that zzso is a member of the zzso protein group, that it may play an important role in zzso bacterial infection of the fat body, and that its expression is hormone zzso
