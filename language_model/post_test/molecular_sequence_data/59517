zzso genes are master regulatory genes that specify the body plan and control development of many zzso organisms, including zzso We isolated and characterized a zzso designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a novel zzso zzso The zzso protein shares high sequence zzso inside and outside of the zzso with both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which together define a new class of plant zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso gene was first expressed in the zzso cell after the first zzso division of the zzso and continued to be expressed in all zzso cells until the eight-cell zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso gene showed a distinct pattern of zzso with its zzso becoming restricted to the zzso In the torpedo stage of zzso development, zzso zzso disappeared altogether but zzso later only in the zzso layer of the shoot zzso zzso in the mature zzso After zzso this zzso zzso pattern of expression was maintained in the zzso shoot zzso zzso zzso and floral zzso as well as in the young floral organ zzso Finally, zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and gradually became restricted in its expression to the zzso surrounding the zzso zzso We propose that zzso may be involved in setting up zzso boundaries of zzso information necessary for controlling cell zzso and pattern zzso In addition, zzso provides an early molecular marker for the establishment of both zzso and zzso patterns during plant zzso
