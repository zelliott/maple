To assist the establishment of platform and provide the reference standard for zzso detection in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and zzso zzso zzso in Chinese Han zzso 

The zzso repeat numbers of the 9 zzso zzso and zzso were detected using zzso and zzso gel zzso technique in 300 healthy Chinese Han zzso 

Among the 300 healthy controls, the range of the zzso zzso repeat number was 17 to 35 in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and the range of zzso zzso repeat number on zzso locus was zzso and the range of zzso zzso repeat number on zzso locus was zzso Of which, the 12 zzso repeats of zzso 9 zzso repeats of zzso 23 zzso repeats of zzso were the shortest normal repeat number, while the 41 zzso repeats of zzso 32 zzso repeats of zzso were the largest normal number that have not been zzso 

The normal ranges of zzso repeats of different zzso of zzso vary with geographical areas and zzso It might be associated with the genetic and ethnic zzso This is the first normal reference standard of zzso repeat number of these ten zzso zzso in Chinese zzso
