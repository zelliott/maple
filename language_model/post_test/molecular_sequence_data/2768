We have previously reported two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that recognize L chain zzso on zzso zzso We have generated a new zzso zzso zzso that recognizes a H chain zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in high zzso in serum of approximately zzso of zzso patients and on 84 of zzso myeloma zzso It is zzso associated with zzso zzso L zzso Furthermore, zzso bearing both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso zzso acid sequencing of H chains isolated from four zzso myeloma proteins suggests that they derive from two currently identified zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is restricted almost exclusively to zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may recognize either a zzso zzso zzso region or a variable region used late in the immune zzso zzso therefore, represents a new zzso family zzso associated with zzso specificity and having features of an zzso immune zzso
