zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with three types of zzso The zzso accepts zzso as a high affinity zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly binding to zzso and zzso To identify those zzso acids not present in zzso defining zzso selectivity of zzso radio zzso binding zzso on zzso cells were zzso It could be shown that zzso exhibited a distinct and much higher zzso to zzso acid zzso compared to zzso zzso 4 and 5 seem to be most important for zzso binding of zzso whereas position 13 was identified to be crucial for zzso affinity of zzso zzso extension zzso of zzso revealed a stabilizing effect of the zzso of zzso on the optimal zzso zzso The substitution zzso were also checked for their capacity to stimulate zzso and zzso formation in zzso zzso Compared to zzso and zzso most zzso revealed zzso reduced zzso to their lower binding zzso However, one of the zzso zzso zzso in position 5, may represent a weak zzso since this zzso was less potent in inducing second zzso than in label zzso Our findings indicate that zzso and zzso differ in terms of their requirement of the zzso acids in positions 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13 for zzso interaction with the zzso
