zzso protein zzso zzso involves a zzso process that includes translation and zzso zzso While zzso has been widely investigated, for the zzso zzso zzso limited knowledge is zzso In this study, we focused on a vital step of zzso protein zzso targeting by the signal recognition particle zzso Taking the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a template, we studied its behavior in two different zzso environments using CD and zzso zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso revealed to fold in an zzso zzso with a zzso central region extending from zzso zzso until zzso The zzso structure was subsequently included in a zzso zzso complex with the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso and further compared with the zzso structures of mouse zzso and bovine zzso zzso This allowed the determination of zzso common predicted zzso polar contacts zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso different zzso zzso between prion and zzso peptides at the zzso zzso groove, that are in agreement with each zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings provide new insights into the zzso of zzso zzso Besides they also show the role of protein zzso switches in zzso toward the zzso zzso a key event of major significance in the cell zzso They are thus of general zzso to the study of the biological function of zzso as well as other zzso
