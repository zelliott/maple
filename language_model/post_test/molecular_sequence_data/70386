zzso zzso a major zzso of the zzso cell zzso was previously recognized as existing in two major zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso version zzso in which the majority of these zzso are modified by additional zzso zzso Since zzso was first recognized in the virulent zzso strain of zzso tuberculosis and the zzso version in a rapidly growing, zzso zzso strain, it was thought that zzso capping may be a key factor in zzso In the present study, zzso from zzso zzso zzso was isolated and the zzso zzso zzso through differential zzso partial zzso and gas zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains a short zzso zzso highly zzso zzso side chains and several zzso zzso capping the zzso zzso of these side zzso Thus, zzso from zzso zzso zzso is of the zzso type, showing no major structural differences at the zzso ends from the zzso tuberculosis Erdman zzso This observation led us to examine the earlier strain and to conclude that it showed little resemblance to conventional strains of zzso zzso Thus, the absence of zzso caps may be more a feature of rapid growth than of zzso These results demonstrate that the relationship between zzso capping and disease induction is not a simple zzso However, use of a panel of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso differences between the zzso and the Erdman products, suggesting the presence of features specific to the different strains and pointing to zzso as a zzso within which further species and strain variations zzso
