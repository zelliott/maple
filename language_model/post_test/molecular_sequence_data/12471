zzso DNA zzso and zzso DNA zzso II and III comprise a distinct zzso of structurally zzso zzso within the zzso DNA zzso zzso The specificity and zzso of the viral zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso and synthetic duplex DNA zzso containing a single strand zzso zzso zzso zzso efficient strand joining on zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha S could not substitute for zzso of these, zzso and zzso alpha S were zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was unable to seal strands across a 1 zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso zzso action at a 1 zzso gap resulted in zzso of high levels of the normally zzso zzso reaction zzso In contrast, no zzso was formed at a 2 zzso zzso A native gel mobility shift zzso showed that zzso DNA zzso was capable of discriminating between zzso and gapped zzso at the zzso binding zzso The zzso was fairly tolerant of zzso at a zzso involving the zzso zzso donor zzso but was inhibited strongly by zzso at the 3' OH zzso zzso especially by zzso zzso These findings underscore the importance of a proper 3' OH zzso in zzso recognition and reaction chemistry but also raise the possibility that zzso may generate zzso during DNA repair by zzso DNA molecules with zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by several DNA binding drugs, including, in order of decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Strand joining by zzso zzso was not affected by zzso a drug that zzso zzso virus replication in zzso and which depends on the presence of zzso zzso for its zzso zzso
