zzso are defined by the presence of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose assembly into zzso requires the zzso assembly factor zzso We find that whereas zzso zzso in the zzso targeting domain zzso are the primary sequence zzso for zzso recognition, buried zzso zzso that generate rigidity with zzso are also required for efficient incorporation into zzso zzso contact points adjacent to the zzso on the zzso surface are not used for binding specificity but rather to transmit stability broadly throughout the zzso fold zzso of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, an intact zzso interface is a requirement for stable zzso incorporation immediately upon zzso zzso These data offer insight into the mechanism by which zzso discriminates zzso from bulk zzso complexes and zzso zzso for a substantial portion of the cell cycle prior to zzso zzso assembly at the zzso
