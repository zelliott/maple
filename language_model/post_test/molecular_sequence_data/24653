zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso are interrupted by numerous, short, zzso zzso segments called internal eliminated zzso or zzso zzso divide a gene into zzso destined zzso or zzso zzso are excised from zzso zzso and the zzso are spliced when a zzso zzso is processed into a zzso zzso after cell zzso In the zzso version of the zzso I gene zzso zzso between zzso during evolution has put zzso into a scrambled disorder in some but not all zzso Studies using zzso sequences to define zzso relationships among eight zzso suggests that evolution of the zzso zzso I gene proceeds by successive addition of zzso in earlier zzso species, without zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso and zzso among zzso in later zzso species produced zzso I genes with scrambled zzso zzso to zzso scrambling, additional zzso were inserted into the more recently evolved zzso Thus, zzso insertions and gene scrambling occur in a progressive manner during species evolution to produce zzso zzso I genes of increasing structural zzso
