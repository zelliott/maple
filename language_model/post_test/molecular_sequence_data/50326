Type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced by zzso of the zzso zzso We have found a total of 13 different zzso associated with type zzso zzso Analysis of the distribution of the 9 zzso zzso shows that most of these zzso cluster in three areas of the zzso All but one of these zzso involve zzso acids that are zzso between the mouse and zzso Two clusters involve the copper A and copper B binding sites, and could disrupt the metal zzso interaction necessary for zzso zzso The third cluster is in zzso I and could represent an important functional domain of the zzso such as the zzso binding zzso The deletion or zzso zzso zzso are distributed throughout the coding region and do not appear to zzso We conclude that a diverse number of zzso are responsible for type zzso zzso and many individuals are compound zzso for zzso responsible for this genetic disease zzso zzso
