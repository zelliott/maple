Development of zzso zzso colon follows a complex pattern of zzso and functional zzso zzso mechanisms and factors responsible for zzso gene expression remain to be zzso In an attempt to identify some of these factors, we examined the expression of the zzso zzso and delta zzso of the zzso binding protein zzso zzso factor gene family during zzso colon zzso Whereas zzso alpha zzso levels are reduced during the third zzso week, zzso alpha 42 and 30 zzso proteins levels decrease between zzso days 8 and zzso zzso beta zzso levels increase between zzso days 4 and 8 and remain constant zzso in contrast to a decrease in zzso beta protein levels between zzso days 11 and zzso zzso delta zzso levels increase gradually while zzso delta protein levels show variations during zzso zzso Changes in zzso DNA binding activity zzso with modifications in zzso zzso zzso By indirect zzso we show restriction of zzso alpha expression to differentiated surface zzso cells during zzso zzso zzso alpha is predominantly nuclear with some zzso zzso at all zzso zzso zzso beta and delta are both predominantly nuclear in zzso and differentiated surface zzso cells, as well as in various cells of the zzso zzso and muscular zzso Thus, specific zzso zzso are zzso regulated during zzso colon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern of expression suggests a role for these zzso factors in zzso gene expression during zzso
