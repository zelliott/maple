zzso producing zzso were isolated and selected from the environment and the alkaline zzso with superior performance for commercial exploitation were zzso 

The strain producing zzso zzso was isolated by a zzso plate and was identified by zzso and zzso tests and by zzso zzso sequence zzso To acquire the open reading frame zzso of the zzso zzso zzso designing and zzso walking method were zzso The precursor and mature zzso of the zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso After zzso of the active zzso the characteristics and the zzso ability were detected using synthetic zzso zzso as the zzso 

zzso zzso isolated was named as zzso zzso zzso after zzso The zzso of the zzso was zzso long and zzso a protein of 382 zzso acids comprised with a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso mature zzso and the zzso protein was one of zzso member of zzso zzso and designated as zzso The precursor of zzso zzso zzso into active zzso zzso by the zzso when zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso exhibited high zzso efficiency zzso towards synthesis zzso with optimal activity at 70 degrees C and pH 9 - zzso zzso was stable over a range of pH zzso to zzso and was zzso stable at 25 degrees C - 60 degrees zzso 

The high stability of zzso towards alkaline conditions zzso 7 - 10) and under temperature 25 degrees C - 60 degrees C and the high zzso efficiency suggested that the zzso would find research value and potential zzso
