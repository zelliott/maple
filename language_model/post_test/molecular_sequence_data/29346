The model zzso zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into small zzso zzso zzso which provide a zzso zzso zzso compatible with high-resolution solution zzso zzso Using zzso chemical exchange and zzso zzso zzso the interactions between zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso solutions with several zzso zzso schemes indicated that zzso is zzso interacting with the zzso region of the zzso rather than with the zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso were combined with zzso chemical exchange zzso of selectively zzso zzso zzso valuable information was obtained about the position of selected zzso relative to the zzso zzso Specifically, three main classes were zzso Class I zzso lie outside the zzso and show zzso exchange zzso but no zzso zzso Class II zzso reside in the zzso interface and show both zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso Class III zzso are embedded within the zzso core of the membrane and show no zzso exchange zzso but strong zzso zzso
