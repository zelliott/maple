The three structural zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso are zzso from zzso to zzso Although the zzso domain is not needed for zzso activity, a similar sequence has been identified previously in other zzso zzso We found this zzso zzso the LW zzso in another three human proteins that are predominantly nuclear zzso We investigated two examples to determine whether the LW motif is actually a dedicated nuclear targeting zzso However, in one of the newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso a region containing classic nuclear zzso signals zzso rather than the LW motif was necessary and sufficient for nuclear targeting in zzso zzso In contrast, human zzso does not possess an zzso and only zzso containing the LW motif were efficiently targeted to zzso Moreover, zzso in the motif could cause zzso zzso of zzso and enabled a zzso zzso for the domain based on the efficiency of nuclear zzso Finally, zzso pull-down zzso showed that the LW motif is part of a zzso zzso We suggest that the targeting role the LW motif plays in zzso arises from its more general function as a protein interaction domain, enabling zzso to bind a carrier zzso that accomplishes nuclear zzso
