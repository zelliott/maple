zzso type zzso zzso syndrome was reported to be caused by defects in zzso I zzso zzso which is involved in the synthesis of common linkage regions of zzso Recently, we isolated zzso of the zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso in this gene of a patient with zzso type zzso syndrome by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and direct zzso Two changes of G and T to A and C at 186 and zzso respectively, were zzso Then, we determined the zzso DNA sequences encompassing the zzso and zzso zzso revealing that the unaffected parents and two siblings were zzso for either one of the two different zzso and normal, while the patient had both of two different zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso clones of zzso containing the individual zzso were zzso zzso that zzso clone completely lost the activity, while zzso retained approximately 50% or zzso of the activity when analyzed with extracts from zzso zzso cells or zzso soluble zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed diffuse zzso in the zzso of zzso cells, while the wild type or zzso clones showed zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso in zzso were at least one of main molecular basis for zzso type zzso zzso
