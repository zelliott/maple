With the combined use of various two-dimensional zzso zzso techniques, a complete assignment of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso for two molecular states, zzso and zzso at the zzso group, was performed in zzso zzso A small but distinct change in the backbone zzso of the zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso was first suggested from those zzso parameters relevant to zzso such as change with temperature in the chemical shifts of the zzso zzso zzso and changes in chemical shifts and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso The solution structures of zzso for the zzso and zzso forms were then calculated using distance analysis in zzso space, based on a relaxation zzso evaluated from quantitative zzso zzso at different mixing zzso Total amounts of 93 and 105 distances were determined for the zzso and the zzso forms, zzso There were 25 zzso distances relevant to the structure of the zzso zzso for the zzso form of zzso and 43 for the zzso zzso zzso structures with the lowest target penalty function were similar between the two forms, having a zzso structure at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The local backbone zzso near the zzso however, were significantly different between the two zzso This was found to be due to a change in the zzso angle of the zzso bridge zzso zzso around zzso which closes the ring in the zzso zzso The zzso angle was about zzso degrees for the zzso form and an intermediate value of about zzso degrees for the zzso zzso
