Many environmental pollutants induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso We integrated cellular and molecular biological techniques to examine the effects of zzso zzso exposure in lake trout brain zzso distribution and zzso Over a zzso zzso real time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso results showed that zzso zzso induction in response to zzso exposure occurred rapidly and continued to rise in the zzso lake trout after 4 zzso with a peak at or after 2 zzso zzso zzso levels fell after 4 days, and this trend continued after 16 days of zzso In zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso was universally elevated in the brain of zzso fish and was mainly expressed in the zzso and occasionally in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in the zzso bulb and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Other brain areas showed zzso zzso zzso in both control and zzso zzso Some zzso fish contained zzso zzso in the brain zzso and these fish had overall depressed zzso zzso in the zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso effects of zzso exposure in the brain of juvenile lake trout is zzso
