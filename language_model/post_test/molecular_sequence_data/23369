It is believed that most modern zzso lineages arose from a series of rapid zzso events near the zzso zzso It is shown that such a zzso makes the common ancestral zzso sequence an ideal target for zzso zzso suggest that with methods currently available, we can expect to get zzso of the bases correct in reconstructing zzso zzso regions of an zzso ancestral zzso from the zzso of approximately 20 zzso chosen modern zzso Using actual zzso sequences from 19 extant zzso we reconstruct zzso zzso of ancient zzso sequence around the zzso zzso zzso examination suggests the reconstruction is accurate and that it allows us to identify features in modern species, such as remnants of ancient zzso zzso that were not identified by direct zzso zzso the predicted evolutionary history of the bases in the reconstructed region, estimates are made of the amount of DNA turnover due to zzso zzso and substitution in the different zzso zzso lineages since the common zzso zzso showing considerable variation between zzso In coming years, such reconstructions may help in identifying and understanding the genetic features common to zzso zzso and may shed light on the evolution of human or zzso zzso
