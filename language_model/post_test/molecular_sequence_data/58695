zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the resulting zzso zzso with a second zzso zzso It belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso which catalyze different reactions which start from zzso of zzso zzso A model for the structure of zzso coli zzso zzso II, based on its zzso with zzso zzso and experimental testing of the model by zzso zzso has been used here to study how zzso controls the chemical fate of a zzso zzso zzso Because of the potential zzso freedom of the reacting zzso zzso interacting with the zzso could not be identified directly from the model of zzso Three zzso were considered as candidates for involvement in the recognition of zzso as the zzso acids at these sites in a unique zzso zzso are different from those in typical zzso which are highly specific for reaction with zzso as second zzso in preference to zzso These zzso were altered in zzso II by zzso zzso Replacement of zzso lowers the specificity by at least 1 order of zzso with minor effects on the activity or stability of the zzso suggesting that zzso contributes zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso have small effects on specificity and do affect other properties of the zzso A model for zzso interactions can be proposed on the basis of these zzso The model of zzso also explains previously reported spontaneous zzso of zzso resistant to zzso zzso which probably bind in the narrow depression which provides access to the bound zzso A role for the C zzso of the zzso zzso in determination on the reaction zzso is also zzso
