To develop a cell culture system susceptible to infection by zzso C virus zzso human fetal zzso grown in zzso zzso were zzso with serum samples from two zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were detected by zzso chain reaction, using zzso specific for the zzso zzso region of zzso in extracts prepared from the zzso cultures as early as 5 days after zzso zzso was also released from the infected cells into the zzso The zzso strains could be serially zzso three times into fresh liver cell cultures using zzso virus as zzso Evidence that zzso replication really took place in primary human fetal zzso was also obtained by detection of zzso viral zzso zzso zzso in cell extracts and of viral zzso in the infected zzso
