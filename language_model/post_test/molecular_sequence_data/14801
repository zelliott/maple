Although the importance of adequate zinc intake has been known for decades, the estimated global prevalence of zinc zzso remains zzso This zzso the need for a specific and sensitive status assessment zzso 

The objective was to evaluate zzso zinc zzso as candidate molecules with the potential of being a zzso of dietary zinc status in zzso 

A zzso zzso study with zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted in healthy men zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches including Western zzso analyses and tandem mass zzso were implemented to identify the zinc responsiveness of selected red blood cell membrane zzso 

zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso were detected in human zzso zzso No effects of short-term dietary zinc depletion were observed on the amounts of these zzso However, changes in a zzso zzso zzso by zinc depletion were identified through the zzso signals produced by an zzso zzso This response was further validated by a zzso zzso and with zzso collected from mice fed a zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso and zzso in human red blood cells implicates their role in the regulation of cellular zinc metabolism in the human zzso zzso The zinc responsiveness of membrane zzso suggests its capability to serve as a zzso for dietary zinc depletion and its involvement in impaired zzso membrane fragility by zinc zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
