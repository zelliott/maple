A new family of zzso zzso genes (called zzso for zzso that encodes peptides related to the major surface zzso zzso is zzso Members of the zzso sequence family are linked to zzso genes and are located near the ends of at least 13 zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso were present in a single population of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that multiple zzso genes were zzso Two size classes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Both sizes of zzso zzso lacked the upstream zzso sequence zzso which is found on the zzso end of zzso zzso because zzso genes must be linked to the zzso to be zzso The absence of the zzso from zzso zzso suggests that expression of zzso genes does not require linkage to the zzso zzso
