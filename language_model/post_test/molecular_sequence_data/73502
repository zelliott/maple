zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that carries out the terminal step in the electron transport zzso We have isolated the gene for this zzso previously shown to be zzso expressed from a single copy gene in the zzso and show that 167 base pairs of DNA surrounding the zzso start site contain the minimal promoter of this zzso This zzso promoter contains two zzso sites and at least one site for zzso which show binding to their zzso zzso zzso of both zzso sites eliminates most of the promoter zzso zzso at the upstream zzso site significantly reduces the efficiency of transcript initiation at the major start site and thus plays the dominant role in zzso zzso zzso is, thus, the second nuclear gene of zzso that is regulated by zzso suggesting that it is a third common factor, along with zzso and zzso to be associated with zzso gene zzso
