The zzso zzso protein represents the third member of the zzso zzso family of zzso coli that includes zzso and zzso zzso possesses a zzso at its extreme zzso but shares no additional zzso with zzso Our genetic analysis suggests that zzso acts in concert with the zzso zzso signal zzso system to augment induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthesis of zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso is essential for the observed stimulation of this zzso as zzso or introduction of the zzso zzso within the highly zzso zzso zzso abolished all inducing zzso zzso of the zzso anchor sequence also abolished all inducing zzso zzso is not an essential gene under all conditions tested, nor is it essential for zzso capsule zzso however, strong zzso leads to rapid loss of cell viability suggesting that the gene is normally tightly zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso message was extremely unstable but could be induced or stabilized in response to cold zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso is dependent upon both zzso and zzso and therefore we propose a role for zzso together with this zzso machine, as a novel regulator of a zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
