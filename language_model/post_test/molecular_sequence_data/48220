The zzso vaccine zzso sterile protection against zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying this are of great interest, yet little is known about the immune zzso mechanisms induced by this zzso The immune responses induced by zzso were characterized in 10 zzso zzso Several zzso in the zzso protein zzso were identified as targets of cultured zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were induced in 8 zzso this ex zzso response mapped to a single zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso were not zzso zzso zzso zzso production was universal, whereas zzso and -5 production was zzso zzso zzso responses and zzso to zzso were strongly induced in all zzso zzso waned with time but were zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso cellular and zzso zzso These results highlight possible immune mechanisms of protection and have important implications for vaccine design in zzso
