zzso zzso regulated genes for the zzso heavy chain zzso have been zzso in zzso avian and zzso species, no zzso zzso gene has previously been zzso in a species of zzso In this study, we identify two zzso regulated zzso gene transcripts (named zzso and zzso in carp zzso zzso and zzso their expression patterns during embryonic and zzso zzso The transcripts showed an identical zzso pattern of expression zzso 22 h zzso (18 degrees C incubation zzso zzso with the switch from exclusive expression of genes for zzso to expression of genes for both zzso and zzso and continuing for 2 weeks zzso No expression of these zzso transcripts was detected in juvenile or adult zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that both transcripts are expressed initially in the zzso region of the developing trunk and progress zzso Both are expressed in the developing zzso fin and zzso zzso zzso However, the muscles of the lower jaw express only the zzso zzso No expression of either transcript was detected in cardiac or smooth zzso A distinct zzso pattern of expression was observed in the zzso zzso This was shown to be caused by zzso of the zzso to the zzso regions of the zzso the sites of new zzso addition during muscle growth, suggesting transport of zzso zzso zzso The 3' untranslated region of the zzso transcript contains a 10 base pair motif zzso which is shown to be also present in the 3' untranslated regions of zzso genes from a wide range of zzso zzso reasons for the need for zzso zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso are zzso
