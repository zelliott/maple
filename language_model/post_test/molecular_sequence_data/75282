The DNA sequences at the ends of the linear zzso of 6 species of zzso encompassing 13 strains were zzso All the strains have variable numbers of a zzso repeated DNA zzso 31 zzso to 53 zzso in size, at their zzso zzso Based upon the size and zzso sequence of the terminal repeats, the zzso can be separated into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have different zzso repeats on the two ends of their zzso The only zzso feature of the zzso zzso is the presence of tandem zzso The function of the repeats might be to promote unequal crossing over during zzso thereby overcoming the problem of zzso replication for these linear zzso
