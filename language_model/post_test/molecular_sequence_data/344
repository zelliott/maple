The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents one of a long list of microbial lineages for which there have been few zzso zzso In this study, we analyze molecular data to assess the placement of a species of zzso on the zzso tree of life and we report fine structural data to provide additional information on the identity of this zzso Our zzso analyses indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso sister to the zzso zzso It also forms a sister group relationship to the zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also share fine structural zzso zzso such as zzso structure of the zzso zzso The zzso form and zzso habit of zzso zzso highlight the multiple origins of diverse body forms and multiple zzso losses within the zzso
