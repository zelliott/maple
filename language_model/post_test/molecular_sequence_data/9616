We have designed a zzso protein that is expected to zzso in the membrane to form an zzso channel with a structurally zzso zzso This should serve as a model system to study the structural requirements of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that this zzso is zzso in the zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso shows that this zzso at low zzso forms zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport across zzso zzso Our data indicate that a component of the designed zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso behaves as per zzso
