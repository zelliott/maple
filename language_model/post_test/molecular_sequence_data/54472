zzso analysis of a putative novel zzso factor zzso zzso protein designated zzso which contains two predicted zzso zzso was zzso The zzso role of the zzso zzso zzso factor has not been reported in any zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso construct revealed substantial gene expression in old leaves and induction of zzso activity by zzso and salt zzso zzso plants displayed a markedly enhanced leaf zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso expression of the zzso gene was very significantly influential in zzso parameters including zzso content, membrane zzso leakage and the expression of zzso zzso Although the seed zzso rate was improved under zzso and saline stress conditions in the zzso plants, decreased salt tolerance was evident compared with the wild type and zzso zzso interference lines during later zzso growth when exposed to long-term salt stress, indicating that zzso protein is able to zzso regulate stress zzso Furthermore, zzso protein activated the zzso of a reporter gene in zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso was localized in the zzso of transgenic zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso functions in the leaf zzso process, with the zzso stress response implicated as a putative potential zzso zzso
