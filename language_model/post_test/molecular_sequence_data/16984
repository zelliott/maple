We have previously reported that the zzso restriction zzso of a zzso degrees zzso strain zzso which acts as an zzso because of being zzso degrees , changes its zzso mobility when the strain zzso with a certain group of zzso strains zzso In this study, we found that the zzso strain being zzso degrees was not essential for this phenomenon and also that the altered form of the zzso contained zzso in place of zzso Furthermore, we observed conversion of zzso to zzso in the cross in which a zzso zzso strain was zzso with a representative of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, when this zzso strain was zzso with a zzso zzso strain, the zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso indicating that conversion of zzso to zzso had taken place in the course of zzso From all these zzso we conclude that there is a group of zzso zzso strains that carries zzso that zzso conversion of a zzso cassette of the mating partner to alpha zzso cassette and that this mating type cassette conversion takes place in all three mating type zzso zzso zzso and zzso if the zzso are in the zzso zzso
