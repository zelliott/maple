The zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso regions have been cloned from zzso zzso delta H and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso genes have DNA sequences that are 57% identical and zzso zzso with zzso acid sequences that are 57% identical and zzso similar, with calculated molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to initiate 10 zzso upstream from the zzso translation initiating zzso and to generate a zzso transcript approximately 1 zzso in zzso This transcript was zzso at all stages of zzso zzso delta H growth in batch cultures but was found to increase in abundance from the earliest stages of exponential growth, reaching a maximum level at the zzso growth zzso For comparison, zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso delta H that encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Wolfe, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was included in this zzso The zzso transcript was found similarly to be zzso and to be approximately 1 zzso in zzso but, in contrast to the zzso transcript, the zzso transcript was present at maximum levels at both the early and the zzso growth zzso
