A number of protein sequences deduced from the molecular analysis of plant zzso or zzso libraries can be grouped in relation to a defined number of zzso zzso located in distinct positions of their zzso This is the case for a group of around 500 zzso from different species that contain a small domain (less than 100 zzso acids zzso displaying a pattern of zzso in a specific zzso The plant sequences containing this motif belong to proteins having different functions, ranging from storage, protection, zzso zzso and zzso transfer, to cell wall zzso The zzso motif zzso appears to be a structural scaffold of zzso zzso regions connected by variable zzso as observed by three-dimensional structure zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso would form a network of zzso bridges necessary, for the maintenance of the zzso structure of the zzso together with the central zzso core, while the variable zzso would provide the sequences required for the specific functions of the zzso
