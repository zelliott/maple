A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso domain of the slow zzso zzso channel, zzso has been incorporated into a zzso zzso and its zzso properties studied using zzso zzso The zzso following zzso is found to be dependent on the nature of the zzso zzso When the zzso is conducted by zzso evaporation from a methanol solution, zzso comprised of zzso are zzso and their concentration is essentially zzso with zzso By contrast, when zzso is used, the initial zzso of the zzso is zzso This then zzso to an equilibrium state between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso conversion rate is relatively slow, and this allows the zzso to be studied by zzso zzso The reverse process is much slower but again can be demonstrated by zzso Thus, it appears that a true equilibrium structure can only be achieved by starting with zzso in the zzso zzso We believe this result should be of general zzso for zzso zzso zzso The implications for zzso changes in membrane proteins are zzso
