zzso zzso from cultured tomato cells is a member of the zzso zzso zzso It is, however, distinguishable from zzso zzso from zzso zzso a typical zzso of the zzso zzso family, by its CD spectrum in the zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso the base specificity of zzso zzso and to study the role of zzso in zzso zzso which is considered to zzso to the base recognition site zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso at the 44th position were expressed from zzso cells with the same expression system as zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with four extra zzso acid zzso at the 2nd zzso acid zzso of mature zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso from zzso cells to give a yield of 10 zzso and zzso zzso culture zzso zzso The expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same characteristics as native zzso zzso in the CD spectrum and specific zzso This is the first example of the expression of plant zzso from microbes and in sufficient amount to perform further zzso zzso The base specificity of zzso zzso was zzso acid preferential and that of zzso was changed to a more zzso acid preference as compared to that of zzso zzso These experiments showed that zzso of zzso zzso is crucial for base recognition as the case of zzso in zzso zzso and also suggested that the base recognition mechanism of zzso zzso is very similar to that of zzso zzso
