It was shown previously that zzso coli zzso zzso in a highly selective manner recognizes and binds zzso zzso related to the zzso region of the zzso DNA strand of bacterial gene zzso The zzso cover the zzso box with zzso zzso up to the zzso zzso These affinity zzso inhibit competitively the zzso of bacterial DNA carried out by zzso coli zzso zzso The present work has demonstrated that zzso coli zzso zzso is not capable of binding the zzso zzso to the affinity zzso related to the zzso area of the zzso promoter, but binds the zzso which are complementary to the zzso The zzso with a high affinity for the zzso coli zzso zzso strongly inhibit zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso of zzso groups to the zzso of the affinity zzso and zzso provides their zzso binding to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso It was shown that the modified affinity zzso zzso is zzso bound to the zzso while the modified affinity zzso zzso is zzso bound to the zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso It is suggested that the affinity zzso can be transcribed from the zzso DNA strand in the region of the open complex and functions presumably as a primer which is zzso later from the nascent zzso or as a regulator of zzso
