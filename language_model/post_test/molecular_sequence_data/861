The zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its downstream factors zzso and zzso are zzso with different zzso in zzso cell lung cancer and zzso predict clinical response to zzso zzso The present study compared the zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso in primary tumors with the one in corresponding zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sequencing of zzso gene zzso 18 to 21, zzso gene zzso zzso and 61 to 68, and zzso zzso 15 was done on 96 paired samples of primary lung zzso and corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, comparative zzso zzso analyses in two pairs of corresponding primary and zzso tumor samples with zzso zzso zzso status were zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were observed in 7 zzso 36 zzso and 2 zzso patients, zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso were observed in two patients with an zzso zzso zzso in primary tumors and zzso zzso zzso were identical in 1 of 7 zzso patients in case of zzso and 11 of 36 zzso patients in case of zzso One patient zzso different zzso zzso in primary and corresponding zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso analysis revealed similar patterns of zzso changes, strongly supporting a common zzso origin of primary tumors and zzso 

The possibility of differences in the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso between primary tumors and corresponding zzso zzso zzso should be considered whenever these zzso are used for the selection of patients for zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
