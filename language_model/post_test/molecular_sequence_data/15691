zzso are characteristic structural arrangements of zzso DNA sequences that abound in regions with relevant biological zzso These structures are highly zzso differing in the number and polarity of the zzso loop zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso species present in solution strongly influence the zzso of the zzso Recently, we reported the synthesis and structural studies of new zzso forming zzso zzso in which the zzso and/or the zzso of four zzso strands are linked together by a zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso having the sequence zzso are able to form parallel zzso characterized by a remarkable high zzso zzso We report here an investigation about the influence of the reduction of the zzso size on the zzso zzso and stability of the resulting zzso using a combination of circular zzso zzso CD melting, zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and molecular modeling zzso We found that all zzso zzso regardless the zzso size and the structural orientation of the zzso zzso formed parallel zzso The molecular modeling studies appear to be consistent with the experimental CD and zzso data revealing that the zzso formed by zzso having the longer zzso zzso are more stable than the corresponding zzso having the shorter zzso zzso The relative stability of zzso was also zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
