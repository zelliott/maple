zzso is an zzso zzso protein from the plant pathogen zzso zzso that can trigger a zzso response in a number of host plants including zzso zzso belongs to a novel family of zzso zzso with the charter member of this family being the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has a very stringent zzso zzso catalyzing a single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso by zzso zzso at zzso zzso The structure is composed of a central zzso zzso with zzso packing on both sides of the sheet to form a zzso zzso The core of this structure resembles the zzso zzso zzso The similarity includes the zzso active site zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso hole zzso zzso Based on zzso with inhibitor complexes of the zzso zzso we propose a model for the zzso mechanism of zzso A deep and positively charged pocket zzso and a neighboring shallow surface zzso likely bind to zzso acid and zzso zzso in the zzso located two zzso and three zzso zzso N terminal to the zzso site, zzso Further implications about the specificity of plant pathogen recognition are also zzso
