zzso zzso receptors constitute a zzso family zzso zzso expressed in discrete zzso and spatial patterns within the nervous zzso The receptors are critical for proper signal transmission between zzso and their zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso gene expression have not been completely zzso but clearly involve regulation at the level of zzso We previously identified a novel zzso pair zzso zzso regulatory element in the promoter region of the rat zzso zzso zzso This zzso element interacts specifically with zzso proteins enriched in nuclear extracts prepared from adult rat zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and DNA zzso affinity zzso we zzso the zzso element binding activity approximately zzso Analysis by zzso gel zzso revealed the presence of four zzso in the most zzso zzso ranging in molecular masses between 31 and 114 zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that one of the zzso is the bovine zzso of the zzso regulatory factor, zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso interacts directly and specifically with the zzso zzso In addition, mobility shift zzso using an zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso or an zzso related zzso in nuclear extracts prepared from brain zzso We zzso that the interaction between zzso and the zzso element is critical for proper expression of the zzso zzso zzso
