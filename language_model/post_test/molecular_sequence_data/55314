Many recent studies on zzso have shown how zzso not always captures the true diversity of zzso with cryptic zzso often being discussed in this zzso Here, we show how diversification patterns can be very different in two zzso of closely related zzso in the zzso zzso stressing the risk of using zzso substitution rate values across zzso On the one hand, the zzso zzso species complex, endemic to the central zzso Peninsula, shows zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso Peninsula shows an enormous zzso zzso with 15 described zzso The zzso complex, however, zzso faster zzso and this could be explained by the harsher environmental conditions to which it is zzso detected in this study, that is, zzso and slightly poorer zzso with lower pH values than those of the other species in the zzso These extreme conditions could be at the same time limiting zzso evolution and thus be responsible for the observed zzso stasis in this zzso zzso zzso species from the zzso zzso Peninsula, although still inhabiting harsher milieu than other earthworm groups, have had the opportunity to evolve into a greater zzso zzso An attempt to zzso species within this group following the recently proposed general mixed zzso method showed a higher number of entities than expected under the zzso concept, most probably due to the low zzso of these animals, which considerably limits gene flow between distant zzso zzso but also because of the decoupling between zzso and genetic evolution in the zzso zzso
