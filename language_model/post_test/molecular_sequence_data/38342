The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso in various zzso of serially sacrificed zzso monkeys zzso zzso in order to zzso the zzso of the virus and to evaluate the relationship between viral expression and the zzso or cellular immune response during zzso Six zzso monkeys infected with zzso were sacrificed 6, 12, and 35 days and 3, 6, and 26 months after zzso and 20 zzso and zzso were collected from each zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso were performed with gag and tax zzso zzso DNA was detected by zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of monkeys sacrificed 6 days after zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of monkeys sacrificed 12 and 35 days and 3, 6, and 26 months after zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was detected by zzso in the zzso of two monkeys 8 to 12 days after zzso and in the zzso and zzso zzso of the monkey sacrificed on day zzso In this animal, scattered zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by in zzso zzso in frozen sections of the zzso around the zzso centers and close to the zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity was evaluated at various times after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses were detected 2 months after infection and remained zzso zzso When Tax peptides were used, this response appeared to be directed against various Tax zzso Our results indicate that zzso monkeys represent a promising animal model for studying the early events of zzso infection and for evaluating candidate vaccines against zzso
