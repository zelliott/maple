zzso are integral membrane proteins that partition into and shape the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso use a membrane zzso mechanism to generate regions of high membrane zzso in the zzso A zzso contains two short hairpin zzso zzso zzso which could generate membrane zzso by increasing the area of the zzso zzso Here, we test whether the short length of these hairpin zzso is required for zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of zzso 4 to resemble a typical zzso zzso that spans both zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso like wild type zzso however, they are not zzso do not partition into zzso do not zzso zzso and no longer suppress peripheral zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso length is required for zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Another membrane protein with a short hairpin zzso is zzso We show that an zzso zzso construct also partitions within the zzso in a manner that is dependent on it containing a short hairpin zzso These data suggest that a short hairpin zzso may be a general feature used by zzso proteins to partition into and shape regions of high membrane zzso
