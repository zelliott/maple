The surface of zzso zzso is decorated with a family of zzso proteins zzso that are zzso bound to the zzso of the zzso zzso Two examples zzso a protective zzso and zzso the major zzso have been well zzso We identified additional zzso and characterized a new zzso zzso as an zzso and a zzso of zzso Using zzso immobilized on a solid zzso a mixture of proteins from a zzso strain of zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso to these proteins passively protected mice challenged in the zzso with a lethal dose of zzso The zzso component of this mixture, zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso with human zzso zzso The deduced sequence from the corresponding gene showed a zzso architecture with a unique zzso region and a zzso domain consisting of 10 repeated zzso zzso nearly identical to zzso A zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction in adherence to zzso human cells and failed to bind to immobilized zzso acid or zzso known zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in an animal model of zzso colonization was reduced zzso There was no difference between the parent strain and this zzso in an zzso model of zzso These data for zzso extend the important functions of the zzso family to bacterial adherence and identify a zzso vaccine zzso
