We previously zzso an zzso protein zzso from the zzso fraction of zzso shoots zzso zzso zzso zzso Golden Cross zzso In the present study zzso clones derived from zzso zzso the zzso were isolated and zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso includes a zzso open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a single zzso species of approximately zzso zzso The predicted precursor of zzso is composed of 201 zzso acid zzso and has a molecular weight of zzso The zzso sequence of 38 zzso is zzso and may be a signal zzso for zzso of the zzso across the membrane of the zzso zzso The mature zzso composed of zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso contains a potential zzso site zzso and the zzso zzso zzso may be a signal for retention of the zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso
