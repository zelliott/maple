The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to zzso a step in zzso A zzso Surprisingly, this zzso reaction is carried out as an zzso zzso zzso In the first zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso and the zzso intermediate zzso spontaneously to the zzso zzso In the second zzso this compound is reduced to zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso The active site zzso zzso is unable to perform this reductive zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso in complex with the reaction intermediate zzso and zzso The geometry of binding suggests that reduction of the zzso double bond of the intermediate can be performed by direct zzso from zzso of zzso to zzso of the zzso supported by a zzso of zzso by zzso The binding mode of the zzso is very similar to that previously observed for a zzso to the zzso zzso zzso that introduces the zzso as final reaction product at the C zzso of zzso zzso This finding further supports our view that these zzso zzso form a protein family of zzso zzso zzso zzso which we have termed zzso zzso
