The Lewis alpha zzso zzso is known to zzso both Type I zzso zzso beta zzso and Type II zzso zzso beta zzso sequences even when these are zzso at zzso or zzso at zzso of the terminal Gal zzso These zzso sequences are ubiquitous on zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is therefore a potential candidate as a universal zzso for the modification of cell zzso We have found that a readily accessible, partially zzso zzso from human milk, which normally uses zzso (a zzso zzso as the donor for the transfer of a single zzso zzso will also transfer a zzso zzso zzso on zzso by a very large zzso demanding structure, in this instance, a synthetic blood group zzso As a demonstration of the ability of the zzso to modify zzso in a mild and specific manner, we chemically zzso the complex zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso analog where the human blood group B zzso zzso is zzso linked to zzso of zzso through an zzso zzso It is shown that, in zzso zzso zzso the zzso uses both immobilized beta zzso beta zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and renders them blood group zzso as detected by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to which the zzso is linked therefore becomes zzso attached to the zzso zzso chains of those zzso zzso of type zzso zzso with the zzso and complex donor 13 results in the zzso transfer of alpha zzso zzso zzso beta zzso to zzso zzso since the cells become zzso zzso and are zzso by the same zzso It is proposed that the zzso represents a powerful new tool with the ability to label animal cell surfaces with zzso zzso and possibly also other complex recognition zzso
