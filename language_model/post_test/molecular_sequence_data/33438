zzso samples were collected from six remote freshwater and saline lakes located at zzso of zzso to zzso m and 1,000 zzso apart within an area of zzso 1 million zzso on the eastern Tibetan zzso to comparatively assess how environmental factors influence the diversity of bacterial communities in high-altitude zzso The composition of the zzso was investigated by analysis of large clone libraries of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso estimated for the six Tibetan lakes with reference data previously published for lakes located at lower zzso indicated relatively low zzso richness in the Tibetan zzso The estimated average zzso richness in the four Tibetan freshwater lakes was only one-fifth of the average zzso richness estimated for seven low-altitude reference zzso This cannot be explained by low coverage of communities in the Tibetan lakes by the established libraries or by differences in habitat zzso Furthermore, a comparison of the zzso compositions of zzso across the six Tibetan lakes revealed low overlap between their community zzso About zzso of the operational zzso units zzso zzso were specific to single lakes, and a relatively high percentage zzso of sequences were zzso similar to publicly deposited sequences of cultured or zzso zzso This beta diversity was explained by differences in zzso between lakes rather than by distance zzso Another characteristic of the investigated lakes was the predominance of zzso zzso and zzso These features of zzso diversity may reflect specific adaptation of various lineages to the environmental conditions in these high-altitude zzso
