The zzso and zzso related zzso factor 1 zzso is a putative zzso regulator that is expressed exclusively in the zzso and is required for zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso mechanisms regulating zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a region of the promoter between zzso zzso and zzso that is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso revealed four sites of zzso interaction within this region, three of which were prominent in primary zzso zzso Analysis of these sites, using zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso and another unknown factor bound within these zzso Further zzso zzso of various zzso promoters established the functional relevance of the zzso and unknown zzso zzso while studies of zzso expression in zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso supported the in zzso importance of zzso zzso As a whole, these studies identify zzso as an important regulator in the zzso zzso machinery that is responsible for robust expression of zzso in the zzso
