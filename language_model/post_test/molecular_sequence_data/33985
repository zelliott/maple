When not transporting zzso zzso is zzso by binding of a tail region to the motor zzso but the mechanism of zzso is zzso We report the crystal structure of a motor domain zzso in complex with its tail domain at zzso zzso and compare it with a structure of the motor domain alone at zzso zzso These structures indicate that neither an induced zzso change nor zzso blocking is the cause of zzso Instead, the tail zzso the motor zzso at a second position, in addition to the coiled zzso This zzso zzso by zzso at two positions, prevents the movement of the motor zzso that is needed to zzso the neck zzso and release zzso zzso This zzso mechanism could extend to some other zzso
