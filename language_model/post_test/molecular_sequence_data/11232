The zzso cycle constitutes the principal route of CO2 zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso purple zzso Most of the zzso of the cycle are found to be zzso by zzso zzso Despite some conservation of the internal gene arrangement zzso gene clusters of the various organisms differ in size and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso are more strictly regulated than those of zzso zzso The major control is exerted by the zzso zzso which codes for a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This gene is typically located immediately upstream of and in divergent orientation to the regulated zzso zzso forming a control region for both zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that additional protein factors are involved in the zzso Although the zzso zzso received by the regulatory components of the zzso is zzso still unknown, the zzso state of the cell is believed to play a key zzso It is proposed that the control of the zzso zzso expression is integrated into a regulatory zzso
