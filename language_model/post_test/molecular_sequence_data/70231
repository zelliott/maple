zzso plants made transgenic to express the wild type tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso gene were not resistant to zzso However, transgenic plants containing essentially the same zzso but with an additional zzso that would terminate translation in the middle of the zzso zzso were highly resistant to systemic infection by zzso and other zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso open reading frame zzso of the resistant plants was shown by DNA sequencing to be an zzso zzso element, which apparently inserted itself into the zzso sequence at zzso zzso sometime during the propagation of this zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of four stop zzso in frame with the zzso zzso zzso on the immediate zzso border of the IS zzso zzso effectively represents domain 1 zzso zzso zzso and a portion of domain 2 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tobacco plants had a level of resistance to zzso similar to other reported transgenic zzso zzso No zzso was detected in upper leaves of these plants at zzso zzso In addition, zzso plants were resistant to an unusually broad range of zzso including tomato mosaic virus, tobacco mild green mosaic virus, zzso green tomato zzso mosaic virus, and zzso mosaic zzso These plants were not resistant to cucumber mosaic zzso The lack of systemic infection by zzso was due to reduced zzso in zzso leaves rather than complete prevention of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
