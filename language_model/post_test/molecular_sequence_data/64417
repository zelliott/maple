To further zzso the role of zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have cloned two zzso zzso zzso of the airway zzso zzso zzso from mouse zzso and rat zzso zzso The open reading frames comprise zzso zzso acids zzso and 279 zzso The mouse AT gene was located at zzso zzso and contains 10 zzso The longer zzso which we designated zzso and zzso has a simple type II zzso protein structure, consisting of a short zzso domain, a zzso domain, a SEA zzso sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The human zzso of zzso and zzso is the human AT zzso The shorter zzso designated zzso and zzso which contains an alternative N zzso was formerly described in the rat as adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been shown to be involved in the processing of zzso zzso In contrast to the long zzso neither zzso and zzso zzso contain a zzso domain nor a SEA domain but an zzso signal zzso to direct the zzso to the zzso zzso The C zzso covering the zzso zzso is identical in both zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso of the upper gastrointestinal and the respiratory zzso also in the adrenal zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and quantitative zzso analysis revealed a complex expression pattern of the two zzso with differences between mice and zzso These findings indicate a zzso role of these zzso beyond adrenal zzso
