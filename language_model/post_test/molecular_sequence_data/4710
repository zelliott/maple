Although zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso is often detected in zzso studies, the zzso gene has rarely been zzso Here, I present the zzso sequence of the zzso gene from two species of field zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso protein is suspected of being under balancing zzso zzso analyses support the conclusion that these sequences are truly cricket zzso The cricket zzso acid sequences are compared to sequences from other zzso to determine zzso zzso that may be essential for the function of the zzso Such analysis is necessary as there is no zzso structure of the zzso zzso In addition, the compositional bias of cricket zzso is different from the other animal zzso genes characterized to zzso
