For zzso insects there has been an explosion of zzso and zzso information thanks to large zzso sequencing zzso zzso insects, although zzso many important species, have been far less zzso The migratory locust zzso zzso a zzso zzso is one of the most infamous agricultural zzso They undergo a well-known and profound phase transition from the relatively harmless solitary form to a ferocious gregarious zzso The underlying regulatory mechanisms of this phase transition are not fully zzso but it is undoubtedly that zzso are zzso However, zzso research in zzso is hampered by the absence of zzso zzso 

Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso databases from zzso zzso were zzso Using zzso tools, we searched these zzso databases specifically for zzso zzso Based on known locust zzso zzso we confirmed the sequence of several previously identified zzso precursors zzso zzso zzso which consolidated our zzso In addition, we found two novel zzso precursors and zzso the zzso unknown zzso zzso Besides one of the known zzso zzso this zzso contained an additional zzso zzso Using zzso precursors from zzso zzso as a zzso we succeeded in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso which until now had not been identified in zzso or in any other zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the zzso hormone precursor and the zzso zzso translation of the predicted zzso in neural zzso was confirmed with mass zzso zzso 

In this study we describe the zzso of 6 novel zzso precursors and the zzso they zzso from the migratory zzso zzso zzso By combining the manual zzso of zzso with experimental evidence provided by mass zzso we demonstrate that the genes are not only transcribed but also translated into precursor zzso In addition, we show which zzso are zzso from these precursor proteins and how they are zzso zzso
