The zzso machinery in the zzso cells of the zzso intermediate zzso is primarily dedicated to the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Transfer of the animal to a black background stimulates the production of these peptides and causes a dramatic increase in zzso zzso zzso To identify genes involved in the zzso and regulated release of zzso hormones, we zzso screened an intermediate zzso zzso library of toads adapted to a black background with zzso zzso derived from intermediate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of twelve distinct genes whose expression levels in the zzso are regulated in coordination with that of zzso Four of these genes are novel while the others code for zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso family and a zzso protein presumably involved in the assembly and/or specific functioning of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our results indicate that a wide variety of both soluble and zzso components of the zzso zzso is recruited in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
