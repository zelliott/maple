zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types and zzso in zzso and in zzso The effects of zzso were shown to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso R zzso which is a zzso zzso and provides zzso specificity in a functional zzso zzso complex with zzso Here we show that the mouse zzso contains a second gene zzso an zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso The structure of the zzso beta gene is highly similar to that of zzso zzso and zzso beta exhibits zzso sequence identity with zzso alpha at the zzso acid zzso zzso beta is zzso with zzso zzso albeit at lower levels, in zzso and in various adult zzso zzso beta transcripts are abundant in zzso and, in contrast with zzso zzso absent from skeletal zzso zzso beta expressed in zzso binds zzso with high zzso suggesting that the mouse zzso contains a second functional zzso
