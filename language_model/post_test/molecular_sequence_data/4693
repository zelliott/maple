We investigated the molecular basis for zzso zzso of the cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso alpha or its 3' deletion zzso zzso produced channels that exhibited prominent zzso zzso To identify structural regions of alpha involved in this process, we analyzed zzso alpha zzso in which one of the major zzso zzso of alpha was replaced by the corresponding region from the skeletal muscle alpha zzso (which lacks zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso or the zzso loop of alpha with its counterpart from alpha had no appreciable effect on zzso channel zzso In contrast, replacing the zzso loop of alpha with the corresponding region from alpha dramatically slowed the zzso of zzso currents while preserving zzso zzso A similar but less pronounced result was obtained with a zzso loop zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso of alpha may participate in the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso the final zzso of the zzso zzso of alpha with the corresponding region from alpha completely eliminated zzso zzso without affecting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was restored to this zzso by deleting a zzso zzso acid segment from the end of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of alpha can block zzso zzso possibly by interacting with other proteins or other regions of the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that structural zzso of zzso zzso are distributed among several major zzso zzso of zzso
