zzso zzso hormone zzso a zzso produced by zzso cells in zzso zzso suppresses the synthesis of zzso zzso hormones by paired zzso Data from several sources indicate the effects of zzso are zzso at least in part, by a zzso second zzso Based on these and related findings, our working hypothesis is that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso In studies reported here, we used a zzso cloning strategy zzso followed by zzso and zzso to clone from blue crab zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed a zzso base pair open reading frame zzso a 56 zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence showed that zzso contains the signature zzso characteristic of zzso including an zzso zzso domain, a single zzso domain, a zzso domain, a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to an zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from three insect species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are similarly distributed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the three insect zzso zzso revealed the zzso transcript is expressed in zzso and several other zzso While other interpretations of the data are possible, our working hypothesis is that the cloned zzso encodes an zzso zzso
