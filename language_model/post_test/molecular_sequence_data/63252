zzso nuclear import is crucial for the function of the zzso zzso zzso in both health and zzso The zzso zzso is retained in the zzso but, on binding zzso it zzso into the nucleus and alters zzso of its target zzso Nuclear import of zzso is zzso by the nuclear import factor zzso which functions as a zzso that zzso and binds to specific nuclear zzso signal zzso motifs on cargo zzso We show here that the zzso binds to zzso directly, albeit more zzso than the zzso of zzso or zzso We describe the zzso crystal structure of the zzso complex, and show that the zzso binds to the major zzso site on zzso in a manner different from most other zzso Finally, we have shown that pathological zzso within the zzso of zzso that are associated with prostate cancer and zzso syndrome reduce the binding affinity to zzso and, zzso zzso nuclear zzso surprisingly, however, the zzso activity of these zzso varies zzso Thus, in addition to its function in the nuclear import of zzso the zzso in the hinge region of zzso has a separate, quite distinct role on zzso which becomes apparent once nuclear import has been zzso
