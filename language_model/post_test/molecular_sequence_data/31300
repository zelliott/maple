A zzso zzso zzso zzso clone was isolated from mouse zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences were, respectively, 95 and zzso zzso to those of the rat brain zzso The mouse zzso and a zzso zzso recognizing the corresponding in zzso translation product were used to compare changes in zzso zzso and protein levels during zzso zzso zzso and chronic insulin exposure of zzso zzso The respective cellular content of zzso zzso and protein were increased zzso and zzso during zzso and zzso and zzso from chronic insulin exposure of differentiated zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and protein levels zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in differentiated zzso zzso of zzso cells completely converted the native zzso to an incompletely zzso form, while increasing zzso transport rates zzso Either full zzso is not required to produce a functionally active zzso or zzso causes a unique zzso induction of the normally absent zzso zzso The changes in zzso protein expression zzso by differentiation were attributed primarily to increased rates of zzso zzso while the disproportionate changes in zzso and protein expression from chronic insulin treatment and zzso suggested these conditions increase synthesis and decrease turnover rates in regulating zzso protein zzso Although chronic insulin exposure and zzso zzso each raised the expression of zzso protein greater than zzso and zzso transport rates zzso to zzso no significant increase in the insulin responsiveness of zzso zzso or differentiated zzso was zzso Thus, the changes in the zzso zzso and protein expression observed in this study were most consistent with their being associated with the regulated expression of a zzso or low level zzso zzso
