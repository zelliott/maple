zzso are a family of proteins that catalyze long-term extension of isolated cell zzso Previously, two zzso proteins have been isolated from zzso of zzso rice, and three rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso We report here on the identification of a fourth rice zzso zzso zzso and on the expression pattern of the rice zzso gene family in zzso zzso Rice zzso genes show zzso differential expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In these zzso there is increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso regions where zzso zzso This pattern of gene expression is also correlated with zzso in zzso cell wall zzso zzso and treatment with zzso both of which promote rapid zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso before the rate of growth started to zzso Our results indicate that the expression of zzso genes in zzso rice is zzso regulated by zzso zzso and environmental signals and is correlated with cell zzso
