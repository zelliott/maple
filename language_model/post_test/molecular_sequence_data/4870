We have used zzso zzso DNA profiling to assess genetic variation in the endangered and highly zzso black zzso and the closely related zzso These species are restricted to wild populations on the Chatham Islands, off the east coast of New zzso DNA profiles revealed a remarkable degree of genetic similarity among black zzso as well as among the zzso zzso although the typical profiles of these two species were clearly zzso The parentage of two putative hybrid zzso and one putative hybrid adult was established for a zzso zzso adult male and an adult zzso female which were found zzso zzso The zzso zzso male, despite being zzso a typical black zzso was found to possess a number of zzso restriction fragments not recorded from the black robin population zzso zzso zzso These fragments were however detected in zzso zzso this bird appeared to be an F1 hybrid and his three offspring were zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of members of this family showed that the zzso zzso male had zzso b and zzso of black zzso rather than zzso zzso This indicates that the black robin adult male hybrid was the result of a black robin female mating with a zzso zzso These findings are particularly important since zzso had been used as zzso parents for black zzso as part of an earlier conservation recovery zzso The existence of any hybrids thus detected would have important implications for zzso programs generally, since may such programs are now being implemented in conservation programs zzso
