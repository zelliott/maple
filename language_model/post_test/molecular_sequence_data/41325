zzso zzso is a fundamental cellular process that is most widely used by cells to rearrange genes and accurately repair DNA zzso zzso It may result in the formation of a critical intermediate named Holliday zzso which is a zzso DNA junction and needs to be resolved to allow zzso zzso Different Holliday junction resolution systems and zzso have been characterized from all three zzso of zzso In bacteria, the zzso complex is the most important resolution zzso 

In this study, we conducted comparative zzso studies to identify a novel zzso zzso zzso which may serve as a key zzso regulator that mainly regulates the gene expression of zzso zzso in zzso On the other hand, the presence of zzso zzso in some organisms lacking zzso implied that it might participate in other biological zzso Further zzso analysis of zzso protein sequences revealed two functionally different zzso zzso and zzso Distribution of zzso is much wider than zzso Only zzso proteins may play an important role in regulating zzso gene expression in zzso Investigation of zzso proteins in zzso suggested that they may have originated from zzso proteins and evolved a new function as a specific zzso zzso in zzso Finally, additional zzso genes associated with Holliday junction resolution were zzso 

Overall, our data provide new insights into the basic mechanism of Holliday junction resolution and zzso zzso in zzso
