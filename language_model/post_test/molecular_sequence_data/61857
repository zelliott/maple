The zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is impaired in photosynthesis and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso activity is zzso and zzso core complexes fail to accumulate in zzso whereas levels of other zzso membrane proteins are zzso Northern and in zzso zzso analyses as well as studies on zzso loading show that zzso transcript levels and translation rates of zzso which belong to zzso are normal in zzso zzso zzso at 77 K is shifted from 735 to zzso zzso in zzso indicating that zzso cannot efficiently be transferred to the zzso reaction zzso zzso the zzso antenna is almost zzso zzso plants not only fail to accumulate mature zzso which contains three zzso zzso but also are characterized by reduced levels of the soluble zzso complex zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso maturation is not a secondary effect stemming from lack of zzso because the zzso zzso which also lacks zzso accumulates zzso at normal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso soluble and membrane zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were unchanged in zzso zzso These data suggest a specific role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso localized and belongs to an ancient and universally zzso family of zzso zzso previously designated as the zzso zzso zzso zzso The function identified for zzso suggests a new designation, zzso for this zzso
