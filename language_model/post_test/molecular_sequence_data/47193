We have identified a novel complementary DNA zzso corresponding to a gene zzso in the rat zzso prostate after zzso This zzso displays zzso identity with 453 zzso of a mouse zzso and zzso identity with 157 zzso of a human zzso and was named zzso for zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso is zzso zzso long and codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids that contains four potential zzso sites and three half zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be expressed at quite low levels in most rat zzso including those of the zzso zzso The kinetic of induction of zzso gene in the prostate was highly correlated to the development of zzso in the whole zzso zzso of zzso animals with zzso reversed both the process of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso did not result in an increase in the zzso zzso zzso levels when compared with the zzso zzso However, the treatment resulted in a more rapid return to intact levels in the zzso plus zzso zzso When zzso of zzso and prostate was induced in zzso by zzso it was found that zzso was only zzso in the zzso zzso zzso seems to be regulated by zzso only in the zzso Using in zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we have shown that zzso gene product is found exclusively in the zzso cells of zzso zzso Analysis by flow zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso protein did not allow us to demonstrate a direct effect of zzso gene zzso on the programmed death of the zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells by transforming growth zzso induced zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso However zzso protein has been detected by Western zzso in various cell lines such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso This would suggest that zzso gene product would be a marker for acquired zzso of these tumor zzso
