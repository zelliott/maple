zzso is the zzso zzso located on the zzso and zzso brush border zzso where it functions in zzso zzso zzso The brush border zzso zzso process is acutely inhibited by zzso of zzso protein zzso but the molecular mechanism of this zzso effect is poorly zzso We have identified two regulatory zzso zzso and zzso that interact with zzso to enable zzso to inhibit zzso The two regulatory proteins are structurally zzso sharing approximately 50% identity in zzso acid zzso It has been previously shown that when zzso is zzso into zzso zzso or zzso cells, zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso cells lacked the expression of both zzso and zzso In contrast, other cell lines in which zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso cells, expressed zzso regulatory zzso To determine their functions in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulting in zzso zzso in these zzso
