zzso zzso is a quantitative trait in human zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene determines a size zzso of the zzso which is related to zzso levels in zzso In an attempt to gain a deeper insight into the genetic architecture of this risk factor for coronary heart disease, we have investigated the basis of the zzso size zzso by zzso field gel zzso of zzso DNA employing various restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso All zzso detected the same size zzso in the zzso IV repeat domain of zzso With zzso 26 different zzso were identified among 156 unrelated zzso these zzso ranged in size from 32 zzso to 189 zzso and differed by increments of zzso zzso corresponding to one zzso IV zzso There was a perfect match between the size of the zzso DNA zzso and the size of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso DNA zzso was further used to estimate the magnitude of the zzso gene effect on zzso levels by a zzso comparison approach based on zzso zzso from 64 zzso zzso correlation of zzso zzso levels was high in zzso sharing both parental zzso zzso zzso zzso significant in those with one common zzso zzso zzso zzso and absent in those with no parental zzso in common zzso zzso zzso The data show that the zzso zzso in zzso levels is almost entirely explained by variation at the zzso locus but that only a fraction zzso is explained by the DNA size zzso This suggests further zzso relating to zzso levels in the zzso zzso
