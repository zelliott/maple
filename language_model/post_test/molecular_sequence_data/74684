Four forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one form of zzso and one form of zzso were zzso from a slightly alkaline extract of ostrich zzso zzso zzso The zzso in the crude extract were activated with immobilized zzso and then separated by affinity zzso using immobilized zzso and zzso exchange zzso One of the zzso forms of zzso zzso exhibited an unusual interaction with the highly selective protein zzso inhibitor from zzso zzso zzso zzso with other protein zzso zzso such as basic pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso soybean zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso This study demonstrated the affinity of zzso to zzso containing zzso at zzso zzso Studies of zzso specificity of zzso using oxidized zzso of insulin revealed four susceptible zzso zzso zzso zzso and, surprisingly, zzso The zzso acid zzso as well as the first 13 zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso Studies of ostrich zzso showed that it can interact with immobilized zzso in the presence of 5 M zzso This unusual characteristic is reported for the first time and suggests that zzso specificity depends on zzso zzso The kinetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso ostrich zzso zzso 4 and zzso were also zzso
