Human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to belong to type zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso expressed zzso and remained at high levels throughout the cell cycle in zzso cells when compared to the zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso During the cell cycle zzso this protein remained zzso in the zzso without significant zzso from the zzso to the zzso In addition, during the course of zzso maturation in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso levels decreased when cells stopped proliferation and zzso diminished in zzso However, its level remained unchanged during the course of zzso maturation of vitamin zzso zzso cells which still retained its zzso capacity and did not change the size of the zzso The data suggested that zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Its cellular level appeared to be under control during the cell cycle progression of normal zzso but was found to be zzso in zzso cells which may be associated with the tumor transformed cell zzso
