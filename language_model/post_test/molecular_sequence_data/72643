To identify genes involved in vascular zzso we applied differential zzso display analysis to the rat carotid artery balloon injury zzso One zzso chain reaction product showing increased expression at days 2 to 14 after vascular injury was nearly identical to the mouse alpha 1 chain of type VIII zzso a zzso zzso collagen of uncertain function expressed by a limited number of cell zzso By Northern analysis, expression of both chains of the type VIII collagen zzso zzso collagen alpha 1 zzso zzso expression was almost zzso higher than control by 7 days after vascular injury, and collagen alpha 2 zzso zzso expression reached a maximum of almost zzso above baseline by 3 days after zzso By zzso analysis, type VIII collagen expression increased in the media and zzso in a localized pattern consistent with the distribution of activated zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso expressed higher levels of type VIII collagen in response to serum and growth factors, notably zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso significantly less to type VIII collagen than to type I collagen zzso and showed greater zzso migration (by zzso on type VIII collagen than on type I zzso We zzso that increased expression of type VIII collagen by zzso after zzso injury may contribute to vascular zzso through the promotion of zzso zzso
