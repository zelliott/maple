zzso 5 zzso is a dominant zzso component of the zzso stage of zzso zzso and is highly zzso in human zzso Although the diagnostic value of zzso has been thoroughly zzso there has been little progress in its molecular characterization and the understanding of its biological zzso In the present study, the zzso gene was cloned by reverse zzso on the basis of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso The zzso sequence indicates that zzso is zzso as a single zzso chain that is afterwards processed into single zzso 22 and 38 zzso zzso Whereas the 22 zzso component contains a highly zzso zzso motif that may help to zzso zzso in the host tissue surrounding the zzso the 38 zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The sequences in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso and critical zzso zzso involved in zzso formation, are well zzso but the zzso zzso zzso is replaced by zzso Since there are no significant chemical differences between the O gamma atoms of these zzso we performed a series of zzso zzso to find out whether zzso is a zzso zzso Neither zzso activity nor binding to zzso zzso could be detected using the native zzso zzso Thus it may be possible that zzso possesses a highly specific zzso zzso or, more zzso that zzso folding has been recruited to zzso novel zzso
