The zzso protein is required for the zzso of a variety of genes in the zzso zzso zzso In a search for proteins involved in the activity of the zzso zzso we identified four zzso genes in which zzso reverse the temperature sensitivity caused by the zzso zzso We report here the molecular characterization of zzso in one zzso zzso the previously identified zzso zzso The zzso protein has been implicated in both zzso regulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed most aspects of the zzso zzso zzso but did not suppress the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso suppression is by restoration of zzso zzso Our evidence suggests that suppression by zzso is unlikely to be due to increased stability of zzso zzso zzso despite the observation that zzso affected zzso of zzso zzso We report here that attenuated zzso activity strengthens zzso zzso activity, whereas increased zzso activity further zzso zzso zzso activity, suggesting that zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso for zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we find that zzso zzso zzso in zzso
