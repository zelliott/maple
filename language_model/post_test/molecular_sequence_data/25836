zzso of laboratory mice bearing a zzso deletion of some T cell zzso V beta genes have proven useful in a variety of studies of T cell zzso zzso Analysis of genetic crosses between deleted and wild type strains can provide information about the relevance of genes located within the deletion to specific T cell zzso zzso techniques for zzso offspring of such crosses usually involve flow zzso analysis which may not be available to all zzso Recent zzso sequence data indicate the presence of two restriction zzso site zzso in the closely linked V beta 1 gene which discriminate between deleted and zzso zzso zzso of a DNA segment containing the diagnostic sites by zzso chain reaction followed by restriction zzso zzso of the product offers a simple and rapid method for zzso zzso
