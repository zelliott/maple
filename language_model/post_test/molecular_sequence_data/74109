We cloned complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and kidney tissue of the black zzso zzso zzso zzso Black zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso base pairs zzso and encodes a protein of 261 zzso zzso and zzso partial zzso consists of 606 zzso To investigate the zzso abilities of black zzso in different zzso (35 per thousand seawater, zzso 10 per thousand zzso zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso levels increased in the zzso and zzso during zzso zzso and the zzso expression in the kidney was greatest in 10 per thousand SW and then decreased in zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso only in 10 per thousand zzso while it increased in the kidney in 10 per thousand SW and then decreased in zzso Thus, the expression of these zzso increased in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso genes play important roles in hormonal regulation in zzso zzso thereby improving the zzso ability of black zzso in zzso zzso
