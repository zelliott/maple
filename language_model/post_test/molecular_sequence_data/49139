The zzso class zzso zzso zzso have been identified in many organisms, including human, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso have poor activity with common zzso zzso but exhibit novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, and zzso zzso release by zzso zzso An investigation of the zzso organization of human zzso identified a second actively transcribed member of the zzso class zzso Both zzso and zzso are composed of six zzso and are separated by zzso zzso on zzso zzso A third sequence that appears to be a zzso zzso zzso has been identified on zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acid identity with zzso and zzso the zzso zzso at position 32, which is thought to be important in the active site of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was seen in a range of zzso including the liver, zzso skeletal muscle and zzso The strongest zzso expression was in the zzso which also expresses a larger transcript than other zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been limited by its poor zzso Two functional zzso of zzso have been zzso One alters a zzso junction and causes the deletion of zzso and another results in an zzso zzso zzso of these zzso revealed that the zzso substitution affects neither heat stability, nor activity towards zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso zzso appears to contribute towards both a loss of heat stability and increased zzso zzso
