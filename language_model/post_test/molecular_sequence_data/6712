zzso were isolated from zzso off a stand of zzso zzso established with a single zzso strain, zzso 7 years earlier in an area devoid of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed diversity in growth rate, zzso I fingerprint of zzso DNA, and zzso pattern to zzso DNA zzso The zzso of zzso that grew at the same rate as strain zzso were the only zzso that had the same fingerprint as strain zzso zzso of part of the zzso zzso gene of several diverse zzso confirmed that they were not derived from the zzso zzso Nevertheless, all zzso strains gave zzso and zzso I zzso patterns identical to zzso when zzso to zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso generated by the very rare cutting zzso zzso I revealed that the symbiotic DNA region (at least 105 zzso was zzso integrated in the zzso The results suggest that the diverse strains arose by transfer of zzso symbiotic genes from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso
