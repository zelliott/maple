We have cloned and characterized the human gene for the zzso brain form of zzso zzso zzso The gene was isolated from a human zzso zzso library and spans zzso base zzso It consists of seven zzso and six zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that there is a single copy of the gene in the zzso zzso The zzso start site was mapped to a G zzso 74 base pairs zzso of the zzso initiation zzso A zzso zzso element zzso is situated 21 base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso The gene was mapped to zzso 9 bands zzso The gene bears close resemblance to the genes for zzso major urinary protein and zzso zzso
