zzso A zzso is a type II zzso protein implicated in the regulation of blood pressure in the brain zzso zzso In this study, a zzso soluble form of zzso was expressed in a zzso system, zzso to zzso and zzso By using synthetic zzso it was shown that although the zzso has a rather broad zzso specificity in the absence of zzso the preferential release of zzso zzso acid zzso was observed in the presence of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso or zzso the zzso activity depending on the zzso By searching for natural zzso of zzso we found that peptides having zzso zzso acids at their N zzso zzso II, zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso efficiently in the presence but not in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted to zzso effectively only in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso increases the preference of the zzso for the zzso zzso having zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso IV could bind to zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso and inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso IV acts as a negative regulator of the zzso once generated from zzso II by the serial actions of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that there exists a complex regulation of the zzso activity of zzso which may contribute to zzso such as regulation of blood pressure, maintenance of memory, and normal pregnancy by controlling the zzso of zzso zzso
