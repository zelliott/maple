Many zzso zzso have been identified from various normal or transformed cells based on serum induction and re-entry into the cell cycle from zzso However, these zzso may not represent some important genes expressed during zzso phase in continuously cycling zzso The zzso cell cycle possesses two zzso zzso zzso dependent regulatory gates through which cells pass during late zzso phase and zzso phase of each zzso zzso zzso was employed to zzso a high zzso fraction zzso library enriched in sequences expressed during zzso phase prior to passage through the zzso zzso To prepare zzso cells from continuously cycling cell zzso zzso zzso cells were collected by zzso zzso and highly zzso S phase cells were obtained by double zzso block followed by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso library was prepared by zzso zzso zzso with a zzso excess of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso The library was screened with a high zzso fraction zzso probe zzso Following two rounds of zzso 20 positive clones were zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that six of these clones were enhanced in expression level during zzso phase when compared with S zzso zzso sequence comparison of each clone with the zzso data base revealed that zzso was highly zzso zzso to the zzso light chain gene and clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented new zzso members of four human zzso protein gene families zzso zzso The last zzso zzso zzso a highly charged zzso not previously zzso Additional study of these zzso zzso will be required to determine their role in cell cycle progression and the zzso gateway through which cells transit as they proceed through the cell zzso
