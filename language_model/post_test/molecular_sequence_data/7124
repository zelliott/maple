The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was identified after detecting zzso zzso activity expressed by zzso from a zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame, capable of zzso a protein of 91 zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shares 35 and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with group B zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli zzso a result consistent with the coding capacity of zzso Identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene will allow the regulation of this putative zzso zzso to be zzso
