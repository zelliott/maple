A crude DNA zzso fraction partially zzso from a low salt extract of zzso cells was zzso on a zzso column by an zzso with a linear zzso of zzso zzso By this zzso DNA zzso zzso delta and zzso were separated from each zzso DNA zzso activities were detected in the DNA zzso alpha and delta zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso after further zzso on zzso column revealed that the DNA zzso in the DNA zzso alpha fraction required zzso (or zzso in addition to zzso (or zzso Both DNA zzso zzso on zzso DNA in the same direction of 3' to zzso By a repeated zzso on zzso 6 zzso zzso activities of DNA zzso alpha and delta were zzso at positions of zzso 600 zzso and 400 zzso respectively, and the activities of DNA zzso were well associated with those of corresponding DNA zzso These results strongly suggest that the DNA zzso described here are physically associated with DNA zzso alpha and delta to make large zzso
