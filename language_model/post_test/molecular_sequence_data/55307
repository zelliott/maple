zzso explicit hypotheses regarding the factors determining genetic structuring within species can be difficult, especially in species distributed in historically dynamic zzso To contend with these challenges, we use a framework that combines species distribution models, environmental data and zzso genetic data to generate and explore zzso hypotheses for zzso species occupying the coastal zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Australian zzso zzso a community which has both a high diversity of zzso and has varied dramatically in spatial extent over zzso We use zzso zzso summary statistic and zzso analyses to explicitly test specific zzso zzso zzso we test if zzso zzso across zzso habitat stability, population isolation along a linear habitat or fragmentation across different environments can explain genetic divergence within five zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that patterns of genetic variation reflect complex and zzso interactions related to the spatial distribution of zzso present currently and during repeated glacial zzso as opposed to being associated with historical factors such as habitat stability between glacial and zzso periods or zzso zzso We suggest that the large impact of habitat characteristics over time zzso relative levels of habitat zzso zzso zzso and spatial zzso of soil zzso reflects the ecological restrictions of the zzso and zzso zzso communities and may explain the lack of zzso across zzso The study demonstrates the general utility of the approach for zzso as well as single species, zzso study, including its usefulness for exploring biologically informed hypotheses about what factors have influenced patterns of genetic zzso
