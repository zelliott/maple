zzso zzso is the distinguishing protein component of zzso a major inherited risk factor for zzso Human zzso is zzso to zzso It contains from 15 to 50 repeated zzso closely related to zzso zzso four, plus single zzso zzso and inactive zzso zzso This expressed gene is confined to a subset of zzso Although most zzso lack zzso zzso produce an zzso protein composed of highly repeated copies of a zzso zzso zzso domain, with complete absence of zzso domain zzso Both human and zzso zzso proteins form zzso linked zzso particles that can bind to zzso and other zzso shared with zzso DNA sequence comparisons and zzso analysis indicate that the human type of zzso evolved from a duplicated zzso gene during recent zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso type of zzso evolved from an independent zzso of the zzso gene approximately 80 million years zzso In a type of zzso evolution, the zzso gene has been independently remodeled twice during zzso evolution to produce similar forms of zzso in two widely divergent groups of zzso
