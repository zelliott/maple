zzso the evolution of biological systems requires untangling the molecular mechanisms that connect genetic and environmental variations to their zzso zzso Metal limitation across many zzso ranging from pathogens in the human body to zzso in the zzso zzso strong selection for improved metal acquisition zzso In this study, we uncovered the genetic and zzso basis of adaptation to metal limitation using experimental populations of zzso zzso zzso evolved in zzso growth zzso We identified a zzso zzso arising zzso in 30 of 32 independent populations that zzso methanol as a carbon source, but not in any of the 8 that zzso only zzso These parallel zzso events increased expression of a novel zzso system that enhanced zzso zzso Such ability ensured the production of vitamin zzso a zzso zzso to sustain two vitamin zzso zzso reactions essential to zzso but not zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso provided higher selective advantages under genetic backgrounds or incubation temperatures that permit faster growth, indicating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results link beneficial zzso emerging in a zzso environment to their zzso basis in carbon zzso suggest that certain molecular features may promote the emergence of parallel zzso and indicate that the selective advantages of some zzso depend generically upon changes in growth rate that can stem from either genetic or environmental zzso
