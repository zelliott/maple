A high percentage of human breast and zzso tumors display amplified zzso gene copies, leading to zzso of the growth factor zzso Its membrane location and elevated expression make the zzso protein an appropriate target for a directed tumor zzso We have used zzso DNA technology to produce a zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein which specifically binds the human zzso zzso The zzso portion is composed of the zzso and zzso variable zzso of a zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso The zzso produced zzso protein was shown to bind specifically to cells expressing the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein synthesis in zzso tumor cells at doses ranging from 2 to 200 zzso and is zzso for these cells at equivalent zzso In zzso nude mice, administration of the zzso inhibited the growth of zzso human zzso zzso zzso
