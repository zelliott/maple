zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that converts zzso into zzso one of the main components of zzso cell zzso Class III zzso zzso act directly in the formation of the cell zzso They catalyze the conversion of the immediate precursor of zzso and are responsible for the majority of zzso synthesis in zzso As such, they are highly specific molecular targets for drugs that can inhibit the growth and development of zzso zzso In this work, we have identified and characterized a zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso by primer zzso The complete gene sequence is zzso zzso interrupted by 13 small zzso and comprises a zzso with an zzso with zzso zzso whose terminal region was zzso determined, zzso a protein with zzso zzso that harbors all the motifs and zzso typically found in class III zzso zzso This is the first report on the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso its mature zzso product, and its putative protein in zzso and secondary zzso stages of zzso zzso a zzso fungus that causes zzso broom disease of zzso
