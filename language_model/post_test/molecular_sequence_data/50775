zzso prepared zzso extracts from zzso zzso contain zzso zzso with a specific activity of 20 zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso to a specific activity of zzso zzso zzso by zzso exchange zzso gel zzso and zzso on zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was strictly dependent on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso during incubation with zzso zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso The zzso is extremely sensitive towards oxygen and is inhibited by 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The pure zzso consists of three zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and gamma (24 zzso in approximately equal zzso In this respect the zzso differs from the related zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso both of which are composed of only two zzso with sizes comparable to those of alpha and beta but require an additional protein for zzso The relative molecular mass of the native zzso of about 100 zzso suggests a zzso alpha beta zzso The homogeneous zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso iron and sulfur zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso from zzso zzso did not zzso with cell free extracts or zzso zzso from zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, showed some similarities in the zzso
