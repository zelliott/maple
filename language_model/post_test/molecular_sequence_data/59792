A novel method to monitor specific zzso activities in biological samples as complex as zzso zzso is zzso The approach is based on the design of synthetic zzso zzso in which zzso or zzso sequences are linked to each other via one or more other zzso acids recognized specifically by the zzso to be zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activities using synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, serves to demonstrate the principles of this new zzso zzso A zzso membrane zzso prepared by doping zzso films with zzso zzso is shown to exhibit significant zzso zzso force zzso responses toward these and other zzso zzso at zzso levels under zzso zzso The same zzso however, exhibits much smaller total zzso response toward the shorter fragments of the synthetic peptides generated by zzso zzso zzso the addition of zzso to a solution containing the synthetic zzso yields a change in zzso zzso response, the rate of which is zzso to the activity of zzso zzso Other synthetic zzso peptides as well as natural zzso peptides zzso zzso that lack specific zzso sites for zzso and zzso yet are detected by the zzso membrane zzso do not elicit any significant change in zzso response in the presence of the zzso confirming the feasibility and utility of the proposed zzso zzso
