In zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are key hormones regulating growth and reproduction in the zzso zzso The regulating hormonal interactions are of great interest, therefore, the aim of this study is to provide novel insights into the involvement of brain zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in a fish model, the blue zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning of two zzso forms combined with zzso analysis revealed that three zzso zzso forms exist in blue zzso and evolve as a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are related to final zzso maturation zzso and this zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and growth hormone zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso analog combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The data zzso together with previous studies in our lab, enable suggesting mechanisms explaining the zzso relevance of these peptides in the regulation of zzso and zzso in blue zzso zzso These findings support the biological importance of the zzso and zzso hormones family, enabling them to stimulate differential biological functions in the regulation of growth and zzso
