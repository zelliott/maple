To investigate the expression of the zzso genes resulting from the specific zzso zzso in soft tissue zzso zzso and its diagnostic significance for zzso 

The variety of fusion transcripts were detected in 103 cases of zzso including 30 cases of zzso zzso zzso 15 cases of zzso zzso 25 cases of Ewing's zzso primitive zzso tumors zzso 12 cases of zzso zzso zzso 14 cases of zzso soft part zzso zzso 3 cases of zzso zzso 2 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 cases of zzso zzso and 20 cases of control tumors by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso zzso embedded zzso 

Of the 34 cases of SS 28 zzso expressed zzso zzso transcripts zzso were positive for zzso 9 for zzso Four of the six cases of zzso zzso had a zzso fusion zzso None of the 9 cases of embryonic and zzso zzso expressed zzso Of the 25 cases of zzso 19 were positive for zzso fusion transcript and 1 for zzso fusion zzso zzso fusion transcript was expressed in 8 of the 12 cases zzso of zzso Of the zzso cases of zzso ten expressed zzso fusion zzso None of the 3 cases of zzso 2 cases of zzso 2 cases of zzso and 20 control cases contained any of the fusion zzso 

zzso gene transcript resulting from specific zzso zzso is a reliable index for the molecular diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso for detection of specific fusion gene provides a useful tool for confirmation of the diagnosis of zzso in zzso difficult cases and in retrospective zzso
