Two unusual characteristics of the memory response to the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso which associates with zzso zzso have provided an unique opportunity to investigate self tolerance and T cell zzso zzso plasticity in zzso First, the response is exceptionally zzso dominated by zzso T zzso zzso with identical zzso protein sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso zzso Burrows, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moss, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso expressing this zzso are zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Burrows, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso using this zzso public zzso could be zzso from the peripheral blood of zzso exposed individuals expressing both zzso B8 and zzso demonstrating the zzso zzso of potentially zzso T cells in zzso A significant zzso response was still apparent, however, and zzso sequence analysis of multiple zzso clones revealed an zzso zzso repertoire for this zzso within these individuals, using diverse V and J gene segments and zzso zzso In addition, a significant public zzso component was identified in which several distinct zzso zzso are shared by zzso clones from a number of unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso The striking dominance of public zzso in the response to this zzso zzso suggests a strong genetic bias in zzso gene zzso Fine specificity analysis using zzso zzso showed that, of six different zzso receptors for zzso zzso none associate closely with the zzso full array of potential zzso contact zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso binds zzso acids toward the zzso zzso of the zzso others zzso favor an zzso zzso presumably evading an area that mimics a structure presented on zzso zzso Thus, tolerance to a background major zzso zzso can effectively diversify the zzso repertoire for a foreign zzso by deflecting the response away from an zzso combination of zzso zzso
