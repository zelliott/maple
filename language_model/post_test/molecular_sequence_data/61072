A gene zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso showing zzso to the zzso form of the 70 zzso heat shock protein was cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was expressed in zzso as a protein of 71 zzso that was zzso by a zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, recognized a protein of 70 zzso by Western zzso analysis of zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was located in the zzso of the muscle larvae as determined by the indirect zzso pattern on zzso of the zzso The expression of this protein was not detected in adult zzso zzso suggesting a differential expression of zzso between the 2 stages of zzso
