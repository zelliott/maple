zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso of the zzso reduction of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso In the purple sweet potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene was strongly associated with zzso zzso in leaves, stems and zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso fully zzso the pigmentation zzso of the seed coat, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso expression in transgenic sweet potato zzso using an zzso approach dramatically reduced zzso zzso in young leaves, stems and storage zzso In contrast, the increase of zzso zzso and zzso in the leaves and roots of zzso plants is zzso zzso the zzso zzso channeled greater zzso influx in the zzso plants when their zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These plants also displayed reduced zzso capacity compared to the wild zzso After 24 h of cold treatment and 2 h recovery, the zzso plants were almost fully restored to the initial zzso compared to the slower recovery of zzso plants, in which the levels of zzso leakage and hydrogen zzso zzso were dramatically zzso These results provide direct evidence of zzso function in the protection against zzso stress in the sweet zzso The molecular characterization of the zzso gene in the sweet potato not only confirms its important roles in zzso metabolism but also supports the protective function of zzso of enhanced scavenging of zzso oxygen zzso in plants under stressful zzso
