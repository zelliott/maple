We evaluated the zzso status of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 255 locus detected by probe zzso beta to study zzso in acquired zzso anemia zzso A total of 30 females were suitable for zzso analysis of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso cells using a zzso chain zzso procedure in 24 patients and Southern zzso in zzso Overall, 10 of 30 patients exhibited an zzso zzso zzso However, in 4 patients, analysis of constitutional DNA suggested a skewed zzso pattern and 2 further cases had to be excluded because of the lack of an appropriate zzso A truly zzso pattern was thus established in 4 of 30 zzso zzso In 7 patients who later developed zzso disorders of zzso zzso analysis did not predict this event in any zzso In patients with a zzso nocturnal zzso zzso there was no correlation between the proportion of zzso zzso anchored protein zzso blood cells and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso analysis detected zzso zzso in only 3 of 10 patients with a zzso in zzso in the cell population under study, but sorting of zzso cells on the basis of zzso expression showed the zzso nature of zzso zzso We conclude that the majority of patients with AA show zzso zzso using zzso zzso analysis, but that minor zzso zzso such as zzso cells, may not be detected unless sorted cell populations are separately zzso
