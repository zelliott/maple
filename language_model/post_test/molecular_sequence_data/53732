The zzso binding zzso and zzso of the interaction between zzso growth factor and the soluble zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso produced in zzso cells using a zzso have been studied by three zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using surface zzso resonance detection zzso zzso and zzso zzso These studies were performed with an zzso preparation zzso in the absence of zzso using a mild two step zzso procedure employing zzso exchange and size exclusion zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso data indicated a zzso zzso binding ratio between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso further indicated that the complex comprised zzso consistent with the model proposed recently by zzso et zzso zzso Global analysis of the zzso binding data showed that a simple zzso interaction does not adequately describe the zzso interaction and that more complex interaction mechanisms are zzso Furthermore, analysis of solution binding data using either zzso zzso or the zzso to determine directly the concentration of free zzso in solution competition experiments, yielded zzso plots which were zzso and Hill zzso of less than zzso Taken together our data indicate that in solution there are two zzso zzso one which binds zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and the other with a zzso of zzso zzso
