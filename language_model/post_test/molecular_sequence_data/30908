A zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from zzso of zzso a bacterial expression zzso containing the full length zzso zzso by utilizing sequential zzso exchange and zzso exchange zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso of zzso estimated at zzso purity on the basis of zzso high performance liquid zzso could be obtained from 200 g wet weight of zzso The zzso protein exhibited a single zzso zzso band at the region of Mr zzso 42,000 by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and an zzso zzso acid sequence consistent with the expected translation product of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso rapidly inhibited zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso as well as zzso with apparent second order rate zzso in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A specific activity measurement of 250,000 zzso was calculated for the zzso based on its ability to inhibit the zzso activity of a zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the activity of the zzso was very stable when stored at temperatures of 25 degrees C or lower, but decayed within hours when stored at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, which partially activates the zzso form of natural zzso zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso produced from zzso displays many of the properties associated with the biologically active form of natural zzso
