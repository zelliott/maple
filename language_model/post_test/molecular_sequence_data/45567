zzso of zzso signal molecules of the zzso zzso zzso type by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on its zzso zzso zzso of two of its four native zzso zzso and zzso resulted in loss of production of the largest zzso and the three smaller zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso resulted in AHL signal degradation and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was studied in these strains by zzso zzso zzso affected a small zzso fraction of the detected spots in the zzso and a smaller zzso fraction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affected up to zzso of the detected spots in the zzso strain, suggesting that zzso normally interferes with the zzso response zzso by other zzso This, together with the observation that zzso 50% of the zzso proteins in strain zzso showed zzso repression, suggests that an important part of their functionality can be exerted through repression, although zzso are usually considered as gene expression zzso The three main zzso zzso were identified by zzso as charge zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Another major zzso zzso was only present in the zzso strain and could not be zzso
