zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool for exploring protein structure and function, and several procedures adjusted to specific purposes are still being zzso zzso we describe a straightforward and efficient method with versatile applications for introducing zzso zzso in any zzso acid zzso sequence cloned in a zzso expression zzso In this zzso chain reaction zzso zzso method, forward and reverse zzso are used to amplify the zzso containing the sequence of zzso The zzso are designed so that the desired modifications are introduced at the zzso end of one of the zzso whereas the other primer starts with the zzso at position zzso of the one to be zzso The zzso is carried out using zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso is zzso and used to transform zzso zzso zzso clones are screened by colony zzso using the zzso primer as probe and the presence of the zzso is confirmed by direct DNA zzso This procedure was used efficiently to introduce zzso zzso and insertions in the DNA sequences coding for a zzso form zzso of zzso 107 specific of the human zzso zzso the rat alpha zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso cloned in zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso
