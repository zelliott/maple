In order to better understand the zzso role of zzso zzso found in the zzso gene from patients affected with zzso adrenal zzso zzso due to steroid zzso zzso we built two three-dimensional zzso models of human zzso using all known zzso structures of zzso For each zzso affected by a zzso zzso its location in the zzso structure and the putative changes in terms of zzso properties brought about by the zzso were zzso Most of the severe zzso were found to affect zzso located in functionally important regions of the zzso such as zzso recognition sites zzso or the zzso region, whereas moderate zzso were mostly found in less crucial regions of the zzso Thus, there is a good correlation between the zzso structure study and clinical data and zzso experiments previously zzso In one case, however, the observed clinical severity of the zzso zzso did not match its expected severity deduced from the model, pointing to a potential functionally important region of the zzso Our zzso human models provide a basic model for further studies of zzso responsible for zzso and for identification of important zzso involved in the specific activity of the zzso
