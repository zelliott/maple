To study the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso structural model of human zzso was constructed using computer graphics and molecular dynamics calculations, based on the zzso zzso This zzso model shows that the folded zzso zzso can fit into the zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso The three positively charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso make salt bridges with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso which is in the processing site, forms salt bridges with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These zzso interactions between the zzso and the zzso may contribute to keeping the zzso structure as an inactive zzso
