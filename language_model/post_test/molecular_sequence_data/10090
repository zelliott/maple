zzso and functional analyses were used to investigate the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso To define the structural zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins that covered the complete linear zzso sequence of the zzso were expressed in zzso The fusion proteins were screened for zzso and zzso red binding through the use of zzso and zzso red overlay zzso Six new zzso zzso regions were detected on the zzso in addition to the one described earlier zzso zzso De zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong zzso and zzso red binding zzso were localized in the zzso region of the zzso as zzso two zzso zzso were located within the zzso domain, and three zzso binding stretches were localized in a zzso acid region just downstream of the zzso zzso A sixth zzso stretch was detected in the proximity of the zzso zzso Evidence for the involvement of multiple zzso sites in the regulation of the zzso was obtained from functional studies on zzso zzso cells, in which we characterized the effects of zzso and zzso on the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso was due to a shift in zzso toward lower zzso zzso and this effect was zzso by zzso The zzso by zzso zzso was caused by a decrease in zzso and by a shift in zzso toward higher zzso zzso The effect on the zzso occurred at lower zzso zzso than the zzso effect on the zzso In addition, zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso but not the zzso effect on the zzso The different zzso and zzso zzso suggest that three different zzso interaction sites were zzso zzso zzso zzso the release without affecting the Hill zzso or the zzso excluding the involvement of one of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that multiple zzso sites are localized on the zzso and that at least four different zzso sites may be involved in the complex feedback regulation of the release by zzso
