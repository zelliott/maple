The zzso zzso is a cell surface protein that can mediate zzso and that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the human zzso zzso were killed within 4-6 h by zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso with various zzso in the zzso region were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso A deletion of 15 zzso acids from the C zzso of the zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso killing activity, whereas a further deletion abolished its zzso This suggests the presence of an zzso as well as a zzso domain in the zzso region of the zzso zzso A zzso acid portion of the zzso domain significantly zzso in the zzso zzso as well as in the type I tumor necrosis factor zzso was considered to be the novel protein domain required for zzso signal zzso
