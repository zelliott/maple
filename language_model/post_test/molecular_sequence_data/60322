A zzso zzso strain resistant to zzso zzso was cultured from respiratory zzso of a patient suffering from zzso pneumonia in zzso Germany, in zzso The isolate harbors a zzso resistance gene located on a zzso zzso An zzso coli zzso produces a zzso with an zzso point of zzso and a resistance zzso characteristic of an zzso zzso 1) zzso except for low zzso of zzso The zzso gene was cloned and zzso It encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with the active site zzso of the zzso motif at position 64, as is characteristic for class C zzso Multiple alignment of the deduced zzso acid sequence with 21 other zzso zzso demonstrates only very distant zzso reaching at maximum zzso identity for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso represents a new type of zzso zzso for which we propose the designation zzso zzso class zzso
