zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso signals received by zzso receptors to zzso zzso Each zzso of the G protein complex is zzso by a member of one of three corresponding gene zzso Currently, 16 different members of the alpha zzso family, 5 different members of the beta zzso family, and 11 different members of the gamma zzso family have been described in zzso Here we have identified and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the human zzso of each of the zzso zzso and gamma zzso genes as well as a G zzso zzso and a previously undiscovered G zzso zzso The gene structure and zzso location of each gene was determined, as were the zzso of paired zzso These results provide greater insight into the evolution and functional diversity of the zzso G protein zzso zzso
