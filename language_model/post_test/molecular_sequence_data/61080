Through an integrated study of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with synthetic peptides and native zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso we have obtained zzso information on a region of zzso not yet zzso by X-ray zzso zzso zzso binds with high affinity and broad zzso specificity to the zzso zzso region zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso display selection from a random zzso library identified the core binding motif as zzso zzso to zzso zzso Using quantitative binding zzso the affinity of zzso zzso for native, zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be similar to that for the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the synthetic zzso largely has a random zzso zzso in zzso The results therefore suggest that the zzso zzso is fully accessible on zzso and that this region of zzso is as flexible as the synthetic zzso zzso zzso are on the edge of a putative zzso binding site that has been zzso to change zzso on zzso zzso However, the affinity of zzso zzso for zzso is not affected by binding of zzso and zzso These results suggest either that the zzso region does not change zzso upon zzso zzso or that zzso zzso does not undergo the same changes as occur in the native viral zzso zzso The detailed characterization of the zzso zzso may be useful for further study of the role of the zzso region of zzso in the viral attachment and fusion zzso
