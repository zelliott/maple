We report the results of molecular analysis of 39 zzso of zzso zzso from human and bovine sources in nine human outbreaks and from bovine sources from a wide geographic zzso All 39 zzso could be divided into either of two zzso on the basis of genetic zzso observed at the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 was observed only in zzso from zzso zzso 2, however, was seen in calf zzso and in zzso from a subset of human patients who reported direct exposure to infected cattle or consumed items thought to be contaminated with cattle zzso Furthermore, experimental infection studies showed that zzso 2 zzso were zzso to mice or calves under routine laboratory conditions, whereas zzso 1 zzso were zzso These results support the occurrence of two distinct transmission cycles of zzso zzso in zzso
