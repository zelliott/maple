The zzso zzso in the East African Great Lakes exhibit a great diversity of color patterns, presumably as adaptations to zzso zzso and/or due to the action of sexual selection on color for species discrimination or female mate zzso To zzso the mechanisms underlying such zzso pattern diversity, we cloned the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that previously had been cloned and characterized from pigmentation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Gene sequence analysis among five zzso species from the Great Lakes shows that the evolutionary rate of zzso acid replacement in zzso is the highest of these four zzso We then compared the zzso zzso acid replacement rates between species from the zzso and zzso zzso and between Lake zzso and zzso zzso and Lake zzso zzso We show that the evolutionary rate within the zzso lineage is twice that of the zzso zzso but that rates for the zzso zzso and zzso lineages are almost the zzso These results suggest that the accelerated evolution of zzso might have occurred zzso with zzso pattern diversification in Great Lakes species, but not necessarily correlated with species under intense sexual selection on male mating color via female mate zzso Finally, we characterized a novel alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso that is similar to a zzso zzso zzso zzso generated using alternate zzso zzso We suggest that this new zzso in zzso like that in zzso encodes an zzso zzso factor having higher relative DNA binding zzso These data provide a novel example of functional convergence in which a particular zzso zzso is independently generated via alternative zzso of a specific gene in different zzso
