zzso Finger zzso zzso famous for their ability to precisely and efficiently modify specific zzso zzso have been employed in numerous transgenic model zzso and cell zzso Here we employ the zzso technology, with zzso zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With the use of zzso we established zzso knock in cell lines with zzso efficiencies of about zzso We zzso DNA zzso containing the promoter and the protein coding regions of the zinc finger zzso into cells, instead of the zzso to avoid problems associated with off target zzso zzso and adopted a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso to reduce the toxic effects of the zzso on cell zzso Since zzso of zzso or a zzso of it, might lead to an immediately lethal effect, we used the zzso System to regulate zzso zzso Our genetically transformed cell lines, zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The Swedish double zzso in the zzso coding sequence enhanced zzso and zzso zzso What is more, the activity of the three key zzso in zzso formation could be zzso indicating that these transgenic cells have potential for drug screening to modify zzso metabolism in zzso Our transformed cells could readily be zzso in culture and should provide an excellent experimental medium for zzso aspects of the molecular zzso of Alzheimer's disease, especially those concerning the zzso pathways involving zzso in the zzso coding zzso The cellular models may also serve as a tool for zzso potentially useful therapeutic zzso
