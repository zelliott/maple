zzso G proteins are an important component of signal zzso zzso in zzso Although these proteins have been described in plants, their exact function and action mode are not clearly zzso In order to analyze the relationship between these proteins and the zzso of light signals in spinach, we have isolated by zzso and 3' zzso a zzso zzso clone called zzso This codes for a zzso zzso which reveals a very strong zzso with other plant zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso belonged to a small multiple gene zzso Northern blots and zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso transcripts accumulate in all zzso tested with a specific high level associated with the zzso roots and zzso Finally, a zzso analysis performed on the green zzso showed that zzso of zzso transcripts follows a zzso zzso However, zzso zzso analysis of the zzso suggested the opposite behavior, while no variation was observed in the zzso
