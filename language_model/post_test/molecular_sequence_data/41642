zzso zzso protein zzso interactions are often characterized by low affinity but high zzso These traits are essential in signaling and regulation that require zzso zzso zzso coli zzso exploit this situation by zzso host zzso signaling to stimulate zzso assembly beneath bound bacteria, generating zzso that promote zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso which form a complex with the host protein zzso The interaction of this complex with zzso triggers localized zzso zzso We show that zzso is an zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso Our structure shows that single zzso repeat forms a zzso zzso complex with zzso and zzso We demonstrate that bacterial and cellular zzso interact with zzso zzso in a similar fashion, but the bacterial protein has evolved to zzso cellular targets by utilizing a zzso switch that offers superior binding affinity enabling zzso zzso zzso
