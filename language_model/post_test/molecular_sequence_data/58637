The zzso zzso zzso gene 1 zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of zzso zzso from a few days before zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter is sufficient to direct zzso temporally regulated expression of the zzso reporter gene in the zzso of transgenic zzso We have carried out a deletion analysis of the zzso promoter and found that elements required for zzso expression are located between zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the translation start zzso Furthermore, specific binding of zzso nuclear factors to sequences within this region was demonstrated by gel zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were found to be required for high-level zzso
