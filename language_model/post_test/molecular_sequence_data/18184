We have cloned and zzso the gene zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso II zzso from zzso zzso and partially zzso genes from soybean zzso zzso We have also determined the zzso sequence for a number of zzso clones which zzso the zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso zzso II from both soybean and zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso of approximately 205 zzso consists of 12 zzso and encompasses more than 8 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shows eight regions of similarity with the largest zzso of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as a highly zzso zzso unique to zzso zzso zzso The zzso in plants, like those in most other zzso consist of tandem zzso repeats with the consensus zzso acid sequence zzso The portion of zzso which encodes the zzso in plants differs from that of zzso of animals and lower zzso All the plant genes examined contain 2-3 zzso within the zzso zzso regions, and at least two plant genes contain an alternatively spliced zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso Several clustered zzso acid zzso in the zzso are zzso in the two plant species zzso but are not found in other zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso family in zzso but a single gene encodes this zzso in zzso and most other zzso
