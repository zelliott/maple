We show that the zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso binds DNA highly zzso with three members of the zzso family of zzso regulators zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso This zzso is apparent with DNA molecules bearing consensus zzso sites and is unaffected by the presence of a negative regulatory element, a sequence previously proposed to be important for zzso repression by these zzso zzso The zzso observed in these zzso zzso is paralleled by interactions between protein pairs in the absence of zzso We also show that in zzso cells, as zzso by transient zzso expression of zzso increases zzso by zzso from the twist promoter and zzso that zzso from the zzso promoter, consistent with the previously proposed idea that zzso can affect the action of zzso in a zzso zzso
