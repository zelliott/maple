zzso is a zzso zzso released from zzso coli to kill sensitive bacterial cells by degrading the zzso acid molecules in their zzso zzso is classified as one of the group A zzso since the zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso interact with specific zzso or zzso zzso proteins during protein zzso Here, we show that if the zzso tail of zzso is deleted, zzso zzso zzso loses its zzso activity against zzso Moreover, zzso protein interacts directly with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso deleted zzso zzso zzso as detected by zzso experiments, confirming that the zzso tail is required for zzso interactions with zzso The crystal structure of the zzso tail deleted zzso zzso was determined by the zzso anomalous zzso method at a resolution of zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso well with the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso a group A zzso zzso and a group B zzso zzso zzso The structural resemblance of group A and B zzso implies that the two groups of zzso may share a zzso connection during cellular zzso
