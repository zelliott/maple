The zzso finger is a common structural motif found in all zzso zzso It is a zzso domain and its closest structural relative is the zzso zzso Many zzso fingers bind to zzso zzso to mediate the zzso of zzso Whether zzso fingers share a common function is zzso zzso many if not all zzso fingers are found in nuclear proteins whose zzso tends to be zzso Some zzso fingers bind to specific nuclear protein partners, apparently through the same surface that is used by zzso zzso to bind their zzso zzso zzso New evidence also suggests that some zzso fingers bind to zzso raising the possibility that zzso might be a common nuclear zzso of zzso zzso
