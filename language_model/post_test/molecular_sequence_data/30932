zzso carrying the white and zzso eye color genes have been isolated from zzso DNA libraries of the blowfly Lucilia zzso using cloned DNA from the zzso white and scarlet zzso respectively, of zzso zzso as zzso On the basis of zzso studies using adjacent restriction fragments, zzso fragments were found to be zzso between the genes from the two zzso The zzso sequence of a short region of the white gene of zzso zzso has been determined, and the zzso to the corresponding region of zzso zzso is zzso at the derived zzso acid level the zzso is greater zzso due to a marked difference in zzso usage between the zzso A major difference in zzso organization between the two species is that whereas the DNA encompassing the zzso zzso genes is free of repeated zzso that encompassing their zzso zzso counterparts contains substantial amounts of repeated zzso This suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso is organized on the short period zzso zzso zzso sequence DNA zzso which appear generally to be short (less than 1 zzso and which vary in repetitive frequency in the zzso from greater than zzso copies to less than zzso copies, are found in at least two different locations in the clones carrying these zzso One type of repeat structure, found by sequencing, consists of zzso repeating short zzso zzso site and restriction zzso length zzso involving both the white and zzso gene regions are found within and between populations of zzso zzso
