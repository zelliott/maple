Early achievements in zzso were zzso typified by the identification of very small quantities of zzso However, as the subject has developed, there has been a pressure to develop approaches to define the amounts of each zzso in a relative or an absolute zzso A further dimension to quantitative zzso zzso the behavior of each protein in terms of its zzso Virtually every protein in the cell is in a dynamic state, subject to continuous synthesis and degradation, the relative rates of which control the expansion or the contraction of the protein pool, and the absolute values of which dictate the zzso responsiveness of the protein zzso Strategies must therefore be developed to assess the turnover of individual proteins in the zzso Because a protein can be turning over rapidly even when the protein pool is in steady state, the only acceptable approach to measure turnover is to use zzso labels that are incorporated or lost from the protein pool as it is zzso Using zzso labeling on a zzso scale in turn requires zzso labels that contain stable zzso the incorporation or loss of which can be assessed by mass zzso A typical turnover experiment is zzso The choice of zzso label is dictated by several factors, including abundance in the zzso zzso zzso of the label in the precursor pool, and the downstream mass zzso zzso zzso Key issues include the need to control and understand the relative isotope abundance of the zzso the zzso of label flux into and out of the protein pool, and a sampling strategy that ensures the coverage of the greatest range of turnover zzso Finally, the zzso approaches to data analysis will not be as straightforward as in other areas of zzso In this chapter, we will discuss the principles and practice of zzso development for turnover analysis, exemplified by the development of zzso for turnover analysis in the model zzso zzso zzso
