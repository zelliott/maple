A locus for zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso was previously identified in the zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence zzso a long range zzso zzso of the Sonic zzso zzso gene at human zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that a zzso zzso in the human zzso previously thought to represent a neutral zzso acts as a dominant zzso with reduced zzso We found this zzso in three independently zzso zzso from southern England with zzso zzso demonstrated significant linkage of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified a shared zzso zzso around the zzso suggesting that the zzso share a common zzso An individual zzso for the zzso zzso presented with isolated bilateral zzso thumb resembling the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is largely dominant to the zzso zzso As a functional test of the zzso of the zzso zzso we zzso a zzso zzso construct to demonstrate that it can drive zzso anterior expression of a reporter gene in the developing mouse zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso is in fact zzso and, in southern England, appears to be the most common cause of zzso zzso Depending on the zzso of the founding zzso it may play a wider role in the zzso of this zzso
