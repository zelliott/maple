Aleutian mink disease zzso zzso is a zzso virus with a zzso DNA zzso that causes a zzso usually persistent immune complex disease in zzso In this study, a total of zzso serum samples were collected from zzso that were farmed in China from 2009 to zzso After testing by zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was found to be zzso zzso The results show that there is a serious epidemic among Chinese zzso used for zzso To gain detailed information regarding the molecular epidemiology of zzso in China, nine strains of zzso were isolated from mink samples that were collected from four of the primary mink farming areas in zzso The full-length zzso protein zzso gene from each strain was zzso after zzso amplification, and a zzso analysis was performed on the zzso gene zzso including the zzso genes from the other 10 zzso strains available in the zzso database, which were submitted from the 1970s to zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso were divided into five independent zzso The Chinese zzso strains were distributed among all five groups and showed a high level of genetic zzso Over 50 % of the Chinese zzso strains were classified into two zzso that consisted only of zzso from China and that were distinct from zzso strains found in other zzso This finding indicated that both local and imported zzso species are prevalent in the Chinese mink farming zzso
