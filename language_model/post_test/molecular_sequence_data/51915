A genetic locus implicated in the synthesis and zzso of alkaline zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been previously described zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the DNA zzso zzso these functions was determined and revealed the existence of five open reading zzso zzso the structural gene zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whose products are involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins share significant zzso with proteins implicated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso These results provide further evidence for the existence of a specialized zzso system widespread among zzso zzso
