Nuclear export sequences zzso have been identified in many cellular zzso but it remains unclear how different zzso compare in zzso We describe a sensitive new in zzso export zzso which we have used to assess the relative export activity of different types of zzso The most common type of export sequence resembles that first identified in the zzso Rev protein and typically comprises a core of large zzso zzso acids that specify recognition by the zzso export zzso We compared 10 previously identified zzso zzso in our zzso and whereas all were functional, the relative export activities of these signals varied zzso We further identified 3 new zzso zzso from a computer database search, and each export signal was assigned a score of 1 to 9 and ranked in order of activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The weakest zzso were found in the zzso tumor zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso which are all normally localized to the zzso All of the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso of key zzso zzso and by treatment with the zzso export zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a different type of export zzso the zzso shuttling element derived from zzso K, exhibited a modest export activity that was insensitive to zzso B zzso zzso thus appears to mediate export via a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence identified, for the first time, specific zzso and zzso zzso necessary for its export activity, thereby distinguishing zzso from other types of nuclear transport zzso We have shown that different nuclear export signals can vary profoundly in activity and therefore conclude that the nuclear export rate of a specific shuttling protein largely depends on both the strength and the accessibility of its zzso
