zzso proteins have no known zzso activity and exert their zzso effects via interaction with and regulation of the activity of other zzso termed target zzso in both a zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies have identified the zzso region between the two zzso zzso binding zzso and the zzso as zzso target protein binding sites in several zzso family zzso In fact, zzso aromatic zzso are obligatory for interaction of zzso with several of its zzso target zzso zzso studies suggest the presence of additional zzso binding motifs on some family zzso A minimum of seven family members interact with and regulate the activity of zzso A in a zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso target protein interactions zzso a binding motif distinct from the zzso zzso target protein binding zzso Several studies suggest that zzso interactions participate in the interaction of zzso family members with zzso target zzso While some target proteins are activated by multiple family members, other target proteins exhibit family zzso zzso zzso they are activated by a single family zzso As predicted, family member specific interactions appear to be zzso by regions that exhibit the most divergence in zzso acid sequence among family members, the zzso or zzso region and the C zzso Further specificity in zzso protein interactions may arise from the different zzso properties of the individual family members, including affinity for metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the structural motifs that mediate zzso protein interactions and determination of the in zzso relevance of these interactions are needed to fully understand the role of zzso proteins in normal and diseased zzso
