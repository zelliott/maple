A short tandem repeat zzso in the zzso locus was zzso in more than 40 zzso Twenty different zzso were found and these could be grouped into 12 zzso classes in accordance with the total number of zzso This is a compound zzso consisting of blocks of zzso and zzso repeats with basic sequence structure zzso Whereas smaller zzso zzso have variation limited to the zzso unit, in larger zzso the complexity is greater with variation in the number of tandem zzso in the two motifs zzso and zzso zzso data showed that this is a highly zzso zzso with a zzso of more than zzso This fact, together with its simple structure, makes this zzso an interesting DNA zzso for forensic and genetic zzso
