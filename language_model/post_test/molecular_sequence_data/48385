Changes in gene expression have been proposed to have an important role in the evolutionary changes in zzso zzso changes in gene expression can result not only from genetic changes in regulatory regions but also from zzso changes in such zzso Here we report the identification of zzso regions showing differences in DNA zzso between humans and chimpanzees zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 21 and zzso These regional zzso differences are frequently associated with zzso including those relevant to a disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes zzso or zzso zzso differences are often correlated with changes in promoter activity or alternative zzso Comparative studies including other great zzso species provide evidence for the contribution of genetic changes to some of these zzso zzso changes responsible for the zzso include gain or loss of zzso site and changes in zzso density in zzso zzso Our results suggest that DNA zzso changes, often caused by small sequence changes, contribute to zzso and zzso diversification in zzso zzso
