zzso selection was used to isolate coding sequences from zzso mapping to the zzso zzso region of human zzso zzso A novel zzso termed zzso was isolated and mapped between the zzso zzso and zzso about zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The predicted protein of 103 zzso acids appears to be a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose gene was previously isolated as a zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes an essential zzso protein and shows zzso to zzso zzso an integral component of active zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso to two other recently isolated human zzso suggesting the presence of a new gene zzso zzso sequences were also found in zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, all predicted proteins show significant zzso to zzso The proposed role of zzso zzso as zzso protein and the strong evolutionary conservation of the zzso gene suggest an involvement of the zzso protein in the function and/or structure of the zzso zzso
