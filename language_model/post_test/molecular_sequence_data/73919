A zzso zzso technique was used to analyze the characteristics of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins of mouse zzso gray matter zzso In the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoted zzso increases of zzso associated with free zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso at zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of delta zzso zzso zzso II and zzso displayed little or no activity on this zzso toxin resistant regulatory zzso Although exhibiting diverse zzso all the zzso studied activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II were more potent at zzso zzso than at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed a competitive profile in reducing the zzso of G proteins promoted by zzso Moreover, zzso antagonized the releasing effect exerted by zzso II on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the G zzso zzso promoted by zzso of delta zzso zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso exhibit marked differences in efficacy and/or potency in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso proteins in mouse zzso gray zzso
