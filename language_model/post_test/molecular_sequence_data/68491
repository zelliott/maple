Small angle zzso scattering and zzso analyses of the zzso of zzso in solution indicated that the molecules were zzso zzso predictions of consensus sequences for the two classes of zzso zzso and zzso were in good agreement with the zzso contents determined by circular zzso zzso determined by small angle zzso scattering and zzso indicated a predominantly zzso zzso The data are discussed in relation to models for the solution zzso and to earlier models for zzso zzso
