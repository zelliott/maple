Low zzso zzso a common condition of many soils, is known to stimulate zzso activity in plants; however, the molecular details of this response remain mostly zzso We zzso and zzso the zzso region of a zzso zzso induced acid zzso zzso from zzso zzso and cloned its zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso predicted that zzso is zzso as a 338 zzso zzso precursor with a signal zzso zzso was found to be related to known purple acid zzso especially to zzso type 5 acid zzso Other similarities with purple acid zzso which contain a zzso metal zzso include the conservation of all zzso involved in metal zzso binding and resistance to zzso zzso In addition, zzso like other type 5 acid zzso displayed zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments, as well as in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso on transgenic plants zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is not only responsive to zzso zzso but also to zzso and salt zzso It is also expressed in zzso leaves and during zzso stress induced by zzso but not by zzso or salicylic zzso Given its zzso as it displays both zzso and zzso activity, we propose that zzso could be involved in zzso zzso and in the metabolism of zzso oxygen species in stressed or zzso parts of the zzso
