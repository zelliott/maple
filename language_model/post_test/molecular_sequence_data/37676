The direct repeat region in zzso tuberculosis complex strains is composed of multiple direct zzso repeats zzso each of which is composed of a zzso direct repeat zzso plus a zzso zzso sequence of similar zzso It has been shown previously that clinical zzso show extensive zzso in the DR region by the variable presence of zzso and this zzso has been used in the epidemiology of zzso In an attempt to better understand the evolutionary scenario leading to zzso DR zzso and to improve strain differentiation by zzso we characterized and compared the DNA sequences of the complete DR region and its zzso DNA of zzso tuberculosis complex zzso We identified 94 different zzso sequences among 26 zzso tuberculosis complex zzso No sequence zzso was found between any of these zzso and zzso tuberculosis DNA outside of the DR region or with any other known bacterial zzso Although strains differed extensively in the presence or absence of zzso the order of the zzso in the DR locus was found to be well zzso The data strongly suggest that the zzso in clinical zzso is the result of successive deletions of single discrete zzso or of multiple zzso zzso from a primordial DR region containing many more zzso than seen in present day zzso and that virtually no scrambling of zzso took place during zzso Because the majority of the novel zzso sequences identified in this study were confined to zzso of the rare zzso zzso zzso the use of the novel zzso in zzso led only to a slight improvement of strain differentiation by zzso
