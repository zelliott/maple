zzso analyses and comparison of the genes coding for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of different influenza B viruses isolated between 1940 and 1987 reveal that the number of zzso is not always zzso to the time between zzso zzso of 14 influenza B virus zzso gene and 10 zzso gene sequences by the maximum zzso method suggested zzso with influenza C zzso are multiple evolutionary lineages which can coexist for considerable periods of zzso zzso of the sequence divergence among genes of viruses belonging to type A, B, and C virus suggests that, in man, influenza B viruses evolve slower than A viruses and faster than C zzso We propose an evolutionary model for influenza B viruses that is intermediate between the pattern for human influenza A viruses and that for influenza C zzso
