The zzso are a zzso population from northeastern zzso who are believed to have originated from ancient zzso populations in South zzso based on archaeological and zzso zzso In order to better understand zzso origins, we modeled 25 demographic scenarios and tested by zzso simulation whether any are consistent with the patterns of zzso diversity observed in zzso zzso The models consist of either two simulated zzso that represent zzso and a South zzso ancestral population, or three zzso that also include a regional Northeast zzso population that served as a source of local gene flow into the zzso zzso The model that produced the best fit to the observed data defined a founder group with an effective female population size of only 150 individuals that migrated zzso approximately 1,000 years zzso and who experienced significant zzso with neighboring populations in zzso zzso These simulation results indicate a pronounced founder effect that was primarily zzso and reconcile reported discrepancies between zzso zzso and Y zzso diversity zzso
