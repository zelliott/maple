The regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso This region comprises the origin of replication for the zzso and the start point of zzso for the zzso zzso which zzso the two replication proteins zzso and zzso In this region there are two binding sites for zzso a zzso site which is probably the origin of replication and a zzso which zzso the promoter and implies an zzso expression of zzso The zzso site contains two 8 zzso zzso as well as an zzso repeat zzso By introducing point zzso into each of these motifs and monitoring changes to zzso binding in a zzso zzso it was shown that the central, zzso zzso (the zzso is the most important motif for protein zzso zzso in the second, zzso zzso (the zzso had no effect on protein binding and the zzso repeat structure per zzso was not needed, though some zzso changes affected binding to one or other of the DNA zzso These zzso were subsequently tested in zzso for their effects on zzso replication in zzso zzso Any change to the zzso abolished zzso but changes to the other motifs were dependent on the position of the changed base, again indicating that the zzso repeats are not essential and that the zzso is part of the promoter and not primarily zzso by zzso The zzso plasmids did not show any changes in copy number to that of the zzso The expression of zzso was zzso by introducing a stronger promoter upstream of the zzso zzso The resulting zzso was capable of increasing to a degree in trans the copy number of other plasmids carrying the zzso region, but was unstable when present on its own in zzso
