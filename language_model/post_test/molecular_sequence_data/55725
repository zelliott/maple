zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was performed to identify zzso in the zzso zzso that are involved in the induction of zzso zzso expression by zzso A putative zzso binding domain located near the zzso was previously zzso based on zzso studies with the zzso coli zzso family of zzso which all have a zzso sugar as zzso zzso within this domain and zzso zzso that are charge zzso in the zzso family were changed into zzso or zzso The production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso strain zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso activities and decreased growth rates on zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the complex between a DNA zzso carrying the zzso operators and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso in the presence of zzso in contrast to wild type zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited no gross effects on zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that the zzso at positions 72, 80 and zzso and zzso acid at position 210 are involved in the induction of zzso zzso expression by zzso
