zzso zzso peptides zzso have been used to zzso the structure and stability of the triple zzso zzso of collagen zzso Although zzso zzso have been widely zzso very little work has been reported regarding zzso zzso because of synthetic zzso Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of zzso and zzso type zzso zzso natural and synthetic zzso sequences that are zzso zzso to a template, a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Various zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso representing specific zzso of type I collagen were zzso and characterized in terms of triple zzso structure, zzso melting behavior, and zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso derived from natural type I collagen sequence can form stable zzso zzso complexes with artificial zzso and that the zzso stability and the folding rate increase with the increasing number of zzso stabilizing zzso acids zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso stability and zzso zzso of all zzso however, their relative values were not affected suggesting that the zzso system can be used for comparative study of zzso zzso folding behavior in regards to chain composition and for characterization of zzso unstable zzso
