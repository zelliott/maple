In this study the comparative TLC zzso investigation of neutral zzso and zzso from human skeletal and heart muscle is zzso A panel of specific zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso were used for the overlay zzso combined with preceding zzso treatment of zzso on TLC zzso This approach proved zzso but also quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso neutral zzso and zzso in these two types of zzso muscle tissue within the same zzso The main neutral zzso in skeletal muscle was zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas in heart muscle zzso and zzso were the zzso neutral zzso beside small quantities of zzso zzso and zzso No zzso neutral zzso and no zzso zzso were found in either muscle zzso zzso was the major zzso zzso almost zzso in skeletal and about 50% in cardiac muscle total zzso zzso was found in skeletal muscle only, while zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed somewhat quantitative differences in each zzso zzso zzso was detected in both zzso zzso zzso were identified in TLC runs corresponding to zzso zzso g muscle wet weight zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in runs which corresponded to zzso g muscle zzso Only zzso g and zzso g wet weight zzso were necessary for unequivocal identification of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Muscle is known for the lowest zzso concentration from all zzso zzso studied so zzso Using the overlay technique, reliable zzso composition could be revealed, even from small muscle zzso on a zzso and zzso detection zzso
