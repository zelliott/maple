zzso use of DNA restriction zzso length zzso zzso to differentiate strains of zzso tuberculosis to monitor the transmission of tuberculosis has been hampered by the need to culture this zzso zzso and by the level of technical sophistication needed for zzso zzso We have developed a simple method which allows simultaneous detection and typing of zzso tuberculosis in clinical specimens and reduces the time between suspicion of the disease and typing from 1 or several months to 1 or 3 zzso The method is based on zzso of the zzso DR zzso which contains a variable number of short direct repeats zzso with zzso zzso The method is referred to as zzso zzso or zzso because it is based on zzso zzso patterns of in zzso DNA with multiple zzso zzso Most of the clinical zzso tested showed unique zzso patterns, whereas outbreak strains shared the same zzso The types obtained from direct examination of clinical samples were identical to those obtained by using DNA from cultured zzso zzso This novel preliminary study shows that the novel method may be a useful tool for rapid disclosure of linked outbreak cases in a community, in hospitals, or in other institutions and for monitoring of transmission of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso a distinction which is often difficult to make by traditional zzso
