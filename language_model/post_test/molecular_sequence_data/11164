Although chemotherapy effectively reduces the plasma cell burden in multiple myeloma zzso the disease zzso zzso includes circulating and bone zzso zzso localized zzso A large majority of circulating zzso zzso B cells zzso express an zzso zzso zzso identical to that of zzso zzso plasma zzso Unlike plasma cells, these zzso circulating B cells exhibit dye and drug transport activity before and throughout zzso Drug resistance was measured as the ability to export the fluorescent dye zzso zzso or the drug zzso using flow zzso The role of zzso 170 zzso the zzso zzso was defined by zzso A zzso dye zzso Only zzso to zzso of zzso plasma cells exported dye with the majority retaining zzso identified as bright zzso zzso zzso plasma cells were also unable to export dye and remained zzso However, zzso of circulating zzso zzso B cells exhibited zzso dye zzso zzso plasma cells taken before or after initiation of first line chemotherapy were equally unable to export zzso Thus in zzso differentiation to the plasma cell stage is accompanied by a loss of zzso function, although zzso zzso expression is zzso In contrast, for zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso zzso of zzso plasma cells exported zzso comparable to the zzso of circulating zzso B cells that also exported zzso suggesting that the apparent zzso in zzso function is unique to myeloma plasma zzso Virtually all zzso plasma cells in zzso retained the drug zzso consistent with their initial drug sensitivity in zzso in contrast to circulating zzso B cells, or to T cells in zzso or zzso Thus, circulating B cells appear to be the zzso drug resistant component of the zzso zzso zzso This report suggests that successful therapeutic strategies will be those that target circulating B zzso zzso methods involving zzso of zzso are likely to improve depletion of these cells by compromising their ability to exclude zzso This work suggests that circulating zzso B cells should be monitored in clinical trials to confirm their depletion and the overall efficacy of novel treatment zzso
