Six small molecular mass, zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor proteins from tobacco zzso zzso leaves were isolated to zzso The zzso zzso called tobacco zzso inhibitor zzso have molecular masses of approximately zzso to zzso D, calculated from gel zzso analysis and zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of the entire 53 zzso of one zzso zzso and the sequence of 36 zzso acid zzso from the N zzso of a second zzso zzso were zzso The two zzso differ only at zzso 11, which is zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso are members of the potato inhibitor II family and show considerable identity with the small molecular mass members of this family, which include the eggplant zzso two small molecular mass zzso and zzso zzso from potatoes, and an inhibitor from zzso of the ornamental plant zzso zzso zzso produced against the zzso in rabbits were used in zzso zzso to zzso both the systemic wound zzso of zzso in tobacco leaves and its zzso levels in zzso
