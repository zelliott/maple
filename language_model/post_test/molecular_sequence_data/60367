The zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for signaling via the T cell zzso However, the exact mechanism of their zzso is zzso Recent crystal structures of zzso zzso suggest that an important mechanism of zzso zzso is via engagement of the zzso zzso zzso domain by zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we identified several T cell membrane proteins that contain potential zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso can be activated by zzso motifs in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Supporting a role for zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso signaling in both transformed and primary T cells requires zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso
