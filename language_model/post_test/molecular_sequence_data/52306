zzso D is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains one zzso zzso Each lobe also contains protein zzso that serve as recognition zzso for binding of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso In this study we examined whether the location of the protein recognition domain influences the relative zzso of the zzso and zzso lobe zzso To do this, zzso proteins containing either zzso or zzso lobe sequences of zzso D zzso into a zzso form of the zzso zzso protein zzso were expressed in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso lobe zzso were then isolated from the various zzso proteins and independently analyzed for their zzso zzso zzso This analysis has shown that a zzso recognition domain located on either lobe of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to allow zzso of zzso on both zzso However, zzso of the zzso on the lobe containing the recognition domain is zzso We also found that the majority of the zzso lobe zzso of zzso D acquire two zzso whereas the zzso lobe zzso only acquire one zzso
