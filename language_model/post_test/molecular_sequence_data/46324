The genes involved in the zzso of zzso were identified in the zzso fungus zzso zzso through zzso searches and zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso Whereas the zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by distinct genes in bacteria and the zzso zzso zzso both activities are performed in zzso zzso by a single zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso Such a zzso zzso gene is a genetic feature common to numerous members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in plants and zzso However, unlike in other zzso the three bio genes contributing to the four zzso steps from zzso to zzso are organized in a gene cluster in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all found to have zzso in the zzso acid zzso domain of the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is an inconvenient marker in classical genetic zzso due to zzso of zzso transformation of the zzso zzso with the zzso gene from either zzso zzso or zzso zzso led to the recovery of zzso zzso zzso The usefulness of zzso gene as a novel and robust transformation marker was demonstrated in zzso experiments with a green fluorescent protein reporter, and in the efficient deletion of the zzso zzso gene via zzso zzso in a zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso
