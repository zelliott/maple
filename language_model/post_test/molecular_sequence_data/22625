zzso comprises a recently identified family of zzso zzso proteins which is implicated in diverse biological functions, such as immune regulation, protein quality control, and membrane zzso We previously identified zzso as a binding partner of zzso 6, which plays a role in zzso protein zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of zzso which is the closest zzso of zzso It is broadly expressed at relatively high levels in zzso zzso and zzso An zzso study of zzso cells demonstrated that zzso is present in peripheral zzso partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso and strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is associated with zzso 6 and zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso motif and zzso finger are essential for the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso effect on zzso zzso The location, associated zzso and effects of zzso suggest that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso trafficking in zzso
