The binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated toward several structurally defined zzso zzso immobilized on zzso gel zzso or plastic zzso In both zzso systems the zzso zzso type zzso zzso see zzso were more strongly bound than zzso zzso A considerable binding was observed to the zzso zzso backbone in the absence of zzso but not to a zzso analogue or zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso zzso zzso for other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to terminal or zzso zzso or zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso These studies, together with earlier reports that zzso binding to zzso is inhibited by zzso highlight the relative importance of zzso in the adhesive specificity of this zzso
