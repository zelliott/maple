The C zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is unusually large zzso zzso due to the presence of 330 zzso acids zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The sequence following the core, including a zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso We have characterized the zzso activity and stability of C zzso zzso in sequences outside the zzso core and we have analyzed their ability to interact with the R zzso and with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso carrying deletions in the zzso domain displayed little difference in their kinetic properties and retained their capacity to be inhibited by R zzso and by zzso In contrast, the zzso of one or both of the zzso zzso in the zzso motif resulted in a decrease of zzso activity and stability of the zzso zzso by the R zzso or by zzso were however zzso zzso analysis of other protein zzso revealed that a zzso motif is present in many zzso protein zzso although its location at the very end of the zzso is a particular feature of the zzso zzso We propose that the presence of this motif may serve to identify zzso of protein zzso
