T cell zzso zzso V alpha and V beta chain usage of zzso zzso zzso class I restricted zzso zzso T cells zzso was determined from zzso obtained from peripheral blood of patients with zzso associated neurological zzso To characterize zzso repertoire, zzso zzso from peripheral blood were cloned in limiting zzso and the resulting zzso were screened for zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso restricted zzso tax zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lines and zzso was analyzed by zzso amplification using V alpha and V beta chain zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso T cell lines from zzso zzso patients express a limited repertoire of T cell zzso chains which may correlate with duration and severity of zzso The restricted use of zzso genes expressed by zzso zzso may play a critical role in the zzso of zzso and may be of value in developing zzso strategies that focus on eliminating these cells or zzso their zzso
