Two genes code for zzso zzso peptides zzso One expresses by zzso alternate zzso zzso and zzso I zzso the other zzso II zzso zzso is the marker of sporadic or zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II expression is not well established in normal or zzso zzso After amplification by zzso chain reaction, zzso I and II zzso were detected in six cases of zzso associated with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and in two cases of isolated zzso zzso I was detected in all zzso cell zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso II was barely zzso in three out of six zzso zzso II could be a specific zzso marker of zzso
