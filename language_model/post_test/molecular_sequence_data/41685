The zzso proteins zzso are known both as the receptors for zzso drugs and as zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso rotation of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the inclusion of at least one zzso domain zzso the zzso site for zzso and the active site for zzso zzso The zzso form large and diverse families in most organisms, with the largest zzso families occurring in higher zzso Plant zzso are molecular zzso that interact with specific protein partners to regulate a diversity of cellular zzso Recent studies have found that plant zzso operate in intricate and coordinated mechanisms for regulating stress response and development zzso and discoveries of new interaction partners expand their cellular influences to gene expression and zzso zzso This review presents an examination of the molecular and structural features and functional roles of the higher plant zzso family within the context of these recent findings, and discusses the significance of domain conservation and variation for the development of a diverse, versatile and complex zzso zzso
