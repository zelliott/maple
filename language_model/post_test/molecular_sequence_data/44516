zzso of some components within the zzso zzso with the presence of zzso precursors found early in the zzso processing zzso Specifically, after most zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been depleted by incubation of zzso kidney cells in zzso zzso zzso D for 4 zzso only zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are retained in the zzso as compared with control zzso These zzso components are important for processing steps in the zzso that gives rise to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which is used for zzso and zzso zzso production, is fully retained in the zzso after zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso is in a different category than zzso and zzso zzso and zzso It is proposed that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso bind to the external transcribed zzso or internal transcribed zzso 1, and when these binding sites are lost after zzso D treatment some of these components cannot be retained in the zzso Other binding sites may also exist, which would explain why only some and not all of these components are lost from the zzso
