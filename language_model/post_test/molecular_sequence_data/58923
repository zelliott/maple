zzso is a B zzso surface zzso which may play an important role in interactions between B cells and other cells and in regulating signals through the B cell zzso zzso zzso Here we have examined whether the mouse is a suitable in zzso model for studying zzso zzso In primary and secondary zzso zzso of adult mice zzso is on all mature B cells, including resting zzso B cells, zzso zzso memory B cells, zzso plasma cells and zzso B cells, but it is not on immature zzso B zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso in some, but not all, zzso B zzso and zzso cell zzso as with human zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso on zzso after zzso of the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso expression was zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 was zzso in order to identify potential DNA regulatory elements in the zzso promoter zzso Consensus sequences for zzso factor binding sites including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present, but no classical zzso elements or zzso motifs were evident at relevant zzso The zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso 1 was sufficient for directing zzso promoter activity in B and T zzso There was no significant sequence similarity between the zzso and human zzso gene zzso although both contain repetitive elements and zzso and zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso zzso shares a number of features with human zzso and the mouse provides a suitable model system for zzso the function of zzso in zzso
