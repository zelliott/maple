A series of key zzso acids involved in zzso zzso binding and zzso activity of rat brain zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso domain is at the zzso end and restricted to a maximum of 275 zzso acids zzso and zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, newly prepared zzso and zzso zzso have been compared both for zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso When the protein was expressed from zzso to zzso the activity was lost but zzso binding was zzso Another deletion zzso that had lost only four zzso acids after zzso had lost zzso zzso and this finding suggests that these zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso To further support the data, we have produced two zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso The two new zzso were designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed similar zzso and zzso values for zzso and zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was totally inactive but had kept the ability to bind to zzso zzso deletion zzso that had lost five, seven or nine zzso acids showed a large decrease in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso One zzso that had lost five zzso acids zzso was zzso to apparent zzso zzso values for both zzso appeared unchanged but zzso was decreased zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso a positively charged zzso acid zzso zzso is essential for zzso binding and zzso zzso acids at the zzso end of the protein are necessary to act as a catalyst in the zzso zzso zzso
