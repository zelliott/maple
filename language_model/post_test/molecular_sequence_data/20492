The regulatory factor X zzso family of zzso factors has been recently implicated in gene regulation during zzso However, the relative expression of individual members during this zzso process is not completely zzso particularly in the case of zzso which has multiple transcript zzso in the zzso We used reverse zzso real-time zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso to compare transcripts and protein levels for this family in cell populations from the three major zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were present at trace to low levels in zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso were elevated in zzso zzso zzso however, the dominant zzso transcript present begins at a downstream zzso and lacks the DNA binding zzso zzso for all four genes were elevated in early zzso cells zzso zzso In these cells zzso transcripts originate primarily from a newly described promoter with zzso 1 but are expected to be zzso compromised due to a poorly situated start zzso Western zzso confirmed that zzso is greatly elevated beginning in zzso and also confirmed that full-length zzso protein is not prevalent in mouse zzso at any zzso These results imply that zzso is the most likely X box binding factor to influence novel gene expression during zzso that zzso may all play roles in zzso cells but that zzso is much less prevalent than implied by its high transcript zzso
