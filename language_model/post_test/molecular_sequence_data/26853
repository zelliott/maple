Heat shock protein zzso zzso proteins zzso are thought to function as zzso proteins to link the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso during the processing of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of three zzso repeat zzso zzso of which the first zzso binds to zzso the second zzso binds to zzso and the third zzso is of unknown zzso zzso to most other zzso the zzso closest to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso domain and the short zzso region connecting it to zzso questioning the reported function as an zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We observed high zzso expression levels of zzso and detected significant zzso upon zzso linking the protein to functions in zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed physical interactions with both zzso zzso and zzso albeit only the interaction with zzso is strong and zzso of the zzso zzso activity can be observed upon binding of zzso However, the formation of zzso complexes with both zzso zzso is impaired, as zzso and zzso compete for zzso interaction sites, in particular as zzso binds to both zzso zzso simultaneously and requires both zzso zzso for zzso zzso These results imply that, at least in zzso zzso essential functions of zzso exist which apparently do not depend on the simultaneous binding of zzso and zzso to zzso
