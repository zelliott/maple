zzso of zzso zzso is crucial in many zzso including development, memory and cell zzso The 3' untranslated region is a rich zzso of regulatory elements that bind proteins and zzso Here we focus on zzso zzso an important family of zzso regulatory proteins crucial in stem-cell zzso pattern formation and synaptic zzso We show that two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of a single zzso zzso in the middle of an zzso site, whereas zzso requires its zzso A discrete protein segment is responsible for the zzso We propose that a structural distortion in the central region of zzso zzso the requirement for the additional zzso and that this mode of zzso specificity may be zzso We suggest that new zzso can be designed and selected using the zzso zzso
