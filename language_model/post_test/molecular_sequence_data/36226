Eight unrelated patients with Hunter syndrome were investigated for expression of zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso linked to zzso chain reaction zzso or zzso The entire coding region was studied by amplification of two overlapping segments of zzso and zzso zzso Seven children with Hunter syndrome had zzso products indistinguishable in size from zzso One patient, with clinically severe disease, did not produce either zzso product although zzso for a control gene was readily zzso This method rapidly identifies patients having absent or zzso abnormal zzso zzso and may be useful in investigating zzso zzso
