The zzso drive system on zzso abnormal zzso 10 zzso is contained within a terminal domain of zzso that extends the long arm of zzso to approximately zzso times the size of normal zzso zzso zzso type I zzso does not recombine with normal zzso 10 zzso over an approximately zzso terminal region of the long zzso Comparative zzso mapping demonstrates that multiple independent zzso are responsible for the current organization of zzso including a set of zzso zzso and at least one long zzso segment at the end of the zzso Four major zzso drive functions, zzso the zzso effect, zzso zzso zzso activity, and the zzso tip function, all map to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity (the fifth known drive zzso is zzso in the type II zzso of zzso and maps to a central region that may include a second zzso zzso Both zzso activity and the zzso effect behave as dominant zzso zzso consistent with the view that zzso drive involves new or alien gene zzso These and other data suggest that the zzso zzso drive system was initially acquired from a related species and that a complex zzso evolved around zzso
