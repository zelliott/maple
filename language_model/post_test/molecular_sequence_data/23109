zzso B zzso zzso zzso 3G zzso is a potent inhibitor of infection by a wide range of zzso Although recent reports have suggested that human zzso exerts zzso activity against zzso B virus, zzso expression is normally low in the human zzso To clarify the role of zzso in cellular defenses against zzso zzso the regulation of the zzso expression was investigated in human zzso zzso transcripts of nine zzso family members were barely zzso in zzso liver zzso However, zzso was significantly zzso in response to zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso and primary human zzso zzso regulatory factor elements that are important for zzso promoter activity were identified zzso upstream from the human zzso zzso Our findings provided the first evidence showing that zzso is induced by zzso stimulation in human zzso and thus could be involved in host defense mechanisms directed against zzso zzso
