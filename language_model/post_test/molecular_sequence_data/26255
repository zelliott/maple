The influence of the zzso zzso zzso gene product upon the interaction of the zzso zzso protein zzso with the zzso promoter has been examined using in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the upstream zzso sequence zzso of the zzso promoter in the presence of the zzso protein was observed under zzso growth zzso Growth in the presence of zzso or addition of zzso to zzso cells diminished the interaction of zzso with the zzso when zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso may therefore involve an interaction between zzso and zzso which reduces the affinity of zzso for the zzso
