This study analyses the frequency and the potential role of two zzso the zzso located in the gene zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso in the gene zzso for zzso zzso type A zzso in a cohort of 98 consecutive patients with pulmonary zzso hypertension from two different zzso Units zzso of zzso and in 100 healthy Caucasian subjects randomly recruited from the same zzso zzso anatomy and function were zzso by non invasive diagnostic imaging techniques zzso standard zzso zzso zzso and by invasive studies zzso zzso zzso screening of the region of interest was performed by automated zzso At zzso analysis, patients with the zzso zzso zzso show a lower cardiac index (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a higher zzso pulmonary vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso at cardiac zzso A zzso zzso model shows idiopathic disease zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pulmonary vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as independent zzso of zzso zzso Our findings may suggest a potential link between specific zzso in the zzso gene and zzso for zzso
