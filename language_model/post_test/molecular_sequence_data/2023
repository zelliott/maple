In zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso shows the seven members of the zzso complex to be zzso expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system and in zzso derivatives zzso and zzso Beginning at the zzso end of the zzso each successive gene displays a more anterior boundary of expression in the central nervous zzso A zzso position in the zzso cluster therefore reflects its relative domain of expression along the zzso axis of the zzso a feature observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso cluster with other mouse and zzso zzso genes have defined zzso of related zzso in the mouse there are four clusters related by zzso and zzso zzso shows a clear relationship among genes in the mouse and zzso complexes, based on relative position, sequence identity, and zzso of expression along the zzso zzso Our results argue that these complexes arose from a common zzso present before the divergence of lineages that gave rise to zzso and zzso
