We studied zzso production in serial serum samples from patients with acute zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed both by zzso zzso zzso zzso using a synthetic zzso zzso derived from the zzso repeating region of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso and by zzso In prior studies, we have shown that patients with acute zzso infection make zzso zzso that react with this zzso that recognize a zzso protein zzso and that bind with a number of proteins present in zzso zzso however, zzso binding to these zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso did not appear until months after the disease and were specific for the zzso zzso We now find that patients with acute zzso infection but not those with acute infections from a variety of other zzso organisms also produce zzso zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso These zzso also appear to recognize the same cellular proteins as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared in all acutely infected zzso patients studied and occurred both in patients with previous zzso infections and in one patient studied who had not previously been exposed to zzso It appears that infection with zzso or zzso can induce the synthesis of a very similar or identical set of zzso zzso
