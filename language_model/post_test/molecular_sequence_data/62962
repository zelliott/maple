We zzso a zzso zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso of northern shrimp zzso borealis by several zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed the highest specificity for zzso zzso at zzso a specificity pattern similar to zzso S and K whereas zzso and zzso zzso were not suitable as zzso zzso However, unlike these zzso it accepted zzso almost equally to the zzso zzso at zzso The shrimp zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso while zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso remained largely zzso Next, we determined the primary structure of the shrimp zzso by molecular cloning and investigated the zzso zzso the zzso zzso which is possibly involved in its unusual zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the shrimp zzso shared the highest identity of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso from zzso but its identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and K fell within zzso ranges of zzso However, the shrimp zzso differed from these zzso in some key zzso including, for example, the unique occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso at the structurally important zzso zzso Interestingly, transcripts of this zzso were exclusively detected in the shrimp gut coinciding with its broad pH activity and stability profiles, which is also unusual as a zzso zzso These results suggest that the shrimp zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and K, but is distinct from each of these zzso in both zzso and structural zzso
