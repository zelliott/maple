The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso has potent effects on zzso insulin zzso insulin gene zzso and pancreatic zzso cell formation and is presently in clinical trials as a therapy for type 2 diabetes zzso We report on the effects of zzso and two of its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso proliferation and zzso and on the metabolism of two zzso proteins in the rat zzso zzso cell line, which has been shown to express the zzso zzso We observed that zzso and zzso induced zzso outgrowth in a manner similar to nerve growth factor zzso which was reversed by zzso with the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso could promote zzso differentiation and may rescue zzso cells after zzso zzso These effects were induced in the absence of cellular dysfunction and toxicity as zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that such peptides may be used in reversing or halting the neurodegenerative process observed in neurodegenerative diseases, such as the peripheral zzso associated with type 2 diabetes zzso and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso Due to its novel twin action, zzso and zzso have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic peripheral zzso and these central nervous system zzso
