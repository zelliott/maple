zzso studies of zzso states, both fully unfolded and partially zzso give insight into the zzso and interactions formed during zzso Although the complete structural characterization of partially folded proteins is a very difficult task, the identification of structured subsets, such as zzso zzso is of value in understanding the structural organization of such zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso in zzso conditions zzso zzso of a zzso zzso cluster localized in the core of bovine zzso 

The existence of a small zzso cluster present in the zzso protein family has been assessed on the basis of structural alignment and zzso data obtained for the partially folded bovine zzso The presence of the cluster had been predicted identifying those zzso that are highly zzso in most members of the zzso An zzso study conducted at pH 2, where the protein exhibits a very stable zzso together with zzso regions, reveals the presence of zzso among zzso of 11 zzso zzso centered around zzso and pointing towards the interior of the zzso This buried cluster is found to be unusually stable at pH 2, not only at room temperature but also at zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso pointing towards the surface of the protein define a zzso surface patch located in a groove between the strands and the zzso 

The detected buried cluster most likely plays an important role in bovine zzso zzso The analysis of five structurally related proteins reveals that the same extended cluster is present in these zzso We propose that the buried cluster may represent the internal binding site as well and that the zzso surface patch is involved in a second external binding zzso
