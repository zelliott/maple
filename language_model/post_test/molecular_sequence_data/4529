Four zzso zzso zzso the chicken adult zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso major muscle zzso library using zzso DNA zzso These clones were zzso and then zzso into a zzso zzso chicken adult zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso consists of zzso zzso with 19 zzso zzso region and 34 zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso encodes a zzso zzso whose molecular weight is 223 zzso The calculated zzso point of this protein is approximately zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence and comparison with a previously published zzso sequence of the same zzso zzso reveals that six zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso analysis of this adult zzso zzso sequence shows a similar pattern as the embryonic zzso A zzso zzso carrying this full-length adult zzso zzso has also been generated and expressed in the zzso insect cell zzso A approximately zzso zzso zzso was zzso and reacted specifically with chicken adult zzso zzso zzso
