Several human milk zzso inhibit human pathogens in zzso and in animal zzso In an infant, the ability of these zzso to offer protection from enteric pathogens would require that they withstand structural modification as they pass through the zzso canal or are absorbed and zzso in zzso We investigated the fate of human milk zzso during transit through the zzso canal by determining the degree to which zzso zzso urine and zzso zzso resembled those of their zzso zzso zzso profiles of milk from 16 breast-feeding mothers were compared with profiles of stool and urine from their zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso profiles obtained from the urine and feces of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In all cases, zzso were zzso zzso reduced, and separated into zzso and neutral zzso the latter were zzso and subjected to zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso were determined by mass zzso after zzso Among zzso zzso zzso of zzso were higher in feces than in zzso milk, and much higher in feces than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso infants resembled those in their zzso zzso Those from zzso infants did not resemble human milk zzso were found at much lower zzso and probably resulted from zzso of zzso zzso or from zzso zzso Most of the human milk zzso survived transit through the gut, and some were absorbed and then zzso into the urine intact, zzso that zzso of zzso and urinary pathogens by human milk zzso is quite likely in zzso zzso
