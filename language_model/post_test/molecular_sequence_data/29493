The human zzso gene encodes a basic zzso zzso zzso factor that is highly similar to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding region is contained within a single zzso We mapped zzso to zzso zzso zzso a region zzso to the segment of mouse zzso 10 where zzso (formerly zzso is zzso The evolutionary relationship between zzso and other zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso A direct comparison of zzso and zzso protein zzso to zzso also revealed a zzso distribution of zzso acid changes across the zzso domain, which may be related to their separate visual and zzso sensory zzso Among zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso This sequence conservation extends significantly beyond the coding zzso We define blocks of strong zzso in zzso human and mouse zzso DNA, which are likely to include zzso regulatory zzso Because targeted deletion of zzso causes zzso nerve zzso in mice, we propose zzso as a candidate for human zzso nerve zzso and related clinical zzso
