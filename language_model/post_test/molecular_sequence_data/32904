zzso of zzso signaling 2 zzso is a negative regulator of growth hormone zzso The deletion of zzso in mice results in a zzso increase in zzso zzso In an effort to identify zzso in the zzso gene that may be associated with body size in dogs, we characterized the canine zzso gene and analyzed its genetic diversity among small and large dog zzso The study was carried out on a total of 520 dogs from 66 different zzso Dogs were classified as large or small based on height and weight as determined by their respective American zzso Club breed zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the canine zzso gene were zzso in 32 dogs from different zzso Only one zzso sequence zzso zzso was detected which zzso to an zzso acid change zzso All samples were zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso were determined for each dog zzso The T zzso was distributed primarily among European large dog breeds with a gene frequency ranging from zzso to zzso The nature of the zzso change and the effect on the protein together with the finding of a zzso related to body size in the same zzso region by other researchers suggest canine zzso as a potential candidate gene for body size in zzso Future studies will be needed to clarify the role of the zzso zzso and its interaction with genes like growth hormone and zzso growth factor zzso
