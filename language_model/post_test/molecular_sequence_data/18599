zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso synaptic zzso and its abnormal level or activity contributes to cognitive zzso One crucial downstream zzso and direct zzso of zzso is zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which has important functions in spine zzso and action potential zzso The zzso of zzso activity toward zzso has the potential to treat zzso diseases, but the detailed mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso by zzso is not zzso zzso we examined zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and the full-length zzso protein using zzso zzso with different structural zzso zzso was found to be a highly efficient zzso zzso zzso that required both its zzso regulatory region and key zzso in its active zzso Specifically, both zzso interaction motif zzso and zzso sequence of zzso were required for zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso sequence region, zzso zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso zzso located in the KIM region were important in controlling zzso activity toward zzso Further kinetic experiments revealed subtle structural differences between zzso and zzso that affected the interactions of their zzso with zzso Moreover, zzso zzso specific positions of a zzso zzso sequence through its active site, and the contact of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were crucial zzso Taken together, our results not only provide the information for interactions between zzso and zzso but will also help in the development of specific strategies to target zzso recognition, which could serve as a potential therapy for neurological zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso important zzso zzso A detailed zzso zzso and cellular studies of zzso revealed that specific zzso in KIM and active site zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between the zzso zzso and the active site among different zzso zzso could be targeted to develop specific zzso zzso which has therapeutic potential for neurological zzso zzso protein zzso A & zzso nerve growth zzso
