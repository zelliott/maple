zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso type B were found to contain three different zzso molecules with approximate lengths of 11, 5 and 3 zzso The 11 zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a putative virus and is named zzso zzso type B zzso virus XL zzso zzso probably exists in an zzso zzso We identified two distinct zzso (10 374 and 10 375 zzso of zzso both of which coded for the same putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and contained four regions similar to putative viral zzso zzso box zzso viral zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso While a zzso region with several zzso motifs in zzso was similar to that of putative zzso cluster analyses of zzso regions revealed zzso to be distinct from a broad range of viral zzso but most closely related to zzso zzso virus zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso represents a novel virus group related to zzso
