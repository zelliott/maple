A zzso library in zzso zzso zzso from zzso human fetal brain zzso was screened using a human liver zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The complete sequence of the positive zzso zzso showed that the coding region and a part of the zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso are identical to the corresponding published sequence of the liver zzso However, a particularly noteworthy difference is the presence of 279 zzso of additional sequence in the FB zzso Northern zzso analysis of FB zzso showed it to be a part of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with the zzso and zzso databases showed it to be zzso zzso and zzso similar to segments from human, mouse and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in all these cases, only a part of this zzso sequence has been found in the zzso zzso We therefore conclude that in zzso the zzso sequence is a part of the mature zzso zzso zzso analysis also suggests a differential zzso site selection in the production of zzso zzso in FB and zzso
