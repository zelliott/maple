The zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso contain a number of different, zzso zzso some of which zzso into a zzso zzso An zzso probe was zzso based on partial zzso acid sequences determined by chemical methods, and used to screen a zzso library constructed from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso The longest positive zzso found were zzso using the zzso zzso chain termination zzso One complete clone was zzso clone 5A, zzso bases long, contained 59 bases of zzso zzso an open reading frame of zzso bases coding for 147 zzso acids and a zzso region of zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso was in agreement with the partial zzso acid sequences obtained by chemical zzso Three additional zzso obtained in the screening were also zzso the zzso zzso acid sequences proved to be partial zzso sequences which were different from each other and from the sequence of zzso Thus, the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso of zzso probably consists of at least four different zzso chains much like the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with the two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that they share 54 identical zzso At 74 positions, the identical zzso in zzso and zzso differ from the corresponding zzso in zzso including at zzso where zzso has a zzso zzso in contrast to zzso in zzso and zzso The alignment of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their templates were used to examine the principal differences between the two types of zzso zzso zzso They appear to consist of uncommon surface zzso acid zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso E10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso One or more of these zzso could be responsible for the zzso exhibited by the zzso zzso zzso
