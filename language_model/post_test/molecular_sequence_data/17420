The disease caused by infectious zzso virus zzso produces great economic for the poultry zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular epidemiology of zzso in zzso An old zzso strain isolated in 1964 and another 31 strains isolated from 1991 to 2003 were selected for zzso zzso gene zzso Based on their zzso tree, 13 strains were selected for sequencing the entire zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that Taiwanese zzso strains could be divided into two distinct zzso Taiwan Group I and Taiwan Group II, with one Massachusetts strain and one Chinese zzso No zzso was found between zzso and the Taiwanese strains in the zzso zzso However, the zzso gene showed a noticeably higher divergence than the N zzso The zzso trees constructed from the zzso and N genes indicate that zzso zzso has zzso Since most local strains are in Taiwanese zzso developing vaccines from local strains is necessary for zzso control in zzso
