zzso zzso withdrawal is a zzso process inducing cell death in activated T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a protein modulating zzso zzso zzso by zzso various signaling zzso We report here that zzso deprivation leads to expression of zzso in T zzso We then characterized the human zzso promoter and showed that zzso zzso box class zzso binding to the zzso responsive elements identified in the promoter is necessary for induction of zzso expression upon zzso zzso To assess the functional consequences of this zzso we used 2 strategies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protects zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso whereas cell death is accelerated in cells unable to express zzso zzso the expression of zzso is inhibited in zzso cells and enhanced when zzso expression is zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that leads to zzso of zzso expression but also to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expressed protein induced upon zzso withdrawal that protects T cells from the onset of zzso
