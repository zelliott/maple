The molecular basis for the ability of bacteria to live on caffeine as a sole carbon and nitrogen source is zzso zzso zzso zzso which grows on several zzso zzso zzso caffeine and related zzso via sequential zzso to zzso zzso of caffeine by zzso was previously attributed to one zzso zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report that zzso and zzso are actually two independent zzso zzso iron zzso with zzso and zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso for both zzso is dependent on electron transfer from zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso itself is a novel protein with one zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso per zzso All ndm genes are located in a zzso zzso DNA zzso which also contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned as zzso fusion zzso expressed in zzso coli, and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of caffeine, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso caffeine, and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso was produced from each zzso group zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso has been confirmed zzso This is the first report of bacterial zzso genes that enable bacteria to live on zzso These genes represent a new class of zzso zzso and have the potential to produce zzso animal feed, and pharmaceuticals from coffee and tea zzso
