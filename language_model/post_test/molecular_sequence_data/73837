The molecular cloning and zzso sequencing of the zzso hormone zzso zzso represented an enhanced step in the experimental effort to understand this key zzso in the zzso process at a cell and molecular zzso A subsequent step in this broad effort is zzso expression of the zzso in model cell systems for studies of signal zzso and zzso processes that may require zzso detection of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso at its zzso using zzso DNA procedures with the zzso zzso that is bound by a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing this zzso bound zzso zzso zzso with the expected high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso stained by the zzso zzso Signal zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso of zzso cell zzso expressing the zzso revealed protein bands at 67, 57, and 32 zzso zzso occurred when the zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso was reacted with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the presence of the zzso demonstrated either by its binding of zzso or by its detection on Western zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso cells was evoked by a five zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of such cells during zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso was not associated with zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the high-yield zzso zzso cell system: the membrane zzso bound zzso with slightly lowered affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and in Western blots yielded protein bands of 32, zzso 69, and zzso zzso The development and validation of these zzso systems will permit the study of several zzso zzso processes that are poorly zzso
