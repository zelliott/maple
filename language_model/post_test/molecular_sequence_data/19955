A surface zzso strategy that produces zzso with zzso zzso density is critical to investigating the role of zzso interactions in regulating cell zzso zzso migration, proliferation and zzso zzso this end, we have designed and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain flanked by two zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso end zzso of zzso zzso onto surfaces and zzso associate into zzso zzso forming a zzso coating zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso coating was found to render both zzso zzso and zzso scaffolds zzso to zzso A zzso sequence was inserted in the middle domain of zzso zzso the protein zzso and found to introduce zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence did not significantly impact the surface activity of zzso allowing us to zzso the zzso surface density simply by adjusting the relative ratios of the two zzso zzso density dependent zzso interactions were demonstrated in human zzso zzso human zzso vein zzso cells, and rat neural stem zzso The versatility to zzso a range of different zzso surfaces, combined with the ease of controlling surface zzso density, makes these zzso proteins an attractive tool for developing zzso surface zzso with tailored zzso zzso
