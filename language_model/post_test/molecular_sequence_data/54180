A novel zzso strain zzso zzso zzso showing high zzso activity under zzso zzso conditions was isolated and zzso The zzso is Gram negative, short rod zzso and zzso and displays effective production of zzso zzso and other zzso from cellulose zzso zzso under optimal conditions zzso and pH zzso zzso zzso of the cellulose was zzso in modified zzso zzso medium containing zzso zzso and the zzso production yield and specific production rate reached 375 zzso g zzso and zzso zzso g zzso zzso respectively, after a zzso zzso To our knowledge, this represents the highest zzso yield and specific rate from cellulose for zzso bacterial zzso reported so zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is capable of rapid conversion of cellulose to zzso with potential zzso applications under zzso zzso
