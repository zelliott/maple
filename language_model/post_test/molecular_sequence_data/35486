DNA zzso were obtained for 81 butterfly species belonging to 52 zzso from sites in north-central Pakistan to test the utility of zzso for their identification and to gain a better understanding of regional zzso zzso These species represent zzso of the butterfly zzso of Pakistan and belong to five families, although the zzso were dominant, zzso 38% of the total zzso zzso analysis showed that maximum zzso divergence was zzso while there was zzso divergence from the nearest zzso zzso zzso records for 55 species showed zzso sequence divergence to records in the zzso of Life Data Systems zzso but only 26 of these cases involved specimens from zzso India and Central zzso Analysis revealed that most species showed little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a zzso increase was noted in a few zzso There was a clear gap between maximum zzso and minimum nearest zzso distance for all 81 zzso zzso cluster analysis showed that members of each species formed a zzso cluster with strong zzso zzso The zzso results revealed two provisional species that could not be clearly linked to known zzso while 24 other species gained their first zzso Future work should extend the zzso reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan as well as zzso countries to gain a better understanding of regional variation in zzso sequences in this zzso and zzso complex zzso
