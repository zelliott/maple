Members of the human zzso family, now renamed zzso for zzso zzso zzso proteins with two tandem copies of a zzso zzso There are three members of this family, two have been isolated at the sites of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The function of the zzso motifs is at present zzso We found that the zzso gene is highly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso As a first step to obtain a model system for studying the function of the zzso motifs we have isolated the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso appears to have only one zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso library, zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso A second transcript with an alternative zzso end was identified in zzso from zzso The zzso zzso protein consists of two tandem copies of the zzso zzso domain characteristic of the human zzso family and an extended zzso and zzso zzso which is not present in the human zzso The zzso acid sequence similarity with human zzso and zzso in zzso 1 is zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition a short stretch of 25 zzso with a zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso is found in the 3' zzso zzso like zzso has an zzso after the second zzso zzso region, which is not present in zzso It is expressed zzso and at a high level in early zzso as well as in zzso Interestingly we observed that the zzso protein is zzso related to zzso and can be detected by zzso in early cellular zzso zzso The gene was zzso to a genetically well characterized region zzso on the X zzso opening the way for identification of zzso
