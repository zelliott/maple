DNA from the scarlet zzso region of zzso zzso has been cloned by zzso walking, using the zzso of a new zzso third zzso inversion zzso which breaks in the scarlet zzso and rosy zzso zzso Two spontaneous zzso of zzso and zzso contain insertions of zzso DNA located within zzso zzso of the site of the inversion zzso used to isolate the zzso and a second scarlet inversion breaks within zzso zzso of this zzso However no changes zzso by Southern zzso were found in 5 zzso zzso zzso with zzso normal third zzso A zzso transcript arising from the zzso gene region (as defined by zzso analysis and DNA zzso has been zzso This transcript is present throughout development at low levels, with a peak level during the early to zzso zzso The size and amount of this transcript is altered in zzso and its amount is drastically reduced in zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso show normal levels of expression of the zzso transcript, suggesting that the zzso gene does not regulate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso between sequences from the zzso zzso unit and a zzso carrying coding information from the white gene has been zzso This suggests that the zzso and w proteins are zzso they appear to belong to a family of zzso zzso proteins involved in the transport of zzso precursors into zzso
