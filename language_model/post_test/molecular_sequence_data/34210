zzso zzso zzso has a key role in the regulation of zzso metabolism and cell survival, but the molecular identity of the zzso channel, the zzso calcium zzso is still zzso Here we have identified in zzso a protein (named zzso that shares tissue distribution with zzso (also known as zzso a recently characterized zzso regulator, is present in organisms in which zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated and whose sequence includes two zzso zzso Short interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso doubled the zzso zzso concentration increase evoked by zzso zzso zzso thus significantly zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein showed channel activity in zzso zzso zzso with zzso properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the zzso A zzso zzso in which two zzso charged zzso of the putative zzso region were zzso had no channel activity and reduced zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso when zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these data demonstrate that the zzso protein identified is the channel responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso thus providing a molecular basis for this process of utmost zzso and pathological zzso
