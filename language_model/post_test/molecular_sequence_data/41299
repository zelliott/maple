zzso zzso a key zzso zzso regulates diverse cellular processes by modulating the activity of a variety of zzso and zzso However, little is known about the biological function of zzso in plant zzso In this study, an zzso zzso zzso zzso factor was isolated as a zzso zzso zzso contains two putative zzso zzso zzso at the zzso Using domain mapping analysis, both predicted zzso were identified as authentic zzso zzso zzso We identified three zzso zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso were verified in zzso and plant zzso Based on zzso mobility shift zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of the zzso complex to two zzso motifs in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso relieved the suppression of zzso zzso by zzso not only in transient expression zzso of zzso but also by the zzso of a zzso negative form of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso a calcium zzso can be involved in the zzso control of zzso zzso genes by the zzso of zzso under the condition of higher levels of zzso in zzso
