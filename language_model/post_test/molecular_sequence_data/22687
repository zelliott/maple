Growth of the zzso zzso zzso on methanol zzso the expression of genes whose products are required for its zzso Three of the methanol zzso zzso are located in an zzso called the zzso As a result, both methanol zzso zzso and proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso are induced in response to this zzso The most highly regulated of these genes is zzso which encodes alcohol zzso the first zzso of the methanol pathway, and a zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for methanol regulation, we identify genes required for the expression of zzso zzso in one zzso named zzso zzso expression regulator 1), result in strains that are unable to zzso grow on the zzso zzso methanol and zzso acid, zzso induce the zzso of zzso and other methanol zzso and zzso zzso and zzso form zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso encodes a large protein with a zinc finger zzso domain near its N zzso that has similarity to zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso is localized to the nucleus in cells grown on methanol or other zzso zzso Finally, zzso specifically binds to sequences upstream of zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso factor that is necessary for the zzso of many genes in response to zzso We propose that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but that it has gained new functions and lost others through evolution as a result of changes in the spectrum of genes that it zzso
