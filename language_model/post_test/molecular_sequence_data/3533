zzso rejection of transplanted zzso is the major cause of graft loss after clinical solid organ zzso Recent data link the indirect presentation of zzso to chronic graft zzso thus, identification of zzso zzso on major zzso complex zzso zzso could significantly contribute to establishing novel ways for monitoring and managing chronic zzso Here, we show that synthetic zzso peptides covering the zzso region 56 to 120 of zzso zzso zzso In particular, the 2 zzso zzso peptides covering zzso 91 to 105 and 96 to zzso respectively, but not sequences from the zzso zzso were presented by zzso peripheral blood zzso to induce zzso zzso In addition, the 2 zzso zzso peptides and the zzso zzso zzso 60 to 75 zzso zzso of zzso target cells by zzso zzso T zzso zzso Although most zzso between 91 and 120 are normally not directly accessible to T cells, our results indicate that peptides derived from the lower surface of the zzso groove of zzso are zzso in zzso zzso To characterize the binding and stability of zzso to T cells, the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso that blocked zzso of zzso zzso zzso and coupled with zzso zzso The zzso specifically labeled zzso zzso but not zzso zzso as measured by flow zzso zzso binding to zzso was specific at 4 degrees C and remained stable for 12 hours, whereas it remained stable for less than 2 hours at 37 degrees zzso These studies allow the identification of zzso zzso zzso and reveal for the first time a novel, previously zzso application of synthetic zzso zzso to zzso zzso T zzso
