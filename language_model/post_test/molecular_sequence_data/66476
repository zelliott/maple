zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is an essential protein for cell viability for which functions in zzso membrane zzso and cell division have been zzso Using a fusion of green fluorescent protein to the C zzso of zzso we found that the zzso zzso is zzso inhibited when light zzso increase to 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso with an increased zzso potential of the reaction center zzso zzso and a decreased zzso potential of zzso Analysis reveals that membrane integration of the D1 precursor protein is affected, leading to the zzso of zzso in the membrane zzso We show that zzso interacts directly with the D1 protein and discuss why the zzso of zzso in two reaction center assembly zzso is dependent on zzso
