The zzso composition and primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined in zzso zzso The isolated zzso has a zzso composition identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both having six different zzso The molecular masses of the six zzso were 60, 50, 32, 17, 19, and 8 zzso and they were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, based on their zzso with zzso against the F1 zzso zzso from zzso zzso and by comparing their zzso zzso acid sequences with that deduced from the cloned genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso a and b found in many bacterial zzso zzso could not be detected either in the zzso zzso zzso or crude zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contained nine genes arranged in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced protein sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were comparable with those of the corresponding zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso spinach zzso and the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The analysis of total zzso by Northern zzso experiments reveals the presence of transcripts zzso of the genes zzso zzso and b zzso not found in the isolated zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso genes reveals overlap of the structural genes for the i and a zzso and the presence of secondary structures (in the b zzso which could influence the zzso regulation of the corresponding zzso
