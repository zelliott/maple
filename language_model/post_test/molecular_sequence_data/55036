zzso residing in the zzso of cattle represent a rich source of zzso zzso since their diet consists of zzso materials that are high in cellulose and zzso In this study, a zzso library was constructed from buffalo rumen contents using zzso zzso zzso zzso clones from the pooled library of approximately 10,000 clones showed degrading activity against zzso whereas four other clones showed activity against zzso zzso analysis of zzso data derived from the selected strongly positive clones revealed 15 zzso that were closely related to zzso zzso belonging to several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family 5 zzso was the most abundant zzso zzso found, and a majority of the zzso in our zzso were closely related to several zzso bacteria, especially ones from other buffalo rumen zzso zzso of zzso a selected clone with highest zzso activity from the primary plate screening zzso revealed a zzso zzso gene with optimal working conditions at pH zzso at 50 zzso Along with its stability over zzso zzso the capability efficiently to zzso cellulose in feed for broiler zzso as exhibited in an in zzso zzso test, suggests that zzso has potential application as a feed zzso
