zzso of zzso zzso from Riverside, California zzso and Hawaii zzso zzso distinct strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the expression of zzso zzso when zzso zzso zzso lines carrying both of these zzso zzso strains were generated by the transfer of infected zzso zzso into zzso zzso by zzso The zzso flies were zzso incompatible with both zzso and zzso zzso As a result of this pattern, the zzso state was observed to replace single infections in laboratory zzso The ability of the zzso to spread was modulated by the production of zzso infected offspring from zzso zzso strain segregation was observed under crowded zzso rearing zzso An inverse correlation between the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the degree of zzso crowding was also zzso The findings have implications for the evolution of zzso incompatible zzso and lead to the prediction that zzso should be relatively common in field zzso Evidence for a natural zzso in the zzso Aedes zzso is zzso The results also have applied significance for the generation of insect lines capable of driving desirable genes into populations already infected with zzso thus allowing repeated opportunities for population zzso
