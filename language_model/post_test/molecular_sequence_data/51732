zzso products of zzso the universal bacterial cell wall zzso were previously found in animal zzso and zzso zzso and quantitative analysis of available data lead to an original concept, zzso that zzso cells zzso zzso We present a model in which this zzso zzso zzso is essential for the processes of zzso cell division and sleep induction in zzso Genes for zzso zzso like those for zzso zzso in plants, are probably inherited from zzso bacteria, the ancestors of zzso and zzso zzso of this concept, zzso roles for zzso metabolism in tumor formation and in the biological clock, are supported by abundant zzso We propose that many interactions between bacteria and zzso are zzso by their common genetic zzso
