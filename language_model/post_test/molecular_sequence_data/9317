zzso is the major structural protein of the skin and its zzso are essential for its mechanical zzso In zzso skin, a decrease of the mature collagen zzso zzso was zzso In this study, we investigated the consequences and zzso of the reduced zzso 

In order to determine the consequences of reduced collagen zzso in zzso models of reduced collagen zzso were zzso The collagen synthesis and structure was analyzed using the signals second harmonic generation zzso and the zzso lifetime of the collagen zzso by a zzso laser scanning zzso 

zzso collagen zzso results in a zzso diminished collagen zzso a modified structure of the collagen fibers and zzso and a higher intensity of the zzso zzso The zzso signal might be influenced by the zzso of the collagen molecules within one collagen zzso Because of these findings, it can be speculated that reduced collagen zzso changes the zzso of single collagen molecules within the collagen zzso resulting in an enhanced zzso zzso Alternative explanations are zzso Furthermore, the zzso lifetime was reduced in the in zzso models of reduced collagen zzso In the zzso sites of the collagen zzso the main ratio of zzso is zzso As the zzso lifetime is determined not only by the fluorescent zzso itself but also by its zzso the change in the zzso lifetime might be explained by reduced zzso at the zzso zzso 

A reduction of collagen zzso (as seen in zzso zzso results in an increase of the zzso signal and a decrease of the zzso lifetime in zzso In zzso zzso of the two parameters might reveal the status of collagen zzso and therefore help to identify the status of zzso zzso or zzso using collagen zzso zzso
