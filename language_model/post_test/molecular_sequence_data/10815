zzso cloning of the zzso isolate of chicken anemia virus zzso which had been zzso 173 times in cell culture, resulted in the isolation of an attenuated strain, designated cloned isolate 10, which reverted to zzso following 10 passages in young zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Connor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Avian zzso zzso zzso The attenuated cloned isolate 10 differs from the zzso cloned zzso zzso isolate in that it possesses a zzso zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso and 17 individual zzso zzso dispersed throughout the zzso Comparative analyses with other published zzso sequences indicated that cloned isolate 10 was unique at nine zzso positions and at five zzso acid zzso The molecular basis of the zzso exhibited by cloned isolate 10 was investigated by evaluating the zzso of two sets of complementary zzso zzso These sets were produced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso that contained DNA sequences derived from cloned isolate 10 and the zzso cloned zzso zzso The construction of the zzso zzso exploited the occurrence of unique zzso zzso and zzso restriction sites, which allowed their respective circular zzso zzso to be manipulated as three restriction fragments of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the levels of anemia and gross pathology in the zzso and bone zzso of 14 zzso zzso zzso following infection of zzso zzso with the zzso and cloned parental zzso indicated that zzso changes in each of the three zzso regions contributed towards zzso The significance of this result to the development and use of live attenuated zzso vaccines is zzso
