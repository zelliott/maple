The occurrence of the zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in total bacterial community DNA isolated from different marine zzso The zzso technique was zzso together with most probable number statistics, to determine the abundance of the target zzso zzso All three genes could be zzso and the zzso zzso sequences predominated in all zzso The smallest amount of total community DNA in which the zzso zzso sequence could be detected was zzso zzso and on the basis of our results, we estimated that this sequence was present in 1 of 1,000 to 10,000 zzso zzso of the zzso products with the respective zzso zzso verified the zzso and zzso zzso sequences but only some of the zzso zzso amplification zzso The distribution and dissemination of zzso in natural bacterial communities are zzso
