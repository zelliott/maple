The type II zzso system zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso folded proteins across the outer membrane of zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms that govern the zzso process remain poorly zzso The inner membrane components zzso zzso and zzso possess a single zzso segment zzso and a large zzso region and they are thought to form a platform of unknown zzso Here, using zzso and pull-down zzso we performed a systematic mapping of the zzso interaction regions in the plant pathogen zzso zzso We found that the zzso of these components interact with each other, zzso a complex interaction network within the inner zzso We also showed that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso drive zzso and zzso of these zzso zzso bonding analyses revealed that the respective domain zzso include the equivalent zzso zzso suggesting alternating interactions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso Finally, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso domain mediate coordinated shifts or zzso of the zzso zzso These data suggest a plausible mechanism for signal transmission between the zzso and the zzso portions of the zzso zzso
