zzso zzso zzso zzso innate defense mechanisms is a prerequisite to the development of new protection strategies, based on the stimulation of plant signaling pathways to trigger pathogen zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso with similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes 1), a zzso and key signaling element of the salicylic acid zzso pathway, were recently isolated in zzso zzso In this study, functional characterization of zzso and zzso including zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a functional zzso of zzso whereas zzso likely has a different zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso restored plant growth at a high zzso zzso zzso Related 1 zzso gene expression after treatment with zzso or bacterial zzso and resistance to virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, stable zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in zzso nuclear zzso of the fusion protein and enhanced zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso plants zzso zzso exhibited an enhanced resistance to powdery zzso zzso This work highlights the importance of the zzso zzso signaling zzso for resistance to zzso pathogens in zzso zzso
