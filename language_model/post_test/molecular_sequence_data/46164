The Alpine lake zzso zzso zzso species complex is a classic example of a recent radiation, associated with colonization of the Alpine lakes following the glacial retreat (less than 15 zzso zzso They have formed a unique array of endemic lake zzso each with one to six described zzso species differing in zzso diet and zzso zzso Here, we present a zzso investigation of the relationships between and within the lake zzso Comparing the signal between over 1000 zzso zzso and zzso control region sequence data, we use zzso zzso and population genetic methods to reconstruct the zzso history of the group and to delineate the principal zzso of genetic diversity within the zzso We find significant zzso zzso showing that the zzso zzso Alpine zzso zzso arose from a hybrid swarm of at least two glacial zzso zzso Within this radiation, we find seven extant genetic clusters zzso on seven lake zzso Most interestingly, we find evidence of zzso zzso within and parallel evolution of equivalent zzso among these lake zzso However, we also find the genetic signature of zzso gene flow and diversity loss within many lakes, highlighting the fragility of recent zzso
