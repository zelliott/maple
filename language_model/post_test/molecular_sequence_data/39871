All plants, except for the zzso must reduce zzso to zzso in order to acquire zzso In zzso the zzso responsible for this zzso activity in the roots is zzso by zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated in a screen for plants that do not induce zzso zzso zzso activity in their roots in response to iron zzso zzso zzso plants are zzso and grow more slowly than zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso are smaller in size and possess dramatically fewer zzso zzso and zzso stacks when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso plants express both zzso and zzso zzso normally in their roots under iron zzso arguing against any defects in systemic zzso zzso Further, transgenic zzso plants accumulate zzso fusion protein under zzso conditions, suggesting that the zzso zzso acts zzso in reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to zzso to the plasma membrane of root zzso cells in both zzso and zzso transgenic plants when grown under zzso zzso zzso cloning revealed that the zzso zzso reside in zzso which encodes a component of one of the pathways responsible for the zzso of proteins into the zzso zzso of the zzso The presence of zzso zzso and protein in the roots of zzso plants suggests additional roles for this zzso in addition to its known function in targeting proteins to the zzso membrane in zzso
