zzso zzso depends upon the coordinated assembly of a large number of discrete zzso coat components to couple cargo selection with rapid zzso from the cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso complex binds not only to zzso and select cargo zzso but also to an extensive family of zzso accessory factors and alternate sorting zzso Physical associations between accessory proteins and zzso occur primarily through zzso or zzso zzso which engage an interaction surface positioned on the zzso platform zzso of the independently folded alpha zzso zzso Here, we find that the zzso interaction motif found in several zzso zzso including zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso binds a second interaction site on the zzso alpha zzso located on the zzso beta sandwich zzso Both alpha zzso binding sites can be engaged zzso and our data reveal that varied zzso of interaction motifs with different affinities for two sites upon the alpha zzso can provide a mechanism for zzso ordering of zzso accessory proteins during zzso zzso
