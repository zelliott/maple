The zzso zzso 1 zzso plays a key role in regulation of insulin zzso in pancreatic zzso In this study we investigated the mechanism for zzso expression of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso exhibited zzso promoter activity while the zzso zzso contained a regulatory element for zzso expression of the mouse zzso zzso A pancreatic zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso E box zzso zzso enhanced the promoter activity of the zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to the zzso element located at zzso The zzso sequence in a zzso context zzso zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso eliminated the zzso effect of zzso Unlike zzso zzso 3 zzso could not activate the zzso element in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene through the zzso zzso These results also suggest that zzso is specific for zzso and the zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells may require factors specifically expressed in zzso zzso
