An zzso specific zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for zzso the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and its wild type zzso gene was developed using two different fluorescent zzso zzso First, we determined the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso with usual zzso zzso However this method requires two separate zzso reactions because the amplified products specific for each zzso are almost the same zzso We further developed a simple and reliable zzso zzso method that uses a color zzso strategy to distinguish the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of mice (5 each) were clearly zzso by the zzso zzso We also performed zzso sequencing for the same samples and confirmed the accuracy of this zzso This method makes it possible to reduce the number of zzso reactions because both zzso are amplified in the same reaction zzso
