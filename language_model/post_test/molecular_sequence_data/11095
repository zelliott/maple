zzso virus infection dramatically affects the host zzso zzso by inducing zzso of zzso stress zzso and formation of zzso tails which propel the virus zzso and zzso The viral factors responsible for these zzso zzso remain zzso zzso analysis reveals significant zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso repeats of zzso the protein which zzso zzso tail assembly and zzso in the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso We characterized the zzso gene product to examine its possible role in zzso zzso of the host zzso zzso zzso is a approximately 8 zzso protein expressed early during infection and is found throughout the zzso with no discernible association with viral or cellular zzso Furthermore, the zzso deletion strain, WR zzso forms particles and zzso tails indistinguishable from zzso Our observations demonstrate that zzso is not required for zzso virus zzso or the zzso zzso observed during zzso
