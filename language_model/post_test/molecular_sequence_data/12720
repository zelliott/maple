Recently, we zzso rat zzso zzso from plasma of zzso rats zzso by measuring its activity that zzso the production of zzso from zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso We then cloned the zzso for rat and human zzso In this study, we found the production of zzso by zzso isolated with the zzso zzso method from both normal and zzso rats, by a zzso zzso of zzso culture medium zzso zzso CM of rat zzso cell lines was screened for the presence of zzso three cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were found to produce zzso According to the zzso procedure for zzso from zzso zzso was partially zzso from 2 L CM of each of three cell lines with a zzso zzso In the final zzso column, zzso from each cell line was zzso with the same retention time as that from zzso and the zzso fraction exhibited zzso zzso activity zzso zzso fraction zzso from the final zzso column was separated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso extracted from the zzso and zzso zzso activity from each cell line was found in the respective molecular weight region, indicating the zzso of the zzso zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso we detected the expression of zzso zzso in zzso three zzso cell lines, normal rat liver, and zzso rat zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was expressed mainly in liver among the various zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is produced by rat zzso and zzso cell lines and suggest that liver may be the primary organ that produces zzso
