zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is regulated by the synergistic actions of insulin, zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To delineate its regulatory zzso we examined the hormonal zzso of various zzso zzso containing the promoter sequence of zzso and the cat reporter gene in primary zzso zzso zzso A DNA zzso from zzso zzso to zzso of zzso was sufficient for the hormonal zzso Using a series of zzso and internal deletions of the zzso promoter region, at least three DNA elements were found to be necessary for full zzso These were located at zzso positions zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso I zzso analysis with a partially zzso extract from zzso zzso cells detected at least seven protected zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso III and zzso were included in the three DNA elements required for the hormonal zzso and the IV region corresponded to the zzso consensus sequences of several milk zzso zzso Competition gel zzso zzso using nuclear extracts of zzso mouse zzso revealed the presence of specific binding proteins for regions I, II, IV and zzso as well as specific zzso binding to both regions III and zzso The binding activities of these zzso except that associated with region IV, were increased from the virgin to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
