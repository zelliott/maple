zzso use the alpha 6 beta 1 zzso to adhere to zzso based on zzso zzso and affinity zzso zzso This zzso requires zzso stimulation with either zzso or specific zzso a process that has been termed zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the involvement of alpha 6 zzso structural zzso in this regulated zzso was examined using mouse zzso The two known alpha 6 structural zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso differ only in their zzso domain zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction, we observed that zzso express only the alpha zzso structural zzso in contrast to most cell types which express both alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso The role of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso We found that this mouse zzso cell line does not adhere to zzso even in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso though it does adhere normally to zzso and tissue culture zzso zzso analysis employing reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso of surface labeled cells revealed that this cell line expresses neither the alpha zzso nor alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either the chick or human alpha zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in zzso alpha zzso beta 1 surface zzso The alpha zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso signaling because zzso stimulation markedly increased their ability to adhere to zzso but it did not increase alpha zzso beta 1 surface zzso Similar results were obtained after zzso of the human alpha zzso zzso Analysis of the human zzso was facilitated by the generation of a zzso zzso zzso that is specific for the human alpha 6 zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that both alpha zzso beta 1 and alpha zzso beta 1 can be regulated by zzso signaling pathways in zzso even though this cell type expresses only alpha zzso beta zzso The data presented also demonstrate clearly that the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso do not differ in their ability to be regulated by zzso
