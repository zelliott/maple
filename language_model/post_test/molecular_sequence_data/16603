A functional origin of replication was mapped to the zzso promoter and zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso gene in the mouse and human zzso This origin was lost in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells with a spontaneous deletion zzso 36 zzso at the zzso end of the zzso zzso Restoration of zzso activity by zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequences zzso replication origin activity in two independent zzso cell zzso zzso zzso analyses of abundance of genetic markers in zzso nascent DNA indicated that initiation of DNA replication coincided with the site of zzso in the mouse zzso of the 335 zzso of human DNA containing the zzso zzso 1 and a truncated zzso The genetic information contained in the human sequence and surrounding mouse DNA was analyzed for zzso elements that might contribute to selection and functional zzso of a zzso origin of DNA zzso
