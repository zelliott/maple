zzso zzso zzso with actively folded secondary structures have potential to mimic the function of zzso We here show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose sizes are comparable to those of zzso have potential to be developed as zzso interaction zzso zzso along with several unprecedented zzso Using zzso zzso as a model system, the molecular recognition and zzso of zzso by zzso grafted with a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The competition zzso showed that the zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was far more resistant to degradation by the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso and had high zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso scaffold holds great potential to be developed as a novel class of zzso zzso
