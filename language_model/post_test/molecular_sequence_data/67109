zzso regulate protein function and trafficking in many zzso systems and have emerged as important features of regulated zzso proteins in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso and host cell invasion are inextricably linked and essential processes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein found in a zzso complex with the zzso protein zzso a protein that has a demonstrated fundamental role in gliding zzso and zzso zzso function is also central to these zzso because disruption of zzso zzso results in zzso retention of zzso leading to reduced zzso zzso from the zzso and impaired zzso Because the zzso zzso is predicted to be processed in an zzso site near where zzso is retained in zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso and its zzso removal influence trafficking and zzso of the zzso We found that zzso zzso through zzso compartments and that deletion of the zzso leads to defective trafficking of the complex within or near this site, resulting in zzso processing and decreased zzso of zzso impaired invasion, and reduced zzso in zzso mirroring the zzso observed in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of several zzso site zzso resulted in normal zzso but it affected the stability and zzso of the complex from the zzso zzso the zzso and its zzso site influence distinct aspects of zzso function, with both zzso the outcome of zzso
