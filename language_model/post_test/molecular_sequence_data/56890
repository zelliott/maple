The zzso of zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso gene promoter activity has been studied by transient zzso in rat zzso cell lines, rat zzso and human cervical zzso cells, and shown to be dependent on zzso zzso of zzso gene expression has also been studied in rat liver by Northern zzso and zzso zzso during development, specifically during the zzso zzso The results suggest zzso that the increases in zzso at birth and zzso day zzso result from increased zzso and zzso that no decrease in zzso activity accompanies the rapid zzso zzso zzso during the zzso period, arguing for zzso zzso Support for zzso regulation during the zzso period was obtained from in zzso zzso experiments and gel shift zzso Three zzso factors interact with the zzso promoter between zzso zzso and zzso Two of these, zzso and zzso were expressed throughout development, as well as during adulthood, and zzso with zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The third, zzso was expressed only when zzso gene expression was high, and zzso with zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso
