The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in aromatic zzso acid zzso in zzso plants and zzso zzso of zzso zzso contain two zzso redundant zzso zzso zzso by the genes zzso and zzso whose activities are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is controlled by zzso The authors previously cloned an zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso and found that: zzso it can complement an zzso zzso double zzso in zzso zzso an effect inhibited by excess zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso suggesting the existence of another zzso They now report the identification and functional characterization of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso share zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis places the zzso zzso zzso in a cluster separate from zzso zzso and suggests that zzso and zzso arose from a single gene via a gene zzso event early in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is elevated upon zzso acid zzso consistent with the presence of three putative zzso elements zzso in the gene promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso double zzso in zzso zzso an effect inhibited by excess zzso The authors engineered zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso (with one zzso copy of zzso placed under control of the zzso zzso zzso and found that they fail to grow in the absence of aromatic zzso acids when zzso expression is zzso and that this growth zzso can be partially rescued by aromatic zzso acids and certain aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso It is concluded that, like zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso required for the first step in the aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso
