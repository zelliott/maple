To zzso the molecular basis of the interaction of the native zzso zzso with the zzso zzso we performed a zzso study in which we systematically replaced zzso in each position of this zzso Here we report the binding affinity and zzso potency on human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration was measured on zzso cells, and binding zzso were carried out using zzso prepared from these cell lines which zzso express zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicate that the last four zzso acids in the zzso region of zzso are not important zzso of biological activity and selectivity at human zzso zzso zzso results were obtained when zzso was zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso For these zzso the affinity and activity at all three human receptors zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly, demonstrating that the zzso sequence in zzso is important for activity at these three zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso was replaced with zzso suggesting the importance of this position in the interaction with all three zzso This study highlights the role played by the zzso sequence in zzso binding and in zzso activity of zzso
