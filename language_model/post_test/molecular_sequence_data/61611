zzso zzso zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso zzso obtained from various localities in Taiwan and three provinces in China, by gel zzso followed by zzso zzso The precise molecular mass and zzso sequence of each zzso were zzso In addition to the six previously documented zzso zzso of this species, we identified ten novel zzso The zzso zzso zzso of individual specimens of the zzso from four localities were used for zzso and subsequent cloning of the zzso The molecular masses and partial sequences of most of the zzso zzso matched with those deduced from a total of 13 distinct zzso sequences of these zzso Besides the commonly known zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso a novel type of zzso with zzso substitution at the zzso site was zzso This type of zzso is zzso but may cause local zzso and appears to be a zzso marker of many tree zzso In particular, we showed that zzso zzso displayed high geographic variations of the zzso within and between their Taiwanese and Chinese zzso which can be explained by geological isolation and prey zzso A zzso tree of the zzso zzso zzso of this species and other related Asian zzso reveals that zzso zzso contains zzso genes related to those from several zzso pit zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso besides the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings may explain the exceptionally high variations in the zzso as well as the evolutionary advantage of this zzso
