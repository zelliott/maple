A reverse zzso chain reaction experiment was done to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso probe from apricot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This probe was further used to isolate a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso fruit zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains a single open reading frame zzso a zzso precursor zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso belongs to a zzso zzso The gene is highly expressed in young, zzso fruit and is turned off early in the zzso zzso The ratio of zzso protein to total proteins per fruit apparently remains stable regardless of the stage of development, whereas zzso specific activity zzso at the breaker zzso These results suggest that, in addition to a zzso control of zzso zzso other regulation factors such as zzso and zzso controls also zzso
