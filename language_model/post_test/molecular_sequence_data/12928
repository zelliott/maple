zzso II, a zzso calcium channel blocker in zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing ten zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso at the zzso In this study, the zzso zzso was zzso in solution by applying our maximum protection strategy using the zzso method at the final zzso zzso Before designing the zzso we examined the stability of the zzso zzso under the conditions for the synthesis of the zzso using several model zzso The zzso group was confirmed to be stable during zzso of the zzso bonds, but was partially removable during the zzso reaction in zzso The zzso reaction in zzso was zzso and zzso zzso the decision was made to protect the zzso zzso with zzso zzso since it is more susceptible to zzso than zzso zzso which is now commonly used in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso reaction was carried out at zzso degrees or zzso degrees C for 1 h in order to reduce the extent of the zzso zzso The resulting zzso and zzso products were zzso the remaining zzso groups were removed using zzso and then the completely zzso peptides were folded to their native zzso The final zzso zzso was proven to be identical with the natural one using various zzso systems and by zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
