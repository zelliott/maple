Phase variation of zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso b strain zzso zzso occurs through a mechanism which depends on multiple tandem repeats of the DNA sequence zzso situated within the zzso locus zzso We report here that the same zzso repeats are also found in two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Similar to zzso there are multiple tandem repeats of zzso present at the zzso ends of long open reading frames in zzso and zzso Variation in the number of repeats of zzso by shifting the upstream initiation zzso in or out of phase with the remainder of the open reading frame, could switch on or off the translation of downstream zzso Similar to previously reported findings for zzso zzso zzso in the open reading frame downstream zzso from the repeats of zzso in zzso abolished phase variation and identified DNA sequences required for the expression of additional zzso zzso When we used an zzso zzso five repeats of zzso or DNA sequences specific for zzso zzso and zzso as zzso a survey of other zzso zzso zzso strains zzso a through zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains (including zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso can have from two to five regions which contain multiple tandem repeats of zzso in addition to other sequences which zzso to zzso and zzso
