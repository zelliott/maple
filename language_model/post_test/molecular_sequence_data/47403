zzso in the genes zzso for Met, zzso and Kit zzso zzso zzso invariably result in increased zzso activity and in the acquisition of transforming zzso However, the requirement of zzso zzso for the transformation process is still zzso We have investigated the role of zzso growth factor zzso the zzso zzso for Met, in zzso zzso cell zzso We provide evidence that the transforming potential displayed by zzso forms of Met found in human cancer is not only sensitive but entirely dependent on the presence of zzso by showing that zzso Met zzso zzso zzso which produce zzso zzso but is not able to transform zzso cells, unless zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation of zzso cells can be inhibited by zzso zzso and increased by zzso zzso We also show that an engineered Met zzso which contains an zzso zzso but is impaired in its ability to bind zzso completely loses its transforming activity, which can be rescued by causing zzso zzso using a zzso zzso These results indicate that point zzso resulting in Met zzso zzso are necessary but not sufficient to cause cell zzso the latter being dependent on zzso zzso zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso zzso growth depends on the availability and tissue distribution of active zzso and provide zzso for the treatment of zzso related zzso by zzso zzso
