We have cloned a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso gene contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Also, the gene is not interrupted by an zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene shows significant zzso zzso with other zzso zzso from zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso signal zzso which is thought to function as an zzso targeting zzso In fact, the zzso fusion protein was found to be localized exclusively in zzso when expressed in tobacco zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso activity as well as genetic zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso gene cluster expressed in zzso coli showed that the zzso gene most certainly encodes a zzso zzso catalyzing the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso
