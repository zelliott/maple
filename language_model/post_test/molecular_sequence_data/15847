A number of different membrane associated zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso have previously been zzso Here the structure of a novel zzso zzso of zzso is established by analysis of a zzso corresponding to an zzso zzso from human skeletal zzso The zzso incorporates a novel sequence block into the zzso domain, which introduces an zzso stop zzso and thus prematurely zzso the coding zzso generating a truncated zzso zzso Analysis of zzso clones indicates that the inserted sequence is present as a discrete zzso within the human zzso zzso and Northern analysis shows it to be associated specifically with a zzso zzso zzso species from skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso accumulate it in the zzso and release it to the culture zzso In contrast, cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso express it predominantly at the cell zzso The existence of a zzso zzso may further expand the spectrum of zzso function beyond its known involvement in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
