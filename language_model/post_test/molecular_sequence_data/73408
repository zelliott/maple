Under the influence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a low molecular weight protein zzso approximately zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso zzso Here it is demonstrated that zzso for the same protein is produced by the developing zzso during early pregnancy and by the zzso throughout zzso The transcript for zzso was represented in approximately zzso of total zzso plaques of a day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It shared zzso zzso sequence identity with the zzso isolated from the zzso library and zzso a zzso protein identical to the zzso zzso which has a zzso zzso domain comprised of 64 zzso at its zzso zzso Northern analysis and in zzso zzso studies confirmed that expression of zzso by the zzso begins as early as day 10 of pregnancy and is continued in zzso zzso until at least day 90 of zzso zzso was zzso specific at day 20 of zzso as in zzso zzso detected no zzso in the zzso The pattern of zzso expression during pregnancy is consistent with a role either in controlling zzso zzso or in zzso zzso with zzso specificity released by immune or inflammatory zzso
