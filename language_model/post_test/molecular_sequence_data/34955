zzso molecular markers are powerful molecular zzso However, these markers are not readily available due to the difficulty in obtaining zzso zzso zzso Although recent techniques enabling the rapid isolation of zzso sequences have facilitated primer development, this process nonetheless remains time-consuming and zzso zzso research into the zzso of zzso zzso developed from one plant species onto others would be of great zzso The present study investigated the zzso of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across other fruit crops, as well as within the zzso using zzso amplified zzso molecular zzso Fourteen of the 26 zzso zzso tested zzso produced robust and zzso amplification products across all fruit crops tested, indicating their zzso across plant zzso Four of the 13 fruit crops showed the best zzso performances: zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, similarity zzso and zzso zzso indicated that these zzso could further offer a potential tool for zzso zzso parentage zzso genetic diversity assessment, zzso and zzso studies across a variety of plant zzso zzso was further confirmed by examining published zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso This study is one of the few currently available studies concerning the zzso of zzso zzso across plant species in general, and is the first successful study of the zzso of zzso zzso derived from zzso The zzso presented here will help reduce costs for future zzso primer development and therefore contribute to the zzso of zzso molecular zzso
