zzso zzso is a zzso zzso produced by T cells in response to zzso or zzso zzso We studied the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in human zzso T zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso levels were found as early as 1 h after zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis was observed 2-4 h after induction and appeared to correlate to zzso zzso zzso zzso As analyzed by zzso experiments, the zzso of zzso from T cells was very zzso the zzso zzso being approximately zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso dramatically reduced the expression of zzso but did not block its zzso Natural zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso forms zzso zzso performed in a zzso zzso system with zzso zzso zzso lacking either one of the potential zzso sites suggested that zzso is more efficiently zzso than zzso zzso zzso analysis of natural zzso by zzso treatment followed by zzso mass zzso revealed considerable variation in the zzso structures, with more than 30 different zzso The zzso at zzso consisted of zzso mainly zzso zzso whereas the zzso at zzso were more heterogeneous, with hybrid and zzso zzso Our results emphasize the essential role of zzso zzso in the biology of zzso and show that there is a considerable zzso in the individual sugar chains of this important human zzso
