zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which displays zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and structural study of an abnormal form of the zzso isolated from a patient which we reported earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Rosa, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso is zzso The abnormal zzso present at 50% of the level of the normal zzso as estimated by zzso methods, showed elevated zzso mobility and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same manner as the normal zzso The zzso zzso was unstable at 55 degrees C and could be protected against zzso instability by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two of the three functions of the zzso zzso were distinct from those of the normal zzso The specific activity of the zzso was zzso of normal and that of the zzso zzso By contrast, the specific zzso activity was not affected by the zzso However, the zzso activity of the zzso protein was markedly less zzso by zzso than that of the zzso High performance liquid zzso analysis of zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso showed an abnormal profile with the absence of two zzso normally containing the zzso and zzso peptides and without the appearance of a supplementary zzso zzso acid sequence and mass zzso analysis demonstrated the substitution of zzso zzso in position 89 producing an zzso zzso present in the same peak as the zzso zzso together, our data suggest that zzso is located at or near the active site of zzso zzso and that this zzso is probably involved in the binding of zzso
