zzso treatment increased both activity and zzso level of zzso zzso in human zzso Using zzso zzso prepared from human zzso treated with zzso we have constructed a zzso library in the zzso zzso The human zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening this library with a rat zzso and was subjected to zzso sequence zzso The deduced human zzso zzso is composed of 288 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso in zzso acid sequences between rat and human zzso zzso is zzso Like rat zzso zzso human zzso has a putative membrane segment at its zzso zzso which is probably essential for the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso Both rat and human zzso zzso have no zzso zzso Recently we have shown that rat zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and therefore we examined the effects of heat treatment on the induction of zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso treatment, heat treatment had no apparent effects in either human cell line on the activity of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso These results suggest that human zzso zzso may not be a zzso zzso
