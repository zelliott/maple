The zzso zzso zzso zzso from seeds of bitter zzso zzso zzso consists of 190 zzso acid zzso with four zzso bridges and belongs to the zzso zzso family, including zzso zzso typified by zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution with an zzso of zzso using the single zzso replacement zzso zzso zzso structurally belongs to the zzso class of zzso having ten zzso (six zzso and four zzso and eight zzso When the structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso the close agreement between the zzso positions for the total structure is zzso the root mean square zzso calculated only for structurally related 151 zzso atoms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules was zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso can be easily zzso with that of the possible zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This observation strongly indicates that zzso zzso from a plant origin zzso zzso degradation in a similar manner as zzso zzso
