Human B cells that zzso surrogate and conventional light chains zzso show an unusual heavy and light chain zzso repertoire that display evidence of zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso B cells have been silenced by zzso editing or still express zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of the zzso expressed by zzso B cells are zzso A majority of these zzso are true antinuclear zzso zzso and 50% of the zzso are also zzso with a diverse group of zzso that include zzso zzso zzso insulin, and bacterial zzso Such zzso are rarely encountered among conventional B zzso We conclude that zzso B cells are a unique subset of normal circulating human B cells that escape central tolerance mechanisms and express zzso zzso including potentially harmful zzso
