The zzso zzso are zzso for the small zzso zzso and zzso and are divided into two zzso Group I zzso possess an zzso domain that can suppress their zzso activity in zzso In zzso two Group I zzso have been identified, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso participate in zzso closure of the zzso a process in which a hole in the zzso zzso is sealed through migration of the zzso zzso over a tissue called the zzso zzso closure is driven in part by an zzso zzso apparatus at the leading edge of the zzso and is regulated by a zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function using either zzso zzso or expression of a zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso led to disruption of the leading edge zzso and defects in zzso closure but did not affect the zzso zzso Group I zzso zzso activity in the zzso is required for correct zzso of the zzso and may be a component of the signaling known to occur between these two zzso We conclude that zzso closure requires Group I zzso function in both the zzso and the zzso
