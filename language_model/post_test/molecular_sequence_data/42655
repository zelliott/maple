The human zzso zzso gene zzso product was shown to play an important role in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The deletion of the 4 zzso sequence zzso zzso resistance to a laboratory zzso The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and simple method to detect zzso within the 12 base pair zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and clinical specimens zzso zzso zzso cerebral spinal fluid zzso A target region encompassing this zzso sequence was amplified by a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and reference zzso and a zzso procedure from clinical zzso zzso products were submitted to restriction zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso one probe zzso overlapping the zzso zzso and a control probe with similar length and zzso zzso zzso was performed under conditions allowing the detection of one zzso deletion zzso strain zzso to zzso was determined by a rapid late zzso synthesis reduction zzso The control probe zzso to the zzso sequence amplified from all 23 tested zzso and the reference zzso The DL probe gave a positive signal with zzso zzso no signal was obtained for five out of seven resistant zzso and for a laboratory zzso derived from the strain zzso zzso analysis of amplification products showed different patterns suggesting this region can be involved in various DNA zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
