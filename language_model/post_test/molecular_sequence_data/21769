ARTS zzso is a zzso protein localized at the zzso of living zzso In response to zzso signals, ARTS rapidly zzso to the zzso where it binds and zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso However, the mechanism of interaction between these two proteins and how it is regulated remained to be zzso In this study, we show that ARTS and zzso bind directly to each other, as zzso ARTS and zzso proteins zzso zzso We also show that over expression of ARTS alone is sufficient to induce a strong zzso of zzso protein levels and that this reduction occurs through the zzso zzso system zzso Using various deletion and zzso zzso of zzso we show that ARTS specifically binds to the zzso domain in zzso Moreover, we found that ARTS binds to different sequences in zzso than other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso analysis comparing the location of the putative ARTS interface in zzso with the known zzso of zzso and zzso 9 support our results indicating that ARTS interacts with zzso in zzso that are different from those involved in binding zzso and zzso zzso We therefore suggest that ARTS binds and zzso zzso in a way which is distinct from other zzso to promote zzso
