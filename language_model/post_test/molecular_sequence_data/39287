Novel zzso bacteria, designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso fluid and microbial mat samples, respectively, collected from a shallow marine zzso system zzso depth 22 zzso occurring in coral reefs off zzso Island, Okinawa, zzso zzso of the two novel strains were zzso rods with a single polar zzso in the exponential growth zzso In a medium that included zzso zzso cells of the two strains became zzso with oval to zzso cell zzso For both zzso growth occurred at between 30 and 60 degrees C zzso temperature of zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso doubling zzso and between pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso The zzso were zzso zzso capable of using zzso or zzso as the sole energy source, zzso as the sole electron zzso and zzso as the sole carbon zzso Organic zzso such as zzso extract and zzso inhibited growth of both zzso The zzso contents of zzso DNA were zzso and zzso zzso for strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the two strains were closely related to each other zzso % sequence zzso and were zzso related to other previously described zzso within the zzso The novel zzso could also be differentiated from other zzso zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso It is suggested that the novel zzso represent the type species of a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is zzso
