The initial step in the signaling cascade of the growth factor zzso involves its binding to the zzso domain of the zzso type II zzso This zzso domain contains 10 zzso zzso which are engaged in zzso zzso zzso To zzso the structural framework of this domain we have characterized its zzso pattern using an zzso zzso of the zzso which binds zzso A with high zzso By combining zzso with mass zzso and chemical sequence analysis, the zzso connectivity was determined to be as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A similar zzso arrangement occurs in a family of snake toxins for which the three-dimensional structure is zzso
