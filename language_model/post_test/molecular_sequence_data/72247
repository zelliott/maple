Satellite zzso of bamboo mosaic zzso zzso is a linear zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso of seven different zzso zzso from bamboo hosts in three zzso showed zzso to zzso base variation which spanned the whole zzso zzso However, the putative zzso open reading frame was all preserved in these zzso The zzso relationship based on the zzso sequence did not show particular grouping of zzso from the host in one zzso neither was the grouping of zzso evident by location of zzso zzso secondary structures of the 3' untranslated regions showed a basic pattern with zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso located in the loop zzso Although the zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso its predicted secondary structure contains zzso zzso which may form zzso structure similar to that found in zzso protein zzso by satellite virus of zzso mosaic zzso
