Through a screen designed to isolate novel zzso zzso genes required for zzso zzso we have identified zzso The zzso zzso decreased the transmission zzso of a zzso zzso and altered sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso is a member of an evolutionary zzso protein zzso Its human counterpart zzso was identified in an interaction screen with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was able to substitute for the complete loss of the zzso gene product suggesting that the two proteins might have similar zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso were viable but showed a variety of zzso including impaired control of cell zzso A fusion protein of zzso with the zzso zzso green fluorescent protein led to in zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso structures indicating association of zzso with zzso The absence of zzso protein led to zzso short, often faint zzso zzso as seen by indirect zzso zzso While loss of the zzso gene product had no gross effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso compromised zzso formation and function and led to severe growth zzso and abnormal cell zzso We propose that zzso plays a role in regulating the integrity of zzso possibly by influencing their zzso
