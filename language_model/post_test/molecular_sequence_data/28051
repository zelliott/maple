A gene of the zzso zzso has been designated the zzso gene on the basis that in zzso the gene product is a zzso zzso of zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have located and zzso the equivalent gene in wheat zzso zzso and have raised specific zzso to the gene product following its expression in zzso coli as a zzso fusion zzso Using these zzso we have investigated the location of the gene product in various zzso membrane zzso of pea zzso zzso The gene product of apparent molecular mass zzso zzso is severely depleted in zzso membrane preparations and its distribution between zzso and zzso regions of the membrane is distinct to that of the zzso gene product which is known to be a core zzso of zzso We therefore conclude that zzso does not code for a component of zzso but instead suggest that it is present in a novel protein complex of the zzso zzso On the basis of 1) the zzso overlap between zzso and zzso a zzso gene which shows significant zzso to a zzso gene that codes for a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and 2) sequence similarity between the zzso gene product and the zzso gene product of zzso coli, which codes for a respiratory zzso zzso we propose that this zzso complex functions as a zzso or zzso zzso
