zzso acid zzso affects the growth and differentiation of cells in culture, usually to decrease the growth zzso In zzso limb zzso zzso has the remarkable ability to affect pattern formation by changing zzso identity, but its initial action on the limb is to inhibit division of the zzso zzso zzso Newt limb zzso cells also show this zzso in zzso In order to investigate the role of different zzso receptors zzso in the zzso response, the hormone binding domain of the zzso zzso alpha 1 and delta 1 was replaced with the corresponding region from the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with each of the zzso zzso was activated after exposure to zzso hormone zzso Their profile of activity on three different response elements was indicative of zzso specificity and not zzso zzso After zzso of cultured zzso zzso cells with a DNA particle gun, the zzso were equally active in stimulating zzso zzso of two different synthetic reporter zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso or control plasmids along with a marker zzso expressing zzso exposed to zzso or zzso and zzso with zzso followed by zzso The alpha 1 zzso gave zzso zzso of growth, comparable to the effect exerted by zzso itself, whereas the delta 1 zzso and control plasmids were zzso The results imply that zzso 1 mediates the effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso
