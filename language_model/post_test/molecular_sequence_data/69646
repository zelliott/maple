We describe zzso primer zzso combinations for use in a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso typing system to determine zzso locus zzso of A9 zzso zzso A10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and A19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of the amplification zzso zzso system zzso in which a mismatch at the 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso combinations described extend our zzso typing system, to provide a high-definition typing of the zzso zzso
