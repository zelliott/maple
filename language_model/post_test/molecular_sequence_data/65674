A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was screened by zzso tools and zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso specificity of the zzso was zzso zzso showed high activity for zzso zzso zzso It showed the highest activity for zzso zzso It showed higher activity toward aromatic zzso than zzso zzso The zzso model of the zzso was constructed by zzso modeling using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Then, the zzso was rationally redesigned to increase the activity for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso increased the relative activity for zzso acid to zzso acid by zzso and zzso respectively, over that of wild zzso
