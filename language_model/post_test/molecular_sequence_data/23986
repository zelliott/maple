zzso of zzso I from the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso is studied using a combination of zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso As four potential zzso sites and several zzso and zzso zzso zzso are present, a large number of zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso focusing both in gel and in zzso format was successfully applied for the separation of the zzso They were extracted in their intact form from the gel and subsequently zzso by zzso thereby making use of a powerful two-dimensional zzso zzso on a zzso zzso further allowed the determination of the zzso zzso As a novel approach, an zzso zzso was used in precursor zzso scanning for selective detection of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso
