It has been shown previously that a short sequence from the zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso when appropriately placed, can zzso zzso responsiveness to another zzso Using the zzso sequence and similar sequences from the zzso regulatory regions of other zzso zzso we derived a consensus sequence 38 zzso zzso The sequence contains an zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso carrying a single copy of the sequence bound zzso partially zzso zzso zzso zzso than did control plasmids when zzso by gel zzso zzso specificity for zzso binding occurs at zzso zzso zzso strength and pH zzso zzso carrying multiple copies of the sequence bound zzso more zzso The zzso constant for zzso bound to the sequence is zzso zzso This value is lower by a factor of about 400 than the zzso constant for zzso bound to an equivalent length of zzso zzso zzso of the consensus sequence were evaluated for binding zzso zzso containing the zzso repeat alone bound zzso though less efficiently than did plasmids containing the entire zzso The zzso region alone was ineffective in binding zzso zzso of the zzso DNA did not enhance specific binding efficiency for zzso This model system represents an effective tool for characterization of zzso binding to DNA sequences involved in the regulation of gene zzso
