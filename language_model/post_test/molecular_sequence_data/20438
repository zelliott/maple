zzso virus zzso causes acute zzso fever that is often zzso and no licensed vaccines are available for preventing this deadly viral zzso The immune mechanisms for protection against zzso are poorly zzso but previous studies suggest that both zzso and T cells are zzso In our study, we infected zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso and used overlapping peptides to map zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from mice infected with zzso zzso were harvested and zzso with multiple overlapping zzso zzso pools, and zzso zzso T cells were evaluated for zzso specificity by measuring zzso of zzso and zzso zzso After confirming positive zzso to specific zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the induction of zzso zzso responses and protection from lethal zzso challenge in zzso zzso 

We discovered a zzso zzso zzso within both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that triggered zzso zzso zzso These responses were also protective when zzso zzso were transferred into zzso zzso 

zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso and zzso provides the first evidence that specific zzso induction of cellular immune responses is sufficient to combat zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that are zzso to zzso proteins provides an important research tool for zzso the significance of cellular immune responses in zzso mice infected with zzso
