The gene coding for the zzso bovine liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso cells as a zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso using the constructed expression zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein can be matured in zzso as a zzso with zzso incorporated into zzso zzso during the zzso and the zzso procedures were simplified by using a zzso affinity column zzso with zzso zzso The fusion protein was characterized by its zzso and zzso properties, the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso c was also zzso The results show that zzso zzso fusion protein shares similar properties and functions to that of isolated zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso were fused together, the two partners have not made significant structural and functional zzso of their counterparts, the zzso interactions between them are apparently very zzso To our knowledge, the present study is the first report to express zzso zzso as a zzso zzso fusion zzso which provides a good example for the in zzso maturation of a zzso as a zzso fusion protein and sheds new light on the zzso interactions within the zzso fusion zzso
