Growth zzso hormone zzso zzso plays a critical role in growth hormone zzso zzso release and regulation of zzso zzso expansion in zzso The objective of this study was to investigate variations in goat zzso gene and their associations with growth traits in zzso dairy zzso The results showed four novel single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In detail, the novel zzso zzso in the zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso CCC zzso zzso at position zzso of the goat zzso zzso Besides, zzso and zzso zzso were in complete linkage zzso The genetic diversity analysis revealed that the zzso dairy goat possessed intermediate genetic diversity in zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso dairy goat belonged to poor genetic diversity in zzso zzso zzso associations between the zzso of zzso locus and body zzso body height and chest circumference was observed in zzso goat zzso However, in zzso zzso population, significant statistical difference was only found in body height and body length zzso In zzso and zzso zzso no significant associations were detected between any zzso sites and body zzso body height and chest zzso as well as for the milk traits zzso These results strongly suggested that the goat zzso gene is a candidate gene that influences growth traits in dairy zzso
