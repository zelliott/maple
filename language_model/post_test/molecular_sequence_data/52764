The crystal and molecular structure of an zzso duplex corresponding to the high affinity Rev protein binding element zzso has been determined at zzso zzso Four unique duplexes are present in the zzso zzso two structural zzso In each duplex, the zzso double zzso consists of an zzso zzso and zzso that form an zzso internal loop consisting of zzso and zzso zzso base pairs and a zzso zzso The zzso strand has an zzso zzso whereas the zzso strand is distorted to accommodate the zzso and zzso base zzso In contrast to the zzso model of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso pair with zzso and zzso hydrogen zzso is formed in each zzso The zzso base pairing agrees with the zzso structure in one structural zzso but forms a novel zzso pair in the zzso A backbone flip and zzso of the zzso base pair is required to assume the zzso zzso present in the zzso model of the complex between the zzso and the Rev zzso
