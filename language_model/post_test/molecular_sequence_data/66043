zzso data often have competing signals that are detected by network programs or Lento zzso Such data can be formed by generating sequences on more than one tree, and combining the results, a mixture zzso We report that with such mixture models, the estimates of edge zzso lengths from maximum likelihood zzso methods that assume a single tree are zzso Based on the observed number of competing signals in real data, such a bias of zzso is expected to occur zzso Because network methods can recover competing signals more accurately, there is a need for zzso methods allowing a zzso A fundamental problem is that mixture models can have more parameters than can be recovered from the data, so that some zzso are not, in principle, zzso We recommend that network programs be incorporated into best practice analysis, along with zzso and zzso zzso
