zzso S is a major spore coat protein of zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain, both of which contain a zzso zzso zzso S tightly binds to zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we constructed a novel expression zzso zzso zzso two tandem repeat zzso zzso By using this zzso a number of human proteins that were expressed at low levels or in zzso forms by a zzso zzso were expressed not only at high levels but also in soluble zzso We also demonstrated that an zzso coli protein zzso with zzso fully retained its function, indicating that it is folded independently from the zzso This technology not only allows simple, zzso protein zzso using zzso but can also be used for the identification of proteins interacting with a protein of interest and will prove immensely useful for structural studies of proteins which are difficult to produce or are zzso
