The developing zzso is segmented in a series of repetitive zzso called zzso or zzso In the zzso first molecular evidence for zzso of the zzso came from zzso 3- and zzso expression of the zzso zzso The zzso segments are linked with the expression of different zzso genes which have a role in patterning the zzso and zzso region of the zzso zzso Here we identified by zzso zzso a zzso mouse zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells that have undergone a partial differentiation zzso zzso encodes putative zzso proteins of 54, 55, and 81 zzso acids that might serve as protein zzso zzso or small cell zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso 3 and 5 during early zzso development and in the floor of the zzso zzso In addition, expression is observed in the early zzso pouch, in the derived zzso and in the developing inner zzso During later zzso the zzso gene is strongly expressed in the major part of the central and peripheral nervous zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in the maintenance of segment identity in the zzso and zzso development and maturation or maintenance of the overall structure of the nervous zzso
