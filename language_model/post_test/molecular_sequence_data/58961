A novel point zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso gene was found in a Turkish patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso using a six different pairs of zzso produced no differences in four of the fragments amplified with respect to the control, but generated two fragments of different zzso One was representative of a deletion of 126 zzso and the other of an zzso of 78 zzso These abnormal zzso resulted from a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of an zzso which changed the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso donor zzso zzso This was associated with the occurrence of an alternative zzso which led to the skipping of the whole zzso of 126 zzso and also with the zzso of one cryptic donor zzso site in the same zzso These zzso spliced zzso are predicted to zzso two abnormal zzso zzso zzso the first results in a protein with an internal deletion of 42 zzso zzso whose zzso activity is largely zzso as the zzso site was completely zzso the second contains 17 zzso zzso acids that zzso a stop zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the overall content of these zzso spliced zzso in zzso zzso was the same as that found in control zzso However, hardly any transcript was observed corresponding to the inserted zzso zzso when it was examined by a specific zzso To zzso the relative proportion of the two zzso a quantitative zzso (the zzso zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso show that the proportion of the inserted zzso with respect to the deleted zzso is only zzso The father, mother, and two brothers of the zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso considered, while the two zzso of another brother were free of the zzso
