To construct the zzso zzso expressing small hairpin zzso zzso targeting human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and silence the expression of zzso in human retinal zzso zzso cells zzso 

Three pairs of zzso coding for zzso targeting human zzso gene were designed and zzso and were cloned into the shuttle zzso zzso after zzso The three constructed shuttle zzso through zzso zzso with zzso backbone zzso zzso were transformed into zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso And then the zzso zzso with zzso I were zzso into zzso cells to package zzso After amplification and zzso determination, the zzso zzso were used to zzso the primary zzso zzso real-time zzso was taken to determine the relative amount of zzso zzso to screen the zzso with the highest zzso zzso The level of zzso protein after zzso interference in zzso was further determined by Western zzso 

zzso restriction zzso and DNA sequencing confirmed that the purpose zzso sequences were correctly inserted into the shuttle zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were packaged successfully in zzso zzso The most effective zzso with the zzso efficiency up to zzso was selected by quantitative real-time zzso which significantly lowered the expression of zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso expressing zzso effectively zzso zzso gene was constructed zzso which would facilitate further study of the role that zzso plays in the development of diabetic zzso
