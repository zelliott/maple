In this study, we isolated zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso including a putative signal zzso and was zzso to acid zzso especially at the active zzso Human zzso had zzso zzso acid identity to human zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a ubiquitous expression of zzso which was marked in zzso heart, small zzso muscle, and zzso Human zzso map obtained by zzso in zzso zzso showed that the gene for zzso was localized to zzso 1 zzso The zzso in which zzso was replaced with zzso at the active site and the putative signal zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso In addition, the putative signal zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso The site of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso cells and differentiated zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso human zzso acid zzso also has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed less zzso acid, zzso and zzso These results suggested that zzso regulates zzso metabolism in zzso via the zzso of zzso to zzso
