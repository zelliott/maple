zzso zzso cause contamination and zzso of low moisture zzso This study examined the effect of ozone zzso on growth of a zzso species isolated from zzso zzso Two ozone treatments were used - a low-level long-term exposure zzso zzso for 21 zzso and high-level short-term exposure zzso zzso for 5 to 120 zzso For the low level exposure the combination of different media zzso zzso zzso 5, 10 and zzso zzso with ozone treatment was also zzso The growth of the isolate was found to be sensitive to low-level ozone zzso depending on the media zzso concentration and duration of the zzso zzso ozone exposure significantly zzso reduced the number of asexual spores formed in media with no added zzso an effect not observed in media with higher zzso zzso zzso microscope observations of colonies indicated that ozone exposed cultures produced lower numbers of zzso zzso ozone exposure for short zzso reduced spore viability although zzso reduction in viability was achieved only after 120 zzso zzso This work demonstrates that ozone may be used to reduce spore production in zzso but that the ozone effect can be zzso by zzso levels in the growth zzso
