We recently cloned zzso zzso three zzso of human zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnston, zzso zzso Page, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Campbell, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peter, zzso and Bailey, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated predominance of zzso in many human zzso zzso zzso zzso Lefkowitz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Berkowitz, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45, zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso are important in clinical diseases such as zzso zzso and benign zzso zzso zzso we initiated studies to understand mechanisms underlying regulation of zzso gene zzso A zzso clone containing zzso zzso of zzso region of the human zzso gene was recently zzso zzso protection and primer extension zzso indicate that zzso gene zzso occurs at multiple initiation sites with the major site located zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso where a classic zzso sequence is zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso containing varying amounts of zzso region into human zzso zzso cells indicate that a region extending 125 base pairs upstream from the main zzso initiation site contains full zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, distinct zzso and zzso elements lie 2-3 and 3-5 zzso pairs upstream, zzso Although the zzso promoter contains neither zzso or zzso zzso gel shift mobility zzso targeting three zzso boxes immediately upstream of the main zzso initiation site confirm binding of zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso demonstrating highest activity in cells zzso expressing zzso The human zzso gene also contains several zzso regulatory zzso including several insulin and zzso response zzso zzso with these zzso we provide the first evidence that treatment of zzso cells with insulin and zzso zzso agents leads to an increase in zzso zzso In conclusion, these data represent the first characterization of the zzso zzso our findings should facilitate further studies designed to understand mechanisms regulating zzso zzso expression in healthy and diseased human zzso
