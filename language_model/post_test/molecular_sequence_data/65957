zzso variation and population structure of hair crab zzso zzso were examined using zzso sequence analysis of 580 base pairs zzso in the 3' portion of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I gene zzso of 20 samples collected from 16 locales in Japan (the zzso and zzso zzso and one in zzso A total of 27 zzso was defined by 23 variable zzso sites in the examined zzso zzso zzso population F zzso estimates and zzso tree zzso distinct genetic differentiation between the representative samples from the Pacific Ocean off the Eastern zzso Island and the Sea of Japan, while others were intermediate between these two zzso zzso also showed a weak but significant differentiation among these three zzso The present results suggest a moderate population structure of hair zzso probably influenced by high gene flow between regional populations due to sea current dependent zzso zzso of this zzso
