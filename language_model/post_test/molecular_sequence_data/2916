zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an alpha 2 beta 2 zzso zzso the formation of zzso in zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report here on the isolation of zzso clones zzso the zzso of the zzso from human tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Eight overlapping clones covering almost all of the corresponding zzso zzso including all the coding zzso were zzso These clones zzso a zzso of 517 zzso acid zzso and a signal zzso of 17 zzso zzso Previous characterization of zzso clones for the zzso of zzso zzso has indicated that its C zzso has the zzso acid sequence zzso which, it has been suggested, is necessary for the retention of a zzso within the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso does not have this zzso zzso and thus one function of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso appears to be to retain the zzso within this cell zzso Interestingly, three of the zzso clones for the zzso contained a zzso sequence zzso but not identical to the corresponding zzso sequence found in four other zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments demonstrated that this difference was due to the existence of two types of zzso present in approximately equal zzso Southern zzso analyses of human zzso DNA with a zzso probe for the zzso suggested the presence of only one gene zzso the two types of zzso which appear to result from mutually exclusive alternative zzso of primary transcripts of one zzso
