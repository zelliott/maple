zzso is an important zzso regulator of gastrointestinal motor function, zzso by the class I G zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two chemically distinct full zzso of the zzso zzso are known to bind to distinct regions of this zzso based on previous systematic zzso of zzso regions that zzso the effects on these two zzso In the present work, we examined the predicted zzso loop regions of this zzso for effects on zzso and zzso zzso We prepared zzso zzso zzso that included sequential deletions throughout the predicted first, second, and third zzso zzso as well as replacing the zzso in key regions with zzso zzso or zzso Each construct was zzso expressed in zzso cells and characterized for zzso and zzso zzso calcium responses and for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each resulted in substantial loss of zzso calcium responses to stimulation by both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the negative impact on biological activity zzso by both zzso These data suggest that action by different chemical classes of zzso that are known to interact with distinct regions of the zzso zzso likely yield a common zzso state of the zzso face of this zzso that is responsible for interaction with its G zzso The identification of functionally important zzso in the predicted zzso face provides strong candidates for playing roles in zzso protein zzso
