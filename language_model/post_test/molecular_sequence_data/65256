An orphan G zzso zzso from the rat has recently been demonstrated to act as a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso is possibly involved in zzso Here we report the cloning and functional expression of an additional zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso code zzso zzso for this zzso was obtained from mouse brain and the mouse zzso zzso rat zzso hybrid cell line zzso The new mouse protein sequence shares only zzso identity with that of the rat zzso zzso suggesting that the receptors are not species zzso but distinct zzso zzso In human zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the new mouse zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso formation with zzso zzso of 8 and 15 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to change the responses to zzso In contrast, zzso of cells with zzso toxin abolished the effect of zzso When the novel zzso zzso was expressed in zzso insect cells, a specific binding site for zzso was zzso In competition zzso the rank order of potency of selected zzso was identical to that obtained in zzso from zzso cells and rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data show that a second zzso DNA sequence encodes for a zzso zzso activated by low, zzso zzso of zzso
