The zzso replication origin zzso and the gene zzso the replication zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso have been identified and cloned into an zzso coli zzso zzso The replication origin is composed of 13 characteristically arranged zzso boxes, binding sites for the zzso zzso and an zzso stretch, followed by the zzso zzso The zzso gene is located upstream of the origin and expresses a typical zzso protein that follows the division into four zzso as with other members of the zzso protein zzso Here, we report the zzso of zzso zzso and characterize the interaction of the zzso protein with the replication origin, with regard to the binding zzso and zzso of this zzso Using gel zzso zzso surface zzso resonance zzso and electron zzso we show that, unlike the zzso coli zzso zzso does not recognize a single zzso box, instead a cluster of three zzso repeated zzso boxes is the minimal requirement for specific zzso The highest binding affinities are observed with full-length zzso or six zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso The zzso zzso interaction will be compared with zzso complex formation generated by other zzso zzso
