zzso of cells to one another and to zzso zzso has major roles in zzso processes during zzso One important family of cell zzso receptors are the zzso which in zzso have crucial functions in at least two zzso zzso events: embryonic muscle attachment and zzso of the wing zzso We have cloned and characterized a gene zzso that is expressed in embryonic zzso and muscle cells, including zzso and zzso muscle attachment sites in a pattern that is reminiscent of the expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are produced by this gene and zzso similar proteins with two alternative zzso zzso Both proteins contain identical zzso zzso a protein sequence motif that is found in numerous proteins that interact with zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso in a region including the zzso domain to the mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso important zzso zzso zzso clones of an embryonic lethal zzso in this gene zzso cause wing zzso and flight zzso zzso which are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene encodes a putative zzso protein that appears to regulate some aspects of zzso zzso zzso
