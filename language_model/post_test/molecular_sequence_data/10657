A zzso study has been carried out on six moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from ponds of a zzso located in zzso zzso These strains were examined for 150 zzso zzso zzso and nutritional traits and showed zzso characteristics similar to those of zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso The zzso zzso + zzso content of their DNA ranged between 70 and 72 zzso values quite similar to those described for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis of one representative isolate showed that it is zzso quite close to zzso zzso within the zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed a high degree of zzso zzso to zzso among the six zzso and the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso All data demonstrate quite clearly that the six zzso are members of the species zzso zzso Since this species was described on the basis of a single strain isolated from unrefined solar salt, and its description is not complete (especially in the zzso of different zzso our study contributes to a better description of the moderate zzso zzso zzso
