The sequences of the zzso loop and surrounding regions of human zzso virus zzso from a zzso zzso were studied and the horizontal and vertical transmissions zzso The father's virus was variable for zzso with zzso zzso and sequences of the zzso loop central core zzso In contrast, the mother's viral sequences were much less diverse and reacted with a virus zzso zzso The zzso viral sequences were also less diverse than those of the father, and zzso sites were zzso By zzso analysis, the major zzso of which zzso reacted with the zzso zzso was found to be transmitted from the mother to her zzso however, the zzso minor clones did not bind to the zzso These findings suggest that both horizontal and vertical virus transmission were selective, and that the zzso transmitted virus in infants zzso more rapidly than viruses in the mother, to whom the virus was zzso zzso
