G zzso receptors zzso are important targets for various drugs that are on the zzso An important area in which we urgently need novel drug targets is the field of zzso Recently a new class of zzso sensing G zzso receptors have been identified in zzso The founding member of this novel class of zzso is zzso the zzso sensing zzso of zzso zzso This zzso activates the zzso zzso that is important for the zzso transition and for stress zzso The capacity to change zzso is an important zzso factor for zzso zzso and it has been shown in these zzso that zzso also depends on the zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso receptors in these zzso may be interesting targets for zzso Despite the fact that these receptors are not essential for growth, modification of their activity may affect fitness of the fungus allowing the human or plant defense systems to win the zzso In addition, synthetic zzso zzso such as the one observed between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso may be a tool to come up with a good combination therapy zzso It will be necessary to identify zzso or inverse zzso for these zzso which will require good screening systems and large compound zzso
