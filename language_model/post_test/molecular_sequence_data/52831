zzso energy production requires complex interactions among proteins zzso in both the nuclear and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of interacting gene products has been previously suggested based on zzso comparisons of zzso c zzso by the nuclear zzso zzso and zzso c zzso zzso zzso in the zzso DNA by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have previously been found in zzso zzso In order to determine if zzso also shows zzso variation, this gene was isolated from a zzso library using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of a zzso sequence and 25 zzso DNA sequences derived from four zzso zzso populations yielded the following zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene is interrupted by an zzso that occurs at the same position as the zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso there is extensive sequence variation within both the coding region and zzso of this gene and the vast majority of this variation occurs between sequences drawn from geographically distinct zzso zzso the coding sequence variation includes a minimum of five zzso acid replacement zzso zzso segregation of length zzso among offspring in an zzso cross revealed zzso ratios consistent with the proposed zzso nature of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the requisite genetic variation required for zzso zzso exists in the zzso system in zzso zzso
