The synthesis of an zzso duplex and its use to zzso DNA zzso have been previously described (Gibson & zzso zzso We now present detailed experiments utilizing this zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso coli DNA zzso I zzso zzso and the zzso labeling of the zzso The zzso duplex is an efficient zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso activities of the zzso However, the zzso degradation of the zzso base is dramatically zzso On the basis of the ability of these duplexes to zzso the zzso we have determined that the protein contacts between five and seven bases of duplex zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso results in the in zzso formation of a zzso with the zzso base bound at the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso of this complex followed by zzso zzso and isolation of zzso peptides results in the identification of a single zzso modified by the zzso DNA zzso We identify zzso as the modified zzso acid and thus zzso the zzso site for zzso in the zzso A zzso DNA duplex has been prepared as a fluorescent probe of protein zzso This has been zzso to determine the location of the primer zzso when bound to the zzso zzso When the duplex contains five zzso bases in the primer strand of the duplex, the primer zzso resides predominantly at the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso of the mismatched bases by the zzso activity of the zzso yields a zzso complex with the primer zzso now bound predominantly at the zzso active zzso Data are presented which suggest that the zzso step in the zzso activity of the zzso is zzso of the primer zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso
