A zzso zzso activity from human zzso zzso able to transfer a zzso group from zzso zzso zzso onto zzso or terminal zzso zzso of zzso chains from human respiratory zzso has been zzso The reaction products containing a terminal zzso were identified by high performance zzso zzso Using zzso as a zzso the optimal activity was obtained with zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso in a 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso buffer at pH zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed at zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso The zzso had more affinity for zzso chains with a terminal zzso zzso than for zzso it was unable to catalyze the transfer of zzso to position 6 of the zzso zzso contained in a terminal zzso zzso However, zzso with a zzso terminal zzso were zzso for a zzso zzso from human zzso zzso These data point out that zzso must act before zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
