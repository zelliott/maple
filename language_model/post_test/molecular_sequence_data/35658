zzso of zzso zzso in human plasma was investigated by searching for a stable zzso as a marker of zzso release in zzso zzso incubated with diluted zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso without an increase in zzso and zzso was also zzso to zzso zzso acid inhibited the formation of zzso from zzso whereas zzso inhibited the formation of zzso from BK as well as that of zzso from zzso or zzso The half lives of zzso zzso zzso and zzso under the present experimental conditions were 60 zzso 90 zzso 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso was the most stable one and may be used as a marker for BK production in zzso
