The zzso zzso in zzso was one of the first to arise by direct zzso of the zzso Ds element from its original or zzso location in zzso zzso to a known locus in the same zzso zzso Thus, zzso of its structure should shed light on the nature of the original Ds element described by zzso in zzso The Ds zzso in zzso has been reported to be only zzso zzso zzso shorter than other zzso Ds elements that have been zzso We have characterized here the Ds element in our zzso stocks and have confirmed by genetic and molecular tests that, in the presence of zzso it acts as a zzso zzso The Ds zzso at zzso is zzso zzso zzso Besides its normal zzso and 3' ends, it contains an internal 3' end at the same junction as the zzso double Ds element that has been found in several zzso zzso Thus, it appears to have arisen from the zzso double Ds by internal deletion of zzso zzso Because the element has lost one internal zzso end, but retains the zzso properties of double zzso we have named it zzso zzso The origin, structure and properties of zzso zzso double Ds support the hypothesis that double Ds zzso to the zzso Ds element at the zzso location in zzso
