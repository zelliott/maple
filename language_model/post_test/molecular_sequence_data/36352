Previous zzso mapping studies of human factor VIII zzso inhibitor zzso with heavy chain specificity localized zzso to the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso In this report we have used zzso deletion analysis and zzso zzso to identify a minimum length zzso and zzso acid zzso that contribute to the zzso zzso recognized by these zzso zzso expression plasmids were exploited to demonstrate that a zzso zzso of approximately 150 zzso is required to generate a common heavy chain zzso Another series of plasmids were constructed that zzso a zzso zzso containing an internal zzso four zzso with single zzso zzso two zzso with triple zzso changes; and a quadruple zzso acid replacement within one zzso The relative zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were tested by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso with a variety of human zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso These techniques illustrate that the internal deletion zzso and one of the relatively conservative zzso acid substitution triple zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly decreased zzso The data identify zzso zzso as three critical components of an zzso for human zzso inhibitor zzso and identify a major zzso zzso involved in the immune response to zzso
