Single zzso acid zzso at zzso 37 of the zzso beta chain zzso beta zzso between zzso and zzso markedly influences zzso to the insulin zzso zzso We investigated the effects of DR beta 37 zzso regarding recognition of zzso peptides by a zzso zzso zzso specific to a zzso zzso zzso presented by the zzso zzso zzso responded better to zzso presented by zzso zzso with a single zzso at DR beta zzso of the zzso zzso One hundred and zzso peptides carrying single zzso zzso at each of the core zzso zzso of zzso were tested for full zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides showed full zzso 34 zzso exhibited zzso zzso and 45 zzso exhibited neither full zzso nor zzso zzso irrespective of the presenting molecules zzso or zzso On the other hand, 29 analogue peptides zzso at each of zzso zzso of zzso were recognized differently by zzso depending on the presenting zzso These observations indicate that 1) single zzso acid zzso zzso at the DR beta 37 zzso induced a zzso change distinguished by zzso in some but not all zzso and 2) these zzso changes were observed even in analogue peptides carrying single zzso zzso at zzso far from a putative DR beta 37 contact zzso These findings provide further evidence for altered human zzso responses induced by zzso zzso with minor zzso
