PC cell line is a highly zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cell line zzso Culture medium of PC cells contains a growth promoting activity for zzso cells and producer zzso PC zzso growth factor zzso was zzso to zzso from PC zzso medium as an apparent zzso protein by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso F yielded an apparent zzso protein component indicating that zzso is a zzso containing about 20 zzso of zzso zzso sequence from zzso degradation of zzso fragments obtained by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso demonstrates that zzso contains regions of sequence identity to that deduced from the zzso or zzso precursor zzso zzso are small zzso zzso from zzso extracts with no apparent biological zzso zzso are cell growth zzso zzso as small molecular mass zzso zzso from kidney zzso The existence of a large molecular mass precursor for zzso or zzso has been predicted based upon recently cloned zzso zzso these zzso within a zzso protein with putative zzso zzso No biological activity has previously been attributed to the zzso The present results indicate that zzso is a potential precursor for zzso and/or zzso that this zzso protein is zzso and zzso and that it can function as a zzso for zzso cells as well as an zzso growth factor for PC zzso
