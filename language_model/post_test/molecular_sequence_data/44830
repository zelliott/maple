The crisis in zzso resistance has resulted in an increasing fear of the emergence of zzso zzso Resistance to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the spread of these pathogens throughout the environment, has shown that this scenario is a matter of fact rather than zzso The basis for zzso resistance is the manufacture of the zzso zzso which is incorporated into the zzso cell wall in place of the zzso target zzso zzso to the resistance mechanism is the production of a zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso Two highly efficient zzso zzso have been cloned from zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso show high zzso acid sequence similarity to each other ( approximately zzso but less so to other zzso zzso zzso We have cloned zzso from two zzso organisms, the zzso producer zzso zzso and the zzso producer zzso zzso These zzso show strong predicted zzso acid zzso to zzso and zzso zzso but not to other zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso shows zzso zzso activity in zzso extracts of zzso zzso transformed with the zzso gene and confirms the predicted zzso zzso These results imply a close evolutionary relationship between resistance mechanisms in the clinics and in zzso zzso
