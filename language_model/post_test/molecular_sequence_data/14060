A hybrid zzso marker for transformation was constructed by placing the promoter zzso from the gene zzso the zzso zzso translation zzso factor zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso end of the zzso coli zzso B zzso gene zzso zzso containing this hybrid gene zzso transformed zzso zzso strain zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso consisting of the zzso resistance marker flanked by zzso of zzso DNA has also been shown to transform zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA consistently produced more zzso than circular zzso zzso zzso of 23 zzso zzso revealed integration of the zzso in only eight of these zzso In two zzso integration into the largest zzso zzso resulted in an zzso of the molecular zzso In four other zzso integration occurred in zzso VI (the zzso containing zzso but only one was the result of zzso zzso with the zzso copy of the zzso zzso The remainder of the zzso contained zzso plasmids that could be zzso on an zzso gel by zzso zzso zzso These plasmids were generally zzso in zzso One zzso appeared to contain four plasmids ranging in size from 4 to zzso suggesting zzso of the transforming zzso One zzso obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to transform zzso coli to zzso zzso However, after recovery from zzso coli, this zzso zzso zzso was unable to transform zzso zzso to zzso
