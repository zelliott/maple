During zzso development in zzso zzso approximately half of all developing germ cells undergo zzso While this process is zzso zzso from worms to humans, the regulators of germ cell death are still largely zzso In a genetic screen for novel genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso we identified and cloned zzso Loss of zzso function results in increased zzso zzso and reduced zzso size due to defective zzso exit from zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is expressed in the zzso from the zzso zzso stage to zzso zzso evidence and genetic zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso in the zzso signaling cascade and directly interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a new component of the zzso cascade that controls zzso progression and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and functions as a negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso during zzso development and in muscle zzso
