Up to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is preventable by maternal zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and some other functional zzso are risk factors for zzso in some zzso However, despite extensive study, the genetic risk factors for zzso are incompletely zzso zzso zzso that diminish zzso of reduced folate in the mother during pregnancy could contribute to zzso in her zzso acting in the mother as zzso zzso We recently discovered a zzso 19 zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso within zzso of zzso zzso zzso that is a good candidate for such a genetic zzso Since there is zzso for zzso regulatory elements and the deletion zzso removes a potential zzso zzso factor binding site, we hypothesized that the deletion zzso could be functional and act in zzso mothers to increase the risk of zzso in her zzso We found that zzso for this deletion zzso was significantly more frequent in zzso mothers, but not in zzso fathers or patients, compared with controls and was associated with a significantly increased odds ratio zzso zzso of being an zzso mother compared with other zzso zzso distribution zzso the constraints of zzso equilibrium in controls, zzso patients and fathers, but not in zzso zzso If confirmed, these findings could lead to improved forms of folate supplementation for zzso About half of dietary zzso and all of zzso acid supplements must be reduced by zzso to be available for mother and zzso zzso zzso could be preferable for supplements during pregnancy to prevent zzso
