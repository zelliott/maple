The zzso tumor zzso gene is zzso in varying zzso of almost all tumor types zzso The rate of zzso and the zzso spectrum in some tumors are specific for environmental zzso assumed to be involved in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso supposedly induced by zzso exposure often contain a specific point zzso in zzso zzso and in lung zzso of zzso with heavy zzso exposure, another specific point zzso in zzso zzso suggestive of an zzso zzso has been zzso The interpretation of studies linking the zzso spectrum with specific environmental zzso is complicated by the zzso or unknown genesis of most zzso However, people given injections of the X-ray contrast medium zzso zzso in the past have experienced an enormous risk of liver tumors, and virtually all of these are supposedly induced by zzso from the zzso of zzso The examination of these tumors may provide evidence as to whether specific zzso point zzso are relevant in zzso zzso zzso we collected zzso zzso archival zzso from 18 zzso zzso 9 zzso and 9 zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso were analyzed for zzso protein expression by zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso and for zzso of zzso 5-8 by zzso and constant zzso gel zzso G zzso T zzso of the third base of zzso zzso of the zzso gene were specifically screened for by restriction zzso No high score for zzso protein expression zzso positive zzso of zzso of examined zzso was zzso lower scores were seen in 5 of 18 zzso zzso zzso 1 of 9 zzso zzso and 0 of 8 zzso zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso a zzso T zzso G zzso of the first base zzso zzso occurred in a zzso zzso The rate of zzso point zzso in zzso liver tumors seems to be lower than in European zzso zzso in zzso The study does not exclude the possibility that zzso zzso may involve zzso of zzso by gross deletions of the zzso but it speaks against the proposed specificity of point zzso of zzso zzso in cancer supposedly induced by zzso from zzso zzso
