zzso alkaline zzso zzso was zzso with the putative zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso cells zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso The sequence of the zzso 17 zzso acids and five other internal zzso peptides revealed that it is zzso to the zzso zzso alkaline zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and used for amplification of a zzso segment of the zzso gene by zzso chain reaction, using zzso DNA from a zzso cell zzso library as zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso generated was then used as a probe to isolate a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone from the same library harboring a large, intact open reading zzso This zzso possessed an open reading frame zzso a zzso protein including a putative signal zzso of 17 zzso acids followed by zzso zzso identical to the zzso sequence determined from the zzso zzso zzso closely related to five zzso peptides from the zzso protein were also contained within the zzso zzso zzso with the human, zzso rat and mouse zzso zzso was found to be zzso at both the zzso and the zzso acid zzso The zzso was transferred into a zzso expression zzso and expressed following zzso into zzso and mink lung zzso cell zzso High levels of zzso active zzso were zzso along with a zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso against the original crude zzso zzso zzso was specifically released from intact cells by treatment with zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, only one species of zzso was detected using a zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso expressed on cell surfaces via zzso zzso Despite zzso zzso in two dimensions and following zzso in a third dimension, zzso failed to function as an zzso zzso since its expression failed to provide for attachment or entry of virus into zzso
