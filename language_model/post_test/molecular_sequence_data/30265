zzso are the only group of organisms in which both zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso are known to zzso Most zzso zzso zzso are exceptionally short, often only 50 bases zzso The consensus donor and zzso zzso site sequences found in other animals are used for both zzso and zzso In order to identify the machinery required for these zzso events, we have characterized the zzso zzso zzso They are similar in sequence and structure to those characterized in other organisms, and several sequence variations discovered in the zzso zzso provide support for previously proposed structure zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso by gene zzso We report here the sequences of many of these zzso We find a highly zzso zzso the zzso sequence element zzso about 65 zzso upstream of all 21 zzso genes thus far zzso including the zzso zzso zzso which specify the zzso that provide the zzso zzso in zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is distinct from zzso from other zzso
