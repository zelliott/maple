The zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso but its function remains to be zzso Here, we developed a new zzso zzso strategy to zzso the role of zzso in zzso cell zzso We show that in the absence of zzso the zzso becomes highly unstable and that this instability is caused by defects in the zzso segregation zzso Analysis of zzso zzso reveals that in these cells it is enriched at zzso zzso with zzso on the arms of zzso but not at zzso zzso When zzso is zzso normal zzso interactions are disrupted on the zzso arms and, notably, also at zzso zzso zzso zzso controls the zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso is essential for the accurate transmission of zzso
