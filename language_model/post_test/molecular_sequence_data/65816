The zzso zzso is known to play a pivotal role in zzso proliferation and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso box O zzso zzso by directly interacting with and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso 344 and zzso zzso which consequently promotes cell proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso degrades via an zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso is resistant to the interaction and degradation by zzso double minute 2 zzso thereby resulting in a strong zzso of cell proliferation and zzso Taken together, our study zzso a novel zzso in cell growth and zzso through negative regulation of zzso by zzso and zzso
