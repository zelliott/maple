The edible straw mushroom zzso zzso is an important crop in South East Asia and is predominantly harvested in the egg zzso Rapid zzso zzso and cap expansion result in a swift transition from the egg to zzso and maturation stage, which are subjected to fast zzso and zzso In other mushrooms, zzso have been associated with degradation zzso of the cell wall during zzso zzso and zzso We present a new zzso zzso family 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso and highly zzso deduced zzso zzso The zzso model and presumed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are identical to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso supporting similar zzso zzso In addition to previous association to zzso zzso and zzso our data clearly indicates a role for cap zzso zzso Digital gene zzso quantitative zzso and zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso analysis showed low zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso egg and zzso stages and significantly increased levels in the maturation zzso zzso relative quantitative zzso analysis designated expression of zzso to the zzso in the zzso stage and to the zzso and zzso in the maturation zzso zzso cell wall softening activity, close correlation of zzso expression with the principal expanding mushroom zzso and a strong conservation of expression patterns and protein sequences in other mushrooms, make zzso zzso zzso an important candidate for future studies on mechanisms of zzso body expansion and zzso causing commodity value zzso
