We have examined the cellular association and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso At 4 degrees C, a zzso PO zzso of zzso zzso exhibits apparent zzso binding zzso zzso 22 zzso 1 zzso that is competitive with the binding of zzso zzso zzso The value of zzso for zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso is 5 zzso 2 zzso zzso was used to strip cell surface zzso zzso zzso accumulated in a zzso fashion, consistent with a zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent, PO zzso inhibited the rate of zzso of fluorescent zzso also a marker of zzso This was correlated with direct in zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso beta 1 by the zzso and PO zzso Furthermore, other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso materials, perhaps by stimulating the zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso of charged zzso appears to be dependent on intact zzso zzso activity, which is inhibited in zzso by zzso and PO zzso
