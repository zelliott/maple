zzso is the novel second zzso that elicits calcium release from zzso calcium stores and works independently of zzso In zzso the zzso zzso function is found in two membrane zzso zzso and zzso These zzso exposed zzso bear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In spite of its functional importance, the structural basis of these zzso reactions remains zzso We determined the crystal structures of the zzso region of human zzso at atomic resolution in the free form and in complexes with five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three-dimensional structural views of the reaction zzso with these zzso revealed the mode of zzso binding and the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso In each zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are recognized predominantly through van der zzso interactions with two zzso zzso and thereby the zzso bond of zzso is correctly exposed near a zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso the zzso intermediate of the zzso type zzso This zzso of the zzso zzso also implies the mechanism of zzso between the zzso base and the zzso The three key zzso are zzso among the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and hence this zzso recognition mode and zzso scheme appear to be common in the zzso zzso
