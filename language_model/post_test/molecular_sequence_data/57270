We have determined the relative zzso frequency and estimated linkage zzso between six DNA zzso of the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after DNA amplification by the zzso chain zzso Strong linkage zzso was detected between many of the pair wise comparisons in a sample of 60 patients zzso for familial zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of patients were zzso for at least one zzso and thus potentially zzso for zzso zzso The zzso were used to follow the inheritance of the defective zzso of the LDL zzso gene in the relatives of a patient with zzso zzso of LDL zzso activity on zzso cell lines from two members of the family was used to confirm that the zzso but not the zzso brother, had a zzso in the LDL zzso In the family, none of the children had inherited the zzso of the LDL zzso gene zzso to be zzso The problems associated with this zzso approach to identify relatives of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH are zzso
