On the basis of the published literature, it is still difficult to draw conclusions as to whether zzso zzso circulation is influenced by host species zzso 

To provide data regarding the genetic zzso between zzso and human zzso strains present in Argentina as a means of defining the host range and epidemiology of these zzso 

zzso specimens zzso collected from kidney transplant patients zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso using zzso designed to amplify the zzso zzso zzso segment zzso zzso sequences were further examined zzso 

By zzso amplification 14 of 74 samples rendered zzso of the expected 282 base pair size (8 detected from humans and 6 from zzso Eleven zzso (5 from humans and 6 from zzso were selected for sequencing and subjected to zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed similarities between human and zzso viral sequences that ranged between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso analysis identified these 11 strains as zzso zzso zzso strains and showed that they grouped as a single separate zzso distinct from other zzso strains detected in humans and zzso from other zzso 

The present study suggests that closely related zzso strains zzso both pigs and humans in Argentina and that the epidemiology of zzso is not species zzso
