The zzso gene encodes an alcohol zzso zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and several kinds of zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso fatty acids and zzso A series of analyses of the zzso promoter identified an 18 zzso element essential for zzso zzso zzso of the 18 zzso element into a zzso carrying the zzso promoter deleted zzso zzso and zzso zzso repression by zzso fatty zzso The 18 zzso element contains a binding sequence for zzso which is a zzso zzso and zzso In zzso binding studies showed that zzso binds to the 18 zzso element essential for zzso zzso The results of internal deletion studies of the promoter region suggested that there was also a region responsible for zzso oxygen zzso This region contained the consensus binding sequence for the hypoxic zzso zzso In zzso binding studies showed that zzso binds to the region responsible for oxygen zzso To investigate the effect of the hypoxic zzso complex on transcription, zzso expression was measured in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso and zzso disruption caused elevated expression of zzso under zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso is dependent on zzso and the zzso hypoxic zzso complex is responsible for repression by zzso Furthermore, a study of zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso protein zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso
