A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected from zzso zzso in the Western zzso South zzso The strain was able to grow in the presence of 5 % zzso It contained zzso acid and zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso present in the zzso sugar zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a member of either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso based on a rapid molecular identification method by using zzso restriction zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso distinct from zzso zzso zzso and was shown to be a separate zzso species based on zzso zzso experiments zzso % zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus presented as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
