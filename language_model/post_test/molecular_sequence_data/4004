zzso analysis of numerous strains of zzso isolated from diverse geographic origins has revealed three distinct groups of zzso groups M, zzso and zzso Within group M, zzso zzso and circulating zzso forms zzso zzso Recently, two zzso zzso of similar complex mosaic viruses containing fragments of zzso A, G, I, and J were described in patients from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report on the characterization of two additional full-length zzso sequences with similar mosaic structure in zzso zzso individuals from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis confirmed that the previously described zzso zzso and zzso were indeed a new zzso of zzso which we can now designate as zzso This new zzso fits the complex zzso designation, because four different zzso zzso G, K, and zzso were involved in the mosaic zzso zzso The zzso in the pol zzso which was initially characterized as unknown in the zzso strain and subsequently as zzso I in the zzso strain, is now, with the recent description of the new K zzso clearly identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Ivory Coast, and Nigeria, although the exact prevalence remains to be zzso zzso this new zzso has also been documented on other zzso zzso zzso and zzso showing that these viruses are spreading not only locally but zzso
