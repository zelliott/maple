The zzso sea zzso zzso zzso causes severe cases of zzso We isolated the 60 zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso as the major toxin from the isolated zzso of this zzso zzso showed fatal toxicity to mice with zzso injection at a minimum lethal dose of less than 250 zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was determined and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed high similarity with zzso which had been isolated as one of the major toxins from the zzso sea zzso zzso zzso These sea zzso toxins are new members of the family of proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso best known in pore forming proteins such as zzso These are the first examples of zzso domain proteins as toxins for prey acquisition or zzso predators in zzso
