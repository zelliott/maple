To facilitate zzso chemical zzso of zzso to the heat zzso zzso B zzso of zzso coli zzso a series of genetically modified fusion proteins of zzso were zzso The zzso fusion proteins had modified versions of a short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called the zzso tag attached at their C zzso The zzso zzso differed from each other in the position of a single zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso at any position within the zzso zzso tag did not prevent the zzso proteins from forming zzso or binding to zzso zzso but the position of the zzso had variable impact on the yield of the fusion zzso Following zzso chemical zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso within the zzso tag, the zzso zzso zzso retained their ability to bind zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice with an experimental zzso zzso chemically linked to zzso induced high levels of zzso zzso that could be detected in the serum, saliva and zzso and lung zzso No zzso responses to zzso were detected when zzso was zzso with, but not linked to, zzso
