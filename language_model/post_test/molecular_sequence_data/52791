The zzso zzso consists of trees and zzso which are distributed in temperate and zzso zzso zzso known as zzso a few of the zzso species are valued for their zzso which constitutes the chief feed for mulberry zzso zzso and zzso compounds present in the foliage not only add zzso factors to the feed but also contribute greatly to zzso health and silk zzso zzso zzso which is the first step in zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and its expression characterized in mulberry and transgenic zzso In zzso zzso transcripts were highest in young leaves and zzso The promoter region of the zzso gene was fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene and the fusion introduced into zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression was limited to the zzso zzso and root zzso zzso Later, zzso zzso was observed in floral zzso guard cells, and the heads of zzso on the stem and zzso zzso activity increased zzso by treatment with 100 zzso zzso acid and zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso These results show that expression of the zzso gene is zzso regulated by zzso and environmental cues, suggesting that its zzso zzso a may provide a precursor for synthesis of specific zzso during mulberry growth and zzso
