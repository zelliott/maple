The green zzso zzso has become a valuable model zzso for understanding the interesting mechanism of massive zzso zzso Previously, DNA sequences of several zzso zzso were obtained from zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso was isolated from zzso zzso using a zzso chain reaction zzso The full-length zzso sequence was zzso base pairs zzso containing a zzso zzso putative open reading frame which coded a zzso zzso acid deduced zzso whose molecular weight was zzso zzso zzso A complete zzso search displayed that the zzso and putative protein sequence have sequence identities of zzso and zzso with those of green zzso zzso zzso zzso It was predicted that this zzso zzso zzso may be located in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso had a closer relationship with the zzso of algae and higher plants than with those of other zzso
