Four zzso proteins of zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso sequences and zzso properties were zzso Three could be matched with proteins from other zzso One was a zzso as its level increased when cells were grown in zzso media, and the channel it formed was blocked by zzso Another was like zzso and zzso of zzso coli, except that its channel zzso much more zzso The third zzso which was produced in zzso zzso exhibited several properties of the general zzso zzso zzso The fourth showed no similarity to any known zzso It had a unique zzso and it formed small zzso zzso zzso Two other proteins which corresponded to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso were partly zzso
