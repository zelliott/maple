The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises the majority of zzso and species diversity in the New World zzso These zzso exhibit a wide range of social behaviors, making them an excellent group for studying patterns of social evolution in zzso However, to date the tribal and generic relationships have remained zzso We reconstructed the zzso of the zzso using a combined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and nuclear zzso gene data zzso A total of zzso aligned zzso sites were obtained for 112 species, representing 25 of 38 currently recognized zzso and all four zzso A strict consensus of five equally zzso trees recovered the zzso and three of its four zzso The majority rule consensus tree derived from the zzso analyses based on the zzso and zzso recovered many zzso shared with the zzso trees and is identical to the single best tree zzso from maximum likelihood analysis, aside from the zzso of one zzso A comparison of zzso and nuclear genes indicated that zzso provided higher consistency index zzso data decisiveness zzso zzso Bremer support (PBS) than any of the zzso genes zzso The combined zzso and nuclear DNA provide strong support for the zzso of the zzso and three of its four tribes zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso with respect to zzso and contains two zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the newly zzso tribe zzso Our analyses show that there is a strong zzso component to the evolution of maternal zzso Given the widespread occurrence of maternal care within the zzso this trait is estimated to have zzso or zzso 3 origins, two zzso and one zzso Our results suggest that the evolution of maternal care in insects may not be as zzso zzso as previously zzso
