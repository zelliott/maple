zzso exposure of humans and animals to ozone results in increased lung zzso however, the mechanisms underlying this response are not completely zzso We examined the potential involvement of the zzso zzso factor, zzso inflammatory protein 2 zzso in zzso zzso zzso relationships for ozone and zzso expression were characterized by exposing zzso mice to zzso zzso ozone for 3 zzso and determining lung levels of zzso zzso 6 zzso after zzso zzso relationships between ozone and zzso were determined by exposing mice (2 zzso ozone zzso 3 zzso and characterizing zzso zzso expression 0, 2, 6, and 24 zzso after zzso zzso in lung zzso fluid were determined in both zzso and time course zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and this increase corresponded with recruitment of zzso zzso zzso was increased immediately after ozone exposure and decreased to control levels by 24 zzso To examine the role of direct zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were exposed in zzso for 4 zzso to zzso M hydrogen zzso and zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso levels in lung zzso were increased by zzso or zzso zzso M hydrogen zzso In zzso our findings suggest the zzso protein zzso may be responsible, at least in part, for zzso increases in lung zzso and indicate that direct exposure of zzso zzso to an zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso
