In the zzso zzso a variety of well characterized processes are regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso is considered a model zzso for zzso zzso although the molecular identity of the channels responsible for the zzso signals remains largely zzso We have cloned - for the first time in a zzso - the full sequence of the gene zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells showing molecular characteristics of higher zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso domain binds zzso whereas zzso unexpectedly zzso this protein to the zzso zzso The level of zzso expression was reduced, as shown on a zzso level and by zzso by decreasing the concentration of zzso zzso zzso cells rapidly adjust their zzso level to that in the outside zzso zzso reveal spontaneous fluctuations in zzso zzso levels along the zzso system and these signals change upon zzso of zzso zzso Considering the ongoing expulsion of substantial amounts of zzso by the zzso system, we propose here that zzso receptors serve a new function, zzso a zzso graded zzso of zzso to fine-tune zzso zzso
