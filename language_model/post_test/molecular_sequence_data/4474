zzso cells express several zzso receptors that recognize class I zzso molecules expressed on target zzso The zzso cell zzso receptors zzso provide a key regulatory function for zzso cells via specific interaction with zzso complexes, but the molecular details for recognition of class I zzso molecules by zzso still remain zzso Here we report zzso cloning and expression of zzso zzso and a zzso killer cell zzso zzso zzso from a Korean blood donor and demonstrate direct binding between zzso soluble zzso zzso and zzso soluble zzso zzso We identified three zzso killer cell receptors zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Native gel shift zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso bind both zzso and zzso zzso but zzso zzso binds neither of the zzso zzso However, binding of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is affected by the zzso zzso bound on the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso may be dependent on the zzso In addition, the binding interaction requires the presence of both zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the binding mode of zzso and zzso zzso may have some similarity to that of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and may be distinct from that of zzso and zzso
