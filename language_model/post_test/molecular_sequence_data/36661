zzso in zzso amplified zzso DNA zzso were examined in 18 strains of zzso zzso patterns generated from the region spanning the internal transcribed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso produced two clusters corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The type culture of zzso zzso zzso zzso which could not be separated from the zzso zzso group by small zzso zzso zzso patterns, showed a zzso profile that was distinct from all the other zzso The type culture of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is assigned to zzso zzso on the basis of the combined results of zzso and ITS restriction zzso zzso zzso occurred at a separate branch of the distance tree and is unrelated to any of the zzso zzso were in general agreement with reported DNA zzso and are discussed in relation to other molecular and genetic zzso
