We report here that the zzso of zzso zzso on the human zzso zzso zzso controls the zzso zzso and DNA binding zzso The zzso form of both the zzso from human zzso zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso in zzso insect cells was isolated using zzso response element zzso affinity zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso form of the zzso from zzso or zzso cells was zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso localized in the nucleus of zzso zzso cells with an apparent molecular mass of 67 zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso was zzso devoid of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 66 zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso with a zzso zzso eliminated binding to an zzso in a gel mobility shift zzso The binding of the zzso zzso to an zzso was restored by the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso family zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso confirmed that the zzso of zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso to bind an zzso An zzso zzso restored the binding of the zzso zzso to an zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso brought together the two inactive zzso zzso A zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso These experiments establish that zzso of the zzso and DNA binding are regulated by zzso at zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of the regulation of zzso of a steroid hormone zzso by zzso These results are significant since zzso is zzso in zzso breast zzso and may act to enhance the activity of the zzso
