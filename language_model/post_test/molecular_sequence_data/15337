A previously zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from adult extracts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated that the relative molecular mass of the protein in reduced and zzso form is zzso zzso 500 zzso and that it is distinct from the Settlement zzso zzso Complex zzso which has previously been determined as a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the intact protein showed no similarity with previously reported proteins in the zzso zzso The zzso protein at a concentration of 10 zzso zzso induced approximately four times more zzso settlement than the control zzso natural zzso In addition, results of the zzso using both zzso polystyrene plates and zzso gels indicated that this protein is probably released into seawater and attracts zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is a zzso type zzso which zzso settlement of larvae of zzso zzso
