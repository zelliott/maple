During most clinically relevant infections with zzso zzso zzso zzso are generated early, zzso within the first week of zzso As early as 4 days after zzso of mice with zzso zzso virus zzso a zzso virus closely related to rabies virus, zzso could be isolated that zzso zzso zzso Such zzso were devoid of zzso zzso showed high binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and used V gene fragments predominantly belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, most secondary and zzso response zzso isolated 12 and 150 days after infection used several additional V gene zzso zzso which used the zzso combination of early zzso were point zzso but showed only marginally enhanced binding zzso Since all zzso zzso zzso bound to one zzso within the major zzso site of zzso irrespective of the presence or absence of zzso point zzso fine specificity diversification of secondary and zzso responses was achieved by newly appearing V gene zzso
