The ability to accurately zzso the atomic positions of zzso zzso is central to understanding biological zzso Although substantial progress has been made in zzso small, relatively rigid zzso the problem of zzso flexible peptides remains zzso In this communication we present a new method that allows zzso flexibility of zzso and apply it to predict the zzso of peptides bound to two zzso major zzso complex zzso human zzso and zzso zzso Using only the approximate locations of the zzso and zzso zzso of the bound zzso our calculations yield structures with backbone zzso that are similar to structures reported zzso
