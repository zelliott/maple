The major damage to DNA caused by zzso agents involves the formation of zzso zzso Almost all species possess zzso zzso to repair such zzso zzso repairs zzso zzso in DNA by zzso transfer of the zzso group to a zzso zzso in its active site zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso but in this case an zzso zzso replaces zzso in the putative active zzso To reveal the possible function of zzso in processing zzso DNA, we characterized the zzso properties of zzso No zzso activity for synthetic zzso DNA could be zzso indicating zzso is an zzso zzso Nevertheless, gel shift zzso showed that zzso can bind to DNA containing zzso with higher affinity zzso than normal zzso zzso zzso using a fluorescent zzso suggested that zzso recognizes zzso in DNA using the same mechanism as other zzso We then investigated whether zzso functions as a damage zzso zzso zzso identified 20 zzso including a zzso zzso repair protein zzso which interacts with zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was confirmed using a surface zzso resonance zzso These results suggest the possible involvement of zzso in DNA repair zzso
