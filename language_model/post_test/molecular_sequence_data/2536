In this report, we demonstrate the zzso suppression of viral expression in T cells chronically infected with human zzso virus 1 zzso using zzso zzso zzso As a target for zzso intervention, we used the zzso gene zzso which is essential for viral replication and regulates the expression of zzso zzso in part, by affecting the zzso of the viral zzso A zzso zzso complementary to the initiation sequence of zzso rev had a significant and selective zzso effect on the production of several viral proteins in chronically zzso T cells and drastically reduced the zzso zzso viral zzso zzso with relative sparing of smaller zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso sequence with unmodified normal zzso linkages as well as zzso zzso containing sense, random, zzso zzso or zzso sequence with zzso zzso did not have an zzso effect on viral zzso Thus, sequence specificity and zzso resistance were critical for the zzso regulatory effect of the zzso zzso The altered zzso zzso profile induced by the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the mechanism for the zzso of viral expression is due to an interference with the regulatory zzso zzso by translation zzso
