zzso and zzso in cattle express a novel class of zzso zzso zzso specific for bovine zzso zzso termed zzso gamma zzso In cows, the ability of zzso to kill zzso zzso appears to depend largely on this zzso whose interaction with zzso gamma zzso zzso the killing zzso zzso gamma zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso acid zzso region and a short zzso zzso Although related to other zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso belongs to a novel gene family that includes the human killer cell zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso van zzso zzso Howard, zzso zzso van de zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that like these proteins (and unlike other zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso binds zzso via the zzso zzso domain 1 zzso In this present study, we introduced zzso into the predicted loop regions of the zzso domain and zzso the resulting zzso gamma zzso zzso for their ability to bind zzso Our results indicated that the zzso binding site lies within the predicted zzso loop region of the zzso zzso Furthermore, single zzso acid zzso analysis of this region identified zzso and zzso as being critical for zzso zzso
