zzso expression of genes involved in development, differentiation and zzso transformation is regulated by zzso factors including zzso zzso However, most of their zzso sequences are still zzso We report here the molecular characterization of three newly cloned zzso transcripts from human breast cancer zzso In addition, we provide evidence that these alternatively spliced transcripts zzso one zzso protein and two products lacking the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that all three zzso transcripts are induced by zzso acid in zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso gene may be a key element in the establishment of the breast cancer cell zzso
