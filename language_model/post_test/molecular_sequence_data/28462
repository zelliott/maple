The zzso part of class zzso zzso chain zzso zzso is assumed to interact with an accessory zzso site on the class II Major zzso Complex zzso zzso and promote a zzso zzso We have linked this zzso segment zzso zzso to the zzso of the influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to evaluate relationships between the zzso zzso changes and their implication in immune zzso Our zzso zzso named zzso bind with the same affinity to class II zzso molecules as the zzso zzso and is normally recognized by zzso T zzso Interestingly, the presence of the zzso zzso region enhances the rate of association to soluble zzso molecules but prevents the formation of zzso zzso These features suggest the existence of zzso zzso changes induced by the zzso zzso Furthermore, while in zzso zzso and zzso peptides associated to zzso could not be differentiated based on zzso recognition, in zzso the zzso zzso strongly impaired the zzso of zzso zzso as assessed in zzso transgenic zzso Our study demonstrates for the first time that zzso zzso changes, revealed at molecular level, may influence the zzso
