zzso a designed zzso zzso is known to function both as an zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso solution structure of the zzso is key to understand better its zzso relationships and to design more zzso peptides and zzso zzso However, structure zzso of zzso has been elusive due to zzso zzso resonance zzso Here, we found that performing zzso structural studies in a zzso environment zzso exchange broadening and allows the structure of zzso to be zzso zzso folds in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with functionally key zzso zzso lying on one face of the zzso and positively charged, mostly zzso zzso lying on the opposite zzso zzso comparison is made with a zzso yet relatively inactive zzso zzso These results contribute to the design of zzso of zzso for therapeutic use against zzso diseases like cancer, as well as infectious zzso
