zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso class IV zzso factor zzso characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso domain zzso a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso acute regulatory protein zzso zzso transfer domain zzso involved in zzso transport in animals but the function of which is still unknown in zzso By combining zzso and plant zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso was localized to 85 zzso acids in the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso devoid of this zzso domain is unable to zzso a reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter fused to six repeats of the zzso box, a zzso present in target genes of zzso IV zzso in zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso leads to zzso zzso aberrations in transgenic zzso plants, the most conspicuous one being a strong delay in flowering time which is correlated with the zzso of molecular markers for floral transition such as zzso zzso Mays zzso or zzso zzso zzso As suggested by the interaction in zzso between zzso and zzso a bona fide zzso of the zzso complex, zzso may zzso zzso activity of its target genes by interaction with a zzso zzso zzso
