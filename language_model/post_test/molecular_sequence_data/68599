The possible functions of two recently described zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Introduction of gene zzso zzso the bacterial zzso zzso into a number of zzso zzso and zzso coli strains failed to complement the zzso in these zzso and the zzso zzso was accumulated in the bacterial zzso zzso with zzso and zzso which map downstream of zzso restored zzso to some of the zzso which became zzso After zzso of either zzso or zzso such zzso no longer occurred and the zzso protein accumulated in the zzso which suggested that both genes are required for the zzso of zzso and expression of zzso zzso of these genes from high copy number plasmids resulted in the synthesis of exceptionally long zzso and in detection of the zzso protein on zzso zzso
