A major regulatory site for species specificity of zzso in zzso lies at the level of zzso binding to the zzso zzso This implies a high degree of zzso between zzso zzso zzso One putative zzso zzso on zzso is zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with high zzso The mechanism of recognition involves zzso groups in a particular zzso orientation and it has been suggested that this may contribute to species specificity of zzso zzso In the present work this hypothesis has been tested by challenging zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso eggs to recognize zzso zzso zzso as well as a variety of zzso and unrelated zzso zzso show that pig and cow zzso bind readily to zzso ram, and bull zzso but do not recognize guinea-pig zzso or any of the zzso binding proteins from zzso zzso or mouse zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso ram, and bull zzso as well as a range of unidentified proteins in zzso extracts of zzso zzso and mouse zzso The binding of zzso to a variety of proteins not related to zzso is strongest to those with a high content of basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although the secondary folding of the target protein is of major importance as zzso zzso zzso zzso has the highest binding capacity of all proteins zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not observed to guinea-pig zzso suggesting that in this species the zzso of the protein is different to other zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
