The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exists in solution in the zzso state, as a zzso equilibrium mixture of two zzso the result of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso bond zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso studies of the minor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are reported zzso The rate of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso bond in the zzso protein was determined by zzso analysis at elevated temperatures, using a sample in which all zzso zzso except zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso rate is calculated to be zzso zzso at 25 degrees C, corresponding to a free energy of zzso delta G, of 77 zzso The complete zzso zzso zzso assignments of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso state have been obtained by using standard methods combined with comparisons to the previously assigned major zzso zzso This has permitted detailed comparative analysis of zzso zzso chemical shifts, backbone zzso zzso constants, and nuclear zzso zzso The minor zzso has a global fold that is identical with that of the major zzso zzso changes imposed by zzso zzso at zzso are highly localized to the zzso loop zzso zzso that joins the two zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a global fold that is identical with the zzso zzso but does not exhibit zzso zzso Only very limited structural differences are observed between zzso and zzso zzso and these are also highly localized to the zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso are found to be very similar to the zzso zzso These results provide crucial evidence that justifies the calculation of high-resolution three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso rather than of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
