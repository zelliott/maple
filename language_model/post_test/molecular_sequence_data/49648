zzso interactions drive the assembly of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso A key interaction occurs between the zzso tail of the scaffold protein zzso and the major zzso protein zzso Previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zhang, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was shown that the minimal domain in the scaffold protein necessary for this interaction was composed of a zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to identify the zzso zzso in zzso important for this zzso zzso zzso from the genetic analysis of zzso zzso virus zzso identified the importance of the N zzso of zzso for the interaction with the scaffold zzso This allowed us to focus our efforts on a small region of this large zzso zzso zzso zzso starting at zzso and ending at zzso were zzso to zzso All the zzso were first screened for interaction with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso From this in zzso zzso seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that eliminated the interaction when zzso were zzso All 24 zzso were introduced into the virus zzso with a genetic marker zzso transfer zzso For this system, viruses and cell lines that greatly facilitated the introduction of the zzso into the zzso were zzso The same seven zzso that abolished interaction of zzso with zzso resulted in an absolute requirement for zzso zzso for growth of the zzso The viruses zzso these zzso in zzso were capable of forming zzso shells comprised of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but the closure of these shells into an zzso structure was zzso zzso at zzso did not affect the ability of this protein to interact with zzso as judged from the in zzso zzso but this zzso specified a lethal effect for virus growth and abolished the formation of any zzso assembled zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso zzso is important for another essential interaction of zzso with the zzso shell zzso The zzso of the data from the previous and present studies demonstrates the key roles of two regions in the N zzso of this large protein that are crucial for this zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise the first zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a second zzso of zzso These seven zzso zzso are important for the interaction of zzso with the scaffold protein and consequently the formation of an zzso shell structure that encloses the viral zzso
