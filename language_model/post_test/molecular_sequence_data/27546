Cell wall proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell walls were released using zzso acid zzso which zzso the cell wall zzso zzso and zzso the zzso The cell wall proteins were then characterized by zzso and identified by zzso zzso The analyses for zzso zzso identified 15 cell wall proteins and six zzso zzso For zzso zzso the analyses identified 26 cell wall proteins and nine zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso cell wall proteins are found in the cell walls of both zzso and zzso cells, but some cell zzso cell wall proteins were zzso The analyses showed that the pattern of cell wall proteins present in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are quite zzso Almost all of the cell wall proteins identified in zzso zzso have close zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these proteins have important zzso functions within the cell zzso
