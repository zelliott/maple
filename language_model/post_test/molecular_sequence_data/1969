zzso is one of 11 essential genes in zzso zzso with unknown roles in the physiology of the zzso It encodes a zzso of zzso zzso with motifs characteristic of zzso As a contribution to zzso its indispensable cellular function, we have solved the crystal structure of zzso to zzso A zzso revealing a zzso zzso At the heart of the zzso is the putative zzso domain, which exhibits a classical zzso zzso fold with a zzso very similar to that of Ras and zzso However, as anticipated from the order in which the zzso G protein motifs appear in the zzso the zzso domain fold in zzso is zzso zzso with respect to the classical zzso The zzso pocket in zzso is zzso and analysis of the zzso zzso loop indicates that zzso changes in this region would be needed to accommodate zzso The zzso domain is flanked at its N zzso by a zzso domain with an zzso zzso fold, and at its C zzso by an zzso domain containing a coordinated zinc zzso This combination of protein zzso is unique to zzso and its zzso zzso comparisons reveal a zzso of zzso basic and aromatic zzso on one face of the zzso domain, perhaps pointing to a role for zzso in zzso acid zzso The zinc zzso in the zzso domain is coordinated by three zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in a novel zzso zzso The juxtaposition of the switch I and switch II regions of the G domain and the zzso and zzso zzso suggests that chemical events at the zzso active site may be zzso into relative movements of these zzso The pattern of zzso zzso and zzso surface potential calculations suggest that the zzso and/or zzso zzso participate in zzso acid binding consistent with a possible role for zzso at some stage during zzso zzso
