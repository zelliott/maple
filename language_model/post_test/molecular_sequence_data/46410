When the 34 zzso zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso insect cells, the zzso protein included two forms that migrated slightly differently in zzso gel zzso zzso mass analysis and zzso zzso mapping showed that the major and zzso product had the intended zzso sequence and zzso zzso This material accounted for about zzso of the zzso zzso The minor product was zzso with a 26 zzso zzso zzso The result suggested the existence of an upstream alternative site for the initiation of translation, and this proved to be an zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso used to express zzso The zzso zzso was preceded and followed by zzso sequence elements (a zzso in the zzso position and a G in the zzso zzso that would have enhanced the viability of initiation at zzso The initiating zzso zzso was Met for both minor and major products, and both forms of the protein were zzso For the minor product, protein intact mass analysis and zzso mapping both gave results in agreement with the sequence predicted from the zzso A similar result with the same underlying cause was obtained with insect cell expression of full-length zzso It appears that similar results are possible whenever this zzso is zzso
