zzso raised against four hybrid zzso zzso carrying zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso zzso of the colonization factor I zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso hybrid zzso Fla I zzso zzso Fla II zzso zzso Fla III zzso zzso and Fla IV zzso zzso were not able to inhibit the in zzso binding of zzso zzso bacteria to zzso zzso zzso However, one of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso was recognized by a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was able to block zzso of zzso bacteria to zzso cells and to bind to the zzso acid sequences zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso raised against the hybrid zzso Fla II and Fla IV showed that they were specific for the sequences zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso in the abilities of the zzso II serum and the zzso zzso zzso to block binding might be ascribed to their slightly different fine specificity for zzso
