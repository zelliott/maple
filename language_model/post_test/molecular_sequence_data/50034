Single injection of zzso into the zzso zzso of adult mice induced long-lasting zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and mossy fiber zzso that resembled human zzso zzso Our previous study indicated that brain derived zzso factor was related to the initiation of these zzso zzso In this study, gene expression of the enlarged zzso was examined by differential display to find the gene relating to the progression of the pathological zzso Several genes were identified that were zzso in the enlarged zzso zzso One of them was highly zzso with mouse zzso suggesting that mouse zzso is related to the development of zzso zzso
