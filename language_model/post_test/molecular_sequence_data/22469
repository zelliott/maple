zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso cause skull defects termed enlarged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso has been documented in a unique zzso zzso zzso However, the relative zzso contribution of these genes to zzso and zzso is not known and information on zzso correlations is zzso We zzso zzso and zzso in 11 new unrelated cases or families with zzso 181 cases of zzso and a single family segregating a zzso deletion of zzso including zzso We explored the correlations between skull zzso size and age, zzso and zzso type, and reviewed additional zzso zzso Four zzso cases had zzso in either zzso or zzso including previous families, we have identified six zzso and six zzso zzso accounting for zzso zzso but only zzso sporadic zzso The deletion family confirms the zzso of a mental zzso locus to within zzso zzso region of zzso Overall, no significant size difference was found between zzso and zzso skull zzso but the zzso zzso zzso tends to result in persistent CB and is associated with anatomical abnormalities of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso caused by zzso in zzso and zzso have a similar prevalence and are usually clinically zzso zzso screening has a high pickup rate in zzso especially in familial cases, but is not indicated in zzso
