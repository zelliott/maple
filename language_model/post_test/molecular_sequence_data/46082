In many zzso bacteria, zzso sensing zzso controls expression of genes that are involved in zzso production and resistance to zzso formation and maintenance of microbial zzso zzso on zzso and zzso surfaces of medical and industrial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are the best characterized zzso sensing signals in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso therefore, is considered an attractive strategy for controlling zzso in zzso The search for AHL signals and their mimics has been facilitated by the development of sensitive zzso in which zzso reporters zzso in response to AHL zzso These zzso have already led to the identification of dozens of compounds with zzso modulating zzso The characterization of the mode of action of zzso signals and their mimics requires follow-up zzso zzso Here, we describe a set of zzso reporters, which could be used in high, medium or low zzso format, for the discovery and validation of zzso or zzso of the Las zzso system of zzso zzso These nearly zzso reporters contain zzso or point zzso in the AHL binding domain of the AHL zzso zzso as well as zzso in the promoter for the gene zzso zzso AHL zzso We also developed reporters for documenting the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso The use of these reporters significantly zzso identification and characterization of the Las zzso signal zzso and zzso prior to zzso zzso To test the usefulness of these reporters, we carried out zzso with zzso a known inhibitor of Las zzso
