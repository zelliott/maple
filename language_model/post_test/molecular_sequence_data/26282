The effects of two recently isolated zzso zzso related peptides zzso and zzso on the zzso and zzso rat zzso were zzso zzso zzso 100, 1000 zzso inhibited concentration zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso insulin zzso from the isolated zzso rat zzso during the first zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso p less than zzso 1000 zzso zzso p less than zzso and the second zzso phase zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso p less than zzso The zzso actions of zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso were more pronounced during the first than the second phase zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso p less than zzso 1000 zzso zzso p less than zzso second zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso (at 1000 zzso inhibited zzso insulin zzso zzso first zzso zzso p less than zzso second zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso release zzso zzso first zzso zzso p less than zzso second zzso zzso p less than zzso Both peptides were without effect on zzso and zzso zzso release from isolated incubated rat pancreatic zzso
