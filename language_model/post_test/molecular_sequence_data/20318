zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso strain was originally obtained from the first known clinical case of zzso zzso zzso pneumonia in Southern Europe isolated from an zzso zzso The zzso complete zzso contains the zzso deletion and represents a type strain for a zzso population from the first epidemic zzso outbreak in Spain between zzso Here, we present the complete sequence analysis of the zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso revealed several large as well as small zzso differences with respect to two other published complete zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso shares zzso sequence similarity with zzso and zzso and is also approximately 5 zzso smaller by zzso The overall organization of the zzso zzso is remarkably identical to those of zzso and zzso except for a single zzso zzso inversion in zzso Twelve regions of difference ranging from zzso zzso and zzso small insertions and deletions were identified in a comparative analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two small deletions appear to zzso two genes in zzso causing them to become zzso the intact genes zzso a protein of unknown function and a zzso zzso In addition, we identified zzso proteins in zzso containing zzso acid zzso compared to zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso acid replacements were identified, one of which occurs in the zzso zzso growth locus zzso D zzso Many of these changes in zzso are likely the consequence of direct selection that increases the fitness of this zzso zzso clone within its endemic zzso Our complete zzso sequence analyses lay the foundation for experimental testing of these zzso
