The zzso region of the rat zzso zzso 3 gene zzso 3) has been cloned and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region showed that it contains a zzso region zzso to zzso zzso and multiple binding sites for the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso but does not contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analysis of total zzso isolated from rat zzso cell zzso revealed that single zzso start point zzso is located at an zzso zzso element similar to that found in the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and competitive mobility shift zzso indicated that this zzso element forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso In order to zzso functional elements of the zzso region of the rat zzso 3 zzso zzso fragments were cloned into a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso identified a crucial promoter element located at zzso to zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso indicated that zzso binds to three zzso boxes within the sequence between zzso and zzso of the zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso analyses of promoter zzso containing zzso zzso of these three zzso boxes demonstrated that two zzso boxes, located zzso to the zzso are important elements for normal promoter zzso
