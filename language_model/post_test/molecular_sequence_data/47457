zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso type II zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso has been completely zzso zzso number zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from different zzso zzso with the total zzso zzso has revealed three major species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one minor of zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been previously described and we show that the three major zzso zzso are the result of alternative zzso site zzso a zzso zzso signal at zzso position zzso for the zzso zzso a zzso signal at position zzso for the zzso zzso and a zzso signal at position zzso for the zzso zzso The different zzso zzso zzso for the same zzso and the most abundant transcripts have a long zzso region zzso The absence of obvious correlation between transcripts content and size, zzso protein amount and zzso activity in the four human fetal zzso tested suggests that it is zzso protein processing that may be regulated rather than zzso gene zzso
