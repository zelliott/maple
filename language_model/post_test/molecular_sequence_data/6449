This is the first report describing zzso of zzso activity in human normal zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been thought to be involved in maintaining zzso length stability in zzso and most cancer cells, but not in normal zzso However, in the present study, we demonstrate that zzso activity is zzso at low levels in normal human T and B cells, increases by in zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso cells upon their proliferation and zzso and decreases with zzso zzso the regulation of zzso activity in normal cells may provide important insights not only into the mechanisms of normal cellular zzso but also into the mechanisms of zzso activity deregulation as part of cancer zzso
