There is increasing evidence that locally produced zzso may play an important role in the control of zzso zzso In a previous report we demonstrated that medium zzso by activated human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso which is a rich source of zzso has extremely potent effects on zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Part of this activity could be explained by zzso zzso but additional zzso were evidently zzso In the present study we tried to characterize and purify additional components active on zzso cells from zzso To this end zzso was subjected to a zzso procedure involving zzso zzso to zzso acid, affinity zzso with an zzso recognizing a mixture of zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Throughout this protocol a zzso cell zzso was used to monitor the effects on zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso using silver zzso showed a single protein band in the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the active zzso in this band corresponded to four truncated forms of zzso missing the first 13, 14, 17 and 18 zzso zzso zzso The truncated zzso molecules were as active as intact zzso in the zzso cell zzso Since neither zzso nor zzso alone or in combination could account for the extremely potent effect of zzso we tested a series of additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso display more than additive effects on zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso and that the combination of these zzso may explain the major part of the effects observed with crude zzso The observation that the latter effects could be observed with zzso as well as human zzso zzso and zzso further supports the potential zzso relevance of these zzso
