The zzso zzso consists of a relatively small number of different cell types, and the cell lineages during zzso have been well zzso The zzso restriction of zzso fate takes place considerably early in zzso The fates of most of the zzso become zzso by the zzso stage, just before the onset of zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the early events of fate determination in the zzso zzso zzso we isolated the genes for which zzso expression is initiated during the early zzso zzso Here we report 18 genes isolated by zzso zzso screening between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of most zzso of the genes was initiated at the zzso zzso The genes were subdivided into three groups according to their spatial expression zzso The first group included clones expressed throughout almost the entire zzso The second and third groups represented clones expressed mainly in the animal zzso and in a subset of vegetal zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing the zzso domain that is similar to those of the zzso of zzso family of zzso zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in zzso precursor cells during zzso Another gene named zzso beta was expressed in muscle zzso
