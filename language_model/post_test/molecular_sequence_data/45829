We show here that the African zzso fever virus zzso protein zzso predicted to be a class II zzso (AP) zzso possesses zzso activity specific for zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso and zzso efficiency values for the zzso reaction are in the range of those reported for zzso coli zzso IV zzso zzso and human zzso In addition to zzso activity, the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso activity that is considerably more efficient in the elimination of a mismatch than in that of a correctly paired zzso The three-dimensional structure predicted for the zzso protein underscores the structural similarities between zzso IV and the viral zzso supporting a common mechanism for the zzso zzso During infection, the protein is expressed at early times and accumulates at later zzso The early zzso is localized in the nucleus and the zzso while the late protein is found only in the zzso zzso carries two other zzso DNA zzso X and zzso that, together with the viral zzso zzso could act as a viral base zzso repair system to protect the virus zzso in the highly zzso environment of the zzso zzso the virus host zzso Using an zzso deletion zzso lacking the zzso zzso we have determined that the viral zzso is required for virus growth in zzso but not in zzso zzso This finding supports the existence of a viral zzso system to maintain virus viability in the infected zzso
