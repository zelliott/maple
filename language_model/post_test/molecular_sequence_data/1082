zzso zzso disease of potato is caused predominantly by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso for resistance against zzso zzso zzso previously mapped to potato zzso zzso To develop zzso zzso markers within the zzso the zzso zzso from a set of 30 North American potato zzso was zzso Three distinct and highly diverse zzso can be distinguished at the zzso zzso These were detected in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We tested for zzso association and for genetic linkage between the zzso zzso and resistance of zzso potato to zzso zzso Moreover, field resistance was assessed in zzso populations with known molecular linkage maps in order to identify novel zzso Resistance zzso against zzso zzso were detected on four zzso zzso 6, 9, and zzso at the zzso level, with one zzso on zzso 2 contributing over zzso to the total zzso variation of the zzso At the zzso level, a significant association between the zzso zzso and zzso to the disease was zzso suggesting that zzso genes directed against zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located in the same zzso region of zzso zzso However, on the basis of the present analysis, we cannot determine whether these genes are closely linked or if a single gene provides resistance against both zzso zzso To assess the usefulness of the zzso zzso for zzso selection, we subjected the resistance data to zzso analysis, and calculated positive zzso and negative zzso zzso values, and overall zzso accuracy zzso Our results indicate that tagging of additional genes for resistance to zzso with molecular markers will be required for efficient zzso zzso
