Heat shock protein genes are induced by various kinds of zzso Besides stress, the heat shock family gene zzso has been shown to be induced by zzso agents such as the DNA virus zzso and zzso Here, we report cloning of a novel zzso that encodes a 100 zzso heat shock zzso zzso as a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this heat shock protein at the level of zzso zzso Moreover, the induction of this heat shock zzso was dependent on the zzso region 2 of the zzso zzso which is essential for binding to the proteins of the zzso zzso
