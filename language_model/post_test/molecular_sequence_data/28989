zzso zzso oxidized zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and thus avoids errors caused by their zzso during DNA replication or transcription, which may result in zzso or zzso This zzso specificity for oxidized zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso analyses based on the sequence comparison with the zzso coli zzso zzso which zzso only zzso and zzso but not oxidized forms of zzso or zzso Neither a replacement of the zzso module of zzso with that of zzso nor deletions of the zzso region of zzso which is unique for zzso altered the zzso specificity of zzso In contrast, the substitution of zzso at position zzso and zzso of zzso which showed apparent chemical shift zzso with zzso in zzso analyses but are not zzso in zzso affected the zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso to recognize both zzso and zzso whereas zzso is only essential for recognizing zzso thus suggesting that origins of the zzso pockets for zzso and zzso are zzso
