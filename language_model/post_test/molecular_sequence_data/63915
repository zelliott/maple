zzso array consisting of hundreds of peptides zzso addressed and zzso on a cellulose membrane support was used to screen zzso zzso As a model, zzso II zzso zzso a significant zzso related to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, was chosen as the target zzso zzso zzso covering the zzso II zzso type 1 sequence were prepared, and zzso zzso with high affinity to the zzso II zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso within the first zzso region exhibited the highest affinity to zzso zzso The zzso soluble zzso zzso had an zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that our screening strategy utilizing zzso array is an effective approach for the zzso drug zzso
