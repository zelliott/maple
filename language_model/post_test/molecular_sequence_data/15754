zzso properties of the zzso acid sequences from 22 signal peptides have been analyzed and compared with peptides known to interact with biological zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso of bee zzso and the zzso zzso segment of zzso zzso All these peptides evidence a double zzso structure with an zzso core of 9 to 24 zzso acid zzso and two charged polar zzso They all exhibit a high potential for making zzso and, to a lesser degree, extended or zzso zzso with low or negative zzso for making reverse turns or zzso zzso A model of spontaneous zzso of these peptides into the zzso zzso without specific surface zzso protein is proposed, where the two polar ends interact with each polar face of the zzso zzso and the zzso core zzso into the zzso bonding environment of the fatty acid side zzso This zzso could be the molecular trigger for zzso assembly around the signal zzso and subsequent attachment to the zzso prior to the transfer of the zzso chain through the zzso zzso zzso
