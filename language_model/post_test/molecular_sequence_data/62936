zzso zzso response element binding protein binding protein zzso a nuclear zzso zzso zzso is an important component of the zzso signal zzso zzso In this study, we systematically analyzed the pattern and frequency of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso samples from zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso locus zzso the zzso zzso we observed loss of zzso zzso zzso instability zzso or zzso deletion in 16 of 26 zzso zzso Additional zzso samples were analyzed using different sets of zzso markers zzso within the zzso or in close proximity to the 3' end of the zzso zzso 

The data showed that zzso gene zzso or zzso occurred in 9 of 19 zzso zzso A detailed genetic zzso map of the zzso gene showed that an zzso or zzso hot spot occurred within zzso 2 of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso samples were investigated for zzso gene zzso by zzso sensitive gel zzso and DNA zzso These results revealed that most of the shifted fragments contained internal tandem zzso zzso frequently in the regions zzso the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso domain one of the zzso zzso The presence of zzso within the zzso gene was additionally confirmed by Southern zzso analysis and zzso 

These studies show that zzso and zzso of the zzso gene are frequent genetic events in human zzso These zzso may have functional importance in the development of human zzso
