zzso of viral proteins play an important role in the virus life cycle, especially in zzso zzso Andean potato zzso zzso zzso is a plant zzso virus with a zzso formed by two coat proteins zzso and zzso Both zzso coat protein open reading frames were cloned into zzso and zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso cells transformed with the zzso construct grew on zzso dropout selection media lacking zzso and zzso zzso also exhibited zzso activity in both qualitative and quantitative zzso These results suggest that zzso protein contains an zzso acid motif able to activate zzso of zzso and zzso reporter genes in zzso zzso Several deletions of the zzso gene were cloned into the zzso zzso to locate the region involved in this zzso zzso constructions lacking 12 zzso from the zzso region and another one with 267 zzso deleted from the zzso are still able to activate zzso of reporter zzso However, zzso zzso was not observed with construction zzso which does not contain the last 57 zzso acid zzso These results demonstrate that a zzso zzso domain is present at the zzso of zzso between zzso 267 and zzso
