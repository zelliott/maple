The crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso zzso The overall structure is highly similar to nuclear transport factor zzso It is a zzso comprised of a zzso and three zzso forming a zzso zzso However, known binding sites for zzso and zzso containing peptides show zzso and zzso differences compared to nuclear transport factor zzso A zzso zzso bound in the structure suggests a new, and possibly zzso relevant, zzso binding zzso
