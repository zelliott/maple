zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso variation by modulating the expression of zzso surface proteins zzso which are zzso by a number of small zzso zzso We characterized the zzso copy of the zzso gene expressed by the cloned zzso line zzso derived from the isolate zzso in addition to a zzso but zzso family zzso The coding regions of the two genes zzso closely related zzso zzso zzso However, differences in the coding region of these genes reside solely in an 873 zzso zzso Only four differences were found between the zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso The zzso 205 base pairs downstream from the coding regions were zzso but thereafter the sequences zzso zzso identity over the next 391 zzso zzso studies indicated that no other zzso gene was located within 4 zzso pairs of the expressed zzso zzso zzso and transcripts from the zzso gene were detected in neither zzso nor zzso zzso populations derived from this cloned zzso Any mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of zzso genes must reconcile the near identity of DNA sequences that flank the coding regions of expressed and zzso zzso zzso
