A new zzso zzso for the recognition of zzso is zzso The zzso host 1 features a zzso zzso scaffold bearing three zzso zzso zzso The binding ability of the zzso zzso zzso toward a set of zzso of biologically relevant zzso including zzso zzso Man, and zzso was investigated by zzso zzso in zzso A protocol for the correct evaluation of binding affinities was established, which can be generally applied for the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso zzso A zzso equilibrium model, including zzso and zzso zzso association and zzso of the zzso was zzso for the interaction of zzso with all the investigated zzso An affinity index, which we defined median binding concentration zzso in zzso to the zzso zzso intended to address the general issue of comparing zzso zzso binding data, and a limiting zzso describing intrinsic binding affinities were developed for evaluating the zzso zzso values for zzso range from 1 to 6 zzso indicating an intrinsic binding affinity in the zzso range and a selectivity factor of 5 toward the investigated zzso The treatment has been extended to include any generic zzso system involved in single or multiple binding zzso
