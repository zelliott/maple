Type 1 zzso is associated with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso substitution was the second most frequent sequence variation in the Canadian type 1 zzso study and this zzso was also documented in other type 1 zzso zzso In this study, zzso was detected in a compound zzso possessing both type zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso and zzso levels were disproportionately low for the zzso type zzso zzso 

To determine the role of zzso variation in the zzso of type 1 zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso in the normal and type 1 zzso populations was zzso along with the associated zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso substitution on the zzso and zzso trafficking of zzso was explored by in zzso expression studies in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was performed in zzso zzso cells and zzso from the zzso zzso analysis was performed to investigate an zzso processing zzso in the zzso 

In zzso expression studies demonstrated that the zzso variation does not affect zzso zzso trafficking and storage zzso Storage of zzso in the patient's zzso cells was zzso Analysis of the patient's zzso zzso revealed a novel truncated transcript resulting from the zzso of a cryptic zzso site in zzso zzso The presence of a common zzso zzso in zzso for zzso with low zzso levels suggests a founder origin for this zzso zzso that may mark this zzso zzso
