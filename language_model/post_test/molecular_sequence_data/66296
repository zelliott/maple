In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso emerged and caused over 8,000 human cases of infection and more than 700 deaths zzso zzso zzso likely evolved to zzso humans by a series of transmission events between humans and animals for sale in zzso Using synthetic biology, we engineered the spike protein zzso from a zzso strain, zzso into our epidemic strain infectious zzso creating the zzso virus zzso which was infectious but yielded progeny viruses incapable of zzso in zzso After introducing a zzso zzso within the S zzso binding domain zzso of zzso the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells but was severely zzso in zzso The in zzso evolution of zzso zzso on human airway zzso zzso cells produced two viruses zzso zzso zzso and zzso with enhanced growth on zzso cells and on delayed brain tumor cells expressing the zzso zzso human zzso I converting zzso 2 zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso contained zzso in zzso contact zzso zzso and zzso that remodeled S interactions with zzso Further, these viruses were neutralized by a human zzso zzso zzso zzso but the parent zzso zzso strain was eight times more resistant than the zzso These data suggest that the human adaptation of zzso zzso strains may select for some zzso that are highly susceptible to select zzso that bind to zzso The epidemic, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso viruses replicate similarly in the zzso mouse zzso highlighting the potential use of these zzso spike zzso to assess vaccine or zzso efficacy in zzso
