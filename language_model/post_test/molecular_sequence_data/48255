zzso zzso virus zzso is thought to establish a persistent infection in its natural zzso the deer mouse zzso zzso despite a strong host immune zzso zzso zzso zzso were routinely detected in deer mice which maintained virus zzso in the blood and zzso To determine whether viral diversity played a role in zzso persistence and immune escape in deer mice, we measured the prevalence of virus zzso in infected zzso over time in a natural zzso zzso studies provided serial blood samples from naturally infected deer mice, which were zzso analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected over a period of months in these zzso in the presence of circulating zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso were observed in viral clones from all time points zzso including changes in the zzso domain of zzso 1 and the 3' small segment zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was also detected in seven different zzso of sacrificed deer zzso Analysis of zzso viral clones revealed major disparities in the level of viral diversity between zzso specifically between the zzso zzso zzso and the lung and liver zzso zzso These results demonstrate the ability of zzso to mutate and generate zzso in zzso which may have implications for viral persistence and possible escape from the host immune zzso
