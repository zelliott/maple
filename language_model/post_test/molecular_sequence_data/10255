zzso zzso toxin causes assembly of zzso stress fibers and focal zzso in some cultured cells and zzso mobility shifts of the small zzso protein zzso on zzso We attempted to clarify the molecular basis of the toxin action on zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso revealed the zzso of zzso to zzso The substitution of zzso for zzso of zzso by zzso zzso caused a mobility shift on zzso which was indistinguishable from that of the zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso significantly differed from zzso wild type zzso in zzso zzso binding activity but both showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso activity relative to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso bearing zzso showed extensive formation of zzso stress fibers similar to the zzso zzso These results indicate that the toxin zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and renders it zzso active, leading to formation of zzso stress zzso
