The zzso and zzso transport systems are important for the growth of a variety of zzso In zzso zzso single zzso in either zzso or zzso result in reduced growth under zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions, while a zzso zzso double zzso has a more severe growth zzso These growth defects were not observed when bacteria were grown under zzso conditions or in strains capable of producing the zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and a downstream locus zzso for zzso linked zzso were required for growth of a zzso zzso zzso zzso under static, zzso zzso An zzso zzso alone had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso plague zzso An zzso zzso double zzso was still fully virulent in a zzso plague model but had an zzso increase in the 50% lethal dose zzso relative to the zzso zzso parent strain in a zzso plague zzso Thus, zzso and zzso in addition to zzso play an important role in the progression of zzso zzso Finally, we examined the factors affecting the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under zzso growth conditions, the zzso zzso zzso fusion was zzso by iron in a zzso manner but not in cells grown zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso had no significant effect on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso that prevents repression by zzso under zzso growth conditions remains to be zzso
