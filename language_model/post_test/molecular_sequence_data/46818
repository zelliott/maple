Transport of zzso across the plasma membrane of zzso zzso cells is believed to be a passive process of facilitated diffusion zzso by zzso zzso zzso This article presents three lines of evidence that indicate the expression of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso First, transcripts of zzso zzso ranging in size from zzso to zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso preparations of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso protein was also detected in plasma membrane preparations of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Third, partial zzso acid sequence deduced from the reverse zzso zzso of zzso from bovine zzso zzso was similar to the sequence reported for zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein suggests that an active zzso transport system may be involved in zzso transport and metabolism in the zzso zzso of dairy zzso However, the zzso significance of the expression of zzso in zzso zzso remains zzso
