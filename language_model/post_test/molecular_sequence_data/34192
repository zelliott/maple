Chicken anemia virus zzso the zzso agent chicken zzso is the only member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an immune zzso virus and causes zzso zzso organ zzso and zzso The production and zzso characterization of zzso protein and its use in a zzso vaccine or as part of a diagnostic kit would be useful to zzso infection zzso 

zzso increased expression of the zzso full-length zzso zzso protein from chicken anemia virus was demonstrated using an zzso coli expression zzso The zzso gene was cloned into various different expression zzso and then these were expressed in a number of different zzso coli zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso coli was significantly increased when zzso was fused with zzso protein rather than a zzso By zzso the various rare zzso acid zzso within the zzso of the zzso zzso the expression level of the zzso protein in zzso coli zzso was further increased zzso The highest protein expression level obtained was zzso zzso per liter of bacterial culture after induction with zzso zzso zzso for 2 zzso After zzso by zzso affinity zzso the zzso full-length zzso protein produced in this way was demonstrated to have good zzso and was able to be recognized by zzso chicken serum in an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region has potential as zzso protein that, when expressed in zzso coli, may be useful in the future for the development of zzso vaccines and diagnostic zzso
