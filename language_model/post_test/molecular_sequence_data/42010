By means of zzso zzso on zzso zzso the zzso as well as other zzso zzso peptides of the bovine zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso their structures being determined by a combination of plasma zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso In total, six different peptides containing seven zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was shown to be zzso in the nature zzso zzso acid sequences of some zzso peptides proved to differ from those deduced from the zzso structure, thus indicating the presence of the zzso zzso The zzso does not affect the zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso in the peptides could be determined with a high accuracy by measuring their masses before and after zzso with zzso
