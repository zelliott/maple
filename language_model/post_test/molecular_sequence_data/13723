zzso expressed specifically in zzso and transported to synaptic terminals are likely to constitute important molecular elements of nervous system zzso In an effort to characterize zzso proteins zzso of zzso we have isolated from a zzso library several zzso zzso zzso that selectively stain synaptic terminals in zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to most but not all synaptic terminals of the zzso nervous system, it also recognizes a protein with zzso distribution in other zzso flies and binds to large parts of fish zzso In Western blots the zzso labels a zzso brain protein of 47 zzso and zzso with brain proteins from several species including insects, fish, mouse and zzso From these data we conclude that the corresponding gene has been zzso in evolution at least among zzso Using zzso zzso and expression cloning we have identified the zzso gene coding for the zzso protein of 47 zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso clones reveals the zzso structure of the gene and characterizes the complete open reading frames of two alternatively spliced zzso The zzso gene is located in zzso on zzso zzso and codes for two almost identical zzso zzso of 347 and zzso zzso acids with no significant sequence zzso to known zzso
