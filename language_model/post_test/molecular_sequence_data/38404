Human and bovine zzso zzso zzso demonstrate discrete functional differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cocaine analog zzso In a previous study, the functional analyses on the zzso of human and bovine zzso have revealed that the region from zzso 133 through 186 zzso the third zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso transport and cocaine analog zzso The present study has been carried out to determine the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso functions by zzso the zzso acid zzso in the corresponding region between human and bovine zzso As described zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding almost disappeared in zzso zzso in which the region from zzso 133 through 186 of bovine zzso was zzso into human zzso Replacement of zzso zzso 152 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso the human zzso zzso at the identical position, remarkably restored the zzso transport and zzso binding to zzso to zzso of the human zzso zzso Similarly, substitution of zzso for zzso at position 152 in the human zzso reduced the zzso transport and zzso binding by 57% to zzso Among other zzso acids tested at position 152 of the zzso zzso only zzso resulted in small but significant increases in the zzso functions ranging from 16 to zzso Thus, zzso at position 152 plays a crucial role for molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions of zzso zzso and zzso with human zzso
