A subset of sporadic zzso tumors and most tumors developing in zzso zzso zzso cancer patients display frequent zzso in zzso zzso Such tumors have been thought to manifest replication errors zzso but the basis for the zzso has remained zzso We demonstrate that the zzso rate of zzso repeats in zzso tumor cells is at least zzso that in zzso tumor cells and show by in zzso zzso that increased zzso of zzso cells is associated with a profound zzso in zzso mismatch zzso This zzso was observed with zzso zzso as well as with zzso containing single zzso zzso and affected an early step in the repair zzso Thus, a true zzso zzso exists in a subset of tumor cells, the responsible zzso is likely to cause transitions and zzso in addition to zzso zzso and a zzso basis for this zzso has been zzso
