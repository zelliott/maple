Previously, zzso zzso zzso was established, which defines a structure specific for zzso isolated from fetal and zzso cells and zzso The presence of the zzso structure at type III connecting segment zzso zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso and its absence is characteristic of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 82, zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by various zzso followed by subsequent zzso on an zzso affinity column and zzso columns at each step of zzso A single strongly active zzso zzso 1) and an inactive zzso zzso 3) were isolated from zzso A containing 35 zzso acid zzso The minimum essential structure required for the zzso activity was found to be a zzso sequence zzso having zzso alpha zzso beta zzso or its core zzso beta zzso or zzso linked at zzso Various synthetic peptides including the zzso sequence and a zzso having the zzso zzso with the same zzso at zzso were all zzso zzso of zzso acid slightly increased the activity, and subsequent elimination of zzso did not alter the zzso however, removal of the Gal beta zzso zzso by zzso from zzso zzso A resulted in total zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso Thus, a single zzso at a defined zzso zzso of the III zzso region may induce zzso changes in the zzso to form the specific zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso This finding opens the possibility that a number of other zzso zzso consist of a zzso and a common zzso zzso and that the combination produces a zzso specific to cancer or to a stage of zzso
