Common zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are colonial seabirds that nest in temperate to arctic oceans throughout the Northern zzso They are very similar in the characteristics of zzso demography and life history that are thought to determine the extent of differentiation among zzso yet geographic variation in zzso is notably greater in common zzso Despite evidence of strong zzso zzso previous analyses of zzso and the zzso zzso b gene revealed little genetic differentiation among North Atlantic colonies of zzso zzso To determine if the more extensive zzso zzso in common zzso reflects greater genetic zzso we zzso part of the zzso b gene for 160 common zzso from 10 colonies distributed throughout the Northern zzso zzso zzso and zzso relationships among zzso both indicated that Atlantic and Pacific populations are genetically zzso zzso divergence among zzso suggested that differentiation of these populations has resulted from separation by zzso glaciers and the zzso zzso as well as by currently zzso breeding habitat in the Arctic zzso zzso b zzso zzso also differed among Atlantic zzso and appeared to define a zzso similar to that described for zzso zzso zzso of sequence variation suggested that this variation probably results from secondary contact between two zzso populations from the zzso zzso rather than from isolation by distance or zzso In contrast, the Atlantic population of zzso zzso appears to have arisen through recent expansion of a single homogeneous zzso zzso
