A mouse zzso zzso zzso was raised against zzso zzso from zzso insect cells and selected as zzso by zzso of the zzso The zzso was zzso from the cells by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and its zzso and internal zzso acid sequences were zzso Based on the partial zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was cloned and zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso sequence showed a zzso to those of zzso family zzso zzso (or zzso a zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso and protein zzso (a cell surface protein with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The insect protein had two zzso zzso at the same sites as the zzso zzso family zzso but had no zzso zzso which the zzso zzso commonly zzso An electron microscopic zzso study demonstrated that the insect protein was localized in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since this zzso is identical to that of zzso zzso the insect protein was considered to be a zzso of zzso rather than that of zzso zzso involving zzso K zzso sodium zzso extraction and zzso zzso extraction revealed that the insect zzso protein was a soluble protein tightly associated with the zzso surface of zzso zzso as reported for zzso zzso The insect protein was also shown to have zzso activity as does zzso zzso These data verify that the insect protein is zzso The existence of zzso in insect cells suggests that zzso is an essential zzso zzso protein in a wide range of the animal zzso A zzso tree analysis, however, suggested that zzso was derived from zzso long after the segregation of a zzso zzso from an insect zzso
