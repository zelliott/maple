An approach for generating structures capable of directing full-length zzso synthesis for zzso zzso DNA is zzso The structures are formed following heat zzso and cooling of zzso zzso DNA molecules in the presence of what is referred to as a zzso zzso Consisting of a sequence complementary to the free ends of one of the two zzso zzso the closing zzso functions as an agent for zzso of a DNA strand and generation of a zzso template structure suitable for zzso full-length zzso synthesis and zzso into a zzso closed zzso zzso When combined with a zzso zzso and zzso DNA templates, this approach allows zzso zzso to be performed directly on zzso DNA with a zzso formation efficiency of about zzso a level amenable to rapid screening by DNA zzso
