The isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso from oxidized marine surface zzso zzso Bay, French Atlantic zzso is zzso zzso (with zzso as the carbon zzso zzso (with zzso as the carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract supported growth with zzso sulfur under zzso zzso Apart from zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso growth was supported with hydrogen zzso as the carbon zzso zzso zzso as the carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The isolate grew zzso with zzso zzso being the only organic zzso zzso sulfur and oxygen were the only electron zzso zzso zzso or zzso acids were not zzso The isolate was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a tight cluster consisting of the zzso described species zzso zzso and the strains zzso and zzso zzso as the closest relatives of strain zzso zzso of sequence zzso zzso to zzso Together with strain zzso these organisms form a novel lineage within the zzso zzso of zzso clearly separated from the described species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Due to the zzso characteristics shared by strain zzso and zzso zzso and considering their zzso relationship, we propose the inclusion of strain zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the results of this study, an zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
