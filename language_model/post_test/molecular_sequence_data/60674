To analyze the role of zzso acids in the steroid zzso DNA binding domain zzso recognition zzso in binding of the zzso to the zzso response element zzso we adapted the powerful zzso challenge zzso selection system for use with a zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso DNA binding domain and selected for zzso that gained the ability to bind to the zzso We used a zzso protocol based on zzso zzso to create a large and diverse pool of zzso in which 10 zzso zzso acids in the DNA recognition zzso of the zzso zzso DNA binding domain were randomly zzso After a single cycle of modified zzso challenge zzso selection, 37 zzso proteins were identified, all of which lost the ability to bind to the zzso response zzso In gel mobility shift zzso approximately zzso of the genetically selected zzso bound to the consensus zzso with a zzso higher affinity than the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region of the DNA recognition zzso the selected zzso contained the zzso acids found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as other zzso acid combinations seen in naturally occurring zzso receptors that bind the zzso zzso We also obtained high affinity zzso with zzso as the first zzso acid of the zzso although this is not found in the known zzso zzso In the zzso region between the two zinc fingers, zzso was by far the most common zzso In transient zzso in zzso cells using promoter interference zzso the zzso displayed enhanced affinity for the zzso When linked to an zzso domain, the zzso zzso activated zzso from zzso reporter zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso acids can display considerable variation and that the little studied zzso zzso acids play an important role in determining affinity for the zzso This work also demonstrates that the zzso challenge zzso genetic selection system, modified for use with a zzso zzso provides a novel, single cycle selection for zzso zzso zzso with altered specificity and greatly enhanced affinity for their response zzso
