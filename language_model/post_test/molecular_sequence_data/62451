zzso expressing high levels of the zzso zzso protein are zzso killed by the zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso zzso modeling predicts a binding site for AA in the extended zzso groove on zzso previously identified as an interface for zzso to zzso and related zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso groove zzso with normal cellular zzso function but suppressed sensitivity to zzso The zzso of AA for cells expressing zzso zzso directly zzso with the measured in zzso zzso zzso for AA zzso These results indicate that zzso is a principal target zzso AA zzso
