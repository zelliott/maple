zzso zzso by zzso activated zzso C zzso were prepared and zzso for the first zzso The zzso products were structurally characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions were established for the zzso reaction, resulting in high yields, typically in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso yielded the same zzso zzso zzso as that previously isolated from DNA exposed to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed broad zzso melting profiles, greatly increased zzso and complex circular zzso zzso zzso linkages at the zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso restriction zzso snake zzso zzso action was zzso The zzso are stable to heat at neutral pH but are removed by treatment in hot zzso or by the reducing agents zzso and zzso zzso are proposed for these zzso These studies define optimal methods for introducing zzso zzso into DNA fragments at a specific site, providing a versatile tool to study the effects of the zzso zzso on DNA structure and zzso
