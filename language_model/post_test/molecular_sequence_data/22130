zzso is a zzso modification resulting from transfer of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso cells contain zzso that catalyze the formation of zzso zzso which can be zzso by a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso resulting in release of free zzso and zzso of unmodified zzso zzso involved in zzso participate in several critical zzso zzso including DNA repair, cellular zzso and zzso Multiple zzso zzso have been identified in the human zzso but there is only one known zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that degrades the zzso zzso to zzso We report here the identification of an zzso zzso termed zzso zzso or zzso which exhibited zzso activity, generating zzso from zzso but did not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso shares zzso acid sequence identity with both zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso activity, like that of zzso was enhanced by zzso Critical zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso identified by zzso zzso and zzso are located in a region similar to that required for activity in zzso but different from the location of the critical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso All findings are consistent with the conclusion that zzso has zzso activity but is structurally unrelated to zzso
