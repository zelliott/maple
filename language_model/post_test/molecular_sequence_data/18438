The molecular weights of four linear synthetic zzso fragments of a snake zzso were measured by zzso zzso mass zzso The fragmentation phenomenon observed at the level of zzso and/or zzso zzso with a zzso zzso association is reported for a group of two peptides (B and zzso in contrast with the group (A and zzso in spite of the high ratio of zzso and zzso namely zzso zzso The propensity for specific fragmentation of zzso D seems to be correlated to the repetitive zzso zzso Finally, based on the zzso of the zzso measured, we propose an overall mechanism as an zzso zzso shift analogous to that observed for zzso and zzso containing peptides in solution zzso
