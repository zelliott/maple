We have zzso cloned and characterized a new calcium channel auxiliary zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso zzso acid identity with the known zzso zzso The gene maps to the critical human tumor zzso gene region in zzso zzso showing very frequent zzso loss and occasional zzso deletions in zzso breast, and other zzso The tissue distribution of zzso expression is different from zzso and zzso zzso is most abundantly expressed in lung and zzso and well expressed in brain, heart, and zzso In contrast, zzso is expressed predominantly in brain, heart, and skeletal zzso When zzso (via zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased peak size of the zzso zzso currents zzso and when zzso with zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso increased peak size of zzso channels zzso and zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso detect the expression of a zzso zzso zzso in some but not all lung tumor zzso We conclude that the zzso gene encodes a functional auxiliary zzso of zzso zzso zzso Because of its zzso location and expression patterns, zzso needs to be explored as a potential tumor zzso gene linking zzso signaling and zzso breast, and other cancer zzso The zzso location on mouse zzso 9 is also the site of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus, zzso is also a candidate gene for this inherited idiopathic generalized zzso zzso
