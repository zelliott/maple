Atlantic salmon zzso zzso was isolated in 1995 from zzso of farmed Atlantic salmon suffering from zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso was determined, revealing a zzso zzso zzso in length consisting of six zzso genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and large zzso zzso proteins in the order zzso The various zzso features related to virus replication found in most zzso were also found in zzso These include: zzso and complementary leader and trailer zzso zzso zzso regions and highly zzso zzso start and stop signal zzso The P gene expression strategy of zzso was like that of the zzso zzso and zzso which express the P and C proteins from the primary transcript and edit a portion of the zzso to zzso V and W zzso zzso similarities among various features related to virus zzso zzso comparisons of all deduced zzso protein sequences with zzso regions from other members of the family zzso and zzso analyses of these zzso acid sequences suggested that zzso was a novel member of the zzso zzso most closely related to the zzso
