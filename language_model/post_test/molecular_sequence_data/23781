zzso receptors are expressed in zzso and immune cells and regulated in response to zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate zzso of the zzso zzso gene by zzso in immune cells zzso T and zzso zzso zzso E6 T zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified an zzso element at zzso zzso on the zzso gene promoter, to which the zzso factor zzso zzso as shown by reporter gene analysis and zzso interaction studies in living cells with zzso factor decoy zzso zzso normally binds to zzso DNA motifs with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso site zzso is an imperfect zzso with a mismatch within this core zzso A systematic analysis of possible mismatch zzso motifs revealed that zzso also binds to the sequence zzso This motif occurs as a zzso in the human zzso zzso gene zzso et zzso 2001 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that this zzso element has a significantly reduced zzso binding activity which zzso to its reduced zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso binds zzso with similar high activity as a perfectly zzso zzso site and is strongly zzso by zzso
