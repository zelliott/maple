The zzso regulator zzso controls zzso from the zzso zzso that encodes the zzso for zzso of zzso and some related aromatic zzso zzso activates zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter in the presence of zzso zzso or structural zzso in the growth zzso Using zzso zzso and a truncated zzso we show here that aromatic compounds directly activate the zzso activity of this protein in zzso and that the zzso domain zzso this activity in the absence of an aromatic zzso In order to dissect the zzso process, derivatives of zzso exhibiting single zzso acid changes were isolated and their zzso and specificity profiles were zzso in zzso The zzso implications of the zzso of these zzso are zzso
