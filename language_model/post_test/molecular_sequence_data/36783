Recent evidence indicates a crucial role for paired box genes in mouse and human zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso factor and is expressed in the developing zzso system as well as in the developing and adult zzso This restricted expression pattern suggested involvement of the zzso gene in the zzso of the above zzso and prompted us to investigate the zzso gene in zzso In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso from a human adult kidney zzso zzso An open reading frame of 450 zzso acids contains the 128 zzso acid paired domain at its zzso zzso The predicted human and mouse zzso proteins show zzso conservation and are identical in their paired zzso Two independent zzso clones reveal differential zzso of the zzso transcripts resulting in the removal of a 63 zzso acid zzso region from the zzso end of the predicted zzso zzso The truncated zzso protein becomes more similar to the predicted zzso zzso zzso that is also expressed during kidney development and lacks the zzso rich zzso zzso protection analysis shows the presence of both zzso transcripts in human zzso kidney and five zzso zzso No truncated zzso transcripts could be detected in mouse zzso In zzso zzso to sections of human embryonic and fetal kidney showed expression of zzso in condensed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression was present mainly in the very early stages of zzso in the zzso condensing zzso This restricted expression pattern suggests a specific role for both genes during zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
