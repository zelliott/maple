zzso among families and zzso of zzso zzso are poorly understood because of difficulties 1) in making zzso about the evolution of the zzso characters used in coral zzso and 2) in interpreting their zzso fossil zzso Here we describe patterns of molecular evolution in a segment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso of 14 families of zzso and the use of this gene segment in a zzso analysis of relationships within the zzso We show that sequences obtained from zzso are zzso to other zzso zzso zzso sequences and fall zzso distinct zzso defined by size of the amplified gene zzso Comparisons of sequences from the two zzso demonstrate that both sets of sequences are evolving under similar evolutionary zzso they do not differ in zzso zzso numbers of transition and zzso zzso spatial patterns of zzso or in rates of zzso The characteristics and patterns observed in these sequences as well as the secondary structures, are similar to those observed in zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences from other zzso zzso analysis of these sequences shows that they are useful for evaluating relationships within the zzso The hypothesis generated from this analysis differs from traditional hypotheses for evolutionary relationships among the zzso and suggests that a zzso of evolutionary affinities in the order is zzso
