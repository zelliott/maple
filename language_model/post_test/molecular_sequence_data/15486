A zzso zzso study was performed on a zzso unknown zzso isolated from discarded road zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence demonstrated that the isolate belongs zzso to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as its closest zzso relatives zzso zzso and zzso % similarity to the respective type zzso The generic assignment was confirmed on the basis of zzso data, which revealed a fatty acid profile characteristic for the zzso zzso consisting of zzso saturated and zzso fatty zzso with zzso : zzso as the major zzso zzso fatty acid, and zzso : zzso zzso as the major zzso fatty acid, and a zzso with ten zzso units zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso On the basis of both the zzso and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolate should be classified within a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
