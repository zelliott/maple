The zzso of zzso zzso found in human and zzso tumors often are analyzed using a variety of transformation zzso in zzso but data have not been available to correlate in zzso effects with in zzso zzso We have assessed the effects of zzso zzso using mouse zzso zzso cell lines which can be analyzed both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso series) injected into cleared zzso fat pads of zzso mice frequently give rise to zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso in culture zzso zzso to permit analysis of genetic changes important in the development of zzso zzso of the zzso cell line revealed a cell population mixed with respect to zzso zzso One zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells was selected in a zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso whereas another minor population of zzso zzso zzso cells was selected during zzso of zzso cells in zzso When zzso cells were subdivided and zzso in parallel in zzso zzso zzso continued to evolve and zzso These findings reveal that selective pressures exerted on zzso zzso cell populations in zzso are different from pressures present in zzso Selective forces may vary from one cell culture environment to zzso The growth advantage zzso by a specific zzso zzso appears to differ in zzso versus in zzso We propose that caution should be exercised when attempting to correlate the effects of zzso zzso zzso in cell culture systems with the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
