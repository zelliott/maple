The zzso gene was identified during a hunt for zzso that are able to express an zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso lacking an upstream zzso sequence zzso for zzso A zzso zzso of zzso alleviated the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and also suppressed zzso in zzso genes zzso and zzso required for zzso of zzso The zzso also increased expression from various core promoters zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso protein is a global zzso regulator that plays a negative role at or near the zzso zzso However, the zzso function was ineffective on promoters containing a zzso from either zzso or zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso suppressed the zzso cell growth zzso caused by elevated levels of the zzso protein zzso further suggesting a zzso role for zzso zzso cells showed additional zzso zzso zzso zzso growth, reduced efficiencies of zzso and sensitivity to heat shock and nitrogen zzso The zzso gene is predicted to zzso a 64 zzso zzso zzso
