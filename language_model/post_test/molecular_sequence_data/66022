Human zzso zzso are important contributors to respiratory disease, but their zzso burden remains zzso primarily because of the lack of sensitive, accurate, and convenient means of determining their zzso zzso To address this, we developed and clinically validated the sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso targeting the viral zzso zzso region defined by sequences obtained from all 100 currently recognized zzso zzso strains and 85 recently circulating field zzso The zzso successfully amplified all zzso tested and could zzso detect 50 zzso zzso transcript copies, with a dynamic range of over 7 zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso transcript of human zzso 68 zzso that showed the greatest sequence zzso to the zzso zzso and probe set was not detected below a concentration of 5 zzso zzso copies per zzso zzso acid extracts of 111 coded respiratory specimens that were culture positive for zzso or zzso were tested with the zzso real-time zzso zzso and by two independent laboratories that used different in-house zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens were correctly identified by the real-time zzso zzso and 4 of the 24 zzso samples were positive for zzso zzso sequences subsequently were identified in these four zzso suggesting zzso zzso in these zzso The zzso was successfully applied in an investigation of a coincidental outbreak of zzso respiratory illness among laboratory zzso
