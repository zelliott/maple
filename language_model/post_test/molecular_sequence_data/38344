We sought to confirm the importance of zzso protein for growth of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso in a zzso cell line, zzso The protein is out of frame with the zzso and zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso strains of zzso A zzso virus, zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding regions for the corresponding regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso grew with little restriction in zzso zzso In contrast, another zzso virus, zzso which has an zzso rather than an zzso as the starting zzso of zzso protein at zzso zzso resulting in no synthesis of zzso zzso did not grow zzso No significant difference between the rates of zzso to zzso cells of these viruses was zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso viral zzso significantly increased, whereas only a minimal increase was observed for zzso The present study suggests that zzso protein is required for virus growth in zzso
