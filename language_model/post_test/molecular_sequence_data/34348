zzso a zzso zzso zzso has nicotine zzso zzso activity, which mediates the zzso of nicotine into zzso in zzso tobacco zzso zzso is a precursor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso with zzso sequence identity, but it lacks zzso zzso A recent zzso zzso study revealed that a single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to zzso at the 330 position in the middle of zzso restores the zzso activity of zzso zzso However, the same zzso acid change caused the loss of the zzso activity of zzso To determine the mechanism of the functional turnover of the two zzso four zzso structures, zzso the two molecules and their corresponding zzso zzso were zzso The resulting structures exhibited that the zzso site is far from the active site, which suggests that no direct interaction occurs between the two zzso zzso studies in different biological scenarios revealed that the zzso introduces a zzso drift with the largest change at the zzso zzso The dynamics zzso analysis using principal component analysis and zzso analysis suggests that the single zzso acid change causes the opening and closing of the transfer channels of the zzso products, and water by altering the motion of the zzso and zzso zzso The motion of zzso I is also correlated with the motion of both the zzso loop and the zzso loop zzso the single zzso acid zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that the single zzso acid zzso outside the active site region may have indirectly zzso the flexibility of the zzso and zzso zzso through zzso I, causing a functional turnover of the zzso zzso
