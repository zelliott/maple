The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso peptides zzso which, based on zzso yields, make up about 94 and zzso respectively, of the zzso in its zzso The zzso acid sequences of these two zzso zzso and zzso were determined using automated sequencing, and compositional analyses of zzso fragments from zzso zzso and verified by molecular masses obtained with Fast zzso zzso Mass zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid sequence exist between the zzso of zzso and those of other Southern and Northern zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are identical to those of an zzso from another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso Secondary structure data based on circular zzso studies indicated zzso to be a random chain, but a sharp zzso transition of CD zzso around 30 degrees C suggested the presence of zzso secondary or zzso zzso
