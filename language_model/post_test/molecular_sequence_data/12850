Information regarding the biology and zzso attributes of zzso zzso zzso is limited due to the lack of genetic exchange mechanisms and the inability to continuously cultivate this zzso We have zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso DNA library in zzso coli zzso to identify genes zzso exported zzso a subset of which are likely to be important in zzso zzso We report here the identification and zzso zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA insert that contains seven open reading frames zzso The proteins zzso by six of these zzso have zzso with members of a newly described protein family involved in the zzso of zzso and the control of zzso rotation in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Certain members of this family are also involved in the export of zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso St and zzso zzso zzso We have named these six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso containing these zzso has been designated as the zzso zzso We zzso that the protein products of these genes are involved in the zzso of zzso and the control of zzso rotation in zzso
