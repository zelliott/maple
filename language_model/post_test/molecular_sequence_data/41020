The transforming protein of Kirsten zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein called zzso zzso The sequences zzso zzso zzso were genetically localized to a zzso segment near the zzso end of the viral zzso by zzso the capacity of a series of defined deletion zzso of zzso cloned zzso DNA to induce focal transformation of mouse zzso zzso sequencing of a portion of this region has led to the identification of an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso
