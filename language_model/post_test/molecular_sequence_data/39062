We have cloned and functionally characterized the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso The zzso zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids with 12 zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the cloned zzso mediates the transport of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso necessary for zzso transport zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also interacts with zzso The zzso zzso is zzso and concentration of zzso necessary for zzso transport zzso is zzso zzso as determined by zzso studies with zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inward currents in the presence of zzso and zzso At a membrane potential of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso charge transfer and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicate a zzso ratio of zzso for the transport process, suggesting a zzso zzso of zzso pH zzso of zzso currents shows that zzso accepts zzso the zzso zzso form of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso currents in the presence of zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso domain of the zzso lies in the zzso half of the zzso The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso as evidenced by fluorescent in zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso long and consists of 13 zzso and 12 zzso
