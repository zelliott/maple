The human zzso has almost as high a frequency of alternative zzso events as zzso While not as extensively studied as brain, a few candidate zzso zzso regulator proteins have been identified, including the nuclear zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso which are germ zzso versions of the zzso expressed zzso G protein and are highly zzso in zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is also highly expressed in the zzso and physically interacts with these zzso G family zzso In this study, we identified a novel zzso cassette zzso zzso within zzso 6 of the human zzso zzso of split 4 zzso gene which makes a more zzso repressive zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is normally zzso in zzso cells because of a weak zzso zzso site and surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulls down zzso and zzso G proteins which activate its zzso The germ zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were more efficient in stimulating zzso incorporation than zzso expressed zzso G zzso zzso bound moderately to zzso zzso but more strongly to upstream sites to zzso activate an alternative 3' zzso site normally zzso selected in the zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso the normal zzso zzso zzso pattern of this zzso Although they can directly bind zzso sequences around the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function as efficient germ zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our study indicates a delicate balance between the activity of positive and negative zzso regulators zzso controls zzso zzso inclusion of zzso zzso and leads to zzso of zzso pathways in the zzso In addition, we identified a zzso binding site for zzso zzso zzso showing it is also a zzso zzso binding zzso
