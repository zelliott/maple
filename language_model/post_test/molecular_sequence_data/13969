zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso small colony zzso type, the agent of contagious bovine zzso zzso were zzso with respect to the zzso of distribution of a newly discovered zzso element, zzso on the zzso Analysis of 64 strains isolated from Europe, Africa and Australia, including four vaccine strains and the type strain zzso revealed ten different IS patterns, forming two main zzso The European strains originated from outbreaks of zzso in different countries, and from various other sources such as zzso and zzso zzso from zzso lungs from zzso and zzso and milk from zzso They showed identical zzso patterns, except one strain which had an additional zzso element, but the pattern belonged to the same zzso This shows that the strains from Europe form a zzso zzso The strains originating from different geographical parts of the African continent and from Australia showed four closely related zzso patterns which belong to a separate zzso This indicates that strains from Africa and Australia form a zzso lineage different from that of the European zzso suggesting that the sporadic cases of zzso that have re-emerged in Europe almost 15 years after the last declared endemic case in 1967 arose from an established zzso within Europe rather than being the result of repeated zzso from Africa and zzso While most strains from Africa and Australia had the same zzso pattern, all vaccine strains could be distinguished by an individual zzso The type strain zzso also had a particular zzso pattern which belongs to the cluster of the strains from Africa and zzso The molecular definition of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso SC strains with zzso represents a rapid and zzso method for zzso and differentiation of vaccine zzso It permits at the present time the definition of two main zzso lines, one including the strains from the European continent and a second with strains from Africa and zzso
