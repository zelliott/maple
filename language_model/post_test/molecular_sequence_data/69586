pas zzso of zzso zzso are disturbed in zzso assembly zzso and zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso gene and its product zzso that is essential for the import of a large subset of proteins into the zzso zzso zzso a protein of 69 zzso is a member of the zzso zzso or snap zzso protein family, characterized by several direct repeats of a zzso zzso acid motif zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Cell 60, zzso Other members of this family are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso receptors for protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso zzso membrane structures and exhibits deficient import of a number of zzso zzso zzso particularly of proteins with an zzso import zzso In contrast, zzso zzso associated with these zzso is resistant in zzso to degradation by zzso K, indicating true protein zzso These results suggest that zzso is an essential component of a zzso import machinery which mediates the zzso of a specific subset of proteins to the zzso zzso with an zzso import zzso
