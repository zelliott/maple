zzso belongs to the zzso family of proteins that have zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso transfer zzso and function in the transport and metabolism of zzso We isolated zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso gene using a zzso zzso zzso human zzso library, and analyzed its zzso regulation under zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the induction of zzso by zzso stress was limited to the early zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that the induction of zzso depended on both zzso factor zzso and an zzso element in its zzso To date, no other genes that are induced only during the early phase of zzso stress have been identified, although the zzso zzso stress response is known to be regulated zzso and to induce expression of other zzso This study is a first step in zzso the relationship between zzso metabolism and the zzso stress zzso
