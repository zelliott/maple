zzso binds to its zzso via the head domain of its fiber zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso binding domain and solved the structure at zzso A resolution by the molecular replacement technique using the known zzso type 5 head zzso Included in the high-resolution model are zzso water zzso five alternative side chain zzso and individual zzso temperature factors for each zzso The overall structure of the zzso 2 head is very similar to its zzso 5 zzso apart from differences in some of the flexible zzso All but zzso B zzso are believed to use the recently identified protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso By comparison of the two structures and sequence alignment of zzso binding and zzso binding zzso fiber heads, we discuss possible zzso binding sites and propose a zzso binding site in a zzso between two zzso on the side of the zzso The structural basis of the extraordinary stability of the fiber head zzso is also zzso
