zzso rates of individual zzso in the zzso zzso zzso can vary by zzso to zzso To determine the basis for the rapid degradation of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso gene we have used a genetic screen to isolate zzso that increase the stability of this zzso Analysis of point zzso obtained from this screen, and of additional zzso constructed in zzso indicated that the zzso zzso region zzso contains sequences that specify rapid zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso that affected zzso zzso rate also affected the process of zzso zzso zzso in one region of the 3' zzso both decreased the rate of zzso zzso and increased the stability of an intermediate form in the zzso zzso with an zzso tail zzso 10 zzso zzso in a second region primarily increased the stability of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso tail and there are specific sequences within the 3' zzso that stimulate zzso tail zzso as well as subsequent steps in the zzso zzso Given the similarity of this zzso zzso to that seen for some zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso may be a common mechanism of zzso zzso
