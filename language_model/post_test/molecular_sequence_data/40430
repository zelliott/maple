zzso drugs have been used zzso for zzso blood zzso promoting zzso and as a zzso in zzso However, there is confusion about the drug's zzso origins and clinical uses because of zzso similarity of zzso plants and zzso Comparative sequencing of the zzso zzso gene in nuclear zzso DNA zzso and zzso gene in zzso DNA zzso was carried out in order to examine zzso zzso and to identify ultimately zzso zzso A total of a hundred of zzso of zzso species were zzso This resulted in an aligned zzso of 1810 zzso for zzso zzso and 2 800 zzso for zzso zzso zzso sequence divergence within the zzso ranged from zzso zzso ranged from zzso One base zzso site (from zzso to zzso was observed from the upstream of zzso zzso at zzso position 234 in zzso zzso and Japanese population of zzso zzso which have separated genetic distance to other zzso zzso Two zzso regions embedded in zzso zzso showed higher zzso including zzso zzso repeat zzso and zzso Based on consensus of relationship, zzso major lineages within zzso are recognized at the species zzso The results suggest that zzso is zzso with zzso zzso support and sister to the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequences showed considerable variations between zzso species and thus were revealed as a promising candidate for zzso of zzso species, which provide valuable characters for zzso relationship within species but are insufficient to resolve relationships among closely related zzso
