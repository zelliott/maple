zzso zzso zzso is an insect zzso zzso that prevents the onset of metamorphosis from zzso to zzso A zzso coding for zzso is zzso Mixed zzso derived from a zzso zzso sequence were used to generate amplified DNA by the zzso chain reaction zzso Based on the sequence of the amplified DNA, a 41 bases zzso was designed for screening a zzso library which was constructed from the zzso zzso zzso larvae zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso for zzso was zzso base pairs in zzso An open reading frame of zzso base pairs encodes a zzso of 143 zzso acid zzso in which zzso is localized at the zzso region, and other three peptides including a putative signal zzso and appropriate processing sites for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrate the presence of a zzso zzso transcript in fat body and zzso transcript in brain and nerve cord, suggesting the possibility that the zzso of zzso gene is regulated in a zzso zzso This interpretation was supported by zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso is constantly expressed in both zzso and zzso last zzso larvae and there is no difference in the levels of the zzso between both larvae, thus indicating that zzso may effect on zzso or zzso level to elevate plasma zzso zzso
