zzso is known as the zzso and zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso However, numerous zzso including zzso spoke protein 2 zzso in zzso zzso also contain an zzso or a similar zzso zzso To zzso new roles of zzso zzso zzso we investigated a panel of zzso zzso An zzso zzso had paralyzed zzso defective in zzso and multiple zzso near the zzso New transgenic strains lacking only the zzso domain in zzso were also zzso In contrast, zzso was restored in strains that lacked only zzso zzso zzso zzso These cells swam normally in dim light but could not maintain typical swimming zzso under bright zzso In both deletion transgenic zzso the zzso near the zzso were zzso but their firm attachment to the zzso required the zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso required for normal zzso organizing duplicated zzso in the zzso spoke stalk and formation of a symmetrical zzso Further, the zzso zzso region appears to fine-tune the zzso for regulation of zzso zzso in the green zzso Thus, in general, zzso zzso may function to zzso molecular zzso for both the assembly and zzso of zzso zzso
