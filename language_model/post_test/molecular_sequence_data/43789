A 268 zzso region zzso of the pea zzso gene promoter responsible for high-level expression has been shown to interact with the high mobility group proteins zzso and zzso isolated from pea shoot zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein of 154 zzso acid zzso containing a single zzso and a zzso zzso tail and an zzso protein of 197 zzso acid zzso containing four zzso have been isolated and expressed in zzso coli to provide large amounts of full-length zzso zzso I zzso identified eight binding sites for zzso and six binding sites for zzso in zzso zzso of binding by the zzso zzso which binds in the minor groove of zzso DNA, revealed that zzso binding was zzso more sensitive than zzso zzso zzso selection from a pool of random zzso indicated that zzso binds to zzso containing stretches of five or more zzso zzso and zzso binds zzso to zzso enriched in zzso such as zzso and zzso
