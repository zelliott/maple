The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in two steps: zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to zzso to yield zzso and the product zzso zzso by zzso a zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso requires initiation by zzso zzso and a reducing agent such as zzso zzso by an extremely zzso zzso protein zzso present in the zzso zzso All four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order zzso which shares over zzso sequence identity of zzso and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the zzso of the closely related zzso zzso Hall strain zzso zzso shows sequence similarities to a new family of zzso which apparently do not form zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso containing zzso active zzso was zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso zzso which contains one zzso cluster with an electron spin S zzso zzso in the reduced zzso The zzso acid sequence as well as the chemical and zzso of the pure protein are very similar to those of component A of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which was able to replace zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Only in the oxidized state, zzso and component A exhibit significant zzso activity, which appears to be essential for zzso electron zzso Both zzso of zzso zzso zzso show significant sequence similarities to both zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster resembles the zzso gene cluster in the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso genes in zzso zzso The four zzso of these deduced zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence identity between the had zzso probably code for a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso This zzso could be the target for zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso
