Current questions in protein folding mechanisms include how fast can a protein fold and are there energy barriers for the folding and unfolding of zzso folding zzso The small zzso zzso zzso protein folds in zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso which zzso in 17 zzso to native zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso folded in a similar manner, but in two better separated kinetic zzso of zzso and 46 zzso The greater separation and better zzso changes facilitated a detailed kinetic analysis for the zzso phase for formation of the zzso Its folding rate constant changed little with zzso concentration or zzso but unfolding was very sensitive to zzso and energy changes on zzso The folding rate constant of 3 zzso zzso zzso in water decreased with increasing zzso and was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zero zzso Thus, the formation of the intermediate was partly rate limited by chain diffusion and partly by an energy barrier to give a very diffuse transition state, which was followed by the formation of zzso zzso the unfolding reaction required the near complete disruption of the zzso structure of the intermediate in a highly cooperative manner, being exquisitely sensitive to individual zzso The folding is zzso but has not reached, the zzso scenario of energy landscape zzso Under folding conditions, there is a small energy barrier between the zzso and transition states but a larger barrier between native and transition zzso
