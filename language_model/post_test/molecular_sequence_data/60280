zzso transport of newly zzso and mature proteins via zzso is controlled by a large group of zzso Here we describe a ubiquitous rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso shares structural characteristics with zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso which was shown to interact with the synaptic protein zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to a type II integral membrane zzso whose zzso zzso zzso contains a predicted zzso zzso We localized zzso to the zzso and to zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibit zzso transport in zzso leading to significant zzso of zzso zzso It appears that zzso functions early in the zzso pathway, probably within the zzso and between the zzso and the zzso
