We have constructed zzso clones containing the complete zzso sequences coding for two highly zzso zzso zzso adult zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shows significant zzso to zzso rat and human zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is identical to that reported by others for zzso zzso zzso The different zzso sequences demonstrate the existence of two different zzso zzso both of which are zzso in the form of precursor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso B to the zzso ones indicates that the mature protein is processed from a zzso The calculated molecular weight of zzso of zzso suggests that zzso processing is also involved in generating an active zzso
