We recently identified a DNA sequence element located in the rat zzso zzso which fulfills operational criteria for zzso increasing zzso from a zzso promoter in zzso over large distances and in an zzso zzso Here we report that three mouse nuclear proteins bind to the zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that one is a Nuclear Factor 1 like zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site destroys binding of the zzso but leaves zzso activity zzso zzso growth zzso which was shown to exert a zzso effect on the alpha zzso collagen promoter via its zzso binding site, has no effect on the activity of the zzso Thus, the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso is not essential for its activity in zzso
