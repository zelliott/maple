zzso zzso receptors zzso play a central role in the zzso nervous zzso These receptors are G zzso receptors zzso which are activated by the zzso zzso and zzso and blocked by a variety of zzso zzso have five zzso zzso In this study, we cloned two structurally related zzso from the fruit fly zzso zzso which, after expression in Chinese zzso zzso cells, proved to be zzso zzso zzso One zzso (the zzso zzso by gene zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and blocked by the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the other (the zzso zzso by gene zzso is also activated by zzso but has a zzso lower sensitivity to zzso and is not blocked by the zzso A- and zzso zzso were also cloned and functionally characterized from the red flour zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso et zzso zzso 2012, zzso zzso published the crystal structure of the human zzso zzso revealing 14 zzso acid zzso forming the binding pocket for zzso These zzso are identical between the human zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while many of them are different between the human zzso and the zzso zzso Using zzso one zzso of the zzso and one of the zzso zzso could also be found in all other zzso with a zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso such as zzso and other zzso belong to two zzso distinct lineages of animal evolution that split about 700 million years zzso We found that animals that originated before this split, such as zzso zzso had two zzso zzso From these data we propose a model for the evolution of zzso
