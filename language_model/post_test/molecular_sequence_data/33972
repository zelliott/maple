A number of studies have suggested functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the nervous zzso However, results of analyses of the zzso mice lacking zzso suggested that they play crucial roles in the maintenance of integrity and repair of the nervous zzso Furthermore, results of double knockout mice lacking all zzso except zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso of zzso induced complement zzso and zzso leading to zzso Generation of triple knockout mice by mating zzso mice and zzso mice verified the involvement of complement systems in the inflammation and zzso For the mechanisms of the complement zzso functional disorders of zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso which belong to zzso zzso should be main zzso These results suggested that normal composition of zzso is essential for the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso it was suggested that regulation of the complement systems and suppression of the inflammation should be important for the treatment of zzso having common aspects with other neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso zzso
