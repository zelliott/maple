Two zzso units coding for zzso proteins and protein synthesis zzso factors in zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso in zzso They zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso The following general conclusions can be drawn from comparison of the zzso and the derived zzso acid sequences of zzso proteins from zzso with those from zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso factor genes in zzso are clustered in zzso units corresponding closely to zzso coli zzso protein zzso with respect to both gene composition and zzso zzso These zzso units contain, in addition, a few open reading frames whose putative gene products share sequence similarity with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso They may zzso to zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso there being no functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso factors almost exclusively exhibit a higher sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso proteins than to those of zzso zzso Many zzso zzso proteins have a size intermediate between those of their zzso and zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of a hypothesis which implies that the recent zzso zzso developed by a zzso process from a more complex zzso and that the zzso zzso has maintained features of this zzso
