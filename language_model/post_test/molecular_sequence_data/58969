We have isolated a zzso zzso barren zzso required for zzso segregation in zzso zzso encodes a novel protein that is present in zzso cells and has zzso in zzso and zzso zzso defects in zzso zzso become apparent during cycle 16, resulting in a loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso move apart at the zzso transition and zzso B is zzso but sister zzso remain connected, resulting in zzso zzso This zzso is similar to that described in zzso zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso throughout zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicate that zzso associates with zzso II throughout zzso and alters the activity of zzso zzso We propose that this association is required for proper zzso segregation by zzso the zzso of zzso at zzso
