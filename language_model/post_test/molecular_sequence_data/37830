To investigate the zzso mechanisms of rice zzso zzso virus, we have systematically analyzed an zzso element located immediately upstream of the zzso box in the rice zzso zzso virus promoter and its zzso zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we showed that rice nuclear proteins bind to the zzso element, forming multiple specific zzso complexes via zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso interference analysis indicated that multiple zzso complexes share a common binding site located between positions zzso to zzso and the proteins contact the zzso element in the major zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso further showed that two nuclear proteins zzso and 33 zzso found in rice cell suspension and shoot nuclear zzso and one (27 zzso present in root nuclear zzso bind to this zzso zzso In zzso derived from a rice zzso zzso suspension culture, the zzso element is a prerequisite for promoter activity and its function is critically dependent on its position relative to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may function via interactions with the zzso zzso machinery, and we propose that this zzso is zzso by zzso interactions in a zzso zzso
