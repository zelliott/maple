zzso zzso modifications zzso particularly zzso dramatically expand the complexity of cellular regulatory zzso Although zzso zzso in various proteins can be subject to multiple zzso its zzso was previously considered a rare zzso with almost no regulatory role zzso We report here that zzso occurs to a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso regulator A zzso family global zzso regulator A zzso family of zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso pair zzso in zzso zzso zzso is crucial in regulating zzso zzso production and bacterial resistance to zzso Cell zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso inhibit the zzso activity of zzso and lead to decreased zzso of zzso and zzso An in zzso mouse model of infection established that the absence of zzso which results in elevated protein zzso significantly reduces zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a unique zzso that can play crucial roles in bacterial signaling and zzso
