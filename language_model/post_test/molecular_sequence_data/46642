Over the past 5 years the zzso field has exploded with a number of new cultures, each zzso to elicit a variety of zzso zzso of functional characteristics and benefits, in zzso are now commonplace to any presentation on zzso Scientifically established health claims remain among the highest priorities to companies who seek to establish solid health benefits that will promote their particular zzso The scientific community faces a greater challenge and must zzso seek cause and effect relationships for many potential and currently investigated zzso species and strain zzso zzso selection and design of zzso remains an important challenge and will require a platform of basic information about the physiology and zzso of candidate strains relevant to their zzso roles, functional activities, and interactions with other resident zzso In this context, genetic characterization of zzso cultures is essential to unequivocally define their contributions to the zzso zzso and ultimately identify the zzso that control any unique and beneficial zzso zzso selection and zzso based on the genetic complement and programming of a candidate zzso then becomes zzso Looking ahead, it will be vital to the development of this zzso field to correlate important characteristics in zzso with known zzso and regulatory controls that are likely to affect functionality and beneficial zzso in zzso
