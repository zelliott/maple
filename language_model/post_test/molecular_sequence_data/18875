During membrane zzso the zzso zzso protein is inserted into the zzso zzso in a strictly zzso manner with both the zzso signal sequence and the membrane anchor sequence promoting zzso of the zzso loop via a hairpin zzso Here, we find that the zzso requirements can be altered for zzso in a predictable manner by changing the polarity and charge of the zzso region that is zzso across the zzso When the polarity of the zzso zzso region is lowered and the charged zzso in this region are removed, zzso of this loop region occurs largely by a zzso and zzso zzso When the polarity is increased to that of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is essential for zzso Further increasing the zzso by adding charged zzso switches the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso we find that increasing the zzso of the zzso segments of zzso can decrease the zzso requirement for zzso of the zzso zzso This study provides a framework to understand why the zzso and zzso zzso exist in parallel and demonstrates that the zzso zzso has a limited capacity to zzso a zzso chain on its zzso
