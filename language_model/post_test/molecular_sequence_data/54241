The zzso gene displays several peculiarities that are distinct from those of classical zzso class I zzso The unique structure of the zzso zzso permits a restricted zzso presentation and allows the zzso of the cells of the immune zzso Although zzso sites may potentially influence all biological functions of zzso those present at the promoter and 3' untranslated regions have been particularly studied in experimental and pathological zzso The relatively low zzso observed in the zzso coding region both in humans and apes may represent a strong selective pressure for zzso zzso in regulatory regions several lines of evidence support the role of balancing zzso Since zzso has zzso properties, the understanding of gene regulation and the role of zzso sites on gene function may permit an individualized approach for the future use of zzso for therapeutic zzso
