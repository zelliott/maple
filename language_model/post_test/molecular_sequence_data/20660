zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso a reaction that supports various zzso and zzso zzso Genome analysis of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso revealed an zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso CA of zzso zzso zzso after cloning the gene zzso as zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso the protein by affinity zzso revealed that the native zzso zzso is a zzso inhibited by the known CA zzso CA activity in zzso zzso cell zzso reverse zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses showed that zzso was zzso expressed under zzso zzso Lower zzso activity in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso promoter: zzso fusion during the stationary phase or during growth on zzso zzso enriched air or at zzso pH indicated that the zzso of zzso was zzso by the stationary phase, elevated zzso levels and zzso pH zzso These observations were also supported by zzso zzso Thus, zzso in zzso zzso seems to be required for scavenging zzso from the ambient air and the requirement of zzso zzso seems to be higher for the cultures growing zzso at neutral to alkaline zzso
