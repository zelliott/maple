zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso is one of the most damaging diseases of soybean zzso zzso zzso This disease can be difficult to diagnose and other zzso species can zzso zzso zzso diagnosis is important for management of zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate zzso chain reaction zzso methods for rapid and specific detection of zzso zzso and diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso using two sets of zzso zzso and zzso that target the ITS region were evaluated for specificity and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso DNA extracted from 11 species of zzso and 19 other species of zzso and zzso pathogens were used to test the specificity of each primer zzso The previously published zzso zzso amplified DNA from zzso and from four other zzso species using conventional zzso indicating they are not specific for zzso zzso The new zzso zzso amplified DNA only from zzso zzso using conventional and real-time zzso and not from zzso zzso which has been found in soybean production areas, indicating that they are specific for zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also used to detect zzso zzso in diseased soybean tissue and infested zzso The zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso are specific, zzso and sensitive tools for the detection of zzso zzso
