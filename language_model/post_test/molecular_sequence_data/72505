We expressed the zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso zzso using the zzso expression zzso The zzso protein was identified as zzso by zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein showed that the protein is zzso Experimental zzso raised against the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso were zzso for zzso against zzso and zzso human zzso zzso in an zzso and found to be zzso Similarly, both zzso and zzso proteins neutralized the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso activity of rabbit zzso zzso in a zzso However, when these proteins were compared for their ability to neutralize zzso and blocking activities zzso of zzso from patients with zzso zzso disorders, only zzso was able to neutralize these zzso In contrast, zzso partially zzso whereas zzso completely neutralized the zzso zzso activities of zzso from zzso zzso of zzso of these two proteins against a panel of zzso and zzso zzso and their protein sequences showed differences in some specific zzso These data showed that in spite of significant zzso between the two zzso they exhibit specific zzso differences that are sufficient to cause divergence in their ability to react with patient zzso to zzso This suggests that the two proteins might differ in their three-dimensional zzso
