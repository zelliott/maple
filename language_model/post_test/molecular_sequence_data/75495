The sequence organization of four different families of Y zzso repetitive DNA is characterized at three levels of spatial extension along the Y zzso of zzso zzso At the lowest level of resolution, DNA zzso analysis of Y zzso fragments of different lengths and in zzso zzso experiments on zzso zzso demonstrate the zzso of each particular sequence family within one defined region of the zzso At a higher level of resolution, family specific repeats can be detected within these clusters by zzso within zzso zzso long continuous stretches of cloned DNA in zzso zzso At the highest level of resolution, detailed sequence analysis of representative zzso about 1 zzso in length reveals a zzso head to tail arrangement of family specific zzso zzso as the building scheme common to all four zzso Our results provide the first comparative sequence analysis of three novel families of repetitive DNA on the long arm of the Y zzso of zzso zzso Additional data are presented which support the existence of two related zzso of repetitive DNA on the short arm of the Y zzso
