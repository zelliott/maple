An zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA from zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance was cloned into the unique zzso site of the resulting zzso and the interrupted zzso was transferred via zzso zzso by zzso into zzso zzso with a selection for zzso zzso zzso were resolved to generate an zzso zzso strain that expressed zzso resistance, but grew as rapidly as the parental zzso The cloned zzso encodes a putative zzso of the zzso gene of zzso coli that is not essential for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is now available to introduce any zzso DNA into the zzso zzso zzso for the construction of zzso zzso for the studies of gene regulation, or to construct plasmids suitable for the isolation of zzso zzso Immediate applications of this system will include the expression and zzso of crystal toxins from zzso for the biological control of zzso larvae infected with the bacterial zzso
