In an attempt to identify novel zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were analyzed for a significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso The sequence from one of the selected zzso clones was used to generate a full-length zzso zzso a putative seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso The full-length zzso encodes a zzso of 350 zzso acids and has about zzso zzso to the zzso receptors zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates zzso expression of about zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms in human heart zzso while low-level expression of the zzso and zzso forms was observed in zzso zzso and zzso and in fetal zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso in cardiac muscle zzso Similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso maps to zzso 6 and has one zzso in the zzso untranslated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso of about zzso
