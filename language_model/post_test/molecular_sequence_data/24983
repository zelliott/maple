The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso disease virus zzso strain zzso has been zzso The open reading frame of the zzso gene contains zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 577 zzso zzso Three highly zzso patterns among all zzso zzso zzso and one additional zzso zzso region are zzso The protein contains five potential zzso sites, all but one located in the zzso external zzso The secondary structure prediction shows that the zzso external domain is mostly arranged in zzso while zzso are predominantly located in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence data of the zzso gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the zzso database, under zzso number zzso
