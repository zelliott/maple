A zzso gene was isolated from a zzso strain of zzso zzso and its role in zzso was zzso The gene had zzso in other zzso zzso but was not closely related to any fully zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed specifically in response to the plant pathogens zzso zzso zzso minor and zzso zzso but not in response to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the gene did not occur until contact had been made between the two zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed similar expression zzso zzso of the gene in response to zzso zzso was influenced by zzso with a peak of expression at pH 4, and was subject to nitrogen zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene did not affect the growth or zzso of zzso zzso but caused a decrease in its ability to inhibit the growth and zzso production of zzso zzso The zzso gene had a role in the zzso activity of zzso species against specific zzso plant pathogens and is therefore a potentially important factor in zzso by zzso zzso
