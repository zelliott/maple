Nanjing zzso city wall, one of the important historic zzso in China, has greatly suffered zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso of historic zzso However, little is known about the microbial community inhabiting naturally weathered brick minerals and their roles in the mineral zzso To examine the associations between zzso and brick zzso process, we compare the zzso diversity, zzso community structure, and specific functional groups of bacteria existing in weathered bricks by using a coupled approach involving zzso analysis of zzso zzso gel zzso zzso as well as zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses show that the bacterial communities were different along a zzso zzso and the abundance of bacterial communities positively and significantly zzso with the extent of brick zzso Laboratory brick mineral dissolution experiments indicate that bacteria isolated from the surfaces of weathered brick were very effective in enhancing brick zzso zzso analyses show that the weathered bricks were inhabited by specific functional groups of bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that contribute to the brick zzso
