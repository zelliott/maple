zzso zzso zzso an internal zzso segment from a protein precursor precisely, and zzso zzso zzso N and zzso zzso at the respective sides of the zzso Here, a series of precursor zzso bearing 11 zzso and ten zzso zzso is prepared for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso and as zzso The zzso with replacements of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is chosen as a zzso precursor model and is then subjected to a zzso resolution zzso zzso The crystal structure shows that the introduced zzso zzso are located in the vicinity of the zzso site, and that each of their zzso bonds is in the trans zzso The zzso zzso atom located at a distance of zzso from the zzso C atom in the zzso junction suggests that a zzso attack of the zzso zzso atom on the zzso C atom forms a zzso intermediate containing a zzso zzso zzso The zzso intermediate is supposedly resolved into a zzso zzso group upon the zzso of the linkage between the zzso C and zzso N zzso and this zzso zzso formation completes the initial steps of zzso zzso zzso shift at the junction between the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso atom in the zzso junction is placed in close proximity to the zzso zzso atom at a distance of zzso and is well suited for another zzso attack on the zzso zzso zzso group that is then subjected to the zzso in the next zzso The reaction steps proposed for the zzso shift are driven entirely by zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso is balanced within the zzso zzso
