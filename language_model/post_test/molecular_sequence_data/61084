A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso strain F which evolved from the zzso strain A under selective pressure to improve growth on zzso a poor zzso used as sole carbon zzso The ratio of activities on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso compared to zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso showed the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso in the single zzso chain of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso modeling based on zzso with two other microbial zzso suggests that zzso zzso zzso is a neutral zzso since it lies in a region far from the zzso site and should not cause structural zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso lies in variable region II and would shift a loop that interacts with the zzso zzso Another improved zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso that would disrupt a surface zzso in region zzso Hence zzso changes in this region appear to be responsible for the improved zzso zzso
