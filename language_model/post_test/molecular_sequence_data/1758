An intriguing feature of the rat zzso zzso zzso is open reading frame zzso zzso which shows similarity to the rep genes of zzso as well as the zzso genes of human zzso type zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these genes have not been found in other zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso gene is transcribed during the early and late zzso of virus replication in zzso as an zzso zzso zzso transcript containing the complete zzso zzso zzso of zzso were also detected in various zzso of zzso rats at 1 week zzso zzso but only in the zzso zzso at 4 months zzso Using rabbit zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein zzso zzso was found to be expressed as early as 12 h zzso within the zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso was also observed within the zzso of cells in various zzso of zzso rats at 3 weeks zzso Moreover, zzso was demonstrated to bind zzso as well as zzso zzso Finally, an zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso was generated, in which the zzso zzso was zzso This deletion zzso however, was shown to replicate with a similar efficiency as zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Taken together, it is concluded that the zzso zzso gene encodes a nuclear protein with zzso and zzso zzso activity that is zzso for virus zzso not only in zzso but also during the acute phase of infection in zzso
