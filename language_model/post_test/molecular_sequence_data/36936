We have investigated the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells treated with zzso 1 zzso zzso activity was zzso the time required for activity to reach a zzso level was dependent upon the dose of zzso ranging from 15 minutes to 45 zzso The level of zzso induction correlated well with zzso zzso for two characteristic zzso responses, zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity returned to zzso levels within 2 hours regardless of the amount of zzso added to the zzso Exposure of zzso cells to free zzso was accordingly restricted to periods of 2 hours or less, by replacing zzso with an excess of zzso zzso zzso Even after 2 hours exposure, the ability of zzso to induce zzso or zzso was still zzso by more than zzso suggesting that events downstream of, or parallel to zzso zzso requiring the continual formation of new zzso zzso complexes, are needed to fully elicit these zzso Two general zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to strongly inhibit zzso zzso in zzso with zzso of zzso 100 zzso and 30 zzso zzso At these zzso both compounds effectively inhibited zzso zzso and zzso induction without affecting general protein synthesis or zzso Other zzso zzso zzso had less effect on zzso zzso or zzso biological zzso The transient zzso of zzso induction correlated zzso with zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso was, however, relatively insensitive to zzso by zzso or zzso We suggest that zzso is likely to be a necessary, but not zzso intermediate in some zzso zzso zzso but not all zzso B zzso zzso responses in these zzso
