The open reading frame potentially zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and located as the second of three zzso zzso zzso between the S and M genes in the zzso of the Purdue strain of zzso zzso zzso coronavirus zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso to examine properties of the zzso Gene zzso has a zzso role in zzso but its truncated form in some zzso strains of zzso has led to the suggestion that it is not essential for virus zzso During synthesis in zzso in the presence of zzso the zzso zzso became an integral membrane zzso retained its zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and underwent zzso on apparently two zzso linkage sites to attain a final molecular mass of 31 zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso form of the protein was also made via an unknown zzso The existence of both zzso and soluble forms of the gene 3 product in the cell is suggested by zzso patterns showing both a punctuated zzso and diffuse zzso zzso No gene zzso product was found on zzso Purdue zzso by a Western zzso procedure that would have detected as few as 4 zzso indicating the protein probably is not a structural component of the zzso
