zzso zzso which exists in almost all cells, is believed to be working primarily for zzso 3' zzso In zzso coli, however, the zzso Z gene appears to be zzso under normal growth conditions, and its zzso role is not zzso Here, to investigate a possibility that zzso coli zzso Z zzso zzso other than zzso we tested several zzso zzso for zzso Surprisingly, all these zzso were zzso very efficiently at multiple sites by a zzso zzso coli zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso various zzso zzso The zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso seem to have a tendency to cleave after zzso or before zzso while zzso by the zzso zzso zzso inevitably occurred after zzso in addition to the other zzso zzso to determine optimal conditions indicated that metal zzso requirements differ between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the observed rate constant between zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso value of a zzso zzso zzso complex was much higher than that of an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso at multiple sites, but an zzso zzso Z from zzso zzso did zzso
