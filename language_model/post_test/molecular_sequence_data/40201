This paper reports a new strategy for zzso synthesis by combining zzso methods with cap and zzso separation techniques, using the zzso group zzso as a tag for the capture of desired zzso After a complex zzso mixture was obtained by zzso zzso the desired zzso containing a free zzso group derived from zzso was attached to an zzso zzso The loaded zzso was readily separated from side products by zzso and finally treated with acid to release the pure zzso zzso
