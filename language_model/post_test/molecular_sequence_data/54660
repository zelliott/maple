The zzso of a large class of inherited neurological diseases is founded on hairpin structures adopted by repeated DNA zzso and this folding is determined by base sequence and DNA zzso Using single zzso of zzso with zzso we show that zzso folding in repeated zzso zzso is also determined by the number of zzso This zzso analogue has a zzso quantum yield that varies strongly with zzso exposure, thereby distinguishing particular DNA zzso Prior studies demonstrated that zzso alone favors a zzso zzso yet the same sequence adopts an open loop zzso in a three-way zzso This comparison suggests that repeat folding is disrupted by base pairing in the duplex arms and by zzso zzso in the repeat zzso However, these zzso are overcome in longer zzso repeats, as demonstrated by studies of isolated and integrated forms of zzso The zzso alone forms a zzso folded hairpin with zzso properties exhibited by the relatively high zzso zzso from a modification in the central eighth repeat and with zzso properties evident from the relatively low zzso zzso from peripheral zzso zzso these hairpin properties are retained when zzso is integrated into a zzso zzso folding by zzso in the three-way junction contrasts with the open loop adopted by zzso in the analogous zzso This distinction suggests that cooperative interactions in longer repeat tracts overwhelm zzso to reassert the natural folding zzso Given that zzso long repeats are the genetic basis of a large class of inherited neurological diseases, studies with zzso three-way junctions suggest that their secondary structure is a key factor in the zzso manifestation and progression of such zzso
