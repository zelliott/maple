The zzso zzso zzso channels zzso are zzso molecules and targets for the zzso zzso group of zzso zzso in zzso are associated with zzso resistance in the soil dwelling zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, full-length zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso of zzso were cloned and zzso in zzso zzso a common and important zzso zzso zzso of zzso Both genes possess the sequence characteristics typical of zzso and zzso analysis confirms that these genes are zzso closely related to zzso of other zzso and zzso Complete coding sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso zzso expression zzso and proteins were expressed in zzso zzso zzso characteristics were determined by zzso zzso cell zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins with zzso In competitive binding experiments, fitting the data to a one site competition model, zzso zzso zzso was found to bind zzso with a high amount of zzso binding zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso cells, the means of zzso binding were significantly different for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso of zzso genes and in zzso expression of an zzso protein in a zzso zzso These data suggest the likelihood of a similar mechanism of action of AM drugs in these zzso and suggest that mechanisms of resistance may also be zzso
