The class of zzso is defined by the constant region of its heavy zzso When a B zzso switches the class of heavy chain it zzso the constant region of zzso heavy chain is zzso this occurs through a DNA zzso that brings the gene segment zzso the new constant region close to the zzso segment zzso the variable zzso The zzso line zzso which switches from heavy chain zzso to gamma zzso production in culture, occasionally zzso zzso the heavy chain locus so that DNA sequences between the switch regions of zzso and gamma zzso are zzso Because zzso is an intermediate step in generating an zzso the switch zzso could occur by zzso and zzso zzso that zzso is zzso this would produce a circle of zzso Indeed, circular DNA molecules have been isolated as products of zzso among gene segments zzso the variable regions of the zzso zzso and of the zzso heavy chain and light zzso But whereas the zzso for the variable region zzso are precisely zzso the zzso for any given heavy chain class switch are scattered over a length of greater than 6 zzso including both switch zzso We have now isolated circular DNA containing the sequences deleted by zzso thereby showing that the zzso heavy chain class switch occurs through zzso and zzso
