zzso plays a key role in determining the zzso zzso of the nervous systems through the resting zzso zzso zzso but the molecular identities of the zzso and zzso zzso leak zzso are totally zzso Here we show that this zzso is formed by the protein zzso a substantially zzso member of the zzso channel zzso Unlike any of the other 20 family members, zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice have a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm and die within 24 hours of zzso Brain zzso zzso recordings reveal reduced zzso zzso The zzso and zzso background zzso leak current is absent in the zzso zzso zzso The resting membrane zzso of the zzso zzso are relatively insensitive to changes in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso a zzso zzso channel, forms the background zzso leak zzso and controls zzso zzso
