zzso zzso zzso catalyze an zzso group transfer from zzso zzso A zzso to zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso The recently determined three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso have revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which resides in a deep and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is strictly zzso across all known zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso at neutral pH rapidly zzso the zzso with zzso rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass spectral analysis established that zzso is the only site of zzso by zzso Unlike the case for zzso zzso no significant zzso was observed with either zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso state and steady state kinetic analysis with zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a zzso curve for the zzso step with a zzso rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by a slow linear rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Studies of the pH dependence of the rate of zzso with zzso and the rate of zzso with zzso revealed similar zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both rates reached their maximum values at pH zzso and decreased by only zzso at pH zzso zzso studies in the presence of zzso revealed a large inverse zzso isotope effect on both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were found to be identical to the zzso factors zzso derived from zzso inventory studies of the rate of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso resulted in the complete loss of protein structural integrity and zzso zzso From these results, it can be concluded that the zzso mechanism of zzso depends on the formation of a zzso zzso pair zzso However, in contrast to the case with zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso change is likely responsible for the second zzso and not zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso are not zzso The zzso appears, therefore, to be engineered to rapidly form a stable zzso species poised to react with an zzso zzso
