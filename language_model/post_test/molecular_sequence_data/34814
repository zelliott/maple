zzso fluid proteins show striking effects on zzso involving manipulation of female behavior and zzso mechanisms of zzso competition, and pathogen zzso Strong zzso pressures are expected for such manifestations of sexual selection and host defense, but the extent of positive selection in seminal fluid proteins from divergent zzso is zzso We identified zzso evolution in zzso seminal proteins using zzso resources in a zzso zzso We found extensive signatures of positive selection when comparing 161 human seminal fluid proteins and zzso zzso genes to those in zzso Seven of eight outstanding genes yielded statistically significant evidence of positive selection when analyzed in divergent zzso zzso clues were gained through divergent analysis, including several cases of zzso loss of function in zzso plug zzso and statistically significant spatial zzso of positively selected sites near the active site of zzso zzso This study reveals previously unidentified positive selection in seven zzso seminal zzso and when considered with findings in zzso indicates that extensive positive selection is found in seminal fluid across divergent zzso zzso
