The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA repair zzso zzso (AP) zzso zzso was used as a probe to isolate a gene zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is predicted to zzso a protein 30 zzso in size, which shares zzso and zzso identity at the zzso acid level with, respectively, zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso We suggest that zzso protein is a member of the zzso IV family of DNA repair zzso
