A zzso zzso zzso zzso a previously unknown protein with a zzso zzso domain was obtained by zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso library in a zzso zzso zzso impaired in protein zzso The zzso zzso protein shows zzso acid similarity over its entire length to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso whose function is not zzso These two proteins form a new zzso zzso family, number zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso showed that it zzso a protein with zzso activity and thus the protein was named zzso and the corresponding gene zzso zzso zzso were prepared against zzso produced in zzso coli and detected a zzso protein in the zzso zzso culture zzso Northern zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso is regulated in the same manner as other zzso genes of this zzso
