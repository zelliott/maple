Due to the high zzso of breast cancer and associated mortality zzso development of an effective vaccine may be beneficial for the prevention or zzso treatment of this zzso We have constructed a novel breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso that consists of zzso and expresses a truncated form of zzso and human zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso construct confirmed zzso of zzso and human zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit breast cancer growth was evaluated in zzso mice zzso combined zzso mice zzso with 50 zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso that received three biweekly injections of zzso zzso zzso zzso Control animals received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 8 in each zzso were zzso with 4 zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso Whereas mice receiving the control vaccines developed a zzso only zzso of zzso animals developed a palpable tumor with a slower rate of tumor growth zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the primary tumors in zzso animals revealed areas of reduced zzso zzso zzso human zzso were detected only in tumors grown in zzso zzso These results imply a critical role of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso immune zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso engineered to express a zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso inhibited breast cancer growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a promising candidate as a breast cancer zzso
