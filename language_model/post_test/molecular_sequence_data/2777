The class II molecules of the zzso not only bind processed zzso peptides but also interact with the zzso This latter interaction is thought to be the basis for zzso specific zzso of zzso presentation to T zzso The specificity of this interaction is likely due to zzso acid differences in a small number of zzso or zzso regions located in the zzso terminal zzso of the zzso and zzso We have explored the functional significance of these zzso regions in an zzso zzso egg zzso specific zzso presentation system in which the measurement of zzso production by T cell zzso was used as the indicator of zzso recognition of the zzso zzso zzso I-A zzso in which b zzso zzso were zzso in one or more of the zzso regions of the A alpha k chain or in which d zzso zzso were zzso in one or more of the zzso regions of the A beta k chain, were used to examine the contribution of each zzso region of the zzso to its zzso The results obtained demonstrate that the regions between zzso 69 to 76 of the A alpha k chain and the regions between zzso 63 to 67 and 75 to 78 of the A beta zzso exert a dominant effect on the presentation of zzso peptides by zzso to the T cell zzso in our zzso These observations were confirmed and extended by the analysis of zzso presentation by seven zzso selected zzso all of which have zzso acid zzso in or around the dominant zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso selected zzso fail to present zzso not because they fail to bind the zzso zzso but because the zzso acid zzso destabilize the interaction between the zzso complex and the zzso Use of the recently published hypothetical model for class II structure to interpret the zzso presentation results suggests that the dominant zzso regions lie across from one another near one end of the zzso that form the two walls of the proposed zzso zzso located on the top surface of the class II zzso Furthermore, the majority of the zzso acids which have been changed in the zzso selected zzso have side chains which are zzso to point up toward the exterior of the zzso and would, therefore, be potential contact zzso for the zzso
