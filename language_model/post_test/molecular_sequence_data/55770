zzso is a zzso zzso factor that appears to play an important role in cell cycle zzso DNA affinity zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso exhibits multiple protein bands when analyzed by zzso After zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the individual protein zzso the zzso DNA binding activity of the individual proteins was zzso However, upon mixing the individual components together, a dramatic zzso to zzso increase in specific DNA binding activity was zzso The five protein bands isolated can be separated into two groups based on apparent molecular zzso zzso zzso of activity requires one of the two proteins found in the group of larger molecular mass zzso 60 zzso and one of the three proteins in the zzso group zzso 50 zzso The zzso zzso is identical to authentic zzso zzso by three criteria: zzso zzso DNA pattern, and binding to the zzso gene zzso A recently cloned protein with zzso activity, zzso is related to the protein components of the group of larger molecular mass, as determined by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso like many other zzso factors, binds DNA as an zzso complex composed of at least two distinct zzso
