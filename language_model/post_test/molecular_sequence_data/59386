zzso zzso representing all possible sequences of the zzso and internal zzso acid sequences of the zzso inhibitor zzso from zzso zzso seeds were used to generate a probe specific for zzso sequences by the zzso chain reaction on the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso from maturing seeds was screened with the zzso gene thus obtained as a probe and characterized by DNA zzso The cloned zzso zzso comprised 737 zzso and one open reading frame that zzso a zzso chain of zzso zzso acids including a signal zzso composed of 24 zzso zzso An expression zzso was designed for export of the zzso inhibitor into the zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso zzso matured zzso was zzso into the zzso and zzso sites following the zzso B signal sequence in the expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso However, this attempt failed as the zzso inhibitor caused the formation of inclusion bodies in zzso coli cells as a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso B upstream zzso zzso was made soluble and zzso by zzso and zzso and subsequently processed with zzso to give rise to zzso zzso zzso that had an extra zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso acid of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso almost as strongly as authentic zzso
