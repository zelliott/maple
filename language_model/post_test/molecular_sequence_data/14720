zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso are regarded as important zzso defense weapons after zzso and exposure of pathogens to the content of primary zzso Despite intensive studies on zzso during the last three decades, only three active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso and zzso 3 zzso have been identified in these short-lived zzso Here, we report on the identification of a fourth zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity to zzso and zzso but zzso zzso yet sharing features like zzso processing by zzso zzso I, storage, and release as an active zzso with the three active zzso We established zzso zzso against zzso excluded zzso to human zzso NE, zzso zzso and zzso and screened for zzso protein expression in various human zzso and blood zzso zzso Only zzso precursors and zzso populations from peripheral blood were zzso The content of zzso in zzso zzso however, was about zzso lower compared with zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso was released into the zzso zzso its specificity with zzso libraries from zzso coli revealed a preference for zzso in zzso it zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso inhibitor zzso C1 zzso and most efficiently by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specialization and preferred natural zzso of zzso remain to be determined to understand the biological interplay of all four zzso during zzso zzso
