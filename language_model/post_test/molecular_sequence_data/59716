The delayed zzso zzso current zzso in rabbit heart has long been thought to consist of only a single, rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we find that zzso of rabbit zzso zzso actually consists of both rapid and slow zzso zzso and zzso respectively, that can be isolated zzso Thus, after complete blockade of zzso with zzso the remaining zzso zzso is homogeneous as judged by an envelope of tails zzso zzso activates and zzso slowly, continues to activate during sustained zzso has a zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso and slope factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso reverses at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso 4 zzso is increased by removing zzso zzso and is enhanced by zzso and stocked by zzso Northern analysis demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of the channel that zzso the zzso zzso is expressed in rabbit zzso zzso of the rabbit protein in zzso zzso elicits a slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to those expressed previously from zzso zzso guinea zzso and human zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is present in rabbit zzso and therefore contributes to cardiac zzso in this zzso
