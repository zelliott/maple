zzso disease is an idiopathic vascular disorder of zzso zzso Its zzso locus has been mapped to zzso in Japanese families, but the zzso gene is zzso 

zzso linkage analysis in eight zzso families with zzso disease revealed linkage to zzso zzso Fine mapping demonstrated a zzso disease locus bounded by zzso and zzso We conducted zzso analysis of the eight index cases in these families, with results filtered through zzso zzso There was a zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso in the zzso locus of the eight index zzso The zzso zzso in zzso could not be confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in 42 index cases confirmed zzso and revealed it to be the only zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso around zzso revealed a founder zzso transmitted in 42 zzso zzso the zzso region covering the founder zzso in one index case did not show any coding zzso except zzso A zzso study demonstrated strong association of zzso with zzso disease in East Asian populations zzso cases and zzso zzso with an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in East Asian cases revealed additional novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among Caucasian cases, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that possesses two functional zzso a Walker motif and a zzso finger zzso These exhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso did not affect zzso levels or zzso activity, zzso of zzso in zzso caused irregular wall formation in trunk arteries and abnormal zzso zzso 

We provide evidence zzso for the first time, the involvement of zzso in genetic zzso to zzso zzso
