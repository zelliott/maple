zzso is a novel family of proteins linking zzso and zzso In humans, these proteins are zzso by nine zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the characteristics and expression profile of zzso Human zzso has a high sequence identity among various species and similar characteristics as its mouse and rat zzso zzso by results both of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the gene is highly transcribed in zzso zzso and zzso For further zzso we generated a zzso zzso against human zzso and found that the protein is highly expressed in the zzso and some cells of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso gene that may have important roles in the male zzso system and immune zzso Further studies are necessary to validate its functions in the two zzso
