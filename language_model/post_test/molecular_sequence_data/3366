zzso zzso zzso zzso form a diverse family of cell surface molecules whose functions remain poorly zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been implicated in zzso guidance and neural zzso Here we report the molecular and genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso member zzso zzso zzso are expressed in many zzso in early zzso and later become localized to zzso processes and to zzso zzso zzso Loss of function in zzso causes zzso defects in zzso and zzso development similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of function in zzso zzso enhances zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a subset of its zzso zzso but does not show specific interactions with several other zzso or zzso zzso The genetic interaction of zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso and zzso receptors have related and partly redundant functions in zzso zzso zzso
