Analysis by Northern zzso and sequencing of zzso clones from a zzso library of a tumor biopsy from a zzso zzso zzso patient showed that the zzso region of the zzso virus zzso is abundantly and regularly transcribed in tumor zzso from zzso zzso The zzso occurred in a rightward direction terminating between coordinates zzso and zzso where two zzso sites are zzso zzso zzso of this region also occurred in B zzso cells harboring the viral zzso albeit at a lower level than in the tumor zzso zzso zzso yields a family of related transcripts displaying at least four zzso zzso Different promoters may be zzso further contributing to the diversity of this family of zzso A zzso zzso transcript present in zzso cells was probably initiated from a zzso box located in position zzso while the other transcripts may zzso other promoters localized to other zzso All the transcripts zzso a putative open reading frame, zzso which is predicted to zzso a basic protein of about 20 zzso It shares zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with the DNA binding region of a zzso factor, zzso specified by zzso zzso zzso
