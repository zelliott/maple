Many bacteria use zzso sensing zzso to coordinate responses to environmental zzso In zzso bacteria, the most extensively studied zzso systems rely on the use of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso Some bacteria produce zzso that are able to zzso AHL signals produced by other bacteria and hence interfere with zzso processes via a phenomenon known as zzso zzso zzso AHL degradation activity has been found in the biomass of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being absent from the culture zzso The gene zzso has been identified and cloned whose product exhibits zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that it is at least partially responsible for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which was named zzso inhibitor from zzso zzso shows broad zzso length zzso Because the presence of zzso in the biomass of zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described recently, zzso could represent a zzso system to control the response to its own zzso signals but could also be involved in the interference of zzso within complex microbial communities in which zzso are zzso
