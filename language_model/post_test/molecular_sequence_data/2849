A zzso zzso region from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using the tobacco zzso gene for zzso protein zzso as a zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of genes for zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso factors zzso and zzso in this DNA zzso The arrangement is zzso zzso zzso - 167 zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - 77 zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - 26 zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso which is similar to that of the zzso coli zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso show high zzso zzso with the zzso coli and zzso counterparts while those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso give low zzso zzso zzso structural zzso was found between the potential zzso binding region of zzso zzso and the beginning of zzso zzso suggesting that feedback regulation of zzso expression operates in zzso zzso
