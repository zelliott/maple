The mechanism of bacterial gliding zzso zzso movement over surfaces without the aid of zzso is not zzso A large number of zzso zzso of the gliding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been previously isolated, and genetic techniques to analyze these zzso have recently been zzso We zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a library of zzso DNA by using the shuttle zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained an insert of 13 zzso and restored zzso to 4 of 61 independently isolated zzso zzso A zzso zzso that zzso a single ORF, zzso zzso all four zzso zzso of the zzso copy of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminated gliding zzso The predicted protein produced by zzso has strong sequence similarity to zzso binding cassette transport zzso
