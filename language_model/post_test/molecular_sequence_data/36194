Human zzso zzso zzso exhibits a genetically determined structural zzso amenable to analysis by zzso focusing and zzso zzso We have determined the zzso frequency and molecular basis of a unique zzso zzso which is widely distributed among blacks but is absent in other zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso in blacks (N zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso In comparison to the common zzso zzso analysis of coding and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso of 12 zzso near the zzso terminal region of the mature zzso The zzso involves an exact zzso of the second of the four repeats and codes for 4 zzso acids zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is responsible for the charge shift of the the zzso 5 zzso slightly toward the zzso as compared to the wild type zzso 1 zzso on the zzso focusing zzso This zzso zzso occurs in a region which is highly zzso among zzso zzso and zzso In addition to the 12 zzso zzso the four individuals zzso for the zzso zzso also revealed a zzso zzso by replacing G to T at the third position of zzso zzso Our preliminary data suggest that this unique black zzso marker may be of potentially significance in studies of human zzso metabolism and in zzso
