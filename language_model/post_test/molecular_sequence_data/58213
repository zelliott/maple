The contributions of the first and second variable regions of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso to envelope zzso structure, function, and recognition by a zzso zzso were zzso Several zzso with zzso in the V2 loop demonstrated complete zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that inappropriate changes in V2 zzso can affect zzso zzso Some zzso with changes in zzso or V2 were efficiently expressed on the cell surface and were able to bind zzso but were deficient in zzso formation and/or virus zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was affected by particular zzso affecting zzso 176 to 184 in the V2 zzso These results suggest that the zzso variable regions of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso play a role in zzso binding events in the membrane fusion process and can act as a target for zzso zzso
