The zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from human zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso is zzso similar in sequence to that of a previously characterized form, zzso zzso zzso and contains a signal zzso and zzso zzso domain characteristic of all zzso zzso isolated to zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells has a relative molecular mass of 56 zzso and is very active in the zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso of 34 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells had relatively little activity towards zzso acid, suggesting that zzso may have a significant role in the elimination of this zzso and zzso agent in zzso
