To develop a zzso chain reaction zzso strategy to screen the zzso zzso in dogs with cardiac and skeletal zzso 

9 Doberman zzso 1 zzso and 1 Saint Bernard with zzso zzso zzso 1 Irish zzso with muscular zzso and 2 zzso German zzso zzso zzso 

For each of the 3 unique zzso associated with the muscle zzso zzso zzso and cortical zzso promoters of the zzso zzso each first zzso and the M promoter plus its first zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The M zzso transcript was amplified by reverse zzso zzso from skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso of 1 Doberman zzso and from skeletal muscle zzso of 1 zzso 

The M, zzso and C first zzso were amplified from all dogs except the 2 zzso which had a deletion encompassing the entire M, zzso and C zzso promoter zzso The M transcript could not be amplified from muscles of the zzso but was amplified from skeletal and cardiac muscle of the Doberman zzso zzso of the product representing the M promoter and its first zzso revealed no differences between clinically normal dogs and the Doberman zzso with zzso 

We have ruled out a major zzso of the zzso promoter region as the universal cause of zzso in Doberman zzso or of Irish zzso zzso Use of the strategy identified a large deletion of this region in muscle from the zzso
