We recently established two zzso C virus zzso replication systems, using zzso a human zzso leukemia virus type zzso human zzso line, and zzso a zzso human zzso line immortalized with zzso virus 40 large T zzso These zzso replication systems were used to assess the zzso zzso of seven zzso containing more than zzso zzso zzso per zzso obtained from zzso blood zzso 

The results showed that these zzso had different zzso for zzso and zzso zzso One of the seven zzso zzso was more zzso for zzso cells than zzso cells, whereas all the zzso except serum zzso were more zzso for zzso cells than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected at least 30 days after zzso with three of the zzso These findings suggested that the zzso potency of each serum depends on the type of target zzso To further investigate zzso replication in these cells, we examined the zzso region 1 zzso populations of zzso recovered from both zzso and zzso cells at 8 days zzso The results revealed that the shift to limited zzso populations from the zzso of zzso populations in both cells usually occurred within 8 days after virus zzso Furthermore, in two of four zzso the zzso zzso populations in zzso and zzso cells appeared to be zzso 

These results suggest that zzso exhibits cell zzso
