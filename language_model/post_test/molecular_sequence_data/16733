Most gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso harbor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the majority of these zzso affect the zzso domain of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso is important for zzso research studies and for providing zzso information on the likelihood of tumor response to treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso In a series of zzso analyzed in our laboratory by a combination of zzso zzso and direct DNA sequencing, we identified 19 cases with zzso zzso 11 deletions that included from 1 to 14 zzso of zzso 10 sequence and resulted in loss of the normal zzso zzso site at the beginning of zzso zzso zzso use of the next potential zzso site was confirmed by zzso sequencing in 4 zzso Thus, the resulting zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso was the same in all 19 zzso Only two other examples of deletions across the zzso zzso 11 boundary have been reported, yet among zzso zzso analyzed in our laboratories these deletions were not zzso accounting for zzso of zzso 11 zzso and zzso of all zzso Loss of zzso zzso 10 sequences may be zzso if the forward primer is too close to zzso 11, or if cases are examined exclusively at the zzso zzso zzso that offer clinical screening for zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumors should be aware of this class of zzso
