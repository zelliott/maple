zzso a protein with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a major target for patient zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso and occasionally in rheumatic zzso The human zzso zzso has recently been zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence was found to contain sequence similarities with an zzso class I domain and several zzso regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso fusion proteins were used to differentiate the zzso zzso and to map the zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso patients developed zzso as well as zzso and/or zzso class zzso zzso whereas most patients with rheumatic diseases developed zzso class zzso zzso For zzso zzso truncated versions of the zzso protein were zzso for zzso in zzso and zzso With 55 zzso 17 different reaction patterns were zzso and at least three zzso major zzso zzso were recognized by the majority of zzso One domain, which contains the sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso was recognized by all zzso zzso and zzso zzso in part zzso zzso These data demonstrate a zzso and zzso zzso zzso response which is zzso and, at least in terms of zzso zzso different in zzso and zzso zzso
