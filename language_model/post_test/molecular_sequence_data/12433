The entire envelope gene of a British zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and aligned with those of the reference strains zzso zzso and zzso Three of the viruses zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso were then zzso using an extensive panel of human zzso positive zzso and mapped zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the zzso zzso translation product shares zzso zzso with those of the reference zzso Across the zzso region zzso was greater between zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso which zzso zzso and resistant to those that neutralize zzso In the zzso binding region the central zzso was zzso in all viruses but zzso in the zzso was greater between zzso and zzso and zzso than zzso zzso and zzso were sensitive to all zzso raised against the zzso binding site whereas MN was resistant to 3 of 4 zzso Human zzso obtained from a London-based cohort did not differentiate between zzso and MN in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were significantly lower at all stages of zzso These results show that zzso carries a zzso zzso loop and is as representative as MN of zzso viruses circulating in the zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the only British zzso isolate which has been zzso to zzso
