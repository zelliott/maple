We generated zzso zzso against four highly zzso sequences in the zzso domain and against two zzso sequences surrounding zzso sites in the zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso These zzso were used to examine zzso and function in zzso of specific zzso Two of the highly zzso sites, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appeared to participate in zzso since alpha zzso and alpha zzso but not the other zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the six sites revealed that zzso in all except the zzso site appeared to be exposed to zzso binding in the zzso The conditions that caused increased exposure of the zzso site to interaction with zzso included zzso addition of the zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso in temperature from 4 to 34 degrees zzso
