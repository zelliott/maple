A number of natural zzso are characterized as having zzso zzso zzso IV susceptible zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso with sequences analogous to the zzso part of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso IV and zzso N zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso of these peptides was zzso correlated with their chain zzso In contrast to these results, no degradation was found under our conditions for the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for natural zzso independent of whether zzso IV and zzso were used separately or in zzso
