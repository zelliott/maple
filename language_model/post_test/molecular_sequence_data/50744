There is increasing evidence that zzso cells respond to the initiation of mechanical stress by the generation of certain second zzso and the zzso of specific zzso zzso These rapid zzso in cellular function are accompanied by zzso in protein synthesis that are zzso several hours after initiation of the mechanical zzso The molecular mechanisms by which changes in the zzso are converted to altered genetic expression in the nucleus are not zzso Because zzso zzso in the rate of synthesis of zzso and zzso have been associated with the zzso and zzso protein families, it seems reasonable to propose that genetic expression in zzso zzso or mechanical zzso zzso cells is also regulated by selective induction of zzso and zzso gene zzso Testing of this hypothesis is actively under way in our zzso
