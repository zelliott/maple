In zzso zzso zzso is attached to zzso in the sequence zzso where X denotes any zzso zzso However, the presence of this consensus zzso does not always lead to zzso We have compiled an extensive collection of zzso and zzso zzso sites and present a statistical study based on this data zzso Our results indicate that zzso sites tend to be found more frequently towards the C zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso in positions X and Y in the consensus zzso strongly reduce the likelihood of zzso zzso Beyond this, there are no obvious local sequence features that seem to correlate with the absence or presence of zzso zzso These findings are discussed in terms of the prediction and engineering of zzso sites in zzso zzso
