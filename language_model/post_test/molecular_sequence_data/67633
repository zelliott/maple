zzso zzso dominate zzso zzso and cold zzso communities zzso zzso associations with zzso zzso and zzso bacteria that provide for their nutrition are the key to their ecological and evolutionary zzso The current paradigm is that these zzso evolved from two zzso ancestors, one zzso and one zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies, our zzso analyses of the zzso zzso show that both the sulfur and the methane zzso fall into multiple zzso zzso with zzso bacteria, many of which were discovered recently in zzso from marine oxygen minimum zzso We therefore zzso that zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso bacteria evolved multiple times in zzso zzso Furthermore, by zzso zzso sequencing and zzso in zzso zzso we show that close relatives of the zzso zzso occur on hosts belonging to different animal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from a zzso and a zzso sponge from a cold zzso The host range within the zzso zzso is therefore greater than previously zzso confirming the remarkable flexibility of these symbiotic zzso
