zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is supposed to play a regulatory role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of the regulation, we prepared and characterized a chemically modified zzso and examined its effects on the zzso of zzso zzso We found that treatment of zzso with zzso zzso led to loss of zzso activity toward zzso or zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses of the modified zzso showed that zzso of the zzso group of the zzso zzso of zzso led to complete loss of the zzso zzso When the zzso modified zzso was added to culture medium of zzso zzso zzso cells, the conversion of zzso zzso A to the intermediate form was partially zzso whereas that of the intermediate form to the mature one was strongly zzso The zzso zzso zzso also prevented an zzso of active zzso A on the cell zzso We speculate that occupation of the zzso domain of zzso A by the zzso zzso zzso makes it unable for zzso A to be retained on the cell surface, thus preventing the zzso conversion of the intermediate form of zzso A to its mature zzso
