zzso cell zzso receptors zzso control the immune response of zzso cells and some T cells to infections and zzso zzso genes evolve rapidly and are variable between individuals in their number, type and zzso Here, we determined the nature of zzso gene zzso in four ethnic groups using direct DNA sequencing zzso Nine new sequences were zzso Within the panel of 248 zzso individuals, 14 zzso differing in coding regions were zzso They differed at only seven zzso acid positions, and such limited zzso is consistent with its zzso nature throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in the distribution of zzso zzso and their zzso African Americans had more zzso zzso than other populations indicating that more zzso are yet to be discovered in zzso zzso between zzso and certain zzso genes were observed, but frequency of these linked clusters differed substantially between zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used as markers to predict the zzso gene zzso zzso system distinguishing zzso and zzso zzso can serve as a powerful screening test to assess the content of most variable zzso genes that have been implicated in human disease and in the outcome of zzso stem cell zzso
