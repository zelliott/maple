In an effort to improve the activities and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have prepared a linear zzso analogue zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consisting of the zzso region zzso acids zzso joined by a zzso zzso to the zzso region zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso 2 and 4 had eight zzso of zzso as estimated from its circular zzso zzso zzso in contrast to 10 zzso in analogue zzso zzso of analogue 2 at zzso 20 and 24 to give analogue 3 resulted in only a slight change to the zzso ratio zzso to zzso where zzso is considered a perfect zzso although an increase in the zzso length of analogue 3 was zzso In contrast, zzso between zzso 24 and 28 by zzso to give analogue 4 only slightly affected the zzso content but clearly resulted in a more classical zzso structure zzso zzso zzso zzso of the linear analogue 2 enhanced the zzso zzso zzso binding approximately zzso where the zzso values derived from zzso competitive binding zzso with zzso cells were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso induced after interaction with zzso as measured by zzso was significantly reduced in analogue 4 compared to 3, and approached the zzso of native zzso indicating a correlation between the degree of zzso and biological zzso zzso the biological activity of small zzso zzso zzso is highly dependent on the zzso of its zzso zzso
