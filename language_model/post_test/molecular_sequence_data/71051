The newly isolated bacterial strain zzso can zzso 1, zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the zzso was identified as a member of the zzso which contains the fast-growing zzso The first step in zzso metabolism is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso is rapidly converted to zzso oxide by a zzso zzso in this way preventing the zzso of zzso and zzso as toxic zzso zzso oxide can serve as a growth zzso for strain zzso but the zzso by which it is further zzso is still zzso zzso zzso can also zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as growth zzso zzso and zzso are zzso via zzso oxide, which for both zzso is a novel way to remove the zzso without going through the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso zzso by this gene is identical to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso except for three zzso acid zzso and a zzso extension at the C zzso zzso of the complete zzso gene region of strain zzso with DNA sequences in different databases showed that a large part of a zzso gene region, which is also present in zzso zzso zzso zzso was fused to a zzso of a zzso zzso gene that was identical to the last 42 zzso of the zzso gene found in zzso zzso strain zzso
