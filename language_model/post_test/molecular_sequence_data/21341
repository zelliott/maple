The zzso zzso long zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso is under the control of zzso dependent zzso zzso an zzso zzso for its zzso and zzso A high rate of zzso has been found to be associated with zzso viruses like zzso Based on genetic zzso zzso has been classified into 6 different major zzso and 11 different zzso However this zzso system does not provide significant information about the origin of the virus, primarily due to high zzso rate at zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a single zzso of about zzso zzso acids which is processed into structural and zzso proteins inside host cell by viral and cellular zzso 

We have identified a zzso zzso protein sequence for zzso zzso zzso reported from four different zzso of the world zzso Europe, America, Australia and zzso We investigated zzso sequences and compared zzso acid composition of zzso protein of different zzso zzso through Multiple zzso zzso and observed zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso protein of zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed zzso and zzso as more consistent members of zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 5, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 4, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 3 and zzso in zzso 2 as more consistent members of zzso protein of these zzso So the different zzso acids that were introduced as zzso in zzso protein of zzso 1 zzso zzso have been retained as consistent members of the zzso protein of other known zzso 

These observations indicate that zzso protein of different zzso zzso originally evolved from zzso protein of zzso 1 zzso zzso which in turn indicate that zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso established itself earlier in human population and all other known zzso evolved later as a result of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results were further confirmed through zzso analysis by constructing zzso tree using zzso protein as a zzso zzso
