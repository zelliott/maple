zzso B virus zzso is one of the major viruses zzso by blood that causes chronic infection in zzso zzso The study of 61 zzso carrier blood donors from Lebanon revealed multiple patterns of spliced zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was examined and zzso in samples of five zzso and in zzso zzso The Lebanese sample median viral load was zzso zzso zzso All strains were zzso D, zzso zzso 35 clustered as zzso D1 and 7 clustered as zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in 12 zzso zzso Twenty samples of each zzso A to zzso were tested for the presence of zzso spliced DNA and zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was dominant, but zzso of strains with a viral load of zzso zzso contained various proportions of spliced zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso samples in levels that correlated with the overall viral zzso zzso DNA zzso with S zzso and X zzso zzso regions provided different levels of viral load, with the difference corresponding to spliced zzso During the highly infectious window period, the zzso zzso became zzso shortly after the zzso B surface zzso zzso suggesting a correlation between the initiation of zzso and the production of zzso levels of zzso The zzso of zzso DNA with zzso located outside and inside the spliced region might provide different zzso of viral load and differentiate between infectious and defective viral zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso replication and interaction with the host remains to be zzso
