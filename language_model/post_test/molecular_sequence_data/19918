A comparative analysis of the zzso toxin zzso and zzso DNA zzso sequences was performed on a suite of zzso cultures of the potentially toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso These were established from resting zzso or zzso cells isolated from zzso and water samples taken from the south and west coasts of zzso zzso revealed that strains were zzso both zzso and through the sequencing of the zzso domain of the large zzso and the zzso regions of the zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso detection analysis, however, showed that only strains derived from zzso zzso on the southern Irish coast zzso zzso shellfish poisoning zzso toxins zzso and zzso whereas all strains of zzso zzso isolated from the west coast were zzso zzso analysis of net zzso taken when zzso zzso zzso cells were in the water column, revealed no zzso toxins in samples from zzso Harbor zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were detected in samples from zzso Harbor zzso zzso These results confirm the identity of zzso zzso as the most probable zzso zzso for historical zzso of contamination of shellfish with zzso toxins in zzso zzso Finally, random amplification of zzso DNA was carried out to determine the degree of zzso among zzso The analysis showed that all toxic strains from zzso Harbor clustered together and that a separate cluster grouped all nontoxic strains from the western zzso
