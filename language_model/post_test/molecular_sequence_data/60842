Treatment of zzso has remained a major challenge in pediatric zzso because the assessment of the individual zzso particularly in zzso disease is still zzso Previous studies have correlated clinical outcome with activity levels of zzso a cellular reverse zzso which has been detected in the majority of human zzso zzso 

In this zzso study, a zzso zzso repeat amplification protocol zzso with an internal zzso standard was used on an automated laser zzso zzso for the detection and zzso analysis of zzso activity zzso in 67 zzso of all clinical stages from the German zzso Trial and 2 zzso zzso levels were correlated with zzso and overall survival rates and established zzso markers such as zzso 

zzso was present in 14 of 69 zzso samples, including 3 of 22 stage zzso 8 of 14 stage IV, 1 of 10 stage III, 1 of 7 stage II and 1 of 14 stage I zzso and 0 of 2 zzso We found a strong statistical correlation between the presence of zzso and poor clinical prognosis with regard to all tumor zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso as an independent zzso zzso In particular, the analysis of zzso in zzso zzso distinguished two different zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso is an independent zzso marker in zzso which, in combination with other markers such as zzso may proof useful in assessing the individual patient's zzso
