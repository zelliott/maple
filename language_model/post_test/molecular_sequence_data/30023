We have used zzso I zzso and the gel mobility shift zzso to study proteins which bind to promoter elements located between zzso and zzso upstream of the human A gamma zzso zzso zzso are found with both zzso and zzso nuclear extracts at three sites: from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso from the zzso initiation zzso An zzso footprint is identified from zzso to zzso We demonstrate that two known zzso factors, the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso and the zzso regulatory factor zzso bind to the zzso to zzso region and that their zzso zzso zzso of zzso to this region is reduced by a zzso at zzso associated with a form of zzso zzso persistence of fetal zzso We conclude that zzso may compete with zzso for the zzso binding site, possibly functioning as a zzso of gamma zzso zzso
