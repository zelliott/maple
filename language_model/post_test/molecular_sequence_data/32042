zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso , were isolated from zzso zzso of these genes reduced zzso zzso in tobacco flowers, demonstrating their zzso to modification of flower zzso zzso interference zzso has recently been used to successfully modify flower color intensity in several plant zzso In most zzso plants, this technique requires prior isolation of target zzso zzso genes from the same or closely related zzso To overcome this zzso we developed a simple and efficient method for reducing floral zzso zzso based on genetic engineering using novel zzso factor genes isolated from Japanese zzso We identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso tobacco plants expressing these genes were produced, and their flowers were analyzed for zzso components and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso tobacco plants expressing zzso or zzso exhibited significant reductions in floral zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso suppressed in these transgenic tobacco zzso A zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso proteins zzso with the zzso zzso previously identified as an zzso zzso regulator in zzso zzso In addition, a transient expression zzso indicated that zzso of the zzso zzso promoter by the zzso complex was partly canceled by addition of zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso act as zzso zzso factors of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These genes should consequently be useful for manipulating zzso zzso via genetic engineering in flowers of other zzso plant zzso
