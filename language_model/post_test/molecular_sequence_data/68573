The human T cell response to the zzso basic protein zzso has been studied with respect to T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso class II restriction zzso and zzso specificity using a total of 215 long-term zzso T cell lines zzso isolated from the peripheral blood of 13 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and 10 healthy zzso In most donors, the zzso response was zzso zzso Using a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire length of human zzso at least 26 zzso recognized by human zzso could be zzso The zzso domain most commonly recognized was sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of control zzso zzso zzso was recognized more frequently by zzso zzso zzso than by zzso from zzso patients zzso The zzso zzso were recognized in the context of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as demonstrated using a panel of DR zzso L zzso The zzso gene usage was also zzso V beta zzso a zzso of which is currently being used in a clinical trial for treatment of zzso patients, was expressed by only one of our zzso However, within this complex pattern of zzso T cell responses, a minority of zzso patients were found to exhibit a more restricted response with respect to their zzso zzso zzso In these patients zzso of the zzso responded to a single, zzso cluster of zzso T cell zzso located within a small zzso zzso domain of zzso These zzso clusters of zzso zzso were noted within the zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso The T cell response to the zzso zzso was not zzso but heterogeneous, with respect to fine zzso zzso zzso and even zzso zzso In one patient zzso this restricted zzso profile remained stable for zzso 2 zzso The zzso beta chain sequences of zzso specific for the zzso region of zzso are consistent with an zzso response against the zzso of this region zzso Further, two pairs of identical sequences were established from zzso generated from this patient at different times (June 1990 and June 1991), suggesting that some zzso specific for the zzso region persisted in the peripheral zzso The possible role of persistent zzso zzso clusters in the zzso of zzso remains to be zzso
