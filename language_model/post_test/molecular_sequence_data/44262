Vitamin zzso protein zzso a blood zzso zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso in human plasma with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification of a portion of protein S that binds to zzso has been approached using random libraries of 6- and zzso peptides displayed on zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso of zzso were selected in several rounds of affinity zzso with intervening amplification in zzso zzso zzso searches of the affinity zzso zzso sequences against protein S led to the identification of four regions in protein S that were similar to several of the selected zzso These regions were zzso as linear peptides and tested in zzso zzso Only one distinct peak zzso position zzso was observed when the zzso scores versus human protein S sequence were averaged over all affinity zzso zzso A synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso in human protein S was found to inhibit protein S binding to zzso The same result was found with two overlapping peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a second set of synthetic zzso zzso binding of the peptides to zzso was zzso from zzso monitored by recording the near zzso circular zzso zzso or the polarization of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso constitute a portion of protein S that is important for the interaction with zzso These findings may have implications for patients suffering from zzso due to the lack of free protein zzso by directing the design of drugs that disrupt protein S binding to zzso
