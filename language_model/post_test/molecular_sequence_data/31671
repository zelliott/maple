zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso is the method of choice for in-depth structure characterization of large zzso small- and zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Here, we describe the performance of this approach for structural analysis of intact proteins as large as the 80 zzso zzso Current zzso zzso zzso technologies ensure adequate resolution and mass accuracy to simultaneously analyze intact zzso zzso protein zzso and the complex mixture of their zzso product zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso is efficient and may provide extensive sequence information for unfolded and highly charged zzso 1 zzso proteins of zzso zzso and structural motifs embedded in larger zzso zzso regions protected by zzso bonds within intact zzso proteins zzso remain zzso due to the low efficiency of their fragmentation by zzso For zzso reduction of zzso bonds leads to significantly varied zzso fragmentation pattern with higher sequence coverage of zzso and zzso regions, providing a complementary structural information to zzso analysis of its oxidized zzso
