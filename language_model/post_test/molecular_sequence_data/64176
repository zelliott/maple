zzso is a newly discovered member of the zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso and is present in carp head zzso zzso and zzso all of which are responsible for immune and zzso functions in zzso A complex formed by zzso and its inhibitor was zzso from carp kidney extract by zzso affinity column zzso The presence of the zzso complex in different zzso was examined by zzso with zzso zzso against the zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso Both zzso and the zzso inhibitor were present mainly in zzso head zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we have cloned the zzso zzso the zzso zzso There are two different zzso clones possibly resulting from two different zzso and the long form contains unique tandem repeat sequences in the zzso The deduced primary structure of zzso inhibitor is similar to that of zzso a zzso protein present in blood, liver, zzso fluid, and cerebral zzso during fetal zzso Treatment with both zzso F and zzso removed the zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor and decreased the apparent molecular mass from 40 to 30 zzso The zzso inhibitor seems to be zzso in liver and then zzso to the blood as a zzso When it was distributed into zzso zzso it was processed from 67 to 40 zzso and acquired zzso zzso This processing phenomenon of zzso has not been reported zzso zzso the presence of an zzso inhibitor of zzso is the first report of this kind for zzso zzso It is very likely that zzso tissue zzso may also be present for the regulation of other zzso zzso
