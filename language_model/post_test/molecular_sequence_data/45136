zzso zzso receptors are zzso complexes formed by the zzso or zzso assembly of seven different zzso We have shown previously that, unlike all of the other zzso zzso the zzso zzso cannot form zzso receptors and when expressed alone is retained in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, other studies have shown that zzso can form functional zzso receptors with zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we used a combination of zzso surface zzso and atomic force zzso to investigate the assembly and trafficking of the zzso zzso both alone and as part of a zzso We show that as a zzso it exits the zzso and is either zzso expressed at the cell surface or zzso zzso depending on its zzso Through the use of targeted zzso we demonstrate that an zzso region at the N zzso of zzso exerts an zzso effect on its assembly and export from the zzso When this region is removed, or when charge is added to it, zzso forms zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and is delivered to the plasma zzso albeit less efficiently than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were, however, zzso Substituting the zzso zzso acid zzso region for the equivalent region of zzso increased zzso retention but was not sufficient to prevent the formation of functional zzso zzso We propose that the N zzso of the zzso zzso contributes to a mechanism that prevents the inappropriate export and plasma membrane expression of zzso zzso zzso
