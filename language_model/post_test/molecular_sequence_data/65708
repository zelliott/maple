zzso zzso zzso is one of the few zzso restriction zzso zzso found in zzso The zzso zzso system was cloned by the zzso selection method, inverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows significant zzso acid sequence identity to zzso and a putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was successfully zzso in a zzso zzso coli strain from zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows strong zzso activity zzso zzso in zzso buffers 1, 4, and an zzso zzso Star activity was diminished in buffers with zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso from inclusion zzso The zzso zzso protein possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso to zzso substitution zzso or zzso and zzso zzso with a single zzso at the zzso end were also constructed and zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA and the zzso activity on zzso DNA is at least zzso higher than that on zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be useful for zzso to other DNA binding elements such as synthetic zinc fingers, zzso locked zzso acids zzso or zzso zzso acids zzso
