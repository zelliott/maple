When it is bound to zzso zzso the zzso and location of the membrane pH zzso zzso zzso zzso depend on zzso This unique feature allows us to explicitly measure the zzso leading to different zzso states of zzso using a model membrane and zzso zzso Our results show that the membrane association zzso of zzso are zzso and are consistent with a parallel membrane interaction zzso Interestingly, our results also show that the overall rate at which the zzso state is formed is almost identical to that of formation of the zzso state, while zzso slows the rate of zzso zzso
