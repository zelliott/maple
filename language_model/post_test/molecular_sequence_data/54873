zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that also zzso disease progression in zzso and Alzheimer's zzso zzso is of great interest as a target for treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases; however, the molecular basis of zzso function and regulation remains poorly zzso In the recently reported structure of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso at the base of the zzso groove extend upward, in a zzso entirely different from that of any other zzso zzso the central question about zzso structure and function is whether the extended zzso is the zzso competent zzso or whether the extended zzso must undergo a large zzso zzso in order to bind zzso We have generated a series of zzso zzso zzso including a novel zzso zzso form, and determined crystal structures of zzso with and without the zzso zzso This series allows evaluation of the role of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso structure and function before and after zzso zzso zzso is inherently more stable than closely related zzso zzso zzso with both the zzso and the zzso present is the most stable, indicating that these two regions act in concert to increase stability, but maintain the extended zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, these data suggest that zzso zzso a significant zzso change upon zzso zzso adopting a structure that is more like zzso zzso
