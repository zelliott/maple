We describe the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective and direct factor zzso zzso after a single zzso administration in canine models of zzso and zzso zzso The systemic zzso effects of zzso were evaluated initially in conscious dogs after zzso dosing zzso zzso and zzso zzso that resulted in a zzso increase in the activated zzso time and the activated partial zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were evaluated in zzso dogs where saline or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was administered 1 zzso before the left zzso coronary artery was subjected to zzso zzso In the saline group zzso zzso 10), the left zzso artery zzso in 79 zzso 9 zzso and 5 of 10 animals progressed to sudden death due to zzso zzso zzso significantly prolonged the time to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 62 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment groups zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso all of the injured vessels remained patent for 8 zzso There was a zzso reduction in the zzso mass in the zzso animals as compared with controls, as well as a lower mortality zzso zzso in the doses of zzso and zzso zzso did not alter the bleeding time, whereas zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso In a separate study, we evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso in the prevention of carotid artery and jugular vein zzso In response to zzso injury, the carotid artery and jugular vein in the saline group zzso zzso 6) zzso in 142 zzso 16 and 100 zzso 11 zzso respectively, compared with zzso which maintained vessel zzso in the carotid artery zzso and jugular vein zzso and significantly decreased the zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso has zzso efficacy in canine models of zzso and zzso zzso after a single zzso zzso
