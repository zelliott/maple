A zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil around a wastewater treatment plant in Korea and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clustered with the zzso zzso zzso species, with which it exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso zzso The zzso zzso type was based on zzso acid and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso levels of zzso % to the type strains of zzso species and could also be differentiated from these species by differences in zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso was considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
