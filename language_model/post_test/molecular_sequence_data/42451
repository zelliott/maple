zzso zzso in the zzso beta chain was investigated in 80 zzso patients with CD, 23 patients with zzso and 64 healthy zzso A set of amplification zzso were designed to amplify a zzso region between zzso acids 95 and 135 zzso the second domain of the zzso beta chain zzso A zzso at zzso acid 135 was shown to distinguish zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were designed to identify zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To establish whether zzso existed elsewhere in the zzso zzso which could explain the migratory characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso products were zzso from the zzso DNA of three CD zzso The results showed that the zzso at zzso acid 135 distinguishing zzso and zzso zzso was present in CD, zzso patients, or normal controls of the appropriate DR and zzso zzso by zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso second zzso of three CD patients zzso zzso and one zzso gave normal sequences expected from their zzso No specific zzso of zzso second zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso them from normal zzso zzso We conclude that individuals positive for the zzso zzso have the potential to express a unique zzso zzso with enhanced ability to zzso people to zzso
