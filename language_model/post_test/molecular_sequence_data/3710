The zzso gene zzso encodes an zzso binding protein that functions to promote the floral zzso The zzso transcript is alternatively processed to yield four zzso the most abundant of which is zzso within zzso zzso We have analyzed the role of the alternative processing on the floral zzso The introduction of zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso protein levels and accelerated zzso but no role in flowering was found for products of the shorter zzso The consequences of the alternative processing on the zzso expression pattern were determined using a series of zzso zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso sequence containing the alternatively processed zzso 3 restricted the expression of the zzso predominantly to shoot and root zzso and young flower zzso zzso of this fusion also was delayed zzso zzso the alternative processing of the zzso transcript limits, both zzso and zzso the amount of functional zzso zzso zzso in roots prompted an analysis of root development, which indicated that zzso functions more generally than in the control of the floral zzso
