We have zzso by the zzso chain reaction, and have zzso the zzso region of the zzso DNA from the zzso whale zzso zzso The zzso whale zzso was aligned with zzso sequences from four other zzso zzso zzso zzso fin zzso and zzso zzso and an zzso zzso This alignment showed the zzso whale sequence to be larger than that of other zzso In addition, some sequence blocks were highly zzso among all six species, suggesting roles in the functioning of zzso zzso Other blocks that were previously reported to be well zzso among zzso showed little sequence conservation with the zzso whale zzso which argues against the functional importance of these sequence blocks in zzso
