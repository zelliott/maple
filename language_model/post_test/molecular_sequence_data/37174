zzso virus zzso zzso I is zzso in cell culture but necessary for infection of human skin and T cells in zzso mice in zzso The zzso promoter contains an zzso upstream sequence that binds the cellular zzso specificity factor 1 zzso and upstream zzso factor zzso and an open reading frame 29 zzso element zzso which mediates enhancement by zzso DNA binding protein of zzso 62 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with two base pair zzso in zzso or zzso sites, zzso like zzso in zzso but zzso of zzso was significantly impaired in skin and T cells in zzso A double zzso zzso did not replicate in skin but yielded low zzso of infectious virus in T zzso The repaired zzso zzso was as infectious as zzso Thus, zzso zzso promoter sites for cellular zzso altered zzso zzso in zzso with variable consequences related to the cellular factor and the host cell zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso promoter were made by substituting each of four zzso blocks in this region with a zzso zzso zzso that was predicted to interfere with zzso effects of the zzso zzso One of these zzso which was designated zzso had diminished replication in skin and T cells, indicating that zzso zzso enhancement of zzso expression contributes to zzso zzso zzso within promoters of viral genes that are zzso in zzso should allow construction of zzso zzso that have altered zzso in specific host cells in zzso and may be useful for designing zzso gene therapy zzso and attenuated viral zzso
