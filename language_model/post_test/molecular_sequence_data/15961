The genetic variation of zzso Valley fever virus zzso was estimated by sequencing a portion of the M segment zzso of 22 zzso from a variety of host species collected over 34 years in 6 African zzso The M segment zzso of the Egyptian zzso zzso which has been zzso cloned and zzso was used as a reference for these zzso zzso gene regions, responsible for zzso zzso presumed to play a role in protection against disease, were emphasized in these zzso Comparative sequence data revealed that most zzso were very similar to zzso at both the zzso acid and deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso acid sequence variation range was zzso zzso acid sequence variation range was zzso We identified specific zzso acid coding changes which may be involved in virus zzso and may contribute to the zzso characteristics of zzso
