The zzso zzso of zzso zzso (R zzso in the zzso compound eye form specific connections with targets in the zzso zzso In this paper, we report the identification of a zzso zzso zzso that is essential for zzso growth cone zzso In zzso zzso zzso growth cones frequently fail to terminate migration in their normal target, the zzso and instead project through it and terminate in the second zzso zzso the zzso zzso mosaic analysis and zzso rescue experiments indicate that zzso functions in R cells and not within the zzso target zzso zzso encodes a nuclear zzso We propose that it zzso in a gene expression zzso regulating one or more growth cone components controlling zzso zzso
