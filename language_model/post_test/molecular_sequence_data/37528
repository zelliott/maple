The present descriptive study shows the expression pattern of an zzso zzso whose most striking expression is seen along the lining of all four zzso of the adult rat zzso Lower levels of expression are evident in other areas of the brain, notably in cortex, zzso and various zzso zzso and zzso zzso where it seems to be primarily zzso with little or no expression in white matter zzso However, expression in cells on both sides of the basement membrane of the zzso suggests expression in other cell types such as zzso zzso and putative precursors zzso as well as zzso cells and zzso In the zzso zzso had an expression level similar to the brain, whereas zzso had a much higher level of zzso
