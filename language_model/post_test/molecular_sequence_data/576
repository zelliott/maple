The plateau phase of the zzso action potential is the result of balanced zzso influx and zzso zzso The action potential is finally terminated by zzso zzso zzso Under zzso stimulation the slowly zzso component of the human cardiac delayed zzso zzso current zzso provides the major zzso zzso zzso channels are zzso channels composed of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso sensor zzso of zzso are associated with zzso syndrome 1 zzso Here, we study the effects of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in zzso The respective channels were expressed in zzso zzso and analyzed by dual zzso zzso zzso As a result all zzso shifted the zzso dependence of zzso to the right and reduced the zzso dependence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were differently affected in zzso zzso channels compared to wild type zzso All three zzso reduced zzso channel currents in a zzso manner when the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso suggesting reduced zzso as the molecular basis of zzso
