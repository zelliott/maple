H5N1 influenza A virus causes a rapidly fatal systemic disease in domestic poultry and spreads directly from poultry to zzso species such as zzso zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time zzso for rapid detection of H5N1 influenza A zzso The selected zzso and various labeled zzso zzso reporter zzso corresponding to M, zzso and zzso were used in a single step multiplex real-time zzso to simultaneously detect triple fluorescent zzso In order to validate the method, 75 clinical specimens infected with H5N1 isolated from both poultry and zzso as well as various specimens of other zzso and zzso from other viral pathogens of poultry and human were zzso The results showed that the multiplex real-time zzso zzso can be applied to detect virus suspensions of H5N1 influenza A virus from a wide host range and demonstrated the sensitivity of the zzso amounted to approximately zzso In conclusion, the highlights of this particular method lie in its zzso specificity and sensitivity thus rendering it feasible and effective for large-scale screening at times of H5N1 influenza A virus zzso
