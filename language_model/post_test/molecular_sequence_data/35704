High resolution X-ray zzso has been used to determine the modes of binding to zzso of a series of different zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso The interactions displayed by such zzso illustrate interactions that are presumed to occur between the zzso and its zzso during zzso The zzso analysis, together with model building, suggest a detailed zzso mechanism of action for zzso and, by zzso other zinc zzso such as zzso A and the zzso converting zzso Analysis of a series of zzso which are presumed to be zzso zzso has shown that chemically similar zzso can adopt dissimilar modes of zzso These different zzso provide a rationalization for large differences in the zzso of binding that are observed for these zzso zzso with zzso as a test case suggest that knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of an zzso or zzso will greatly facilitate the rational design of drugs directed at such zzso
