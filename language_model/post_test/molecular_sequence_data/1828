zzso is one of three members of the zzso family of zzso proteins that have been shown to be involved in various gene expression pathways including the control of zzso zzso We employed a zzso screen to identify proteins that interact with human zzso The zzso interacting proteins were the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso bound to an zzso sequence in zzso targeting it for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso were not targeted for degradation by zzso However a double zzso acid substitution of mouse zzso that mimics the human zzso site brought mouse zzso under in zzso control of zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso for alternative zzso activity we showed that human zzso like its zzso zzso can influence zzso site choice and that human, but not zzso zzso alternative zzso is modulated by zzso Western blots of protein from zzso germ cells indicated that zzso protein expression zzso in zzso In zzso zzso is zzso with zzso during zzso but, in humans, zzso is only strongly expressed after zzso Comparative sequence analysis showed zzso zzso degradation of zzso has evolved in the zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso down regulation of alternative zzso may be an important zzso difference between otherwise highly zzso zzso zzso
