We isolated and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso highly zzso to other zzso zzso A dramatic increase of zzso zzso zzso levels was observed after heat shock of whole animals in all zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for transient expression in carp cells and in zzso zzso zzso The entire isolated regulatory region zzso was able to mediate heat shock zzso expression of the reporter zzso with no preference for a particular zzso Our studies represent the first zzso analysis of a zzso promoter from fish, revealing a powerful tool to direct controlled, zzso gene expression in zzso
