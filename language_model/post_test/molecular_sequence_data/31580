zzso are zzso zzso lipids produced by many zzso as cell membrane zzso The structural variations of composite zzso or zzso zzso produced by various bacterial zzso make them potentially useful molecular zzso of bacterial communities and zzso processes in both modern and ancient zzso Building on previous work suggesting that organisms in zzso environments are important contributors to zzso production in the marine water column and that there may be zzso roles for zzso specific to these zzso this study investigated the relationship between trends in zzso structural diversity and abundance and the genetic diversity of zzso producers for the first time in a zzso environment of the Eastern Tropical North zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated far greater genetic diversity than would be predicted by examining zzso structural diversity alone and that greater zzso genetic diversity exists in the marine environment than is represented by cultured representatives and most marine zzso In addition, the genetic relationships in this data set suggest zzso environments as potential zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, structural analysis of zzso showed that an zzso of the commonly observed zzso zzso may be linked to a producer that is more abundant in zzso zzso zzso of this study increase the known diversity of zzso producers and provide a detailed zzso with implications for the role of zzso in modern bacteria, as well as the evolutionary history of zzso zzso both of which are important considerations for future interpretations of the marine zzso zzso
