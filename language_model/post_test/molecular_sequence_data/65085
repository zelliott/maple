To understand the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso activates zzso in a tissue specific fashion, we isolated zzso binding protein zzso by performing zzso zzso screening with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein and its zzso is zzso zzso The in zzso interaction of zzso with zzso was demonstrated by zzso pull-down zzso and this interaction was enhanced by zzso In addition, zzso also bound to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the DNA binding domain and the hinge region of zzso There are two zzso binding regions on zzso The binding of zzso region at zzso to zzso is increased by zzso while the binding of zzso region at zzso is not affected by zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was further confirmed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso experiment demonstrated that zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso
