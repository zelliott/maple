Many cellular structures are assembled from networks of zzso zzso and the architecture of these networks depends on the mechanism by which the filaments are zzso Several classes of proteins are known to assemble new zzso including the zzso complex, which creates zzso filament networks, and zzso which creates zzso zzso We find that zzso a zzso protein first identified as a zzso zzso of zzso combines these two zzso activities by both zzso zzso and assembling filaments directly using a zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso expression enhance zzso whereas loss of zzso slows cell zzso When slowly zzso zzso cells are differentiated into highly zzso zzso cells, zzso moves from the nucleus to the zzso and is concentrated at the leading zzso Thus, zzso represents a new class of zzso zzso assembly factor whose activity is zzso at least in part, by zzso in the zzso
