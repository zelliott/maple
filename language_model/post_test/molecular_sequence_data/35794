We have identified two zzso zzso zzso DNA molecules from zzso zzso that zzso to the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have shown that one of these molecules encodes the 51 zzso zzso zzso protein while the other appears to zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso Although this zzso clearly differs in sequence from the zzso zzso zzso the two proteins share extensive zzso acid sequence identity with each other and with the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In all three proteins zzso of the zzso acids are zzso while zzso are zzso The most extended regions of sequence conservation map within the zzso zzso this section has been shown to comprise the zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that some of the zzso zzso acids may be involved in DNA recognition and zzso The gene zzso the zzso protein zzso contains two zzso one of these zzso is only 24 zzso in zzso This is the smallest zzso zzso reported to zzso
