zzso is the largest and arguably the most zzso complex zzso in the family zzso zzso relationships within zzso were zzso using sequence data from the zzso DNA zzso zzso and nuclear zzso DNA ITS regions to test previous hypotheses of zzso zzso explain distribution patterns, reconstruct ancestral zzso features, and zzso the evolutionary processes that gave rise to this zzso zzso In total, 157 zzso representing 118 species of zzso 15 species of zzso (including the zzso zzso that was recently reduced to zzso and the zzso zzso were analyzed using maximum zzso and zzso zzso Both separate and simultaneous analyses of zzso and nuclear data sets were carried out because of the prevalence of zzso and hybrids within the zzso zzso is confirmed as zzso and is divided into two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The first zzso includes all examined species from the Old World zzso Europe, and zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso includes all examined species from the New World zzso Central and South America, and zzso zzso called the zzso World zzso zzso zzso plus the aforementioned Old World species that fall at the base of this zzso Most zzso and zzso divisions previously erected on the basis of zzso are not zzso Within the zzso World zzso zzso group, six zzso are well supported in analyses of zzso and combined zzso and nuclear data zzso the relationships among these zzso however, are zzso These zzso are designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso American zzso zzso American zzso and zzso Members of each zzso share similar geographical zzso and/or zzso or ecological zzso Evidence from branch lengths and low sequence divergence estimates suggests a rapid radiation at the base of each of these zzso Conflict between zzso and nuclear data sets is weak, but the disagreements found are suggestive that hybrid zzso in zzso might have been a cause, but also a consequence, of the different rapid zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso and its two zzso originated from western Mediterranean ancestors and that the zzso distribution of the zzso is explained by several zzso events, including one trans-Atlantic zzso In general, these zzso coincide with the zzso observed, suggesting that they played key roles in the diversification of the zzso The evolution of zzso combines a history of long distance zzso rapid zzso and zzso culminating in the zzso complexity observed today in the zzso
