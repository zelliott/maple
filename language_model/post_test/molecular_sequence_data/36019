The method of time averaging of distance restraints in molecular dynamics simulations is applied to zzso in order to demonstrate the improved sampling properties of this method compared to conventional distance zzso Two zzso regions, zzso type II and zzso are seen during MD runs at a simulation temperature of 500 K, while in simulations with conventional distance zzso no zzso transitions could be observed for temperatures up to 1000 zzso
