zzso zzso zzso is a zzso bacterial toxin that targets DNA zzso the bacterial zzso that introduces zzso into zzso The site and mode of action of zzso on zzso are zzso We review what is currently known about zzso interactions and zzso approaches to understanding its mode of action that involve modification of the zzso We describe experiments in which treatment of the toxin at high pH leads to the zzso of two zzso zzso to zzso The modified toxin was found to be inactive in zzso and in zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are essential for zzso Following on from these studies we have used molecular zzso to suggest a zzso structure for zzso zzso We discuss the implications of this model for zzso action and investigate the possibility that it binds metal zzso
