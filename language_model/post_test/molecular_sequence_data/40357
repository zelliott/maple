A bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a zzso sample of the Southern Ocean off zzso The strain was zzso and zzso and contained zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the major zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The major polar lipids were zzso and zzso The zzso content was 68 zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, the nearest zzso zzso of strain zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso With these zzso strain zzso exhibited zzso zzso values of 36, 21, 12 and zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso analysis, zzso characteristics and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species of zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
