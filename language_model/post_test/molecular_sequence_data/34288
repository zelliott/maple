Type I zzso zzso are important zzso for innate immunity against viruses and zzso Sixteen human type I zzso zzso signal through the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso yet they can evoke markedly different zzso zzso The crystal structures of two human type I zzso zzso signaling complexes containing zzso and zzso reveal recognition modes and zzso zzso that are unique among the zzso zzso zzso but zzso between different type I zzso zzso zzso is enabled by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso interactions that zzso the relative zzso zzso in an apparent zzso zzso zzso mechanism that zzso biological zzso zzso differences between zzso are linked to their respective zzso recognition zzso in concert with a zzso zzso change in zzso that collectively control signal initiation and complex stability, ultimately regulating differential zzso zzso profiles, zzso zzso rates, and downstream gene expression zzso
