Although zzso at zzso and zzso has been found in numerous studies of a variety of zzso in almost all cases the zzso methodology that was used could detect only a single site of zzso For the extensively studied case of reduced bovine zzso A zzso zzso only zzso zzso has been demonstrated zzso although one study found three zzso zzso Here top down tandem mass zzso shows that zzso zzso is extensive before zzso and zzso zzso these are more than half zzso before zzso zzso and its zzso is extensive before that at zzso is zzso Except for the initial zzso site, these large zzso differences correlate poorly with neighboring zzso acid identities and instead indicate residual zzso effects despite the strongly zzso media that were zzso zzso at zzso could enhance that at zzso and these enhance that at zzso This success in the zzso zzso of zzso in a 14 zzso protein mixture, despite the minimal 1 Da zzso zzso zzso change in the molecular mass, is further evidence of the broad zzso of the top down zzso methodology for characterization of protein zzso zzso
