We previously identified a zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso which zzso the assembly of zzso complement membrane attack complexes and we designate it as zzso standing for zzso zzso restriction zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from its coding base sequence resembles that of T cell zzso zzso most conspicuously in zzso zzso 10 out of 11 of which occupy identical positions in an overall sequence zzso of zzso Furthermore, proliferation of human T cells was zzso by zzso zzso to zzso
