zzso methods for zzso zzso zzso are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by zzso zzso and the zzso size limitations of in zzso DNA zzso As demonstrated here, the combined use of zzso zzso and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of zzso size and DNA sequence zzso First, a zzso marker is zzso with synthetic zzso attaching zzso zzso target zzso for zzso zzso and an arbitrary restriction site absent in the zzso zzso The resulting cassette is zzso with zzso plasmids in zzso zzso coli zzso Following isolation of zzso zzso linear zzso DNA replaces the cassette and introduces the desired zzso in a second zzso zzso zzso Upon selective zzso of parental plasmids and zzso a 38% zzso efficiency was achieved using a synthetic zzso zzso to cure a zzso deletion within zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used with similar efficiency to zzso mouse zzso zzso 9 and 76 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
