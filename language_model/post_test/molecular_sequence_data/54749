We cloned the genes zzso the two distinct zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were classified as alkaline zzso and neutral zzso zzso zzso modeling suggested that zzso and polar zzso acid zzso located on the surface stabilize protein structure in the presence of relatively high zzso zzso
