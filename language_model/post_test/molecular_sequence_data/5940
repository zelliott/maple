The sequences responsible for S zzso induction of the human zzso zzso zzso gene have been mapped to a small region that contains putative zzso binding zzso We have analyzed zzso interactions at the zzso promoter during cell cycle progression in human zzso using an in zzso zzso zzso We found 14 protein binding sites that were occupied in zzso All of the sites (among them two zzso zzso boxes and several zzso zzso bound zzso factors zzso throughout the cell cycle, zzso none of the factor binding was cell zzso An zzso site located between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the major zzso start site was protected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This cell zzso protection of zzso sequences in the zzso promoter differs from the zzso binding of zzso complexes observed for genes in which the zzso sites function as zzso elements zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso A comparison of several genes containing zzso motifs indicates that zzso sites located in proximity to the zzso initiation site zzso to zzso in zzso promoters predominantly function as zzso zzso while in other genes zzso bound zzso complexes located further upstream mediate zzso presumably in conjunction with a functional zzso zzso
