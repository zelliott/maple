The origin of the body plan of our own zzso zzso is one of the most fascinating questions in evolutionary zzso Yet, after more than a century of debate, the evolutionary origins of the neural tube and zzso remain zzso Here we examine the development of the zzso nerve zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and find shared gene expression patterns between zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso zzso of the zzso tube and the zzso expresses zzso zzso and it seems likely that zzso zzso cells can receive the zzso Our data suggest that the zzso functions as an organizer to pattern the zzso zzso cord, similar to the relationship between the zzso and neural tube in zzso We propose that the origin of the core genetic mechanisms for the development of the zzso and the neural tube date back to the last common zzso zzso
