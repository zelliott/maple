The zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso C virus zzso zzso 1 is thought to interact with several cellular zzso including the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso region zzso zzso and other regions, could be linked to zzso zzso Thus, the entire zzso sequence of 27 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in relation to the clinical response to zzso The zzso zzso protein presented a low zzso with some specific variable zzso zzso analysis between zzso and zzso zzso identified 5 regions in zzso 2 of them inside the zzso and another around the variable 3 zzso However, using the zzso growth suppression zzso no interaction was found between 5 resistant zzso zzso proteins and zzso Some zzso acid changes of the zzso protein of zzso zzso seemed to relate to zzso resistance independently of the zzso zzso
