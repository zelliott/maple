Using genetic zzso analysis we identified seven zzso genes for the zzso of zzso in different zzso strains of zzso zzso Four laboratory strains zzso zzso zzso zzso contained only the zzso gene and a wild strain zzso zzso had only the zzso zzso Another wild strain zzso zzso contained five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and identified by zzso with zzso parents zzso zzso A cloned zzso gene was used as a probe to investigate the physical structure and zzso location of the zzso gene family and to check the segregation of zzso genes from CBS zzso in six complete zzso zzso and Southern zzso analyses showed that all seven genes are physically very zzso By zzso we found that all seven genes are located on different zzso zzso on zzso II as shown previously by zzso et zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso on XVI, zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso zzso analysis of the segregation of zzso genes from strain CBS zzso gave results identical to those from the genetic zzso The zzso in the physical structure of this zzso gene family suggests that the zzso zzso have evolved by zzso of an ancestral gene to specific locations within the zzso
