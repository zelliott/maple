The zzso gene zzso the zzso domain zzso 1 zzso a member of a small zzso of zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in zzso zzso and cell zzso The zzso zzso domain is responsible for the binding of the zzso zzso As the human zzso the rat zzso gene consists of 17 zzso and is located in the major zzso complex, the zzso complex in zzso A novel zzso zzso transcript of zzso zzso is described here which is expressed specifically in the zzso germ cells of the rat zzso The zzso 1 to 5 are missing in this transcript and the putative protein would lack the zzso domain and parts of the stalk zzso The expression level of both, the full-length zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso zzso transcript, is dependent on the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso carried by zzso and zzso rats, the zzso zzso zzso transcript is completely zzso This might be explained by the lack of four zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which appear to contribute to a zzso binding site in zzso 5 of the zzso gene in the presumed zzso alternative promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, two novel zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene were found that give rise to further alternative zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso transcript is not only expressed in a cell zzso manner in zzso germ cells but also controlled by the zzso zzso
