The sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso region of potato virus S zzso has been determined from cloned zzso The sequence obtained contains six open reading frames zzso zzso proteins of Mr zzso Mr zzso Mr zzso Mr zzso Mr zzso and at least Mr zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso has been confirmed to be that of the viral coat protein zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso was obtained from plasmids which were isolated by colony zzso with a specific zzso zzso to zzso and the expression of coat protein fusion products was verified by Western blots of bacterial cell zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of a 70 zzso acid portion from the central region of the zzso coat protein was 59% identical to the analogous region of potato virus zzso In addition, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed significant sequence zzso with the similarly sized zzso from a number of zzso The partial zzso zzso product was zzso with the zzso portion of the viral zzso proteins of potato virus X and white zzso mosaic zzso
