zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have undergone structural and functional diversification during evolution and play crucial roles in cell division and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to highly zzso regions of sequence within the motor domain were used in a zzso chain reaction to isolate five new members zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso from a mouse brain zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso and zzso are expressed mainly in neural zzso that zzso and zzso are expressed primarily in zzso zzso and cell lines, and that zzso is apparently zzso To zzso the organization of genes zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso and to explore the potential associations of these genes with classical mouse zzso or human genetic diseases, these new genes as well as genes zzso the previously reported zzso and zzso zzso were mapped to mouse zzso by using an zzso zzso panel of zzso from The Jackson zzso The data indicate that the gene zzso is present in three copies in the mouse zzso on zzso 13 zzso 10 zzso and 17 zzso The gene zzso is present in two copies on zzso 7 zzso and 1 zzso The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are each single zzso and map to zzso 11, 2, 12, 15, and 8, zzso
