A systematic method for designing discriminating protein sequence fingerprints is zzso The approach used is zzso and diagnostic performance is evaluated in terms of the relative abilities of sequences to match with individual elements of the zzso The method allows complete protein folds to be characterized in terms of a number of separate zzso without the requirement to define specific intervals between them, and is described here with reference to the derivation of a fingerprint for zzso zzso this comprises the seven zzso regions shown by protein chemistry approaches to be zzso The fingerprint is zzso diagnostic of all sequences of this type in the database in which it was derived (the zzso composite sequence database, version zzso and has continued to perform well on subsequent database zzso identifying 240 receptors in zzso zzso are compared with a commonly used pattern template for this class of zzso The investigation suggests that discriminating power is improved in the fingerprint approach because the recognition of individual features is made mutually zzso Furthermore, by avoiding the definition of predetermined feature zzso members of protein families possessing all or only part of the fingerprint may be zzso
