zzso DNA repair zzso is the principal zzso responsible for the removal of zzso zzso bases from the zzso and restoration of the original zzso Key components of the zzso zzso are DNA zzso zzso that recognize zzso bases in the zzso and catalyze their zzso One major class of such zzso zzso also catalyze zzso of the DNA backbone following base zzso Recent studies indicate that the zzso and zzso functions of these zzso are mechanistically unified through a common zzso zzso on the zzso which acts as both the zzso that zzso the zzso base and an electron sink that zzso DNA strand zzso through zzso zzso zzso elimination zzso The identity of this critical zzso zzso has not been rigorously established for any member of a zzso of zzso zzso 

Here, we report the identification of the zzso zzso of the human zzso DNA zzso zzso a human zzso zzso protein that repairs the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We employed zzso sequencing of an zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso DNA to identify directly the zzso zzso of zzso as the zzso group of zzso In addition, we observed that the zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso can be functionally rescued by zzso with zzso which functionally replaces the zzso zzso by generating a zzso 

This study provides the first direct identification of the zzso zzso for any DNA zzso belonging to the zzso zzso members of which are characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso The critical zzso zzso identified here is zzso in all members of the zzso zzso that exhibit robust zzso zzso The ability to trigger the zzso activity of the zzso zzso of zzso by treatment with the chemical zzso zzso may permit snapshots to be taken of the zzso acting on its zzso and could represent a novel strategy for conditional zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso
