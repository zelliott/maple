Spinal muscular zzso is an zzso zzso neurodegenerative disease of childhood, resulting from deletion or zzso of the survival motor zzso ( zzso ) gene on zzso zzso zzso exists as part of a 300 zzso zzso complex, incorporating several proteins critically required in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso render zzso defective in this role, the specific zzso zzso degenerative zzso seen in the disease remains zzso Here we demonstrate the isolation from mouse brain of the zzso zzso of a recently identified novel zzso zzso of the DEAD box family, zzso and its direct and specific binding of zzso Previous work has shown that zzso binds viral proteins known to interact with a cellular zzso factor to zzso gene zzso We suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso is further evidence for a role for zzso in zzso regulation and that zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso genes essential in zzso zzso
