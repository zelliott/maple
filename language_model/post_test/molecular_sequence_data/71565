zzso zzso has zzso sex zzso the X and Y zzso The Y zzso which is thought to carry the male determining zzso was isolated by zzso laser zzso and amplified by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso suppression of the amplified Y zzso DNA in the presence of female zzso DNA as a competitor showed that the zzso Y zzso DNA did not specifically zzso to the Y zzso but zzso to all zzso This result suggests that the Y zzso does not contain Y zzso repetitive zzso A repetitive sequence in the zzso Y zzso zzso was isolated while screening repetitive sequences in the amplified Y zzso Part of the zzso sequence shared a similarity to that of zzso which was isolated from zzso X zzso Since zzso in zzso zzso analysis with zzso demonstrated that zzso was localized at the ends of the zzso zzso may be a zzso repetitive zzso Regarding the sex zzso zzso was detected at both ends of the X zzso and at one end near the zzso region of the Y zzso The different zzso of zzso on the sex zzso provides a clue to the problem of how the sex zzso arose from zzso
