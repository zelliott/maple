Although zzso zzso isolated from milk of various zzso exhibit a close structural relationship, they show zzso binding to zzso To define the specificity of recognition of human zzso bovine zzso and zzso zzso zzso by human zzso cells, we zzso the binding of the three proteins to a zzso derived from human zzso cell line zzso We observed that zzso and zzso interact with two types of binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso was recognized only by the lowest affinity binding sites with a lower number of binding zzso Using zzso deleted human zzso zzso we found that the sequence zzso is mainly responsible for the interactions with zzso zzso zzso sites on the surface of zzso cells were further identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the presence of the sequence zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso provides an insight into why the interaction of zzso with cell zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso and why binding of these zzso species differs from that of zzso zzso
