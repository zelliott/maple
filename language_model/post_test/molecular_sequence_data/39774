zzso proteins play an important role in cellular zzso However, their analysis by mass zzso often is hindered by their zzso and/or low zzso In this article, we present a method for the mass zzso analysis of membrane proteins based on the isolation of the resident zzso isolation of the proteins by gel zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso With this method, we have achieved zzso sequence coverage for the membrane proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso isolated from rat liver zzso outer zzso including the zzso zzso of these integral membrane zzso This high sequence coverage allowed the identification of the zzso of the proteins under zzso This methodology provides a targeted approach for examining membrane proteins in zzso
