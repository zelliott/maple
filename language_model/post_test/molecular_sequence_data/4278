The zzso protein is essential for synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso are deficient in a zzso activity zzso in zzso The zzso protein is the product of the second gene of an zzso and it has been shown to span the zzso zzso The zzso protein comprises zzso zzso acids and is poorly expressed as observed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso We have zzso measured the zzso organization of zzso within the membrane by construction of zzso to zzso as a zzso Analysis of 51 different zzso zzso suggested that the zzso protein crosses the zzso membrane eight times, with the N and C zzso in the zzso Moreover, a zzso domain is present in the zzso between the second and third zzso zzso It was deduced from the measurement of the zzso zzso activity of truncated or fused zzso proteins that almost all the zzso zzso are necessary for this zzso The model of the zzso protein in the membrane suggests that this protein could be directly involved in the zzso of nascent zzso chains to the zzso zzso
