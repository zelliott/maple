The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso these two proteins are structurally similar to zzso zzso in which the zzso is embedded in a zzso zzso The zzso in both zzso proteins form zzso zzso links to two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso states of the zzso zzso are identical with those of the corresponding native zzso zzso unfolding zzso in zzso zzso solutions confirm that native zzso zzso is more stable than the corresponding state of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
