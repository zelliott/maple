We determined the prevalence of zzso in two major functional zzso of the zzso repeat zzso 2 gene zzso in Belgian Parkinson's disease zzso patients zzso of which zzso were familial zzso zzso Ten patients were zzso for five different zzso zzso zzso of whom six carried the same zzso zzso zzso All six zzso carriers were familial zzso patients explaining zzso of familial zzso in the Belgian patient zzso Moreover, they shared a common disease zzso of 21 consecutive markers in a region of zzso zzso suggesting that they are distant descendants of a single common zzso zzso zzso carriers had typical zzso zzso with zzso as the most common presenting zzso Their age at onset was highly variable and ranged from 39 to 73 years, suggesting the influence of zzso zzso The remaining four patients were zzso each for a novel zzso zzso located in the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso nature of these zzso remains to be determined, though we have genetic evidence that at least some represent rare but benign zzso rather than zzso zzso The latter observation indicates that zzso is needed in diagnostic testing of zzso in zzso zzso zzso data should zzso a conclusion on the zzso nature of some zzso that have not been zzso linked to zzso
