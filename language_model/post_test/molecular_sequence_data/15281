zzso variation in zzso is rarely examined in the field of ancient DNA zzso due to the low quantity of nuclear DNA in the fossil record together with the lack of characterized nuclear markers in extinct zzso zzso sequencing platforms provide a new zzso technology capable of generating up to 1 zzso per run as short zzso read zzso zzso data were generated from the fossil bone of an extinct New Zealand zzso zzso zzso We identified numerous short tandem repeat zzso zzso and here present the successful isolation and characterization of one zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to flank this locus amplified all three zzso species tested zzso The presented method proved to be a fast and efficient way of identifying zzso markers in ancient DNA templates and, depending on zzso preservation, has the potential of enabling high-resolution population genetic studies of extinct zzso As sequence read lengths of the zzso platforms and its competitors zzso the zzso and zzso zzso increase, this approach will become increasingly powerful in identifying zzso in extinct (and zzso organisms, and will afford new opportunities to study past zzso and extinction zzso
