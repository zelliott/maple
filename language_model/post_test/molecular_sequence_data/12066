Race 1 of zzso zzso zzso makes a zzso zzso zzso that is necessary for its zzso on certain zzso of zzso The synthesis of zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso is absent from other races of zzso and from other species of zzso Four other unrelated zzso zzso make zzso peptides closely related to zzso raising the possibility that the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have moved between these zzso by horizontal gene zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed based on several highly zzso zzso acid zzso motifs common to known zzso zzso and used to amplify zzso sequences from different zzso zzso products representing zzso genes from zzso zzso which makes the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso which makes the analog zzso and zzso zzso which makes the unrelated zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Their sequences are more related to zzso than to other cloned zzso but the percent zzso identity is not consistent with very recent horizontal movement of these zzso
