We have identified a novel family of zzso nuclear pore complex zzso Three individual members of this family, zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated and then characterized by a combination of molecular zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cells, we found that the binding of a zzso zzso zzso recognizing this family was predominantly at the nuclear pore zzso Furthermore, the tagging of zzso with a unique zzso enabled the zzso of this protein to the nuclear pore complex by both zzso and electron zzso DNA sequence analysis has shown that the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso share repeated zzso motifs separated from each other by zzso zzso zzso and zzso rich zzso All three proteins lack a repetitive domain found in the two precisely described zzso nuclear pore complex zzso Only zzso is essential for cell zzso zzso cells grow very slowly and are temperature sensitive, whereas the lack of zzso has no zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso over their entire zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso are both flanked by a zzso zzso gene and a zzso element suggesting that they may have arisen by gene zzso We propose that zzso of pore complex proteins can be defined by their characteristic combinations of different modular zzso
