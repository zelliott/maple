zzso catalyze zzso zzso bond zzso and occupy many diverse roles across all zzso of zzso Here we present evidence that an zzso zzso zzso has been recruited to specialized roles in the human malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundant in two zzso compartments in asexual zzso zzso that is, the food zzso where the zzso of host zzso takes place, and the zzso A unique zzso extension contributes to the observed dual targeting by providing a signal zzso and putative alternate translation initiation zzso zzso exists as two major zzso a nuclear zzso species and a processed species consisting of a complex of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is both stable and active at the zzso pH of the food zzso zzso zzso of zzso kinetic parameters for both zzso and unmodified zzso zzso over the pH range zzso reveals that zzso is relatively insensitive to zzso whereas zzso increases at pH values below zzso At the pH of the food zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso remains zzso zzso with the kinetic data, the affinity of zzso competitive zzso is diminished at zzso zzso Together, these results support a zzso role for zzso in the food zzso and indicate the importance of evaluating the potency of zzso zzso at zzso relevant pH zzso They also suggest a second, distinct function for this zzso in the zzso zzso
