We used an expressed sequence tag and zzso zzso approach to initiate a study of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso libraries were constructed from zzso isolated from zzso and second zzso larvae from the Panama 95 zzso zzso 5,400 clones from each library were zzso from both the zzso and 3' directions using the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso larvae, adult zzso and adult zzso These four zzso samples were used for zzso zzso that produced approximately 300,000 independent zzso zzso were assembled into a database of assembled zzso and zzso and used to search public protein databases and zzso the zzso The full database consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso assembled from both the traditional expressed sequence tag zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the data led to the identification of several gene coding regions with possible roles in sex determination in the zzso This database will facilitate the design of zzso and other experiments to study zzso gene expression on a larger scale than previously zzso
