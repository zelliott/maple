zzso is a zzso global regulator that controls the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is zzso on zzso and zzso zzso by a protein zzso zzso zzso and contains an zzso zzso fold at its zzso portion and A- and zzso zzso motifs in the middle of the zzso The zzso domain, zzso of the zzso domain, contributed the binding of zzso to the upstream region of zzso that locates immediately 3' to zzso and encodes a zzso zzso No zzso of zzso in the zzso background and restoration of zzso zzso by zzso on a zzso in the same genetic background indicated that zzso served as a zzso zzso for zzso Interestingly, the zzso binding site overlapped the promoter of zzso as determined by zzso I protection zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain contributed distinct zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso greatly enhanced the zzso activity and modulated the zzso zzso The zzso ability of zzso was independent of the zzso zzso However, the zzso activity was essential for zzso zzso of zzso probably because the energy available from zzso zzso is required for the zzso of the closed complex between zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso competent open zzso Thus, zzso turns out to be a unique zzso factor, in that it is zzso in which zzso and zzso activities are physically zzso and the two functions are modulated by zzso on zzso and zzso zzso
