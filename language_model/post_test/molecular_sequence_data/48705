zzso zzso events are hypothesized as key mechanisms underlying the origin of zzso diversity and evolutionary zzso The diverse and zzso lineage of zzso zzso is a renowned example of this scenario, because of the zzso zzso zzso Gene families, generated by this and other gene zzso events, have been previously found to play a role in the evolution and development of innovations in zzso zzso - a prime model system to study the genetic basis of rapid zzso adaptation and evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso genes are particularly interesting candidate genes for evolutionary zzso such as the zzso jaw apparatus and the zzso fin zzso Here we study the zzso repertoire in 23 East African zzso zzso to determine the rate of evolution and the signatures of selection zzso 

Four intact zzso clusters were retrieved from zzso draft zzso zzso analyses of these eight zzso zzso in ten zzso species, followed by an in-depth analysis of 23 East African zzso species, show that there is disparity in the rates of evolution of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the fastest evolving zzso zzso while zzso and zzso evolved more zzso zzso analyses of the zzso substitution rate ratios indicate that zzso zzso and zzso evolved under zzso selection, while signs of positive selection were found for zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in particular, is shaped by differential selection pressures and rates of evolution after gene zzso Although the divergence of the zzso zzso are putative signs of new or altered functions, comparisons with available expression patterns indicate that the three zzso zzso under strong zzso selection, zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed at high levels in the zzso zzso jaw and zzso zzso The zzso zzso emerge as excellent candidate genes for the development of evolutionary innovations in zzso although further functional analyses are necessary to zzso their respective zzso
