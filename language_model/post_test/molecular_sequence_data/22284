zzso zzso are members of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso that metabolize a variety of zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that efficient zzso zzso zzso the extreme sensitivity of poultry, specifically zzso to the toxic effects of the zzso zzso B1 zzso Using zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso we amplified from turkey liver zzso a full-length zzso zzso zzso predicted to be zzso zzso acids with zzso sequence identity to a zzso from chicken zzso A truncated construct of the turkey zzso gene with 29 zzso acids deleted from the zzso zzso region was cloned and zzso expressed in zzso zzso The expressed protein from zzso coli zzso had a zzso spectrum typical of zzso and it zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was completely inhibited by zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso either slightly inhibited this activity or not at zzso zzso oxidized zzso to form two zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because of the importance of zzso and zzso in the toxicity of zzso we conclude that this zzso probably plays some role in the well-known hypersensitivity of zzso to zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso cloned and zzso from zzso the species in which the toxicity of zzso was first zzso
