zzso of zzso cassette zzso zzso C1 zzso to the zzso membrane of polarized cells is crucial for export of a variety of cellular zzso however, the mechanism regulating zzso targeting of the zzso is poorly zzso Here we describe identification of a zzso targeting signal in the first zzso loop domain zzso of human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequences from zzso to zzso revealed that zzso possesses a characteristic zzso zzso which is comprised of a cluster of zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso This characteristic sequence is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso and is positioned at a site that is structurally equivalent to the zzso targeting signal previously described in zzso zzso scanning zzso of this sequence in full-length human zzso showed that both zzso and zzso zzso were required for zzso targeting of zzso in polarized zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso motif within the zzso is a zzso targeting zzso of zzso
