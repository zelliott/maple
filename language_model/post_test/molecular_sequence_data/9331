We investigated the presence of zzso zzso zzso in three Mexican aquatic systems to evaluate the prevalence with the distribution of zzso zzso Key zzso parameters of the water samples were determined to find correlations with the zzso zzso We used zzso sequence analysis zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments to determine their zzso zzso zzso were recovered from water distribution systems and reclaimed water from the Mexico City Metropolitan Area zzso The isolated species were associated with a temperature of zzso and pH zzso The zzso analysis showed that eight of the 14 different zzso strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One strain was tentatively identified as zzso zzso zzso and another strain was related to zzso zzso zzso All zzso species identified in the water distribution system were also detected in the reclaimed water, but some species from the reclaimed water were not found in the water distribution zzso Two of the identified species found in the reclaimed water, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are considered important human opportunistic zzso
