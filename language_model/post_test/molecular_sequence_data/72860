zzso of zzso DNA can occur into many sites on target DNA with a wide variation in zzso One factor known to affect target site selection is zzso the viral protein required for the integration zzso In this study, zzso that measure the distribution and frequency of zzso DNA integration showed that zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso had different patterns of target site zzso The zzso domain involved in target site selection was mapped by analyzing the integration pattern of zzso proteins formed between zzso and zzso zzso and of deletion zzso of the two zzso zzso The results indicate that the domain responsible for target site selection resides in the central core region of zzso
