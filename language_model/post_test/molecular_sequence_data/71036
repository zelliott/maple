The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso using immobilized metal affinity zzso The zzso was characterized as a zzso with an approximate relative molecular mass of zzso a pH optimum of zzso and a high temperature optimum zzso degrees zzso The metal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were identified as zzso and atomic zzso analysis showed that the zzso contained zzso and zzso The activity of the zzso could be restored with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Heat zzso did not follow first order zzso but showed zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso as zzso zzso acid analysis showed that the zzso contains a high amount of small zzso acids like zzso zzso and zzso but a low concentration of zzso and no zzso at zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso fragments formed when insulin B chain was zzso showed zzso at the zzso terminal of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso acid at the zzso zzso side seems to increase the rate of zzso
