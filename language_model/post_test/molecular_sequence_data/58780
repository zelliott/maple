zzso zzso are characterized by the zzso zzso of an abnormal zzso of the cellular prion protein zzso named zzso prion protein zzso The pathological forms of this protein and its cellular precursor are not only expressed in the brain but also, at lower zzso in peripheral zzso We recently showed that a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso is toxic to zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso Our experiments were aimed at zzso whether zzso and other peptides corresponding to fragments of the zzso protein zzso from brains of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of stimulating circulating zzso Native zzso expression in human zzso zzso and zzso was first confirmed using zzso amplification of total zzso after reverse transcription, and zzso analysis of cell extracts with zzso zzso zzso but not the other zzso increased membrane zzso zzso zzso concentration and cell migration in circulating zzso and zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined by the zzso polarization technique, using zzso as a probe, 300 s after the addition of zzso to the cell suspension in the concentration range zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dependent manner in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso Both the increase in zzso concentration and the zzso production were partially sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration in a zzso zzso zzso manner and, at the highest concentration used, this migration was comparable with that zzso by zzso zzso zzso 8 or 10 zzso zzso zzso
