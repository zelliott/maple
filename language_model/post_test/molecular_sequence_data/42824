We have previously reported that zzso fetal zzso migrate into zzso collagen zzso to a significantly greater extent that do adult cells, zzso this difference in migratory zzso results from the zzso by fetal zzso of a zzso stimulating zzso zzso and zzso adult zzso retain responsiveness to zzso this providing the basis of a zzso for monitoring factor zzso Using a recently modified zzso zzso zzso isolated from fetal zzso zzso medium zzso as a single activity peak in the penultimate zzso Q zzso exchange zzso zzso Analysis of this material by zzso indicates that it consists of three zzso one with an apparent molecular mass of 119 zzso and a zzso with molecular masses of approximately 43 and 33 zzso zzso Our data suggest that the two proteins zzso the zzso result from the degradation of the larger zzso during the zzso zzso Both the 119 zzso species and lower molecular weight zzso stimulate zzso migration (with half zzso activity in the region of zzso zzso and contain a structural domain exhibiting significant zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fide preparations of zzso obtained by the limited zzso of plasma zzso also stimulate the migration of adult zzso in a similar zzso manner to that of zzso In spite of this zzso zzso and zzso differ in terms of a number of biological and zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso is a distinct gene product and not a zzso degradation zzso of zzso zzso stimulates the synthesis of a high molecular weight species of zzso acid zzso Our current data suggest that the observed effect of zzso on cell migration is actually a secondary consequence of the zzso of this zzso in the collagen zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso both in terms of its effects on cell migration and zzso zzso As zzso is present in wound fluid, we have suggested that the zzso of zzso activity by zzso may reflect the zzso interaction of these two zzso in the control of the wound healing zzso Our recent data indicate that discrete minority zzso of zzso zzso are also present at specific sites in the healthy adult and that these may undergo a transient and local expansion during wound zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
