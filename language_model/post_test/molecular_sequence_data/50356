The structures of five basic pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso molecules are compared to establish the extent and nature of the zzso zzso resulting from crystal packing zzso zzso is an ideal system to evaluate such factors because of the availability of high resolution X-ray models of five different zzso structures, each in a different crystal packing zzso zzso observed among the structures are found to be distributed throughout the zzso although the regions that display most zzso are associated with the loop structures zzso zzso and zzso The regions of structure that show the largest zzso zzso from the mean of the five packing motifs correlate well with the presence of zzso contacts in the crystal zzso For most of the molecules there is also a correspondence between a larger number of zzso contacts and systematically higher zzso although it is not apparent whether this is induced by the crystal contact or results from the fact that the contacts are made predominantly through surface zzso The zzso differences seen among the X-ray models constitute more than local shifts at the lattice contact surfaces, and in fact involve in some cases the making and breaking of zzso zzso The zzso of the differences among packing models are significantly larger than those usually associated with changes induced by zzso for zzso the structural differences at the site of zzso observed on removing an internal zzso from the zzso are significantly less than those associated with lattice contact zzso The crystal packing zzso are compared to representative structures of zzso generated during a zzso molecular dynamics zzso zzso This comparison shows a high level of correspondence between the protein flexibility indicated by the X-ray and MD zzso and specifically between those regions that are most zzso This suggests that the regions that show most zzso among the crystal packing models are not artifacts of zzso but rather represent true low-energy zzso that have been zzso selected by zzso zzso
