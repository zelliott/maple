In this study we gain insight into the structural and functional characterization of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso previously identified from the zzso medium of an zzso zzso cell culture at late stationary zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso in a zzso form and zzso processing at the level of a zzso region probably involved in protein membrane zzso Moreover, the zzso protein released into the medium was identified as a zzso form composed of two tightly associated fragments detachable only under strong zzso zzso The zzso site zzso seems be located on an exposed surface loop that is highly zzso in several three-dimensional zzso structures of zzso proteins from different zzso zzso and zzso properties of the zzso protein were virtually indistinguishable from those of the intact zzso Indeed, studies of the entire zzso expressed zzso protein owning the same N and C zzso of the zzso form supported these zzso Moreover, in the middle exponential growth phase, zzso was found as an intact cell zzso zzso Interestingly, the native zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso showing both zzso zzso and possibly originating from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the involvement of zzso in the recycling of zzso proteins was suggested to be a potential zzso zzso Finally, a new zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso and preliminarily zzso allowing the identification of a common zzso organization shared by all zzso zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso
