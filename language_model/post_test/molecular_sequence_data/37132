The high-resolution solution structure of a zzso circular zzso zzso zzso of the potent zzso protein zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso structure revealed that the observed loss in stability of zzso compared to the zzso protein is due to less favorable packing of several zzso at the zzso twofold axis that are responsible for holding the two halves of the zzso zzso In particular, the N and zzso zzso acid zzso exhibit zzso flexibility, resulting in fewer and less favorable contacts between zzso The important zzso and zzso network between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that was observed in zzso zzso is no longer zzso For instance, zzso and zzso are flexible and the zzso zzso is in a different zzso compared to the zzso zzso The stability loss amounts to approximately zzso and the mobility of the protein is evident by fast zzso zzso exchange throughout the zzso zzso of the single zzso zzso to zzso zzso did not substantially affect the stability of the zzso in contrast to the finding for zzso The binding of zzso type zzso to zzso was also zzso Similar to zzso two zzso sites were identified on the protein and the Man zzso linked zzso on the sugar were delineated as binding zzso Unlike in zzso the binding sites on zzso are structurally similar and exhibit comparable binding affinities for the respective zzso On the basis of the studies presented here and previous results on zzso binding to zzso we discuss a model for the interaction between zzso and zzso
