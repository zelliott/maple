zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the processing and presentation of zzso class zzso zzso zzso by catalyzing zzso bond zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso encodes a deduced protein of 242 zzso acids with a putative molecular weight of zzso zzso It contains typical features of zzso proteins including the signature sequence zzso zzso motif and other five zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso gene exhibited a similar zzso organization to human and mouse zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso derived from a common zzso with other zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso manner and obviously zzso in zzso and kidney after zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the immune response to bacteria challenge in zzso zzso
