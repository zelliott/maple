The zzso received by female zzso larvae determines their differentiation into queens or zzso In this study, we report the first molecular analysis of differences that occur between queens and workers during the zzso zzso zzso display experiments identified a clone that encodes for a gene that is zzso to the zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso analysis by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso throughout zzso development detected a higher level of expression of this gene in queen larvae than in worker zzso Analysis of two other genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso c zzso zzso zzso also showed differential expression of these two genes between queens and zzso In particular, the zzso c transcript is more abundant in queen larvae and throughout the metamorphosis of the zzso These results indicate that the higher respiratory rate previously documented in queen larvae is accomplished through a higher level of expression of both zzso and zzso genes for zzso zzso
