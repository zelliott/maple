This study aimed to isolate and characterize an indigenous zzso zzso named zzso and its zzso compounds active against three zzso zzso strains zzso zzso nontoxic zzso and standard zzso zzso The zzso isolated from Lake zzso near zzso City in China, was identified as zzso zzso based on its zzso characteristic features and zzso analysis by sequencing of zzso zzso zzso compounds produced by zzso showed strong zzso activity, and they were zzso and zzso with a molecular mass lower than 2 zzso Two zzso compounds were isolated and zzso from zzso zzso using zzso gel column zzso One of these was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso was unidentified by hybrid zzso zzso mass zzso coupled with a zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso The half zzso effective concentration zzso of zzso produced by zzso against zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso could play a role in controlling zzso zzso and its zzso compounds are also potentially useful for regulating zzso of the harmful zzso zzso
