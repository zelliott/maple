The crystal structure of zzso coli zzso I zzso I) reveals an zzso zzso fold consisting of a zzso core of six zzso and three zzso The overall architecture of the zzso zzso is very similar to the plant and zzso zzso zzso family members, but the perimeter surrounding the active site is characterized by structural elements specific for zzso zzso In the structure of zzso I in complex with a zzso zzso zzso we observe a zzso bound in the B2 base binding site and mixed binding of zzso and zzso in the B1 base binding zzso The active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with the zzso linkage only through a set of water zzso zzso forming the B2 base recognition site are well zzso among bacterial zzso and may generate limited base zzso On the other hand, the B1 binding zzso acquires true base zzso by combining zzso van der zzso contacts at its sides with a zzso zzso network at the zzso This B1 base recognition site is highly variable among bacterial sequences and the observed interactions are unique to zzso and a few close zzso
