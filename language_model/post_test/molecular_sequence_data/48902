zzso zzso is an infectious bacterial disease that causes morbidity and zzso especially in developing zzso Although its efficacy against zzso has displayed a high degree of zzso zzso in different trials, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as an important weapon for preventing zzso worldwide for over 80 zzso Because zzso proteins often play vital roles in the interaction between bacteria and host cells, the zzso of zzso is considered to be an attractive zzso of potential candidate zzso for the development of novel vaccines and diagnostic zzso In this study, we performed a zzso analysis of zzso culture zzso proteins using zzso and high-resolution zzso transform mass zzso In total, 239 proteins zzso unique zzso were identified, including 185 zzso proteins or zzso Furthermore, 17 novel protein products not zzso in the zzso database were detected and validated by means of zzso at the zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso start sites of 52 proteins were confirmed, and 22 proteins were validated through extension of the zzso start sites based on zzso zzso There are 103 zzso proteins that have not been reported in previous studies on zzso zzso zzso and are unique to our zzso The zzso characteristics of the zzso proteins were zzso Major components from the culture zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso and zzso family zzso are zzso some components represent potential zzso zzso in the zzso and cellular immune zzso
