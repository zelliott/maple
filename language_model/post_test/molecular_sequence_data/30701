Mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 3 have a restricted capacity for bone zzso and are severely deficient in mature zzso and zzso Both cell populations originate from a common zzso zzso As zzso mice are not cured by transplants of normal bone zzso cells, the defects in zzso mice may be associated with an abnormal zzso zzso rather than with an intrinsic zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the molecular and zzso basis of the defects caused by the zzso zzso we established primary zzso cell lines from zzso mice and tested the ability of these cell lines to support the proliferation of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso are defective in production of functional zzso zzso factor zzso although its zzso zzso zzso zzso is present at normal zzso This zzso in zzso production and the recent mapping of the zzso structural gene near zzso on zzso 3 suggest that zzso is a zzso within the zzso gene zzso We have zzso zzso complementary DNA prepared from zzso zzso and found a single base pair zzso in the coding region of the zzso gene that generates a stop zzso 21 base pairs zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is within the zzso coding region and we conclude that the pathological changes in this zzso result from the absence of zzso
