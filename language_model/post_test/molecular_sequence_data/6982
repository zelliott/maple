zzso zzso of T cells often requires signals delivered by the zzso of T cell zzso zzso and those resulting from zzso interaction between certain T cell surface accessory molecules and their respective counter receptors on zzso presenting zzso The molecular events underlying the zzso activity are still not understood zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso present on the surface of zzso B cells, which can provide zzso to resting T cells leading to a zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso and negligible amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and electron microscopic zzso data suggest that this zzso binds T cells, and the same can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso experiments point out that B3 shows up as a single prominent peak on reverse zzso performance liquid zzso runs as a single spot in reducing two-dimensional gel zzso and is a zzso The Western analysis indicate that it does not zzso with zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B7 suggesting the novelty of the zzso The internal zzso acid sequence of this zzso suggests that it does not belong to a known category of zzso B cell surface zzso
