To isolate zzso zzso bacteria that produce zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso from zzso acid zzso 

Mixed bacteria from zzso contents of a cow fed grain were enriched with zzso and zzso They produced more zzso zzso zzso than those that were not enriched (7 vs 2 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso had an abundance of large zzso that produced zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso produced the most zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing indicated that zzso was a strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while strains zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso production of zzso was first order with respect to cell concentration zzso zzso protein zzso but zzso were not first order with respect to zzso zzso 

Some zzso zzso strains produce significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso appears to cause milk fat depression in cattle fed diets supplemented with grain and zzso fatty zzso but zzso zzso bacteria that produced zzso zzso zzso from LA had not previously been zzso
