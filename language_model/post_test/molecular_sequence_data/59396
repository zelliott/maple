Several zzso zzso zzso strains were selected for their capacity to produce alkaline zzso Culture zzso of these strains showed optimal zzso activities between pH 8 and 9 and they were stable from pH 6 to pH zzso A zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned in zzso coli using zzso chain reaction zzso The cloned gene was present in a zzso zzso zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso The coding sequence showed an zzso frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso deduced from the zzso zzso permitted us to include it in family 5 (or zzso of the zzso zzso The complete zzso frame of zzso was cloned in the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso in which a protein of 39 zzso was obtained in the zzso however, no zzso activity was zzso A second construction in zzso allowed the production of a zzso protein located in the zzso space of zzso coli that had zzso zzso The protein produced has optimal activity at pH 7 and 50 degrees C and it retains more than zzso of its activity after incubation for 1 h at pH zzso
