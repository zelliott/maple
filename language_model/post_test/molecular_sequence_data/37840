Using a zzso zzso cloning strategy, we isolated previously five novel genes that were expressed abundantly by the zzso zzso cell zzso line zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso One of these genes zzso a unique, zzso zzso zzso termed zzso Here we report the characterization of a second novel gene that was also expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a type II zzso zzso of 209 zzso acids containing a single zzso recognition domain motif in the zzso zzso The expression pattern of this zzso termed zzso was almost indistinguishable from that for zzso that is, both were expressed abundantly at zzso and protein levels by the zzso DC line, but not by zzso lines, and both were detected in zzso and zzso as well as in skin resident DC zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso revealed multiple bands of zzso transcripts and proteins suggesting molecular zzso In fact, we isolated additional zzso clones zzso two zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that a full-length zzso zzso zzso is zzso by 6 zzso whereas truncated zzso zzso and zzso are produced by alternative zzso We propose that zzso and its zzso together with zzso represent a unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso
