The zzso zzso in proteins are known to play an important structural zzso Recently, the role of a zzso zzso in the middle of right-handed zzso segments of peptides has been the focus of zzso This role seems to be particularly important in the case of membrane proteins and in the tight packing of zzso zzso In the present study the right-handed zzso region of the zzso zzso and of zzso containing this group have been zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso from some proteins have been analyzed and energy zzso studies on some model fragments containing zzso in the right-handed zzso zzso have been carried out using flexible zzso The present calculations indicate that the right-handed zzso region of zzso space is an energetically favored region that can also accommodate zzso in longer segments of right-handed zzso This is achieved due to minor variations in some of the internal zzso zzso in the backbone parameters of zzso in the right-handed zzso lead to a zzso of about 23 degrees in the zzso zzso These zzso have been characterized and a set of standard values has been suggested for producing such a zzso These values can be used for model building and as starting points for further zzso zzso Previous energy zzso studies have been done using rigid zzso This may explain why the minimum for zzso in the right-handed zzso region has not been recognized thus zzso
