Alcohol zzso zzso is a key zzso for the production of zzso ethanol, and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso in extracts of several strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave conflicting molecular zzso A more coherent picture has emerged because of the following zzso zzso identification of zzso with different zzso zzso in these zzso zzso discovery of structurally zzso zzso zzso 3) in three zzso zzso zzso isolation of zzso with deficiencies in zzso production and restoration of zzso production with a cloned zzso zzso zzso and zzso resolution of various zzso zzso cultures into four zzso The three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have high sequence similarities to zzso of zzso zzso zzso 262 (formerly zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is profoundly affected by the pH of the zzso and the relative importance of zzso and zzso to zzso production may be zzso when zzso activities were measured at different pH zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and is highly zzso in zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are very similar between zzso zzso and the species represented by zzso zzso zzso 262 and zzso zzso The realization of such relationships will facilitate the zzso of the roles of different zzso because each type of zzso can now be studied in an zzso most amenable to experimental zzso
