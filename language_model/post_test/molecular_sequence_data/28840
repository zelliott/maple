The mechanisms that link zzso of zzso D virus zzso with clinical outcomes have not yet been zzso zzso variations are zzso distributed along the sequences of zzso delta zzso zzso Of these variations, the packaging signal at the zzso has a divergence of zzso between zzso I and zzso In this report, we address the issue of whether these high variations between zzso affect assembly efficiency of zzso particles and editing efficiency of zzso zzso package systems of zzso with expression plasmids of zzso B surface zzso and zzso or whole zzso of zzso consistently indicate that the package efficiency of zzso I zzso is higher than that of zzso zzso zzso swapping of zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso region plays a key role for the varied assembly zzso Also, the editing efficiency of zzso I zzso is higher than that of zzso zzso The zzso and structural changes surrounding the editing site may explain why zzso II zzso has a low zzso editing zzso The findings of in zzso assembly systems were further supported by the observations that patients infected with zzso II had significantly lower zzso zzso zzso levels, more favorable outcomes zzso zzso and a trend to have lower serum zzso zzso levels as compared with those infected with zzso I zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso II zzso zzso fewer viral particles than zzso I zzso does, which in turn may reduce the extent of infection of zzso and result in less severe zzso zzso
