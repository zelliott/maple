The development of specific agents against zzso requires an understanding of the zzso behavior of zzso peptides in different environments on the microscopic zzso We present extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso zzso B18 fusion zzso for several different zzso a zzso zzso mixture, pure water, zzso buffer containing 100 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso was studied as an isolated zzso in solution or at an zzso In the simulations, the zzso behavior of the zzso was found to strongly depend on the environment in agreement with experimental zzso Overall, large portions of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were least stable in pure water and most stable in the zzso mixture and the zzso zzso In all zzso the zzso zzso was most stable in the region around zzso zzso which are mainly zzso zzso zzso in water or buffer folded into structures containing zzso in agreement with data from circular zzso zzso In zzso the zzso content was larger than in water and zzso transitions were observed at elevated zzso zzso were formed by zzso zzso turns were formed by zzso zzso A few typical zzso that contain different zzso are zzso A B18 zzso in a zzso zzso placed in buffer in contact with vapor was spontaneously zzso to the zzso interface with its zzso side pointing toward the vapor zzso The zzso induced the formation of turns at positions zzso and zzso zzso in the region around zzso zzso zzso were parallel to the interface plane in agreement with data from zzso reflection zzso zzso
