A zzso in zzso gene expression in the mouse results in a syndrome that resembles human aging, with greatly shortened zzso zzso and defective zzso In an effort to find functional zzso zzso of zzso we zzso the gene and examined zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso from 16 zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso no sequence variation was found in any of the zzso or zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso we found 45 sequence zzso with six resulting in zzso acid zzso One zzso strain, zzso had four zzso acid zzso and higher levels of the membrane form and total zzso zzso In addition, the membrane to zzso zzso expression ratio was elevated in three zzso strains with zzso acid zzso Interestingly, zzso mice have longer zzso decreased zzso risk factors, and better hearing than almost all other mouse zzso
