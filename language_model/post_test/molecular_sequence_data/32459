Although structures of many zzso proteins have been zzso they fall into a limited number of zzso Here, we describe an approach that led to the finding of a novel zzso zzso Based on the behavior of Type II zzso gene complexes as mobile zzso our earlier work identified a restriction zzso zzso and its zzso modification zzso in zzso zzso through comparison of closely related zzso While the modification zzso was easily zzso zzso was predicted to have a novel zzso zzso We expressed zzso zzso in a zzso zzso translation system and determined its crystal zzso zzso turned out to adopt a novel protein zzso zzso zzso has a curved zzso zzso that forms a zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analyses have assigned it as the zzso zzso zzso Unlike most restriction zzso zzso zzso is able to cleave DNA in the absence of zzso These results demonstrate the value of zzso comparison and the zzso system in finding a novel zzso motif in mobile zzso and, in general, a novel protein fold in zzso transferred zzso
