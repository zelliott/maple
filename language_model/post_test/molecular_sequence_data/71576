Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a novel human zzso zzso underlying an zzso zzso zzso zzso deafness, zzso The same nonsense zzso was detected in four unrelated affected families of Lebanese zzso zzso is the second member of a zzso gene family related to zzso zzso zzso It encodes a predicted zzso protein (of zzso zzso with three C2 zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso and predicted structure of zzso the protein zzso by zzso suggest its involvement in zzso membrane zzso In the inner ear, the expression of the zzso mouse zzso mainly in the sensory hair cells, indicates that such a role could apply to synaptic zzso
