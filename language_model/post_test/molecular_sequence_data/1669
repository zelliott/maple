The zzso of zzso organisms is transcribed as the zzso zzso zzso and this precursor contains the following segments: zzso - zzso - zzso zzso - ITS 1 - zzso zzso - ITS 2 - zzso zzso - zzso In zzso the zzso sequences of the zzso precursor have been completely determined in only two species of zzso In the other zzso species investigated so far, only the short zzso sequences of some zzso fragments have been zzso We obtained a zzso clone containing the zzso precursor from the Japanese pond zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso was zzso zzso long and included the zzso of zzso zzso ITS 1, zzso zzso ITS 2, and a long portion of zzso zzso A comparison of zzso sequences among zzso the two species of zzso and human revealed the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and the complete zzso zzso were highly zzso among these four zzso zzso The regions corresponding to the stem and loop of the secondary structure in zzso zzso were zzso between zzso and zzso but the rate of zzso in the loop was higher than that in the zzso Many of the human loop regions had large insertions not seen in zzso zzso Two ITS regions had highly zzso sequences that made it difficult to compare the sequences not only between human and zzso but also between zzso and zzso zzso The short tracts in the ITS regions were strictly zzso between the two zzso species, and there was a corresponding sequence for zzso Our data on the zzso sequence of the zzso precursor from the Japanese pond zzso zzso zzso were used to examine the potential usefulness of the zzso genes and ITS regions for evolutionary studies on zzso because the zzso precursor contains both highly zzso regions and rapidly evolving zzso
