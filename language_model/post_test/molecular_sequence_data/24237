zzso zzso zzso lethal human central nervous system zzso zzso contain tumor zzso zzso zzso Although zzso class II molecules are frequently detected on zzso cells, suggesting that they may be capable of zzso zzso presentation to zzso T cells, deficiencies in zzso zzso zzso are associated with these zzso zzso We evaluated regulation of the zzso class II zzso zzso the key intermediate that controls class II zzso in zzso cells and tested whether zzso cells could process native zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and class II zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, as well as primary human zzso was directed by two zzso zzso zzso the promoter for zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso the promoter that directs zzso zzso expression in B zzso Both zzso and zzso directed zzso zzso in zzso in zzso and ex zzso in zzso primary zzso zzso We also demonstrate for the first time that zzso cells can process native zzso for presentation to zzso zzso class zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso cells can serve as zzso zzso zzso may be a key target to zzso zzso class II zzso which could augment zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
