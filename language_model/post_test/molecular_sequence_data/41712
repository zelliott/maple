zzso zzso affect a wide range of zzso processes in plants and compromised production or zzso of zzso causes severe growth zzso To identify new regulators of plant organ growth, we searched the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collection for zzso with altered organ size and isolated two zzso lines that display typical zzso deficient dwarf zzso The zzso of these lines, caused by an zzso of a putative zzso gene zzso zzso was partly rescued by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso levels are zzso for the growth of zzso zzso zzso Our transcript analysis further showed that zzso zzso leads to an elevated expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and a reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso a zzso response typical to low zzso zzso Taking the advantage of relatively high zzso zzso zzso in a mild zzso background, we found that zzso of zzso results in moderately reduced levels of zzso and zzso and a strong reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso zzso We tested a set of potential zzso in zzso for zzso expressed zzso and confirmed its zzso activity with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is expressed in various zzso but as reported for other genes involved in zzso zzso the zzso zzso did not display obvious growth zzso under standard growth zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso can modify zzso by zzso and that these properties might help modulating zzso zzso levels in zzso
