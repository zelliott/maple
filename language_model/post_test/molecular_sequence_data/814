The zzso are a family of zzso zzso associated with basement zzso elastic zzso and other zzso They are expressed in a variety of zzso Association with these zzso structures is zzso by their ability to interact with many zzso zzso zzso The seven members of the family are defined by the presence of two structural zzso a tandem repeat of zzso growth zzso zzso and a unique zzso zzso zzso They act not only as zzso bridges within the zzso zzso to form zzso structures, but also as zzso for cellular processes and tissue zzso These important functions of zzso in a wide range of biological processes have been shown in in zzso systems, gene knockout mice, and human genetic zzso In this review, we describe the structure and function of these proteins and discuss the implication of zzso in development and zzso
