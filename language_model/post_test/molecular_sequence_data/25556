Within the zzso of human zzso BK zzso there exists a zzso regulatory region toward the late region side of the origin of DNA zzso In most zzso strains isolated by viral culture, this regulatory region contains tandem repeats varying in zzso Recently, however, several laboratories isolated new zzso strains zzso as zzso zzso lacking such repeat zzso To examine the genetic relationship between zzso zzso a zzso tree was constructed for seven zzso zzso including three zzso zzso from DNA sequence data on the late zzso those for leader protein zzso and those for structural proteins zzso zzso and zzso For three strains data previously reported were used, whereas for the others sequences were determined in this zzso From total numbers of zzso zzso in each pair of zzso a zzso tree was constructed by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree obtained reveals that zzso strains containing the zzso regulatory region do not constitute a cluster of closely related strains and that these zzso together with those carrying the major part of the zzso regulatory region, are widespread in the zzso zzso This finding suggests that the basic structure of the zzso regulatory region has been zzso in the course of zzso zzso
