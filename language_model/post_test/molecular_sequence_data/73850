In rod and cone zzso cells, zzso of particulate zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso protein termed zzso that detects changes in zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso restored zzso sensitivity of native and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the affinity of zzso for zzso and accelerated zzso Using peptides derived from the zzso zzso we found that at least three regions, encompassing the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were likely involved in the interaction with zzso zzso of zzso to Ala zzso which abolished zzso and a 25 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso reduced zzso activity dramatically, while deletion of 10 zzso acids zzso reduced the specific activity by only approximately zzso and modified the zzso zzso At zzso M zzso in conditions that zzso native zzso zzso showed significant activity in the presence of zzso Native and all three zzso forms of zzso had similar affinities for zzso as demonstrated by gel zzso and the changes in zzso zzso All zzso bound to zzso zzso in a zzso manner, except zzso which was mostly zzso These findings suggest that the zzso region is important in zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso
