The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify specific segments of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso a major pathogen of zzso Three sets of zzso were used to produce zzso of zzso zzso and 959 base pairs zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated by testing clinically important strains of zzso including 21 strains of zzso zzso five strains each of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two strains each of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso DNA and biomass from pure cultures of each of these zzso were evaluated as templates in the zzso In addition, extracts of zzso zzso zzso of eight sheep zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso (four animals each) were also tested by the zzso using the three sets of zzso zzso DNA template of all zzso zzso strains produced zzso zzso of the expected size for all three primer zzso However, when biomass from pure cultures of zzso zzso or tissue extracts were used as templates, only the primer pair designed to produce the zzso zzso gave consistently positive zzso No positive results were obtained with any primer pair when zzso DNA or biomass from pure cultures of zzso zzso species were used as zzso zzso the zzso primer sets appear to be very specific for identifying zzso zzso in both cultures and zzso
