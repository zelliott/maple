The zzso zzso toxin zzso produced by some clinically important zzso bacterial species, is related to the family of zzso zzso Three zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso mode of action distinguish the zzso from others in this toxin zzso Crystal structures of several zzso zzso have provided a basis for predicting zzso interactions and zzso In addition, empirical studies have yielded significant insights into the in zzso interactions of the zzso zzso However, there are still critical gaps in information about the intoxication zzso In this study, a novel protein tagging technology was used to zzso the zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso A zzso motif was engineered in each zzso and in zzso with zzso in predicted functional zzso to permit detection with the zzso zzso hairpin binding zzso dye zzso zzso zzso imaging, in conjunction with zzso zzso was used to capture the locations of the individual zzso in cells intoxicated, under various conditions, with hybrid zzso Using this approach, we observed the zzso zzso The zzso zzso remains on the cell surface of zzso cells in association with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is exclusively in the zzso and, after longer exposure times, zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is present on the cell surface and, to a greater extent, in the zzso These observations suggest that zzso but not zzso functions as a zzso for zzso entry into zzso
