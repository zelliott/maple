Until very recently zzso zzso research and indeed zzso research in general has suffered because of the lack of critical zzso In terms of molecular studies of zzso zzso in particular have lagged behind other groups in this zzso This is in sharp contrast to the major advances achieved with molecular and genetic techniques in the study of embryonic development in zzso The aim of our studies has been to identify genes involved in the process of zzso and in particular neural zzso in different zzso zzso Our survey included the asteroid zzso zzso and provided evidence for the expression of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso nerve zzso Present evidence zzso 1) zzso expression is maintained in intact zzso nerve zzso and may be zzso during zzso 2) zzso expression may contribute to the zzso and/or cell proliferation process during zzso zzso From the zzso zzso zzso we have been successful in cloning a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso its expression during arm zzso Here, we discuss the importance of this family of growth factors in several regulatory zzso including maintaining the identity of zzso zzso cells or as a classic skeletal zzso zzso There is clearly substantial scope for future zzso research in the area of molecular biology and certain aspects are discussed in this zzso
