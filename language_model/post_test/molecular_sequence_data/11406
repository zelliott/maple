This paper presents kinetic and structural analyses of zzso material released during zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells incubated with sugar zzso zzso cells released 30 times more zzso material than metabolically zzso cells, zzso to the amount of zzso zzso zzso making this an amenable system for zzso Fifteen to zzso per cent of the zzso material released by zzso cells was zzso depending on the nature and amount of the zzso zzso The zzso released were recovered in the zzso and were exclusively zzso and zzso released from zzso thought to be facing the zzso In contrast, the structures found as neutral zzso material were similar to those attached to newly zzso zzso indicating that the zzso were subjected to the same processing zzso whether or not they were protein zzso zzso the zzso of the transfer to protein and the release of free neutral zzso were zzso suggesting that the same zzso was responsible for both zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the same zzso structure was transferred to protein and released as free zzso zzso zzso were found in both the zzso and the zzso however, zzso with one zzso zzso at the reducing end zzso were found exclusively in the zzso The major neutral zzso produced after 2 h of zzso zzso was zzso and it was found in the zzso
