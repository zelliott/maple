zzso identification of the zzso sites of zzso factors and other zzso proteins on the zzso is crucial to understanding their molecular interactions with zzso Here, we describe a new method: Genome zzso by zzso sequencing zzso which combines in zzso zzso I zzso of zzso DNA with zzso coupled with zzso zzso We have determined the in zzso binding sites of a zzso zzso global regulator, zzso using zzso This method shows that exact zzso zzso which were protected from in zzso zzso I zzso were resolved at a comparable resolution to that achieved by in zzso zzso I zzso and this was simply attained without the necessity of prediction by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso I zzso of the bacterial zzso resolved the closely positioned zzso sites, which had previously appeared as one peak in zzso and zzso zzso The high-resolution determination of zzso sites using zzso enabled us to identify zzso zzso motifs in zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, in a thousand binding sites with very zzso zzso single zzso motifs were also zzso Thus, zzso is a powerful method to zzso the molecular mechanism of target protein binding to its zzso DNA zzso
