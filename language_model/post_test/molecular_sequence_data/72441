zzso is an zzso 32 zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso whose structural motifs include a zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso a zzso zzso an zzso region and a consensus zzso site for zzso zzso In zzso zzso forms zzso and interacts specifically with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso during cell differentiation at approximately equivalent levels in all zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso results in altered cellular zzso impaired zzso migration, and zzso patterning of zzso and zzso cells, the major zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso and zzso expression zones are zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly decreases zzso gene expression and significantly increases the expression of zzso zzso Further, induced zzso of zzso cells into zzso cells is inhibited in zzso In light of these patterning zzso we suggest that the zzso protein zzso plays an important role in early cell fate decisions in zzso acting as a positive regulator of zzso differentiation and an inhibitor of zzso zzso
