The gene zzso rat zzso S zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso boxes upstream of the zzso zzso zzso and Shaw, zzso and contains regions that resemble those of other zzso responsive zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the rat zzso S gene has a potential zzso binding site zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso two potential zzso responsive elements zzso zzso et zzso zzso and a possible zzso zzso responsive element zzso and zzso zzso One of these potential zzso is adjacent to a potential zzso binding site, and another is typical of the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso In this report, we have identified three regions in the zzso region of the zzso S gene that are found in zzso zzso genes zzso et zzso 1992) with a zzso region located between zzso elements II and zzso zzso experiments described in this paper suggest that a zzso DNA zzso from the zzso S gene promoter region with zzso elements II and III, the zzso region, and a possible zzso responsive element contains a negative regulatory zzso In addition, our experiments suggest that the zzso region by itself is acting as a positive regulatory zzso
