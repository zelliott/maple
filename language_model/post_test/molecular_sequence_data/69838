To complement the recent discovery that zzso termination in zzso coli requires zzso protein in zzso we have tested the effect of zzso zzso protein on zzso termination in zzso With the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, and no other proteins than zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso factor, zzso causes a zzso shift in the terminated zzso zzso compared to the zzso generated by zzso zzso The presence of zzso also enhances zzso termination on partially defective zzso zzso zzso zzso We rule out explanations such as a change in the kinetic zzso between zzso and zzso zzso or a zzso increase in the affinity of zzso for zzso We also detect no difference in the zzso rate of zzso in the presence of zzso Even zzso with completely stalled and isolated zzso complexes indicate that zzso is able to effect the release of zzso with the assistance of zzso at points preceding the most zzso release sites observed in the absence of zzso Our observations support a model in which zzso acts as a component of the zzso complex, possibly interacting with both zzso and zzso zzso as it zzso accessibility to the nascent zzso
