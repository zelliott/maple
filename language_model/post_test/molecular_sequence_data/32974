Our previous results have shown that some zzso of V zzso domain in human zzso virus type 2 zzso are essential not only for zzso protein degradation but also for promoting virus zzso Here, we demonstrated that the virus growth of these zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso V proteins were improved in zzso cell zzso expressing the zzso V zzso but not in the cells zzso expressing zzso zzso we identified the region of the V protein that is essential for its zzso and for complex formation with zzso zzso We also identified a host zzso zzso involved in zzso and efficient budding of several enveloped viruses as an interacting partner of the V and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso suppressed virus zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of the V protein plays an important role in virus zzso
