The zzso zzso zzso is activated upon binding of testosterone or zzso and exerts regulatory effects on gene expression in zzso target zzso To study zzso regulation of the rat zzso gene itself, the zzso zzso region of this gene was cloned from a zzso library and the promoter was zzso zzso protection analysis showed two major zzso start sites, located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the translation initiation zzso The area surrounding these start sites was cloned in both zzso in a zzso reporter zzso Upon zzso of the zzso into zzso cells, part of the promoter zzso zzso in an zzso manner, but the full promoter showed a higher and zzso zzso In the zzso gene zzso zzso initiated from the same positions as in the native zzso zzso analysis showed that the promoter of the rat zzso gene lacks typical zzso and zzso box zzso but one zzso site is located at about 60 zzso upstream from the major start site of zzso Other possible promoter elements are zzso sequences at positions zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso resembling zzso of the zzso element zzso Furthermore, a zzso stretch containing a total of 8 zzso elements and similar to sequences that are present in several other zzso zzso is located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the major start site of zzso
