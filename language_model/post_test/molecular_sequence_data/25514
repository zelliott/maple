zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step of the zzso zzso pathway, a reaction that generates zzso We have isolated zzso the zzso zzso gene that encodes zzso and identified its transcript and zzso start zzso zzso of zzso appears not to be zzso consistent with its zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso appear to grow zzso but are more sensitive than wild type to zzso agents that presumably reduce the level of zzso This suggests that zzso has a major role in zzso production in zzso zzso of zzso expression appears normal in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso is highly similar to the sequence of the zzso human, and rat zzso except near its N zzso where the zzso and zzso sequences diverge from that of human and zzso
