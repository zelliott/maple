zzso of zzso zzso pumps that zzso zzso zzso contain eight or nine zzso ranging in size from 116 to 17 zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso critical for zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the major zzso zzso zzso and 70 zzso of the zzso zzso pump are unknown from animal zzso We report here the complete sequence of the zzso zzso derived from a human kidney zzso clone and partial sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of bovine zzso The zzso acid sequences of both proteins strongly resemble the sequences of the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso pumps of zzso plants, and zzso The zzso zzso is believed to use a zzso zzso to zzso zzso Thus, a common ancestral protein has given rise to a zzso pump that zzso zzso in one zzso and zzso it in another and is highly zzso from zzso to zzso The same pump appears to mediate the zzso of zzso zzso including coated zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso such as zzso
