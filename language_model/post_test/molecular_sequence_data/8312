zzso infection is highly prevalent in zzso There are, however, few published reports on the envelope sequence of the prevailing zzso strains in the zzso The authors selected an isolate of zzso from zzso and characterize the envelope zzso zzso in zzso A sample of zzso blood was taken from a 36-year-old zzso female volunteer from zzso classified as WHO stage IV, exhibiting clinical AIDS and pulmonary zzso Nine clones containing complete zzso genes were derived from the isolate and were designated zzso The sequences have been submitted to the Los Alamos Database under zzso numbers zzso zzso clones had a stop zzso in their C1 regions and were not studied zzso The viral sequences from the zzso closely reflect that circulating in the patient's peripheral blood zzso zzso That finding is in striking contrast to the rapid adaptation and evolution of zzso zzso onto human T cell zzso The ability to isolate and culture virus in zzso without the rapid appearance and selection of zzso is important, because it enables relevant observations to be made with regard to the zzso recognition of the virus by the zzso The zzso study found that although zzso clustered with the D zzso it contained unique sequences noticeably divergent from other characterized zzso of the D zzso Further work to investigate and clarify the relationship between zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is of the utmost importance if molecular epidemiology is to be of value in designing an effective AIDS zzso
