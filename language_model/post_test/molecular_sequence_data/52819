The zzso zzso complex consists of four different component zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the complete sequence of reactions as its prosthetic group zzso zzso interacts successively with the three other components of the complex and zzso a cycle of reductive zzso zzso transfer and electron zzso With the aim to understand the interaction between the zzso and its different partners, we have previously determined the crystal structure of the oxidized and zzso forms of the zzso In the present study, we have zzso the zzso in its reduced state and the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso has been zzso in zzso coli and zzso from inclusion bodies in an active zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso and the structure has been determined by X-ray zzso This first crystal structure of a plant zzso zzso is similar to other known zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso in its reduced form has been determined and compared to the structure of the other forms of the zzso It is zzso to the structure of the oxidized zzso In contrast with zzso zzso where the loaded zzso arm was locked into a cavity of the zzso the reduced zzso arm appeared freely exposed to the zzso Such a freedom is required to allow its targeting inside the hollow active site of zzso Our results strongly suggest that a direct interaction between the zzso and zzso is not necessary for the zzso of the reduced zzso arm bound to the zzso This hypothesis is supported by zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by small angle X-ray scattering experiments reported zzso
