zzso and zzso strategies are two commonly used methods for mass zzso zzso based protein zzso each method has its own advantages and zzso In this chapter, we describe an integrated zzso and bottom-up approach facilitated by concurrent liquid zzso zzso zzso analysis and fraction collection for comprehensive zzso intact protein zzso The approach employs a high resolution reversed phase zzso zzso separation coupled with zzso zzso fraction collection and concurrent zzso zzso with a high field (12 zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso zzso zzso profiles and tentative modified protein identification are made using detected intact protein mass in conjunction with bottom-up protein identifications from the zzso zzso and analysis of corresponding zzso zzso zzso proteins of biological interest are incorporated into a target zzso list for subsequent zzso zzso fragmentation that uses an zzso of the original collected zzso zzso an zzso of which was also used for bottom-up zzso
