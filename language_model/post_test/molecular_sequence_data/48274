zzso zzso zzso zzso form the most zzso zzso of the plant zzso More than zzso of vascular plants are susceptible to colonization by the zzso zzso from the order zzso and profit significantly by the zzso exchange between plant and zzso However, knowledge of the biology of these zzso still remains elusive because of their zzso zzso and, up to now, zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso stages and the zzso communication between AM zzso and other soil zzso are, particularly, zzso Here, we study these aspects by means of a molecular approach to monitor changes in the gene expression of the fungus zzso zzso zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to induce specific increases in zzso growth as well as changes in expression of zzso a highly zzso gene zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso We determined the gene structure and studied its expression in response to zzso at two time zzso The results show that the fungus is able to change its gene expression in response to stimuli other than the zzso
