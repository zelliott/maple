The zzso zzso is a large zzso complex consisting of the zzso zzso and at least 43 zzso A database search, initiated in an effort to discover additional zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso and essential zzso zzso protein zzso as one such zzso The zzso zzso zzso a domain of unknown function, displays limited sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso is the only clearly identifiable zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso is zzso and interacts with components of the zzso zzso we examined its role in zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso resulted in slowed zzso Northern analysis of zzso revealed an zzso zzso maturation zzso at sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed association with zzso zzso and with zzso and with components of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif zzso zzso resulted in no zzso zzso or zzso growth zzso zzso that this motif is zzso for zzso zzso A zzso zzso screen of zzso against other zzso zzso components revealed several interacting zzso including zzso zzso and zzso thereby identifying the first interactions among the different zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain is required and sufficient for the interaction of zzso with zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso zzso component that, along with zzso forms the first identified interactions among the different zzso zzso zzso
