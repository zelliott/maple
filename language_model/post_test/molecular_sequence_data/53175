The 72 zzso coli strains of the zzso collection were examined for resistance to 10 different zzso agents including zzso zzso mercury, zzso and zzso zzso strains were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested, and nearly zzso zzso of zzso were resistant to two or zzso Several of the resistance zzso were shown to be carried on zzso zzso The collection was screened for the presence of the three classes of zzso and for the zzso zzso which is generally associated with class 1 zzso The four strains found to carry a class 1 zzso also had zzso mercury zzso One of the zzso zzso a novel zzso resistance zzso zzso with an zzso site (or zzso zzso nearly identical to the zzso site associated with the zzso gene cassette found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Lambert, zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso The conservation of associated zzso sites among unrelated resistance zzso is similar to arrangements found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Webb, and zzso zzso Science zzso 1998) and supports the hypothesis that resistance zzso are picked up from zzso pools and independently assembled from unrelated genes and related zzso zzso
