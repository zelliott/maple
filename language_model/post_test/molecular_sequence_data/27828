zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso in the zzso 4 region of the native form of the zzso domain of zzso zzso A cassette zzso method was used to introduce changes within this region, and zzso candidates were isolated and zzso The resulting data allow the identification of zzso side chains that are critical zzso of zzso zzso Four of these side chains are on the surface of the zzso domain and probably contact the zzso zzso These contact positions were then zzso individually, and the zzso binding zzso of a large number of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Taken together, the zzso data allow a functional map of the recognition surface to be constructed and the physical nature of some of the specific interactions that stabilize the zzso complex to be zzso
