The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in human zzso cancer zzso To zzso the regulatory mechanism of its gene zzso we have determined the zzso organization of the human zzso zzso The gene comprises at least four zzso and spans about 20 zzso The coding region is located in zzso 3 and zzso To determine the zzso initiation sites, zzso amplification of zzso ends analysis was performed using zzso obtained from four human zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso We found four zzso initiation sites and alternative usage of six zzso corresponding to the zzso region in cancer zzso On the other hand, the only transcript beginning at zzso zzso was observed in normal zzso Using reverse zzso analysis, we confirmed that all of the zzso zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso are used as a zzso initiation site in cancer cells, whereas only zzso zzso and zzso mostly zzso are zzso in normal zzso zzso the protein production from the zzso zzso with different zzso we found that all the transcripts examined produced the identical zzso These observations suggest that the zzso usage of zzso initiation sites flanked with zzso is involved in the zzso expression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, this gene was assigned to human zzso zzso by means of zzso in zzso zzso
