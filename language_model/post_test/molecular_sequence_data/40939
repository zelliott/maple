With the intensive application of zzso in greenhouse production of vegetables and the production of medicinal herbs, there is an increasing need to find a way to zzso zzso zzso A bacterial stain capable of utilizing zzso as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from zzso The isolate was designated zzso and identified as a member of zzso zzso based on its colony zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso zzso About zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso of zzso and zzso in mineral zzso medium were removed by the isolate zzso after incubation for zzso zzso The optimal pH value for the isolate zzso to degrade zzso was zzso The degradation rate of zzso by the isolate zzso was found to increase slightly with zzso According to the zzso detected and identified in the present study, it was proposed that zzso was first converted to zzso which was then transformed to zzso zzso zzso and finally to carbon zzso The results indicate that the isolate zzso is a new bacterial resource for zzso zzso and might be used for zzso of sites heavily contaminated by zzso and its zzso
