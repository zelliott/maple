zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso converts zzso zzso into zzso thus ensuring the zzso stability of zzso Two related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the strand exchange reaction at a 30 zzso zzso core zzso In addition, two accessory zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso at zzso These two accessory proteins are thought to act at 180 zzso of accessory sequences adjacent to the zzso zzso core to ensure that zzso only occurs between directly repeated sites on the same zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso interact directly with zzso forming a complex in which the accessory sequences of two zzso sites are zzso approximately three times in a right-handed zzso We present a model for this synaptic complex, and propose that strand exchange can only occur after the formation of this zzso
