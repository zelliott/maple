zzso responsive element binding proteins zzso are members of a larger family of zzso factors that are specific to plants and play an important role in enhancing plant tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought, cold, and high zzso To gain a better understanding of this type of zzso we reported here a novel zzso protein which functioned as a zzso of zzso in tobacco leaf zzso zzso was zzso localized to the nucleus of onion zzso cells and bound specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso zzso analysis showed that expression of the zzso gene was mainly induced under zzso stresses conditions such as drought and high zzso These findings suggest that zzso can function as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso gene expression and provides an important insight into the molecular adaptation mechanisms of environmental stresses in cotton zzso
