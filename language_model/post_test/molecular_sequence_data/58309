In zzso cells the zzso protein zzso associates with other proteins known as zzso factors zzso to form zzso zzso factors important for gene expression by all three nuclear zzso zzso Computer searching of the complete zzso zzso zzso revealed five previously unidentified zzso genes with significant sequence similarity to known human and zzso zzso zzso II zzso Each of these genes is essential for zzso A sixth essential gene zzso has previously been noted to be similar to human zzso zzso experiments show that all six proteins are associated with zzso demonstrating that they are true zzso Furthermore, these proteins are present in complexes containing the zzso zzso indicating that they are components of zzso Based on their predicted molecular zzso these genes have been designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is significantly larger than its higher zzso zzso and deletion analysis demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso domain is sufficient and necessary to support zzso
