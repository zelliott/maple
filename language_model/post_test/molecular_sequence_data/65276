zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a promising target in some zzso pathogens and is effective in zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso has previously been determined at zzso A zzso By modification of the zzso zzso the previously determined structure of zzso zzso zzso has been improved to zzso A resolution with R and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso This high-resolution structure makes it possible to analyze the interactions between the zzso in detail and to reveal the structurally zzso regions that are responsible for zzso recognition during the formation of the active zzso Details of the mode of zzso binding and of the flexible regions that may be involved in zzso recognition and binding are also zzso
