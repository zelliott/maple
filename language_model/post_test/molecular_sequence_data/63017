The zzso of zzso zzso encountered solely in Mt zzso in China's zzso Province, exhibits zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso inactive zzso zzso referred to as zzso is highly zzso and displays high zzso and zzso zzso zzso possesses a molecular weight of zzso consists of 121 zzso zzso zzso by seven zzso bridges and shares high sequence zzso with zzso from the zzso related Asian zzso However, zzso possesses an zzso zzso at position 49 instead of a zzso thereby suggesting a secondary zzso substitution which results in a zzso inactive zzso We have determined the first crystal structure of zzso an zzso from zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso resolution, which represents a novel member of zzso zzso zzso In this structure, unlike the zzso zzso the zzso is well ordered and an unexpected zzso state of the putative zzso loop due to the flip of zzso towards the bulk zzso is zzso The orientation of the zzso side chain results in a similar binding mode to that observed in the zzso zzso however, the zzso group is zzso by zzso oxygen atoms of the putative zzso loop, whereas the zzso atom of zzso is zzso as a result of the different zzso adopted by the putative zzso zzso
