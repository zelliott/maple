The expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene involved in C4 photosynthesis is regulated in a highly organized zzso Nuclear factors interacting with DNA fragments from the zzso zzso region (from positions zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso of the zzso gene were identified by gel shift zzso Among the three kinds of such nuclear proteins zzso zzso and zzso found in the extract from zzso leaves, zzso and zzso which were distinguishable by their zzso behavior, zzso with the same motif of the repeated sequence zzso in the region from zzso to zzso zzso zzso with the region from zzso to zzso in which two copies of another kind of repeated sequence zzso zzso All of these nuclear factors were found only in the extracts from green and zzso leaves but not in those from stems and zzso The relative content of zzso and zzso was almost equal in green and zzso leaves, while that of zzso was significantly higher in zzso leaves than green zzso It is suggested that expression of the zzso gene is controlled by the combined effects of these nuclear zzso
