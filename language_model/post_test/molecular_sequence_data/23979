Plants are constantly exposed to attack by an array of diverse pathogens but lack a zzso zzso immune zzso In spite of this, natural plant populations do not often suffer destructive disease zzso zzso how zzso diversity within plant genes that function to detect pathogens zzso zzso zzso changing structures of pathogen genes required for host invasion zzso zzso is critical to our understanding of the dynamics of natural plant zzso The zzso resistance gene is the most zzso gene analyzed to date in the model plant zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso resistance, and we show that it too exhibits extreme levels of zzso acid zzso Evidence of diversifying selection visible in both components suggests that the host and pathogen may be locked in a zzso conflict at these zzso where attempts to evade host resistance by the pathogen are matched by the development of new detection capabilities by the zzso
