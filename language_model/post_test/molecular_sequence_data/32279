Two zzso were zzso from quail egg white by zzso exchange column zzso and analyzed for zzso acid zzso The zzso showed the same pH optimum profile for zzso activity with broad pH zzso zzso zzso but had difference in mobility on zzso The zzso zzso showed one or two zzso present in individual egg zzso The established zzso acid sequence of quail egg white zzso A zzso zzso was the same as quail zzso reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of quail zzso zzso zzso zzso 66, zzso and had six zzso acid zzso at position 3 zzso to zzso 19 zzso to zzso 21 zzso to zzso 102 zzso to zzso 103 zzso to zzso and 121 zzso to zzso compared to zzso egg white zzso zzso A and zzso B showed one zzso at the position 21, zzso replaced by zzso plus an zzso of zzso between position 20 and 21, being the first report that zzso B had 130 zzso zzso The zzso acid differences between two zzso did not seem to affect zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso egg white zzso but caused them to separate well from each other by zzso exchange zzso
