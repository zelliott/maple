zzso the product of the zzso gene zzso resistance gene 1), is an zzso zzso pump associated with treatment failure in some zzso zzso Its expression is regulated during normal zzso zzso although its function in normal zzso cells is zzso To identify cellular factors that regulate the expression of zzso in zzso cells, we characterized the zzso and zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that an zzso promoter construct containing zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso response equal to that of a construct containing zzso zzso to zzso zzso induced zzso binding to the zzso promoter sequences over a time course which correlated with increased zzso promoter activity and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter region contains an overlapping zzso zzso The zzso element was localized to the overlapping zzso site by using a synthetic reporter zzso A zzso in this site that inhibited zzso protein binding blocked the zzso zzso promoter response to zzso The expression of a dominant negative zzso protein also blocked the zzso response of the zzso promoter zzso Finally, the expression of zzso was sufficient to activate a construct containing tandem zzso promoter zzso zzso These data suggest a role for zzso in modulating zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso
