zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso connected to zzso breakdown of the aromatic plant zzso zzso and related zzso However, this zzso zzso has been described in only a few species of zzso zzso zzso The white rot zzso zzso zzso 79 readily produces a versatile set of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Here we describe zzso and primary structure of two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso characterization for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the gene depicted zzso zzso and zzso code for zzso and zzso long proteins beginning with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Translated zzso and zzso share the highest protein sequence identity zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with the one deduced zzso from zzso zzso The three zzso zzso zzso sequences form a coherent zzso zzso which is further supported by similarities within gene organization interrupted by zzso To find out the significance of zzso upon zzso growth on natural zzso such as wood, we studied zzso gene expression on hardwood zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All the zzso genes were expressed on wood with predominance of zzso transcript zzso in particular on spruce wood chips, where also zzso expression of the multiple lip genes was zzso
