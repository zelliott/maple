Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso malaria zzso in zzso province, along the border between Thailand and zzso have become resistant to zzso zzso To better define the epidemiology of zzso zzso populations and to assess the risk of the possible spread of these zzso outside zzso a new zzso tool named zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on active molecular detection of zzso zzso carriers was introduced in zzso zzso zzso surveys using zzso were carried out in 20 out of 109 villages in zzso zzso zzso detected as zzso zzso carriers were treated with zzso combination plus a single dose of zzso if the patient was zzso zzso Interviews were conducted to elicit history of cross-border travel that might contribute to the spread of zzso zzso After directly observed treatment, patients were followed up and zzso on day 7 and day zzso Among 6931 individuals screened, prevalence of zzso zzso carriers was less than zzso of whom zzso were zzso Only zzso of the individuals had a travel history or plans to go outside zzso with none of those tested being positive for zzso zzso zzso analysis, using 2010 routine surveillance data, showed significant differences in the prevalence of zzso carriers discovered by zzso between villages classified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on malaria zzso zzso All positive individuals treated and zzso until day 28 were zzso No zzso zzso related to zzso resistance was zzso zzso is a potentially useful tool to zzso treat and track clusters of zzso carriers of zzso zzso along with providing valuable zzso information regarding cross-border movements of potential malaria zzso carriers and zzso gene zzso
