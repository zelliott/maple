The unique pattern of class I major zzso complex zzso zzso expression seen at the human zzso interface is thought to be vital for fetal zzso The lack of zzso class I and II zzso zzso on zzso the only fetal tissue in direct contact with the mother, is likely to be at least a part of the explanation of fetal evasion of zzso zzso The recent observation that the zzso class I zzso zzso is present on certain zzso of zzso suggests that this zzso zzso may have a role in the zzso immune zzso Although no experimental evidence exists to support a particular function for zzso reasoned speculation about the possible roles of this zzso class I zzso is zzso Data derived from sequence analysis, analysis of zzso expression patterns, analysis of the zzso expression patterns of other zzso and analysis of zzso zzso zzso and function provide insight into the possible functions of zzso at the zzso interface and are considered zzso
