The complete zzso acid sequence and zzso bridge location of zzso one of the zzso proteins isolated from the snake zzso of zzso zzso have been determined by analysis of peptides derived from zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by gel zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso has the zzso sequence of less than zzso and consists of a total of 202 zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso analysis indicates the presence of another zzso which lacks the zzso zzso making 201 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso Three zzso bridges of zzso link zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso contains a segment which is similar to the zzso sequences found in zzso and several zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso with limited zzso zzso However, there is no other significant sequence zzso with zzso except for the zzso zzso
