We report the isolation of an alternatively spliced human zzso membrane zzso zzso transcript which is zzso in human zzso The cloning of this transcript is an indication for the zzso expression of zzso membrane proteins and implicates the possibility of multiple functions for the protein products of the zzso zzso as well as other zzso membrane zzso The new transcript, designated zzso results from the alternative zzso of the last zzso zzso 9, the alternative form of which is approximately zzso zzso in zzso The resulting protein is identical in length to the previously reported zzso zzso 410 zzso acids including the leader zzso This final zzso which encodes the last zzso zzso acids of the zzso domain, the 24 zzso acid zzso spanning region, and an zzso zzso acid zzso tail, shows complete conservation of the zzso zzso targeting signal with regard to its position relative to the zzso spanning region and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso electron zzso studies verified zzso of this alternative gene product to the zzso zzso
