The properties of full-length and zzso zzso were studied in intermediate zzso zzso cells to define regions of zzso that are essential for initiation of filament zzso A full-length rat zzso gene zzso into zzso cells resulted in filament formation, consistent with the close structural relationship of zzso to other type III intermediate filament proteins that readily form zzso zzso of full-length rat zzso is initiated predominantly at the second of two zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso abolished its ability to form filaments in zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of the entire zzso tail of zzso did not affect its ability to form zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that, of the intermediate filament proteins that are expressed in mature zzso only zzso and zzso are capable of making zzso intermediate zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso tail of zzso generally do not interfere with filament network zzso
