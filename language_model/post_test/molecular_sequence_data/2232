The zzso gene product is required for entering the S phase of the cell cycle in zzso zzso It has been isolated on zzso plasmids by selection for zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso activity is carried on a zzso zzso DNA fragment, as revealed by deletion zzso Northern zzso shows that the size of the zzso zzso is about zzso zzso A Southern zzso of zzso zzso which were separated by the field inversion gel zzso method indicates that the isolated DNA zzso is derived from zzso zzso The locus from which the clone was derived was marked by integration with a nutritional marker and found by zzso mapping to zzso with zzso Thus, we conclude that we have isolated the authentic zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene has revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein with Mr zzso zzso There are five potential zzso zzso sites and a highly zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso Although computer surveys indicate overall sequence zzso between zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they may not be functionally equivalent as evaluated by the zzso zzso
