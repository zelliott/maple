zzso is one of only two mouse zzso that exhibit the most severe form of neural tube zzso zzso termed zzso In this disorder, almost the entire brain and spinal zzso is affected, zzso to a failure to initiate neural tube zzso zzso is a significant cause of zzso in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly zzso Here, we report the identification of the gene zzso in zzso zzso using a zzso cloning zzso This zzso zzso encodes a member of the zzso protein family related to zzso zzso with 16 zzso rich repeats and four zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a single base zzso that creates a frame shift and leads to premature termination of the zzso zzso We report the expression pattern of zzso during embryonic and fetal development, and show that zzso expression closely mirrors the zzso defects observed in zzso zzso In addition, zzso genetically interacts with the zzso zzso and we reveal overlapping expression of zzso with zzso the gene zzso in zzso The identification of the zzso gene further defines the nature of the genetic zzso required for the initiation of neural tube closure and provides an important new candidate that may be implicated in the zzso of human zzso
