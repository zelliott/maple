We have shown that the binding free energy calculation from molecular dynamics can be adapted successfully to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The binding free energy obtained is in good agreement with the available experimental data for eight zzso derivatives including zzso and zzso zzso The calculations showed that the zzso energies between zzso and zzso were important in determining the relative affinities of the zzso to the zzso with an average binding free energy of about -5 zzso The average structures of the eight complexes suggest that zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso and zzso by hydrogen bonding and with zzso by zzso interactions that are essential for the activities of zzso zzso It can therefore be expected that the method provides a reliable tool for the investigation of new zzso zzso This finding could significantly benefit the future design of zzso zzso
