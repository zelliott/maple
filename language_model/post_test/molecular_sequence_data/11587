zzso zzso a zzso protein with zzso to zzso has been found to be expressed at different levels in zzso cells and in other zzso zzso We recently reported the expression of the gene in human zzso zzso cell lines, and suggested a possible role of zzso in cell zzso To extend our findings, we investigated the expression of the gene in zzso cells induced to differentiate by zzso acid zzso using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso experiments employing zzso cells showed that zzso zzso appeared 2 h after zzso treatment, long before the cells were blocked in the zzso zzso phase and before the zzso structures outgrew from the cell zzso This suggests the involvement of the gene in the early phase of cell zzso Furthermore, we investigated zzso expression in a series of fresh zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso pattern of zzso zzso although zzso seemed to be expressed more frequently in cases with a zzso Shimada zzso We also studied the expression of the protein in zzso fixed and zzso embedded zzso by using a specific zzso zzso The protein was detected in zzso cells which zzso a more mature zzso type, and in nerve zzso whereas zzso were zzso The tissue that expressed zzso protein showed a zzso differentiation and, unlike zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso
