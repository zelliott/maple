An in zzso zzso zzso was used to compare the capacity of the zzso zzso zzso (which displays a remarkably high zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso initiation of the zzso major late promoter linked to a zzso transcribed DNA zzso Both drugs inhibit zzso zzso synthesis in a zzso way, and the drug zzso required to inhibit zzso initiation are zzso However, in this study zzso was around 15 times more efficient at zzso zzso initiation when used with an zzso promoter containing an upstream zzso binding site under experimental conditions in which the zzso protein acted as a zzso in zzso The differences in the ability of each drug to inhibit zzso initiation were related to the competition between zzso and the drugs for the same binding zzso zzso of zzso as low as 60 zzso could inhibit the zzso zzso initiation in zzso In contrast, the concentration of zzso required to inhibit zzso zzso by 50% was almost the same as the concentration required to inhibit zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso at zzso zzso from its putative binding site was confirmed using gel zzso and zzso zzso These results are the first unequivocal example of a direct effect of an zzso on activated zzso zzso
