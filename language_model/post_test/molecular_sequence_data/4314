While the zzso repeat region of zzso a zzso zzso vaccine candidate has been extensively studied for zzso and zzso zzso little is so far known about the zzso region in this zzso The present study aimed at investigating the zzso sequence zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Eight overlapping peptides were zzso and zzso for their ability to stimulate peripheral blood zzso cells obtained from zzso zzso donors to zzso and to induce zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso 4 zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso of the corresponding donors were tested for zzso zzso with the same peptides in zzso The individual cellular responses to the different peptides varied and in general they were not zzso zzso the importance of including several parameters for zzso zzso The most frequent zzso responses zzso zzso and/or zzso were seen with two partially overlapping peptides corresponding to the sequences zzso and zzso that induced responses in 71 and zzso of the donors, zzso zzso the frequency of zzso was high, the magnitude of the responses was generally zzso Two overlapping peptides corresponding to the sequence zzso bound zzso from a large number of plasma zzso zzso producing cells were frequently found in donors whose zzso contained zzso to the corresponding zzso However, there was no absolute correlation and many donors having zzso zzso could also be induced to produce zzso In conclusion, the zzso region of zzso contains several zzso inducing functionally distinct zzso zzso The sequence zzso was found to contain both zzso and zzso zzso zzso by almost all individuals naturally primed to zzso Thus, this sequence should be a useful tool in future zzso studies and/or for inclusion into a zzso vaccine against the asexual blood stages of the zzso zzso zzso
