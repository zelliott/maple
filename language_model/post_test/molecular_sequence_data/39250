zzso genes in insects are required for generating the subdivisions of the early zzso We describe here a new member of the gap family of zzso genes in the flour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to transformation of the abdominal segments into zzso zzso providing zzso with up to ten pairs of zzso We show that there are zzso interactions between zzso and the known gap genes in zzso suggesting that zzso is itself a gap zzso The zzso gene reveals an unusual structure, as it encodes a zzso zzso that codes for four zzso zzso appears to be the zzso of this previously unknown gene structure in zzso as we find zzso genes with the same zzso arrangement in other insect zzso as zzso
