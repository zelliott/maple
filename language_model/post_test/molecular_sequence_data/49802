zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso characterized by markedly elevated plasma LDL levels, zzso and premature coronary artery zzso LDL zzso function is normal, or only moderately impaired in zzso from zzso patients, but their cultured zzso show increased zzso LDL zzso and impaired LDL degradation, consistent with a zzso in LDL zzso zzso Recently, the disorder was shown to be caused by zzso in a zzso binding domain zzso zzso which is required for zzso of low density zzso in the zzso This review summarizes the findings of new investigations into the zzso and molecular zzso of zzso 

All zzso that have been characterized to date zzso the synthesis of a full-length zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso binding domain of zzso interacts with the zzso sequence zzso in the zzso tail of zzso and that zzso motifs in the zzso portion of the protein bind to zzso and to the zzso zzso of zzso 

The available data suggest that zzso functions as an zzso protein that couples zzso to the zzso zzso
