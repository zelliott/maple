zzso zzso zzso is highly specific for the initiation of zzso from a relatively small consensus promoter zzso Previous zzso studies suggested that the zzso binds specifically to a fully closed duplex form of the promoter, recognizing functional groups along one face of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso & Coleman, zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso zzso kinetic analysis of zzso promoters shows that removal of the zzso strand completely within the message region of the DNA zzso zzso through zzso results in no change in binding (as reflected in the zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso (as reflected in zzso Further deletion of the zzso strand as far upstream as position zzso has no effect on zzso and although deletion upstream through position zzso zzso zzso specific initiation continues at a high zzso The temperature dependence of the initiation zzso shows a single apparent zzso energy of approximately 26 zzso for the fully duplex zzso Similar zzso on the promoter lacking the zzso strand in the message region show that less than zzso of this barrier is related to melting of the downstream region of the zzso These results lead us to revise the previous model for recognition to include specific binding to a form of the promoter which is duplex upstream of about position zzso and melted downstream through the start zzso Within the melted region, the zzso interacts significantly only with the template strand of the promoter zzso
