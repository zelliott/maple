The human zzso contains a variety of genetic elements similar in structure to zzso and zzso We report here the structural and functional organization of a novel human zzso zzso family zzso Three zzso zzso 8, 2, and zzso zzso long, are detected by Northern zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso cloning of an expressed zzso zzso we demonstrated that the three zzso zzso are originated by a single zzso locus by alternative usage of zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of different zzso zzso have revealed that they are zzso in length and that the length zzso is due to the number of zzso repeated zzso present in both zzso and zzso zzso moreover, the zzso zzso are capable to drive expression of a reporter gene in transient expression zzso Finally, analysis of the zzso zzso zzso start site has allowed us to define the zzso organization of the zzso zzso
