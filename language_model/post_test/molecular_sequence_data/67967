The requirements for the DNA replication of the human zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso as well as the zzso of the related viruses zzso and zzso With all three zzso the boundary of the core origin mapped on the early side to position zzso of the viral zzso In conjunction with earlier studies, the core origin of DNA replication was therefore defined as a zzso region which, similar to the zzso core origin, contains three major structural zzso early zzso zzso binding site II, and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by sequences zzso the core origin on the early zzso Specifically, the stimulating sequences on the early side were identified as zzso binding site zzso The degree to which zzso sequences were able to stimulate viral DNA replication was dependent on the zzso used in the experiment, with zzso zzso relying most and BK zzso relying least on the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an intermediate zzso The same hierarchy was observed when replication activities were zzso BK zzso was more active in replicating DNA than zzso zzso which in turn was more effective than zzso zzso zzso on zzso sequences is, thus, zzso correlated to the replicating activity of the respective zzso showing that, in addition to the origin, the zzso contributes to the characteristics of zzso virus DNA zzso
