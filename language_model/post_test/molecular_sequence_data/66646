zzso of the bovine zzso promoter in response to signaling molecules associated with zzso or bacterial infection was assessed using a zzso reporter zzso Although the liver is the primary site for the production of acute phase zzso typically serum zzso A1 zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso analysis of the differential expression of serum zzso A3 zzso by zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso and the zzso bacterial zzso acid zzso substantially zzso zzso expression driven by the zzso promoter in bovine zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the zzso hormone, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso The minimal zzso promoter zzso that retained responsiveness to zzso zzso or zzso was 352 zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso promoter region exhibited the highest level of zzso or zzso zzso zzso This activity was zzso higher than the zzso activity obtained with the zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso The 53 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso in zzso 1 of the zzso gene enhanced expression levels in response to the stimulants zzso and zzso and the zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter contained an zzso that negated a zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso these data support the proposal that zzso serves an important zzso function for the welfare of the zzso zzso during both bacterial infection and tissue zzso
