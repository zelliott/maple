An attempt for the identification of potential zzso zzso of response to chemotherapy zzso in breast cancer patients has been performed by the use of two-dimensional zzso and mass zzso zzso Since growth and progression of tumor cells depend also on zzso factors in the zzso we choose to investigate the proteins zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins have been analyzed and a comparison was also made between the zzso profile of zzso versus zzso to zzso At zzso proteins isolated in zzso and zzso of all the 28 patients show significant differences in zzso Two clusters of zzso zzso expressed in zzso with respect to zzso were zzso Most significant is the decreased expression in zzso of zzso In the protein metabolism group, also zzso was found zzso Some proteins involved in energy pathways were zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso while some other were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same trend was observed for signal zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso 1 zzso Moreover, an analysis has been conducted comparing protein expression in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso irrespective of zzso or zzso zzso This analysis lead us to identify two clusters of proteins with a modified zzso which might be zzso of response to zzso In responders, an increase in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso and zzso zzso zzso coupled with a decreased expression of zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso We observed that zzso zzso the expression of these cluster proteins since, after treatment, their expression in zzso of zzso is generally zzso Patients not responding to zzso show an unchanged expression pattern in zzso with the exception of protein zzso which is zzso and a decreased expression in zzso of several cluster zzso In conclusion, the identification of protein clusters associated with response to zzso might be important for predicting the efficacy of a specific zzso drug and for the development of less zzso strategies in choosing the therapy to be prescribed to the single zzso
