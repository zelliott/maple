The neurodegenerative disease zzso zzso is caused by reduced levels of zzso a zzso zzso zzso The in zzso role of zzso is under zzso zzso as well as its zzso zzso zzso binds multiple iron atoms as an zzso and has been proposed to function as a crucial zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso This zzso protein was able to replace functionally zzso zzso even when expressed at low levels, when zzso iron levels were high and in zzso strains having deletions of genes that had synthetic growth defects with a zzso zzso The ability of an zzso zzso to function in zzso suggests that zzso and thus zzso iron storage, is not a critical function of zzso Rather, the capacity of this zzso zzso to interact with the zzso protein suggests a more direct role of zzso in zzso cluster zzso
