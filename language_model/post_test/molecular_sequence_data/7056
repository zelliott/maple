zzso zzso zzso in order to construct genetic linkage maps is becoming a widespread strategy for zzso analysis and gene isolation, particularly in cultivated plant zzso Nevertheless, almost all zzso reveal two or more zzso zzso making it difficult to identify the zzso actually zzso In a highly zzso species, such as zzso two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso of proteins may circumvent this zzso With the analysis of various segregating zzso we previously showed that the apparent position shifts of proteins on the zzso gels are zzso and zzso In this paper we compared zzso proteins on the basis of their high performance liquid zzso zzso profile and partial zzso acid zzso In a sample of 20 position shifts, the zzso proteins appeared to be similar in all but one case, strongly suggesting that zzso of structural genes is zzso Thus zzso PAGE could prove to be a useful tool for zzso zzso when a zzso probe detects several zzso a position shift of the zzso protein will allow the identification of the gene translated in the organ zzso
