zzso elements are a group of promoter sequences required for the expression of both pathogen genes in infected plants and plant defense zzso Genes for zzso element binding factors zzso belonging to a specific class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, have been isolated in a number of zzso Using zzso interaction screening with zzso we have isolated zzso an zzso protein that contains a novel zzso domain, the zzso zzso One class of proteins that contain this domain are the tobacco zzso element binding proteins zzso The zzso bind the zzso box that zzso zzso responsiveness to a number of zzso related zzso gene zzso zzso expression is zzso by zzso zzso in zzso plants and zzso transcripts are increased in the zzso zzso where zzso pathways are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I footprint analysis revealed that zzso can specifically bind to the zzso zzso Interestingly, the highest level of zzso expression was detected in callus zzso where zzso elements are very zzso zzso effects of the zzso box with zzso elements or the related zzso sequence have been previously observed, for example, in the zzso expression of a zzso gene zzso Our results suggest that zzso between zzso and zzso zzso factors occurs and may therefore be important in regulating gene expression during the plant defense zzso
