It is zzso that zzso proteins can experience a frequent modification provoked by the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso group of zzso to form a zzso zzso Other groups which have been implicated in this reaction include the zzso group of zzso the zzso group of zzso and the free zzso In a series of recent publications it has been demonstrated that at pH approximately zzso and in the presence of zzso none of these groups experienced measurable interaction with zzso zzso To zzso this conclusion we have used zzso laser zzso with a zzso zzso mass zzso to examine a number of zzso proteins incubated for various intervals with 30 zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso These high resolution data suggest that, for short incubation times zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso the zzso group of zzso is the likely zzso site of zzso zzso incubation times zzso zzso with zzso zzso rendered the role of zzso as the zzso zzso site less zzso
