Three zzso clones coding for the 3' region of the zzso zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso were isolated during screening of a library for genes whose expression was modulated during the zzso zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso cell line zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previously reported results, no zzso transcripts were detected in either zzso cells or two zzso cell lines zzso Instead, zzso transcripts as well as zzso were abundant in the zzso cells zzso and zzso 9 and in zzso zzso zzso cells but not in the other differentiated cell types of zzso origin which were zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of the three zzso zzso clones with a zzso integrated zzso sequence zzso demonstrated zzso in both length and sequence among the zzso The position of the zzso addition site was determined to be 15 zzso from the proposed zzso addition signal and to occur after the sequence zzso not CA, as previously zzso zzso zzso was greatest in a region of zzso repeats 80 base pairs zzso to the zzso addition zzso Additionally, the putative zzso box found in zzso was deleted in the zzso clones and in the long terminal repeat regions from two other zzso clones zzso The zzso evident among the zzso clones further demonstrated that at least two distinct zzso genes are activated during zzso An analysis of the rate of zzso in isolated zzso indicated that the zzso of expression of zzso genes in zzso cells is the result of zzso zzso Together, these observations suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso is regulated autonomously rather than by the fortuitous integration of an zzso sequence adjacent to a zzso regulated cellular zzso
