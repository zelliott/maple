DNA fragments containing zzso zzso cloned adjacent to putative zzso binding sites have been examined by zzso experiments using a variety of zzso in the presence of the zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso a DNA structural change which renders adjacent zzso sequences sensitive to attack by zzso zzso zzso changes are also revealed with zzso I and zzso zzso The results are consistent with a model in which zzso opens the DNA minor groove changing it to a structure which is locally more like zzso
