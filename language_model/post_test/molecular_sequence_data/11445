A protein zzso gene zzso has been isolated from the human zzso zzso zzso by using a mixed zzso pool which zzso to a highly zzso region of zzso protein zzso The zzso which contains one zzso encodes a protein with a predicted length of zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein contains all the zzso sequences characteristic of a protein zzso zzso zzso These sequences are zzso however, since they are separated by two large zzso zzso with 178 and 330 zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso were raised against zzso fragments of the protein and a zzso zzso Using one of these zzso a functional protein zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and this zzso recognized zzso as an zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso fashion and also had a zzso cellular zzso During the zzso life cycle, zzso shifts from the zzso zzso to the zzso membrane zzso An unusual feature of zzso is its zzso mobility on zzso Whereas the predicted protein size is about 100 zzso the apparent size is about 70 zzso There are no indications for zzso processing and we could exclude zzso processing as an zzso
