A zzso protein was identified as a major component of mature zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This protein was, like zzso detected in the content of zzso zzso and was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein corresponded to an zzso protein which exists in a zzso zzso form and had no similarities to zzso However, a strong resemblance between this protein and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was observed on the basis of its characteristics including molecular mass, iron content, zzso spectrum, zzso acid composition and zzso zzso These similarities with zzso and the zzso of the protein in the zzso justify the name zzso given to the zzso A zzso protein zzso related to zzso was detected in zzso zzso The protein was zzso with the zzso procedure used to isolate zzso from zzso and was found to be similar to the zzso zzso This circulating zzso was present in large amounts in the zzso fluid while zzso is in progress, zzso after the third and last blood meal of the animal zzso zzso except at the time of zzso enlargement when its concentration decreases zzso However, in contrast to zzso which is detected specifically in the zzso fluid of leeches at stage 3, circulating zzso is also observed after the first zzso 1) and second zzso 2) blood zzso This observation suggests a more complex function for zzso than being merely a zzso zzso for the zzso
