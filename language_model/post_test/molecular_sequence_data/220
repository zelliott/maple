A novel zzso CCNY, was identified as a zzso interacting protein in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso box in CCNY and the zzso motif in zzso are both required for the interaction which was confirmed by in zzso and in zzso zzso Two transcripts (4 and zzso of CCNY were detected by Northern zzso analysis and CCNY was enriched at the plasma membrane due to an zzso zzso zzso We propose that binding of CCNY to zzso enhances zzso zzso activity and changes its zzso zzso
