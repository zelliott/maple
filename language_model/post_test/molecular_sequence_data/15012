The zzso tongue zzso zzso is a useful model for studying oral zzso cell zzso phase by zzso The present study aimed to investigate zzso in zzso 2 of gene zzso during rat tongue zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso using direct zzso zzso A total of 30 male zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso in drinking water for 4, 12, and 20 weeks at 50 zzso zzso Ten animals were used as negative zzso No zzso changes in tongue zzso were observed among controls or in the group treated for 4 weeks with zzso Following zzso treatment, zzso and zzso zzso were found in mild and moderate zzso At 20 weeks, the tongue presented moderate and/or severe oral zzso and zzso cell zzso with zzso cell zzso in the majority of zzso No zzso were found in any experimental period evaluated that corresponded to normal oral zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso 2 are not involved in the zzso tongue zzso of zzso rats induced by zzso
