We present here the first high resolution melt zzso zzso to zzso analyze differences in zzso DNA zzso levels utilizing zzso zzso of Long Interspersed zzso zzso or zzso By calculating the integral difference in melt temperature between samples and a zzso control, and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso demonstrates enhanced sensitivity to detect changes in zzso in a cell line treated with low doses of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed to be a good marker of changes in DNA zzso of zzso elements at multiple regions across the zzso when compared with total zzso content, measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso design was also used to detect changes in zzso at other zzso repeat elements zzso and zzso zzso Repeat zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso changes were zzso across the zzso within the zzso target region, demonstrating that the zzso zzso can detect small changes in zzso zzso among a large pool of zzso zzso DNA zzso Application of the zzso to various zzso from zzso and zzso mice, including previously zzso peripheral blood zzso revealed a tissue hierarchy (from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso kidney zzso liver zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated overall greater zzso than zzso mice, and male mice demonstrated higher tissue zzso compared with female mice in both zzso Changes in DNA zzso have been reported to be an early and fundamental event in the zzso of many human diseases, including zzso Mouse studies designed to identify zzso of DNA zzso the critical doses, relevant time points and the zzso affected are limited by the low zzso nature and exorbitant cost of many DNA zzso zzso The zzso zzso provides a high zzso inexpensive and sensitive screening tool for identifying and characterizing DNA zzso changes to zzso elements at multiple regions across the zzso
