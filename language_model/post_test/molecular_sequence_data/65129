The zzso and signaling activities of zzso a zzso zzso zzso are regulated by the zzso of several zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso Some studies have revealed a few possible zzso sites of zzso by zzso mapping or by using specific zzso zzso To ultimately identify these and other zzso sites of zzso we performed mass zzso analysis of an originally prepared zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso activity of zzso basic protein as an external zzso of the zzso zzso protein were substantially elevated in the presence of zzso without stimulation by a zzso cell zzso zzso factor, a natural zzso for zzso Mass zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activity of zzso (multiple zzso zzso zzso a zzso active form of zzso with substitution of zzso by zzso zzso were comparable with those of original zzso whereas those of the zzso zzso were greatly zzso Interestingly, those of a double zzso zzso were completely zzso Both the zzso activity and transforming activity were impaired in the zzso zzso and zzso These results provide convincing evidence for both previously suggested and new zzso zzso sites of zzso as well as for novel functions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso zzso activities and cell zzso The significance of the identified zzso sites in various zzso zzso registered in a data base is discussed in this zzso
