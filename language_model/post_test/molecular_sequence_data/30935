We have zzso and studied the properties of zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This series of compounds allowed us to investigate the specificity of zzso bound formation in a reaction that could have taken place on the zzso zzso We asked whether the intrinsic zzso of the zzso zzso the nature of the zzso in the zzso or the complementary zzso template influences the specificity of the zzso synthesis zzso We observed that the differential zzso of the zzso acids results in zzso preferences during the zzso zzso whereas the nature of the zzso and the presence of complementary zzso had no influence on the zzso These results suggest that some peptides would have been more abundant than others on the zzso earth and have implications for the study of the origins of the genetic code and protein zzso
