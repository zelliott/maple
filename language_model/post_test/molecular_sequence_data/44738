An accumulating body of evidence suggests that zzso zzso host cells are recognized and destroyed by class I major zzso complex zzso restricted zzso zzso thus contributing to immune control of the infection zzso However, to date, only a few zzso proteins which could be the target of this response have been described and gene sequence information is available only for the zzso zzso In order to identify zzso proteins which could contribute to immune detection of infected host cells, a panel of zzso zzso specific for zzso proteins was produced and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified which recognized zzso surface proteins of 78, 26 and 53 zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso expression library with zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence indicates that the zzso clone encodes an zzso surface protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on its preferential expression in the zzso stage we have named this protein zzso surface zzso zzso zzso contains the third and fourth zzso block zzso zzso and the zzso type zzso domain, zzso thus placing it in family II of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso family member shown to be zzso expressed in the zzso stage of the zzso zzso life zzso This expression of zzso on zzso in infected cells and its apparent membrane attachment by a zzso zzso makes it a prime candidate to enter the class I zzso processing and presentation zzso
