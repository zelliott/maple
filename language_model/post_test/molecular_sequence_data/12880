Variation in the zzso zzso gene of influenza A zzso viruses isolated in the zzso and abroad from zzso was determined by zzso sequencing of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso isolated in the zzso early in the zzso season were from the zzso lineage and were replaced later that season by viruses from the zzso zzso zzso from the new lineage continued to be isolated during the 1993-94 season, but were zzso Most of these zzso were more closely related to an zzso zzso A Hong zzso but could be distinguished into three groups by zzso (of which one group was circulating during the previous zzso and four groups based on sequence variation in the zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene is evolving along one zzso zzso analysis identified mainstream, zzso and strain specific zzso acid zzso There was a broad correlation between the observed zzso acid changes and the zzso sites of the zzso The results of this study highlight the value of regular molecular analysis of circulating zzso
