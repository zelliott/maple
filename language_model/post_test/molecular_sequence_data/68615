zzso In previous work, we identified a prolonged and intense zzso response of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso application of zzso We zzso that this response, which was blocked by substance P zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonists, was a result of local release of zzso on the zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated factors that might influence zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso as measured by hydrogen zzso central zzso connections, the zzso vascular zzso the release of zzso and administration of zzso zzso zzso of central zzso connections by zzso nerve section or removal of the zzso vascular zzso did not influence baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso section, prevented zzso zzso zzso The zzso vascular zzso was zzso to the effect of zzso by prior application of zzso zzso zzso was also prevented zzso topical treatment with zzso II zzso zzso substance P) an SP zzso systemic zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso antagonists, systemic zzso with zzso sodium or systemic zzso with zzso None of these zzso influenced baseline zzso When systemic zzso was given together with systemic zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is locally zzso is independent of central zzso connections and is sensitive to a variety of zzso It requires an intact zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and the release of zzso by mast zzso Its zzso by zzso suggests that there are local zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso zzso
