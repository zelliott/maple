We examined the zzso of ticks zzso and their closest known zzso relatives zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso In our zzso we included sequences from 36 zzso zzso for 13 hard ticks zzso zzso 5 soft ticks zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso database and we generated sequences for 15 hard ticks and 1 zzso zzso Ten of these tick species were endemic to zzso Our analyses indicated that the zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso the group used as zzso in earlier molecular zzso This finding is consistent with zzso (1991) hypothesis that the zzso rather than the zzso is the zzso to the zzso Within the hard ticks the zzso zzso and thus the family zzso were zzso zzso revision of these zzso is zzso The zzso zzso was zzso without the inclusion of zzso zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a zzso divergence between endemic Australian and other species in both the zzso and the zzso divisions of the hard zzso
