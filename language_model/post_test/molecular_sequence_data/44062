The anterior zzso zzso factor zzso (also known as zzso was initially identified and cloned as a zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and later as a regulator of the zzso beta zzso Analysis of zzso expression during mouse zzso revealed that initiation of its expression zzso both temporally and zzso with zzso of its target zzso zzso studies revealed a high expression of zzso protein in the zzso of only three cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso The importance of zzso as a regulator of the anterior zzso development has been further demonstrated by the absence of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso mice and zzso Since zzso is required for both cell zzso and zzso one may ask if this zzso factor might be associated with development of zzso zzso Several investigators have reported zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso These studies, while not in total agreement, show that zzso zzso does not seem to be associated with a gross zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso identical in size and sequence to those observed in normal zzso were described in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in most cases the presence of zzso transcripts correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso The biological relevance of zzso expression reported in some zzso zzso remains to be zzso As expression of the zzso and zzso genes is ultimately confined to distinct zzso and zzso populations despite the presence of zzso protein in both cell types, there must be additional mechanisms that control the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso beta zzso raised through alternative zzso of zzso 2 of the zzso zzso is a more potent zzso of zzso zzso than the major zzso zzso This form could, at least in part, account for the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta was invariably found present in all the tumors expressing the zzso major form, no significant difference in the zzso zzso expression ratio being observed between tumors identified as pure zzso or zzso zzso This lack of selectivity together with its low level of expression is therefore not in favor of a key role for the zzso in the cell zzso expression of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso The failure of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso mice and humans indicates that zzso might be competent to activate genes required for cell proliferation or survival of the three cell zzso Recent data indeed suggest that zzso may directly or indirectly regulate zzso and zzso through zzso of the receptors for zzso and zzso on the one hand, and zzso on the other zzso Such regulatory mechanisms could contribute to the differentiation of the zzso lineage in fully differentiated zzso and zzso zzso
