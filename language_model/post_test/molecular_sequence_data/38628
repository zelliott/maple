zzso is known to be required for the synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but the exact function of this membrane protein is not zzso We show that zzso also plays a role in spore zzso The expression of zzso and the two downstream genes zzso and zzso was zzso There is a promoter for each zzso but there is only one zzso zzso located after the zzso zzso The promoter for zzso was found to be weak and was active mainly during the transition from exponential growth to stationary zzso The promoters for zzso and zzso were both active in the exponential growth zzso The levels of the zzso and zzso proteins in the membrane were consistent with the observed promoter zzso The zzso promoter activity was independent of whether the zzso gene products were absent or zzso in the zzso It is shown that the four known zzso c in zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso proteins are not required for zzso The combined data from analysis of zzso zzso factor activity, resistance properties of spores, and spore zzso indicate that zzso zzso affects stage V in zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are functionally unrelated proteins and that the role of zzso in zzso c and spore synthesis probably relates to zzso zzso chemistry on the outer surface of the zzso zzso
