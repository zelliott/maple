As discussed throughout this paper, many zzso zzso genes are associated with growth responses, including both positive responses to growth stimulation and negative responses involving transient growth arrest and terminal zzso It is interesting that several zzso genes zzso zzso factors, the zzso zzso are zzso are induced by terminal zzso and also are associated with positive growth zzso In negative zzso zzso their control is complex and almost certainly involves multiple regulatory zzso The role of zzso genes after exposure to zzso agents is currently not known, but as growth arrest can have a protective effect on cells exposed to zzso agents in both bacteria and zzso some protective zzso for the zzso genes may zzso Whatever the roles are for the individual zzso zzso the response of the zzso genes to zzso agents and other zzso signals has been highly zzso during zzso evolution, and it is likely that this stress response, as reflected by induction of one or more zzso zzso is present in most or perhaps all zzso zzso Our findings that the zzso group zzso with another group of zzso zzso the zzso indicate that these two groups combined define a new class of genes whose protein products are likely to play a role in cell growth zzso
