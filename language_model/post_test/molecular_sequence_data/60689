zzso functional analysis revealed the modular organization of zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso was identified through deletion experiments, sequence comparisons indicated the presence of an zzso zzso origin commonly found among zzso zzso Southern zzso confirmed the existence of zzso zzso but only in the case of zzso derivatives lacking the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso replication protein zzso displayed significant similarity with that of zzso a 7-6 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that both elements are representatives of a new family of zzso replicating zzso zzso In addition, both plasmids share a zzso 320 zzso region downstream of their rep genes which, in the case of zzso appeared indispensable for zzso This region is therefore likely to zzso to, or to be part of, the actual zzso origin of both zzso Another interesting feature of zzso is the presence of a zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by its ability to be mobilized by the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same transfer system was also used to zzso demonstrate similar properties of the related zzso protein from zzso A closer analysis of this family of related zzso proteins suggested a zzso organization among its zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be related to zzso of zzso a 60 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Although no function has been assigned to the putative zzso zzso it is located downstream of a zzso zzso next to an zzso zzso zzso appears thus far as an zzso of functional zzso with no obvious zzso function, presumably acting as a zzso of carrier zzso and zzso zzso zzso or recruiting zzso entities for its bacterial zzso
