zzso are zzso zzso of zzso that are best known for infecting and causing serious diseases in humans and other zzso All known zzso zzso are zzso by zzso as part of their zzso and many other zzso are found exclusively in zzso with no known secondary zzso However, little is known about the biology of these latter zzso Here, we have identified 20 new strains of zzso from zzso and constructed a zzso zzso of the entire zzso which includes these new zzso 

We show that zzso are primarily zzso bacteria, and identify several novel groups within the zzso zzso do not zzso with their hosts but host shifts most often occur between related zzso zzso have evolved adaptations including transmission through zzso and killing males in some zzso zzso We uncovered one case of horizontal gene transfer among zzso where a strain is a zzso from two zzso related groups, but zzso analysis indicates that different parts of the zzso tend to share the same zzso 

zzso 150 million years ago, zzso split into two main zzso one of which primarily zzso zzso and the other zzso a diverse range of zzso other zzso and zzso There was then a rapid radiation about 50 million years ago, which coincided with the evolution of life history adaptations in a few branches of the zzso Even though zzso are thought to be primarily transmitted zzso host associations are short lived with frequent switching to new host zzso zzso throughout the zzso is generally zzso although there is evidence of horizontal gene zzso A better understanding of the evolution of zzso will help in the future to zzso the mechanisms of zzso transmission and zzso
