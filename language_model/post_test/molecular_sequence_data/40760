Currently, most zzso zzso studies of bacteria and zzso match experimental data to known zzso acid sequences from the target zzso zzso studies use a zzso molecular weight along with data gathered from zzso experiments to identify proteins by database zzso For zzso zzso and zzso zzso studied here, the necessary protein sequences are not available in protein sequence zzso We apply zzso protein zzso but match the experimental data with zzso proteins from related organisms with zzso zzso demonstrating considerable shared protein sequence between closely related zzso Using this zzso approach, we are not only able to identify representative zzso but are also able to place the two target bacteria in their correct zzso Furthermore, we show that the unexpected mass delta between the experimental precursor and matched protein sequence can often be localized and characterized using zzso precursor and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that proteins identified by zzso zzso provide strong experimental evidence for correct, missing, and zzso bacterial protein zzso not only in the analyzed zzso but also for zzso proteins in closely related zzso
