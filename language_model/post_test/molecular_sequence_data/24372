zzso of zzso to DNA in mouse zzso cells by zzso and isolation of zzso zzso complexes from normal zzso cells and mouse and human zzso zzso indicated close spatial relations between these components in the intact zzso The zzso obtained by zzso with zzso zzso contained substantial zzso not only of repetitive and mobile sequence elements such as zzso satellite DNA, zzso DNA, zzso and zzso long and short zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also of zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso complexes could be isolated with distinctly higher yields from zzso stressed, zzso zzso and were zzso by zzso they possibly arose from accidental zzso reactions zzso by zzso and zzso products of free zzso zzso zzso They can therefore be considered zzso of a general interaction of zzso with cellular zzso The sequence patterns of their DNA fragments were similar to those of zzso circular and linear DNA, including zzso zzso markers and enhancers of zzso instability that also occur in the zzso and are able to transport zzso into the zzso Many of the fragments were also remarkably similar to zzso nuclear zzso attachment regions zzso in that they zzso in addition to various mobile zzso a palette of typical zzso zzso With its tendency to zzso and to interact with zzso and zzso DNA, zzso thus behaves like a nuclear zzso protein and may as such participate in a variety of nuclear zzso processes such as zzso zzso repair, and zzso of zzso These activities seem to be zzso to the zzso zzso as zzso was also zzso to zzso zzso to its zzso and zzso main control zzso These sites are prone to point and deletion zzso and, like nuclear zzso are associated with the zzso Moreover, as a zzso regulated and zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the organization of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso at the nuclear zzso with all its consequences for zzso activities during zzso and in adulthood of zzso However, because of its high affinity for zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso is proposed to play a major role in both the preservation and the evolution of the nuclear and zzso zzso
