Breast cancer zzso zzso 1 zzso reduces the number and the size of secondary zzso in a mouse model without affecting the growth of the primary zzso upon its zzso zzso of zzso expression associates with zzso The molecular details on zzso mechanism of action include its ability to function as a zzso zzso and consistently zzso has been described as a predominantly nuclear zzso Since cellular distribution could represent a potential mechanism of regulation, we wanted to characterize zzso sequence motifs that might regulate its cellular zzso According to its zzso acids zzso zzso contain two putative nuclear zzso signals, however none of them has been proved to work so zzso 

By using well known in zzso zzso to detect both nuclear import and export zzso we have zzso in the present study, one functional nuclear zzso signal as necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear zzso Additionally, the outcome of a directed zzso zzso zzso identify zzso zzso as a specific partner of zzso thus speculating that zzso nuclear import could be specifically zzso by the reported nuclear zzso Besides, the combination of a zzso searching approach along the zzso of a nuclear export zzso identified a functional motif within the zzso sequence responsible for its nuclear export, that resulted not affected by the highly specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate the capability of zzso to shuttle between the nuclear and zzso compartments 

Our results show for the first time that zzso contains both nuclear import and export signals enabling its zzso zzso These findings contributes new data for the understanding of the zzso functions and allow us to speculate that this phenomenon could represent a novel mechanism for regulating the activity of zzso or its associated zzso zzso
