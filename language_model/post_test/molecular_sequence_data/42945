A procedure is described for mapping the ends of zzso Using T4 zzso zzso a DNA zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso ends followed by zzso zzso zzso amplification, cloning and zzso This method determines zzso ends, 3' zzso sites and the size of zzso tails, and should be zzso to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso Analysis of four zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso closely spaced zzso ends consistent with those determined by other zzso Except for a zzso box in either orientation zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site, no zzso sequence elements were observed in the untranslated zzso region or in sequences immediately zzso the zzso start zzso Analysis of the 3' ends of zzso zzso four zzso two zzso and the zzso zzso binding protein confirmed the observations that zzso zzso messages are zzso and that zzso tails in this zzso are short zzso 50 zzso No zzso zzso addition signal was zzso The four zzso messages analyzed have contained three sequence zzso zzso not found in zzso zzso Two zzso messages contained zzso near the zzso addition zzso
