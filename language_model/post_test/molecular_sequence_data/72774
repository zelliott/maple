A zzso chain reaction zzso protocol was developed for specific detection of zzso zzso by using a pair of zzso designed for its zzso zzso zzso The detection was specific for zzso zzso since no amplification was detected with zzso from zzso zzso which belongs to the same zzso as zzso zzso in addition to various species of oral zzso zzso and bacteria, and human zzso This method had a detection limit of 100 zzso for zzso zzso zzso DNA and could detect zzso zzso cells in dental plaque at a concentration of as low as 5 cells per zzso zzso zzso detection from clinical dental plaque samples was also zzso therefore, the present zzso procedure could provide a simple and rapid detection method of zzso zzso in dental zzso
