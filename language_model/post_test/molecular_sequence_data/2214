Pig gastric zzso + zzso can be zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso (about 1 zzso zzso and this modification is not observed in the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso binds to a specific zzso zzso in the zzso binding site or the region in its vicinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The peptides labeled with radioactive zzso could be released from the gastric membrane zzso zzso by zzso treatment, and two peptides were zzso by high performance liquid zzso These peptides were not obtained from zzso incubated with zzso in the presence of zzso The sequences of the two peptides were zzso and zzso exactly corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of pig gastric zzso + zzso zzso recently zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was concluded to be the binding site of zzso as zzso was identified at the corresponding zzso This zzso zzso is zzso in zzso + zzso and zzso The possible zzso acid zzso in the zzso site of gastric zzso + zzso are zzso
