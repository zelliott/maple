We employed the zzso rats as an animal model to explore the feasibility of using genetically engineered zzso cells for growth hormone gene zzso An internal zzso entry site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contained a zzso growth hormone zzso zzso at the first zzso and a zzso gene at the second zzso was used to zzso primary rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The infected cells (5 zzso zzso zzso were injected directly into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the implanted zzso zzso cells could zzso biologically active zzso in zzso leading to significant growth of the zzso at day 15 and day 57 zzso We also treated the zzso zzso cells with collagen to form a zzso zzso The zzso discs were grafted underneath the skin on the back of rats and cells were retrieved at different zzso Using two criteria, zzso reverse zzso chain reaction on the zzso zzso extracted from the zzso and zzso resistance zzso from the zzso cells, we demonstrate that zzso was expressed in the implanted zzso up to 70 zzso Despite the fact that the total zzso zzso level was reduced in the zzso of long-time zzso which was probably due to the reduction of zzso cells retained in the zzso the specific efficiencies of zzso zzso expression from these zzso were maintained as high as the primary zzso zzso prior zzso These results suggest that zzso cells are capable of expressing the foreign genes persistently in zzso
