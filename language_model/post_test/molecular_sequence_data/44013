zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso As zzso are known to produce zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso In zzso studies were performed using the rat zzso zzso cell zzso These cells exhibited a zzso zzso response to zzso zzso to zzso increases at 80 zzso p zzso zzso as assessed by both zzso zzso and cell zzso This effect was inhibited by zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso When added to cultures of zzso zzso cells, zzso induced zzso proliferation that paralleled the effects of zzso growth zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso for 48 hours reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso versus a control zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were also shown to express zzso zzso and zzso as determined by Northern zzso and zzso thereby suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso To examine the effects of zzso in zzso zzso male zzso rats were given subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso or 14 days zzso zzso zzso or vehicle control, then zzso zzso administration induced a transient reduction in zzso clearance of zzso at Day 3 zzso zzso zzso Following zzso administration, an increase in zzso zzso was seen, which was zzso at Day 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso cross section versus control zzso zzso zzso zzso increases; p zzso zzso and maintained at Day 14 zzso increases; p zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cell nuclear zzso demonstrated an increased number of zzso cells per zzso cross section at day 3 zzso increases versus zzso p zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso showed significant labeling only in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso demonstrated that some of these zzso cells were zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is a growth factor for rat zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso
