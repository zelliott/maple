zzso DNA techniques have been employed to isolate sequences that are zzso during zzso zzso in the mouse zzso One of these six zzso zzso zzso detected zzso transcripts that were expressed at levels zzso higher in zzso cell zzso zzso in comparison to normal zzso A full-length zzso for zzso was obtained from a zzso zzso zzso library made from an zzso cell line, zzso DNA sequencing of zzso out of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and searching of zzso showed greater than zzso DNA sequence similarity to mouse zzso over the entire zzso and greater than zzso similarity over the 3' untranslated region, which is unique to the various zzso of zzso Southern analysis showed no amplification or zzso of the zzso gene had occurred during tumor zzso The zzso hybrid protection zzso was zzso to screen for the expression of zzso zzso in mouse skin zzso No evidence for zzso was obtained in any of the tumors zzso Fluorescence zzso of tumor sections stained with zzso zzso showed a peripheral pattern of zzso zzso with no gross differences between zzso and zzso zzso equal amounts of zzso were observed following two-dimensional gel zzso of proteins extracted from normal zzso zzso or zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso did not result in an increased zzso level of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso in zzso metabolism accompany tumor zzso
