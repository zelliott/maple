zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of a unique group of zzso and zzso zzso that contain the unusual zzso acid zzso The genes for these zzso zzso for the zzso zzso acid at a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which normally functions as a termination zzso The present studies analyzed the functional importance of sequences in the coding and zzso regions of transcripts of the primary human cellular zzso zzso gene zzso to the zzso of zzso at this zzso zzso zzso in potential zzso or hairpin structures in the coding region did not substantially diminish incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso expressed by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was completely abolished by deletion of zzso sequences in the zzso region from within a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif also found in the zzso region of zzso genes for other zzso Moreover, in zzso fusing the zzso zzso zzso region to the coding region of zzso (an unrelated protein normally without any zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso region was sufficient to direct the translation of an zzso zzso zzso as zzso Thus, our data directly demonstrate the importance of the zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso gene and specifically show that sequence elements in the zzso region are both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso at a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
