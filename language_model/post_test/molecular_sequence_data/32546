The zzso zzso domain is a ubiquitous fold found in several zzso related proteins zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso proteins share evolutionary zzso analysis of their sequences highlights that they are so zzso to form the zzso zzso The zzso occurs at different levels including zzso active site loop zzso presence of a critical zzso zzso zzso and domain zzso Even within the same zzso multiple genes zzso zzso proteins presenting with zzso arranged zzso zzso as single or tandem zzso or combined with other protein zzso Given the highly variable organization of the zzso zzso and the context where it is found, here we review the structural organization and function of the zzso zzso The overview of the most recent findings about zzso allow us to depict a zzso of versatile proteins relying on zzso chemistry to accomplish cellular functions spanning from resistance to environmental threats, such as zzso and key cellular reactions related to sulfur metabolism and progression of cell zzso
