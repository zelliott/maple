zzso zzso zzso grows zzso with nitrate as nitrogen zzso Using zzso designed for zzso motifs in bacterial zzso nitrate zzso a zzso DNA was amplified by zzso and used for the screening of a zzso zzso A zzso carrying an insert with four zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was isolated, and DNA sequencing revealed that it contains a nitrate zzso zzso gene region, including the zzso gene coding for a hybrid cluster protein zzso zzso of zzso is probably regulated by a zzso zzso zzso by the adjacent zzso zzso A zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso contained about 6 iron and 4 zzso zzso atoms per zzso in agreement with the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso and showed zzso zzso activity, forming zzso in zzso with zzso zzso as zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso were 1 zzso and 7 zzso respectively, at the pH and temperature zzso zzso and 40 degrees zzso The activity was zzso and was inhibited by zzso and iron zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso but not zzso with 1 zzso zzso as nitrogen source, and up to 10 zzso zzso was taken up by zzso resting zzso zzso was zzso accumulated in the media, and its zzso was prevented by zzso a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso or zzso cells showed the higher zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso a strain lacking the whole zzso region, did not grow with 1 zzso zzso Also, zzso coli cells zzso zzso tolerate zzso better during zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso of zzso a toxic product that could be formed during nitrate zzso probably in the zzso reduction zzso
