zzso C zzso is an 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein responsible for triggering muscle contraction upon the release of calcium from the zzso zzso The structure of zzso with two calcium zzso bound has previously been solved by X-ray zzso zzso here is the solution structure of zzso which has been solved using zzso and zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso backbone chemical shifts have already been published zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso Presented zzso are the zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemical shifts which are zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso was determined on the basis of zzso zzso distance zzso 121 zzso zzso angle zzso and 76 zzso zzso angle zzso The appearance of zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso with two zzso zzso connected by a zzso The structures of the zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso atomic root mean square zzso zzso about the mean atomic coordinate position for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A, zzso however, the orientation of one domain with respect to the other is not zzso and thus each domain appears to be structurally zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso determined zzso with the zzso form determined by X-ray methods reveals two major zzso First, there is a major structural change which occurs in the zzso domain resulting in the opening of a zzso pocket presumably to present itself to its target protein zzso zzso This structural change appears to involve only zzso B and C which move away from zzso zzso by the zzso of the backbone zzso zzso angles of zzso acid 41 from irregular in the crystal structure zzso degrees, zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso structure zzso degrees, zzso zzso The other difference between the two structures is the presence of a flexible zzso between the two zzso in the zzso zzso This flexible zzso allows the two zzso of zzso to adopt any orientation with respect to one another such that they can interact with a variety of zzso
