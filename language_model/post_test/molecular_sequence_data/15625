zzso zzso zzso zzso is a tropical forest snake belonging to the family zzso Its zzso shows a high zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso causing zzso paralysis, which may result in zzso In spite of a relatively small zzso of zzso serum therapy is crucial for those zzso However, the adequate production of zzso is hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of zzso from a small snake with demanding breeding zzso In order to zzso the molecular basis of this zzso and to uncover possible zzso for an zzso we generated expressed sequences tags zzso from its zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso zzso In addition, their zzso was tested using DNA zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were generated and grouped into 611 zzso zzso transcripts represented zzso of the total zzso The two main toxin classes consisted of zzso toxins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, 8 other classes of toxins were present, including zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors and even zzso mass components such as zzso and zzso acid zzso Each class included an assortment of zzso some showing evidence of alternative zzso and domain zzso Five zzso candidates were selected (four zzso and one zzso and used for a preliminary study of DNA zzso The zzso response showed that the zzso from the zzso animals were able to recognize the zzso zzso 

Besides an improvement in our knowledge of the composition of coral snake zzso which are very poorly known when compared to Old World zzso the expression profile suggests abundant and diversified components that may be used in future zzso zzso As zzso production of zzso zzso frequently fails due to complex zzso arrangements, DNA zzso may be a viable zzso In fact, the selected candidates provided an initial evidence of the feasibility of this approach, which is less costly and not dependent on the availability of the zzso
