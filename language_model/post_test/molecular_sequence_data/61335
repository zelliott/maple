The length of the heavy chain zzso region 2 zzso was extended beyond what is found in zzso genes to improve the binding properties of an zzso zzso The previous zzso characterization and the molecular modeling of the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that a part of the zzso was loosely recognized by the zzso The zzso because of its close location but scarce contacts with the zzso was considered as a conceivable target for zzso Libraries with either two, three or four random zzso acid insertions in the tip of the zzso loop were constructed and displayed on the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso were introduced also into the rest of the zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction to allow the surrounding structures to adapt to the extended zzso After the panning of the libraries with an zzso zzso selection, a number of active zzso most of which showed significantly improved affinity and zzso were isolated, characterized and zzso The results indicate that the structure of the zzso can tolerate a number of different insertions in the zzso zzso They also suggest that the repertoire of zzso libraries can be expanded by extending the length of the zzso zzso beyond that naturally provided by the given set of zzso zzso This kind of zzso can be generally useful for the engineering of zzso zzso
