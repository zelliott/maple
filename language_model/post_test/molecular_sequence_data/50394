We have developed a technique to detect accurately zzso carriers of a zzso zzso target sequences were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso and the products subsequently were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso Examples from four zzso demonstrated that zzso cycles of amplification for a zzso DNA, based on 50 zzso of zzso DNA, results in excellent zzso that readily permits the detection of zzso carriers of a zzso We have demonstrated that triplex zzso (three targets in a single zzso zzso no loss of zzso We also have demonstrated that this method can accurately differentiate the zzso carriers of a deletion from normal individuals in four family studies, three for zzso muscular zzso patients and one for a zzso B zzso
