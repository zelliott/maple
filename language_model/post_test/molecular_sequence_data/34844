The zzso zzso is a key regulator of late zzso membrane transport and zzso zzso exerts zzso and spatial control over late zzso membrane transport through interactions with various zzso zzso Among zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex serves to regulate late zzso zzso signaling that is important for protein sorting and zzso zzso zzso In this chapter, zzso and methods for the characterization of the interactions and regulation of the zzso complex are zzso Using these methods we demonstrate the requirement for activated zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity on late zzso in zzso
