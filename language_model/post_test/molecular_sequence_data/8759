zzso zzso zzso is inserted into the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso by its zzso zzso sequence which also functions as an zzso retention zzso To analyze further potential retention signals of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso growth factor zzso a plasma membrane zzso and bacterial alkaline zzso a zzso protein were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso functioned as an zzso retention signal when placed at the N zzso of several reporter proteins but not when fused at the C zzso of the zzso domain of zzso growth factor zzso with or without a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in which the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso was zzso for that of zzso growth factor zzso were retained in the zzso indicating that an independent retention signal is present in the zzso part of zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso active which argues against zzso as the primary cause of zzso The zzso retention signal of the zzso domain could not be localized to a single zzso acid segment by deletion zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso contains zzso complex zzso retention signals in its zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that the function of the zzso signal is zzso
