Our present knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso structure derives from zzso made from its zzso acid sequence as established by studying the zzso To obtain direct experimental information, zzso hormone zzso zzso expressed in L cells was zzso in sufficient amounts to warrant analysis by mass zzso and zzso The mature zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso was zzso by using zzso zzso recognizing the hormone, whereas the zzso zzso precursor was zzso by use of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed that zzso of protein molecules started at zzso whereas zzso started at zzso All these molecules bound zzso suggesting that the most zzso region of the zzso does not participate in hormone zzso Six zzso sites have been predicted from the zzso acid zzso One of them zzso was found to be zzso in both the precursor and the mature zzso The most heavily zzso zzso was zzso followed by zzso and zzso These three sites accounted for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in the mature zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso The presence of some zzso molecules zzso at sites 99, zzso and 195 in zzso complexes dismisses a direct role of these zzso sites in hormone binding or in the correct folding of the zzso The mature zzso chains were homogeneous at position zzso zzso and 313 zzso of zzso zzso II activity at positions 174 and zzso absence of zzso zzso III and IV activity at position zzso zzso carbohydrates were present at sites 99 and zzso The latter, which is highly variable in zzso zzso is unlikely to participate in a direct interaction with zzso Site 313 thus remains as the main candidate for a role in hormone zzso
