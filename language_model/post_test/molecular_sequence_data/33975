The zzso of zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso and pathogen attack depends on the zzso zzso of zzso that make zzso fatty acids zzso available to zzso zzso The identity and number of the zzso involved in this process remain controversial and they probably differ among plant zzso Analysis of transgenic zzso zzso plants zzso zzso reduced in the expression of the zzso gene showed that this zzso zzso is a major supplier of zzso fatty acids for zzso acid zzso zzso in leaves and roots after wounding and simulated zzso but not during infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not essential for the zzso control of zzso zzso in flowers and for the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, it affected the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso early during infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was consistent with a rapid zzso of zzso and indicated that this zzso zzso different zzso classes as zzso The results revealed the complexity and specificity of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso highlighting the existence of zzso and zzso zzso
