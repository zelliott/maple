zzso is a type I zzso protein that functions as an zzso zzso zzso stress sensor to regulate global protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso syndrome zzso zzso an zzso zzso disorder characterized by diabetes, zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso To investigate the role of common genetic variation in zzso as a zzso of bone mineral density zzso and zzso we zzso all zzso and zzso regions, then zzso six potentially functional single zzso zzso zzso in this gene in zzso Amish subjects for association analysis, and attempted replication in zzso Mexican zzso We found that the minor zzso of a zzso zzso zzso had borderline associations with decreased zzso zzso in both discovery and replication zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for Mexican zzso A zzso indicated this association achieved statistical significance in the combined sample zzso p zzso zzso zzso corrected p zzso zzso zzso and three other potentially functional zzso a promoter zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed two zzso a zzso associated zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso and a common zzso A zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in zzso expression in zzso cell lines between the two zzso However, after treating zzso cell lines with zzso to induce zzso stress, cell lines with zzso B showed increased sensitivity to zzso stress zzso zzso zzso compared with cell lines with zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that common zzso sequence zzso in zzso have a modest effect on zzso stress response and may contribute to the risk for low zzso through this zzso
