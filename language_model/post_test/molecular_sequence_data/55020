In this study we investigated the zzso degradation by a zzso consortium obtained from a saline soil zzso This zzso named zzso could efficiently zzso zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso Since none of the zzso zzso could degrade zzso serial zzso were performed and resulted in a simple zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso culture named zzso which was shown to contain one zzso zzso strain and one zzso strain belonging to the zzso zzso zzso was shown to grow on zzso at zzso as high as zzso zzso zzso and similarly to zzso at the optimal zzso concentration of zzso zzso could degrade more than zzso of the amended zzso in zzso The comparison of the zzso range of the two consortiums showed that the simplified culture had lost the ability to degrade zzso but still could grow on other zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis by zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso acid and zzso were among the major zzso accumulated in the zzso culture media, indicating that an initial zzso step might proceed at C1 and C2 zzso By investigating the growth ability on various zzso along with the detection of zzso zzso zzso it was zzso that the zzso zzso strain had the central role in zzso degradation and the zzso strain played an auxiliary role in the culture by utilizing zzso zzso whose zzso in the media could be zzso
