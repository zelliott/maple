The emergence of viral infections with potentially devastating consequences for human health is highly dependent on their underlying evolutionary zzso One likely scenario for an avian influenza virus, such as zzso to evolve to one capable of zzso transmission is through the acquisition of genetic material from the zzso or zzso zzso already circulating in human zzso This would require that viruses of both zzso zzso the same cells, generating a mixed infection, and then zzso zzso the nature and frequency of mixed infection with influenza virus is therefore central to understanding the emergence of pandemic, zzso and drug-resistant zzso To better understand the potential for such events, we explored patterns of zzso genetic diversity in recently circulating strains of human influenza zzso By analyzing multiple viral zzso sequences sampled from individual influenza patients we reveal a high level of mixed infection, including diverse lineages of the same influenza virus zzso drug-resistant and zzso zzso those that are likely to differ in zzso and even viruses of different influenza virus types (A and zzso These results reveal that individuals can harbor influenza viruses that differ in major zzso properties, including those that are zzso distinct and those that differ in their sensitivity to zzso zzso
