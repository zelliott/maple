The first zzso single cells of carrot zzso zzso having the competence to form zzso in the presence of zzso acid zzso were identified using zzso cell zzso These competent cells are present as a small zzso of enlarged and zzso cells derived from zzso and rapidly zzso zzso cells that originate from the zzso elements of the zzso A search for marker genes to monitor the transition of zzso into competent and zzso cells in established suspension cell cultures resulted in the identification of a gene zzso expressed in a small zzso of the same enlarged single cells that are formed during the initiation of the zzso cultures from zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence and in zzso zzso zzso show that this gene encodes a zzso repeat containing zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed from cells expressing a zzso zzso reporter zzso During zzso zzso zzso expression ceased after the zzso zzso In plants, zzso zzso could only be detected zzso in the zzso zzso up to the early zzso stage but not in zzso flowers nor in any other plant zzso These results suggest that zzso cells competent to form zzso and early zzso zzso zzso share a highly specific signal zzso chain with the zzso zzso from shortly after zzso to the early zzso zzso
