A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the last zzso common to the zzso pathways for zzso and zzso was obtained from a library of zzso zzso zzso constructed in a zzso zzso by screening for zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli cells transformed with the zzso zzso zzso had high zzso activity, and this activity was markedly inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso for zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence exhibited similarity to sequences of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso of zzso contained a putative leader zzso for import into zzso zzso southern analysis indicated that the zzso whose zzso we cloned is zzso by a single gene in zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the level of expression of the gene in zzso leaves was zzso whereas it was low in roots and floral zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report for the cloning of a zzso for a plant zzso
