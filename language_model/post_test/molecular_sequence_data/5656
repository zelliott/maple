zzso zzso zzso zzso a tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso protects cells from zzso zzso To understand how zzso is zzso transient zzso of zzso gene zzso in zzso DNA binding zzso and in zzso zzso footprint zzso analysis were carried out on the zzso zzso zzso The results of this analysis identified a zzso region of zzso 2 that was responsive to zzso and zzso zzso This zzso response element zzso had the properties of a traditional zzso element that functioned in an zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso revealed zzso and zzso factor occupancy of sites that could bind zzso and zzso The zzso portion of the zzso bound zzso in zzso and was both necessary and sufficient for zzso responsiveness with the zzso promoter or with a zzso promoter when in an upstream zzso The 3' end of the zzso bound both zzso and zzso but was not necessary for zzso responsiveness with the zzso zzso However, this 3' portion of the zzso was required for the zzso to function as a downstream zzso with a zzso zzso These data functionally separate the zzso zzso into a region responsible for zzso zzso and one that mediates induction when it is downstream of a zzso
