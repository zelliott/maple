Two previously zzso features of zzso architecture are revealed by careful analysis of published zzso zzso zzso The extreme zzso of the zzso tail contains two highly zzso zzso sequences each of 15 zzso zzso with the consensus zzso plus another very closely related 7 zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contains sequences of consensus zzso or zzso which in some species are multiply zzso are probably zzso but are distinct from the more obvious zzso repeated zzso zzso related to both the zzso and zzso sequences are found in zzso zzso associated proteins zzso and zzso suggesting a further level of zzso and potential evolutionary relationship between zzso and these zzso associated zzso The possible significance of these findings is zzso
