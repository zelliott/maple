zzso zzso contains a zzso stability system called pas zzso addiction zzso which consists of two zzso a zzso antitoxin and a zzso zzso This system is closely related to the pas of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity for zzso and zzso zzso except that the pas of zzso contains a third zzso zzso As both zzso and zzso are highly zzso zzso plasmids isolated from bacteria that share a similar ecological zzso the plasmids are likely to encounter each zzso We investigated the relative efficiencies of the two stability systems and whether they had evolved apart sufficiently for each pas to stabilize a zzso in the presence of the zzso The zzso zzso pas was more efficient at stabilization of a zzso tester zzso than the two component pas of zzso in zzso coli host cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso after 100 generations, zzso The zzso antidote of each pas was unable to neutralize the zzso toxin of the other zzso The pas proteins of each zzso zzso their own expression as well as that of the pas of the other zzso The pas of zzso was more effective at zzso the pas zzso of zzso than the pas of zzso was able to repress itself or the pas of zzso This increased efficiency was not due to the zzso of zzso The effect of this stronger repression was that zzso displaced zzso when the two plasmids were zzso in the same zzso coli host zzso zzso curing resulted in the arrest of cell growth but did not cause cell death, and zzso stability was not influenced by the zzso coli zzso zzso
