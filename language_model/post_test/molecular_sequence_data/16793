zzso zzso zzso zzso are signaling molecules that regulate many cellular zzso We have previously identified an alternatively spliced zzso form of zzso that is expressed in rats and mice and named zzso Here we report that the same zzso event in humans and monkeys causes, due to sequence differences in the inserted zzso the production of an zzso zzso that zzso together with the zzso zzso Because of the differences of this zzso from zzso we named it zzso We found that its expression levels are about zzso of zzso zzso seems to be expressed in a wide variety of zzso and zzso Its zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso are slower than those of zzso which is probably the reason for its differential regulation in response to zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso which is increased with elevated cell density zzso with zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell density also causes enhanced zzso zzso which is facilitated by zzso of native zzso and is prevented by zzso zzso indicating that zzso mediates cell zzso zzso zzso The differential regulation of zzso extends the signaling specificity of zzso after stimulation by various zzso zzso
