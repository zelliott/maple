Two different zzso genes for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso have previously been characterized zzso zzso C zzso In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of a third zzso of C, from a human zzso zzso library, as well as the isolation of human zzso for C alpha and C zzso This third form of C, which we will designate C zzso is clearly derived from a distinct gene and shows a zzso zzso A close evolutionary relation between C gamma and C alpha was suggested by zzso zzso zzso inside the open reading frame, zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, the C gamma zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso C alpha zzso present at high levels in most human zzso as well as with a zzso zzso C zzso zzso which was only found at zzso levels in human zzso However, at the zzso acid level, C alpha and C beta showed a close relationship zzso zzso whereas C gamma zzso significantly from both C alpha zzso and C beta zzso Taken together with the zzso expression of C zzso this suggests a pressure on C gamma during evolution, acting to zzso it in a functionally specific zzso Certain zzso acid zzso make C gamma a distinct member of the zzso zzso of protein zzso and suggest that C gamma may be distinct in its protein zzso specificity or its interaction with the different regulatory zzso
