A full-length zzso clone zzso of the zzso zzso of a Korean isolate of Pepper zzso virus zzso was constructed downstream of a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter in the zzso In zzso zzso transcripts generated from zzso corresponded to zzso zzso zzso with an extra zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso tract at the 3' zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso cap analog zzso were highly infectious in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Early zzso Visible symptoms appeared at 4-5 days zzso at essentially the same time as occurred on these host plant species zzso with zzso zzso zzso induced by progeny virus of the transcripts were indistinguishable from zzso zzso on their experimental and natural zzso The gene zzso the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso was inserted between the coding regions for zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts of the resulting zzso zzso designated zzso were highly infectious and symptoms were not different from those induced by either transcripts of zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso expression could be detected earlier than zzso symptom in plants infected by zzso This study is the first report of the construction of a biologically active, full-length zzso copy of the Pepper zzso virus zzso zzso and the stable expression of a foreign gene within the modified zzso
