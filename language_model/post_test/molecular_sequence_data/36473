The finding that zzso for zzso and zzso zzso acids are generally zzso by zzso for zzso and zzso zzso acids respectively has led to a novel zzso The zzso peptides coded for by the complementary DNA strand of biologically active peptides are able to bind their active sense counterparts with high zzso zzso relationships have been observed in several zzso species as well as in zzso zzso The idea that zzso interactions are biologically relevant and indeed feasible among complex molecules zzso the examination of zzso cell zzso We propose such a zzso interaction exists between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso This interaction is at a site which may be occupied by the zzso zzso product zzso
