A remarkable property of the integral zzso zzso zzso IV zzso IV, CD 26) is its affinity to proteins of the zzso zzso zzso By in zzso binding zzso we have shown that zzso IV binds to zzso zzso to the zzso I and III, which are both characterized by the formation of large zzso zzso No binding of zzso IV to zzso or zzso could be zzso Within collagen I, the alpha zzso chain was found to be the most prominent binding zzso of zzso zzso A zzso anti zzso IV zzso zzso specifically inhibited the interaction of zzso IV with collagen zzso zzso mapping and zzso sequencing revealed that the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso is located in the zzso domain of zzso zzso We therefore conclude that the putative collagen binding site of zzso IV is different from the region of the zzso site containing the zzso activity, which is located at the zzso portion of the zzso
