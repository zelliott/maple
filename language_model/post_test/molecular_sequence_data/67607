zzso between zzso and zzso rice combined with zzso of ideal plant type has led to the development of high-yielding zzso rice in northern zzso However, the contribution at the zzso level of zzso zzso to the increased yield of northern Chinese zzso rice is zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso pedigree of descendants of zzso between zzso and zzso rice grown in northeastern China between 1963 and zzso zzso sequence repeat markers indicated that since 1990 the genetic diversity among northern zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso and zzso length zzso markers showed zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso bred after 1990, and were significantly positively correlated with zzso number per zzso and significantly zzso correlated with zzso number per zzso Among eight genes controlling zzso traits, zzso and zzso were partially fixed in the zzso of northern zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso is an important contributor to the increased yield of northern zzso zzso zzso for high yield and grain quality in combination is a complicated process and difficult to achieve when relying on only one or several functional zzso thus the selection expertise of the breeder remains zzso
