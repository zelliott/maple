zzso is a promising new compound for the treatment of tuberculosis that is currently undergoing human zzso Like its zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso class, requiring zzso zzso of an aromatic zzso group to exert an zzso zzso We have confirmed that resistance to zzso (a zzso and zzso (a zzso is most commonly zzso by loss of a specific zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso which together provide electrons for the reductive zzso of this class of zzso Although zzso and zzso are necessary for sensitivity to these compounds, they are not sufficient and require additional accessory proteins that directly interact with the zzso To understand more zzso events in the reductive zzso of zzso we examined zzso that were zzso for both zzso and zzso and found that, although these zzso had acquired high-level resistance to zzso (and another zzso they retained sensitivity to zzso (and a related zzso zzso comparative zzso sequencing of these zzso identified zzso in zzso a zzso hypothetical protein with no known zzso zzso with intact zzso fully restored sensitivity to zzso and restored the ability of zzso to metabolize zzso These results suggest that the sensitivity of zzso to zzso and related compounds is zzso by a protein that is highly specific for subtle structural variations in these zzso zzso
