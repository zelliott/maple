We present two examples of exponential zzso acid amplification with the zzso chain reaction zzso in the presence of only one amplification zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso products generated by amplification of human zzso DNA revealed that the amplified sequence contained only one primer and its complement, at the two ends of the zzso zzso Although these experiments were performed with zzso derived from the sequence of the prostate specific zzso zzso gene and the normal zzso zzso 1 gene zzso the amplified sequences were novel and had no zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso While both zzso and zzso genes reside on zzso zzso the amplified sequences were found by mapping to reside on zzso zzso and zzso zzso When we examined the mechanism of amplification by zzso using one primer in these two cases, we found that there was a high zzso between the zzso primer or the zzso primer and the two regions zzso the amplified sequence of zzso zzso or zzso This indicated that the single zzso or zzso primer could zzso on both strands of the DNA of that region, and mediate the exponential zzso Since this phenomenon occurred to us twice with a limited number of different zzso reactions performed in our laboratory zzso zzso we believe that it may represent a common artifact of zzso Moreover, it appears that the zzso primer binding sites can zzso to each other forming DNA zzso
