zzso zzso are members of an emerging class of proteins with a sequence motif zzso a parallel stack of two to four zzso The carp zzso protein forms a stack of four zzso whereas its zzso zzso appears to adopt a very stable stack of two zzso in zzso Here we determined a refined three-dimensional structure of this zzso zzso to examine potential zzso changes compared with the full-length zzso The structures were calculated with both a traditional method and a fast zzso method using ambiguous zzso distance zzso The resulting sets of structures are very similar and show that a zzso stack of two zzso is retained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the loss of the zzso zzso of the native protein are restricted to the zzso end of the zzso the turn connecting the two zzso and the zzso and zzso aromatic side zzso Further removal of the zzso and zzso zzso which are part of the first zzso and components of two major zzso clusters in the two zzso structure, results in the loss of the first zzso The second zzso which is closely associated with the first, retains a similar but somewhat less stable zzso The zzso presence of the second zzso and the dependence of its stability on the first zzso suggest that the stack of two zzso may be an evolutionary zzso and autonomous folding zzso In addition, the high zzso stability makes the stack of two zzso an attractive scaffold for the development of zzso drug zzso
