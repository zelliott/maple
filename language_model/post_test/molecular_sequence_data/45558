The mechanism by which zzso zzso instability is zzso zzso and zzso is currently under intense zzso We have investigated the potential role of altered zzso zzso patterns in the cellular response to zzso and have found evidence for widespread zzso of zzso zzso zzso up to 20 population zzso zzso Similar effects are seen with cells treated with medium from zzso cells (the zzso zzso rather than subjected to direct zzso Using an arbitrarily primed zzso sensitive zzso screening method we have demonstrated that zzso causes zzso zzso in the zzso profile of a human zzso cell line, zzso and have further zzso one of these sequences as being a member of a zzso element derived sequence family on zzso 7; zzso Multiple changes were also detected in the screen, which indicate that although the response of cells is predominantly zzso specific zzso occurs as zzso zzso specific changes are also reported in the zzso of the zzso zzso satellite zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso results in the induction of zzso zzso changes in zzso cells, and provides a link between the various zzso zzso of zzso instability, the perpetuation of the unstable state and several of its zzso
