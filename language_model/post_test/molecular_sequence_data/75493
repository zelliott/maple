The primary structure of the rat liver zzso zzso has been deduced from a single complementary DNA zzso The sequence begins with a putative 19 zzso acid signal zzso followed by the zzso zzso acid zzso that includes a single 24 zzso acid zzso zzso In spite of the fact that the zzso zzso has a much shorter zzso region than the growth hormone zzso there is strong localized sequence identity between these two receptors in both the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the two receptors originated from a common zzso
