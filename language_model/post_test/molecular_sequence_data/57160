It had previously been hypothesized that the ability of a small number of immunity protein molecules in the zzso membrane to zzso protection against the lethal effects of a zzso zzso involves a complex stabilized by zzso or polar interactions between immunity zzso the zzso channel, and specific sites on the zzso membrane surface defined by the presence of the zzso gene zzso zzso The hypothesis was tested zzso by constructing a hybrid zzso zzso zzso containing the E1 channel domain, and the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by altering charged zzso in all peripheral regions of the immunity protein to neutral zzso It was concluded that the specificity of immunity protein requires neither specific zzso zzso nor a specific arrangement of charged zzso in the immunity zzso zzso In addition, by making 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found at five different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on two proposed zzso zzso of the open zzso channel, one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso showed a larger bypass zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells caused by a bypass zzso but not zzso zzso It is concluded that the immunity protein exerts its specific effect through rapid lateral diffusion in the zzso membrane and zzso recognition and interaction with at least one zzso and one zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso implies that the immunity protein can react with the channel in the open zzso
