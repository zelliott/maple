Following zzso into the zzso zzso zzso wheat storage proteins are naturally either retained and packaged into protein bodies within this zzso or exported to the zzso zzso To identify protein zzso that control the sorting of wheat storage proteins within the zzso a zzso zzso storage protein as well as two of its deletion zzso each bearing either of the two autonomous zzso and zzso regions, were expressed in zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso region of the zzso which is composed of several tandem repeats of the consensus sequence zzso was entirely retained within the zzso and accumulated in dense protein zzso In contrast, the zzso autonomous region was efficiently zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso containing both regions, was zzso at a lower rate and less efficiently than its zzso zzso These results suggest that sorting of the wheat zzso within the zzso may be determined by a balance between two opposing zzso one functions in the retention and packaging of the storage protein within the zzso while the second renders the protein competent for export from this zzso to the zzso zzso
