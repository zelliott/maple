A comparative analysis was performed of the properties of cloned zzso and zzso receptors and their ability to induce zzso currents and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were injected with zzso that codes for rat zzso and zzso and bovine zzso receptors and membrane currents were recorded by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation was scored by observation of the zzso zzso breakdown zzso 

zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso generated zzso zzso currents by zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso of zzso zzso expressing rat zzso yielded larger zzso currents zzso zzso than those generated by zzso expressing bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing rat zzso were recovered from zzso after zzso h and completely after zzso zzso whereas zzso expressing bovine zzso receptors were unable to do zzso zzso of rat zzso generated smaller zzso currents zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors triggered zzso whereas zzso did zzso The proportion of zzso developing zzso was greater for zzso zzso than for zzso that were zzso Furthermore, zzso injected with zzso zzso into the media, a zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso This media zzso inward and outward membrane currents when applied to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso receptors couple to similar zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso activated by zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso
