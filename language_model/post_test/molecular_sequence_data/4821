zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso involved in the zzso of zzso hormones and is an important zzso in zzso zzso zzso Different zzso zzso species coding for zzso are present in zzso zzso including the species coding for a zzso acid protein zzso zzso and a second in which zzso 10 is deleted and which is 57 zzso shorter zzso zzso However, it is not known whether the smaller, zzso zzso is expressed as a protein in zzso zzso In zzso under reducing conditions, zzso appears in the zzso zzso and zzso protein preparations as a closely zzso double band of approximately 105 zzso zzso and 100 zzso (smaller zzso We investigated the presence of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue using rabbit zzso to three different synthetic peptides from zzso 10 zzso for zzso and a zzso rabbit and zzso zzso zzso (both of which are specific for the two forms of zzso The larger and smaller forms of zzso were zzso by zzso after gel zzso of highly zzso natural zzso from zzso zzso zzso Both of the zzso forms of zzso react with all three zzso 10 zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This shows that both forms of zzso contain zzso zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, the proportion of the larger and smaller forms of zzso varied in different zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the presence of the smaller zzso zzso in the zzso natural zzso preparation, affinity depletion of zzso using the zzso 10 zzso zzso was carried zzso The binding of zzso 10 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso fraction was considerably diminished in comparison to binding of zzso zzso suggesting the presence of small amounts zzso zzso of zzso expressed as a protein in zzso zzso Our results extend previous observations by showing that the alternatively spliced form of zzso in which zzso 10 is zzso is expressed at low levels in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirm that both the larger and smaller forms of zzso observed on gel zzso contain zzso suggesting that the difference is caused by zzso zzso The presence of small amounts of zzso in zzso zzso zzso argues for its role in zzso function, which remains to be zzso
