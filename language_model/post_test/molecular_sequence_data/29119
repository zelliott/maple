We report the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the marine zzso zzso zzso In this zzso the zzso displays an equal zzso pattern until the zzso zzso There, an zzso event takes place that sets up the bilateral zzso by specifying one of the four initially zzso vegetal zzso as the zzso pole of all subsequent zzso This zzso usually designated as zzso will subsequently act as an zzso We show that zzso expresses zzso as soon as its fate is zzso As reported for another zzso zzso zzso Lambert and zzso zzso Nagy (2001) Development zzso zzso we found that zzso determination and activity also involve the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and we further show that zzso expression in zzso requires zzso zzso zzso expression then rapidly spreads to zzso cells that cleave in a bilateral fashion and whose progeny will constitute the zzso edge of the zzso during zzso suggesting a role for zzso in regulating cell movements and zzso zzso in zzso Until the completion of zzso zzso expression is maintained at the zzso pole, and along the developing zzso zzso Comparing this expression pattern with what is known in other zzso we advocate that zzso might have a zzso role in the regulation of zzso patterning among zzso through the maintenance of a zzso growth zone, suggesting that a zzso mode of axis formation might be ancestral to the zzso
