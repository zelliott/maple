The general zzso factor zzso zzso recruitment of the zzso machinery to gene promoters and regulates initiation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso interacts with and serves as a zzso for multiple zzso regulatory zzso including zzso and zzso A zzso zzso screen has identified an interaction between zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso protein whose function has been implicated in gene zzso We find that zzso associates with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso but not zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso and components of zzso in zzso nuclear extracts associate with zzso zzso and zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso box compromises the interaction of zzso with zzso We demonstrate that zzso proteins interfere with zzso zzso of zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso associate with zzso to mediate repression of transcription, supporting a new model of zzso repression involving a specific interaction between a component of zzso and zzso
