The molecular events that regulate differentiation of human colon zzso cells are not zzso Although a number of in zzso models to study this question exist, none have identified a gene product which could function as a zzso of cell zzso Although the zzso gene is frequently zzso in human colon cancer, the zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the most differentiated cells of zzso zzso In order to study the effects of zzso gene zzso on the differentiation zzso in human colon cancer cells, we have expressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This maneuver resulted in a marked induction of gene expression of multiple markers characteristic of zzso brush border zzso These include a zzso or zzso zzso induction of zzso a zzso increase in zzso alkaline zzso a zzso induction of transforming growth factor zzso and a zzso increase in transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso cells undergo a zzso or zzso zzso reduction in DNA synthesis under zzso conditions and cannot be zzso after such treatment, suggesting terminal zzso whereas the same treatment has no effect on the zzso capacity of the parent zzso cell zzso These studies with zzso human colon cancer cells provide a model to study the role of zzso and related genes in colon zzso zzso
