zzso initiation of class II genes is one of the major targets for the regulation of gene expression and is carried out by zzso zzso II and many auxiliary factors, which include general zzso initiation factors zzso zzso one of the zzso functions at the later stage of zzso zzso As recent studies indicated the possibility that zzso may have a role in zzso zzso regulation, we isolated zzso factors which have zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso screening system, we isolated the zzso part of the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a general zzso zzso The zzso part of human zzso directly interacts with zzso and zzso also interacts with zzso zzso thus indicating the existence of an zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso interaction of zzso and zzso was examined using a conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso of cold sensitivity of the zzso zzso strain, and in zzso binding zzso revealed that zzso zzso protein showed diminished binding affinity to zzso 

These observations indicate that general zzso initiation factor zzso functionally interacts with general zzso factor zzso a finding which provides new insight into the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso This may well lead to a breakthrough in relationships between the zzso initiation process and structural changes in zzso
