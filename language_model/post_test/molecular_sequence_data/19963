Solar zzso operate only for short dry periods of the year in the north shore of the zzso Sea because of its relatively humid and cold Mediterranean zzso In a previous paper, we showed that the zzso zzso ponds zzso of Northern zzso zzso zzso have different zzso populations from those typically found in dry and hot climates such as Southern zzso To check whether there is a common pattern of zzso diversity in these less extreme conditions, diversity in zzso of other zzso solar zzso in zzso Croatia was zzso by molecular and culture zzso In addition, the zzso approach was used to further describe zzso diversity in both zzso Over the period of two solar salt collection seasons, zzso related to species of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recovered from both zzso Within the same sampling effort, relatives of the zzso zzso and a zzso isolate were cultivated from zzso zzso zzso while zzso related zzso were obtained from the Croatian zzso zzso zzso with our previous findings, a library of Croatian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes was dominated by sequences related to the zzso zzso The microbial community structure was similar in both zzso but diversity zzso showed greater values in zzso zzso when compared with Croatian zzso
