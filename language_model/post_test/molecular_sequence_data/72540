The zzso gene was initially identified by a zzso cloning approach as a highly expressed transcript in the mouse embryonic zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso indicated that it can zzso a protein of approximately 103 zzso consisting of a zzso and zzso binding domain, three putative zzso interaction zzso (the WW zzso and a zzso region similar to the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso In mouse zzso the expression of zzso in the central nervous system is highest during zzso and decreases as development zzso In addition to the central nervous system, the expression of zzso is detected in various embryonic zzso and persists in most adult zzso Using an zzso raised against a fusion zzso we show that zzso protein is localized to the cellular zzso We have mapped the mouse zzso gene to zzso 9 using an zzso zzso zzso zzso maps to a previously defined zzso region between human and mouse zzso and thus provides additional information regarding zzso comparative zzso
