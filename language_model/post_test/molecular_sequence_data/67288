Advances in DNA sequencing technology have improved our ability to characterize most zzso zzso However, accurate resolution of large structural events is challenging because of the short read lengths of second-generation zzso zzso sequencing technologies, which can yield longer zzso reads, have the potential to address limitations associated with zzso zzso Here we combine sequencing data from second- and third-generation DNA sequencing technologies to assemble the zzso zzso of a recent zzso zzso outbreak strain into two nearly finished zzso at zzso zzso Complex regions with clinically relevant structure were completely zzso In separate control zzso on experimental and simulated data for the zzso zzso zzso reference strain, we obtained 14 scaffolds of greater than 1 zzso for the experimental data and 8 scaffolds of greater than 1 zzso for the simulated data, which allowed us to correct several errors in zzso assembled from the zzso data zzso This work provides a blueprint for the next generation of rapid microbial identification and zzso zzso
