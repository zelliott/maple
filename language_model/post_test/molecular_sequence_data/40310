zzso parallel sequencing has provided a more affordable and zzso method to study microbial communities, although it has mostly been used in an exploratory zzso We combined zzso with a strict indicator species statistical analysis to test if bacteria specifically responded to ethanol injection that successfully promoted zzso zzso reduction in the subsurface of a uranium contamination plume at the Oak Ridge Field Research Center in zzso zzso was achieved with a zzso flow control consisting of an inner loop, where ethanol was injected, and an outer loop for zzso zzso This strategy reduced uranium zzso in groundwater to levels below zzso zzso and created zzso zzso in electron donors from the zzso injection well toward the outer loop and zzso flow zzso Our analysis with 15 zzso samples from the entire test area found significant indicator species that showed a high degree of adaptation to the three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterized areas with low zzso heavy metals, and low zzso while zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso were indicators of areas where zzso reduction zzso The abundance of these bacteria, as well as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso connectivity to the zzso injection site, suggesting that the selected populations were a direct response to electron donor addition by the groundwater flow zzso A zzso approach was implemented to discard zzso results by chance, given the large amount of data zzso
