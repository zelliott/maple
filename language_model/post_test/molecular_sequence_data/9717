The abundant, zzso molecular zzso of zzso cells, of which zzso zzso is a member, have central roles in protein folding pathways in zzso Although substantial information is now available on zzso interactions and zzso activity, neither the crystal structure of the intact zzso zzso nor its isolated zzso domain is zzso Recently, the crystal structure of the isolated zzso domain of an evolutionary relative of zzso zzso the zzso protein of zzso coli, was zzso We have generated several rat zzso zzso using zzso and cassette zzso guided by secondary structure predictions to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have similar molecular zzso zzso properties along with the zzso and zzso binding activities of the resulting zzso proteins were zzso zzso analyses included one- and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso The results of our study suggest that the zzso molecular structure is a useful working model for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence is provided that zzso small additions to the N zzso of zzso alter the function of the zzso domain, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso result in dramatic increases in zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso substitution of a zzso zzso segment compensates for changes at the C zzso to restore zzso function, zzso specific side chain interactions involving this zzso segment are not required for zzso zzso activity, and zzso disruption of the cap zzso region zzso zzso binding by zzso
