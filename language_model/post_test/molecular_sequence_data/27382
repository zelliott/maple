Human zzso zzso causes cervical cancer and external zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to document the zzso distribution of zzso in females aged between 18 and 34 who zzso to an zzso clinic with visible external zzso warts zzso zzso were taken from visible external zzso warts zzso These scrapings were zzso by zzso for the presence of zzso zzso Positive samples were then zzso by means of a commercially available zzso zzso A comparison of zzso results determined by the zzso zzso and direct zzso DNA sequencing was also zzso 

zzso patients out of 105 samples zzso had zzso levels of zzso zzso The majority of individuals with zzso zzso showed the presence of two or more zzso The most common zzso zzso present in the study population were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Potential effects of vaccination on zzso molecular epidemiology indicate that zzso of the patients could have been protected from the high risk zzso zzso and zzso 

This is the first report of the molecular epidemiology of external zzso warts in women aged between 18 and 34 from Ireland based on results from a zzso zzso The study shows that most individuals are infected with multiple zzso including those with high zzso potential and that the newly available zzso vaccines could have a significant impact on prevalence of the most common zzso zzso in this study zzso
