The complete sequence of the zzso wine zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined and zzso It is an extremely compact linear zzso containing the shortest functional region ever found in zzso (11 zzso zzso zzso flanked by Type 2 zzso zzso zzso The latter contained a zzso zzso region and tandem repeats of zzso zzso In consequence, a population of zzso molecules that differed at the number of their zzso reiterations was zzso The functional region of the zzso zzso coded for 32 zzso which included seven zzso of respiratory complexes and zzso zzso (the genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso were zzso two zzso and 23 zzso genes which recognized zzso for all zzso zzso A single zzso interrupted the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso A number of reasons contributed towards its zzso small size, zzso zzso the remarkable size reduction (by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso that most zzso genes and five of the seven zzso genes were the shortest among known zzso zzso and zzso that the zzso regions were restricted to zzso of the zzso In addition, the zzso showed multiple changes in the orientation of zzso and the gene order differed drastically from other zzso When all protein coding gene sequences were considered as one unit and were compared with the corresponding molecules from all other complete zzso of zzso the zzso trees constructed robustly supported its placement zzso to the zzso species of the zzso zzso demonstrating the advantage of this approach over zzso or zzso approaches of zzso zzso
