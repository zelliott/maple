To determine the contribution of copy number variation zzso in the regulation of complement zzso zzso locus to the development of age-related zzso zzso zzso 

A multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso was developed to zzso the number of copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with zzso and without zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso and the impact on zzso risk was zzso 

Eight unique combinations of copy number variation were observed in the zzso zzso Combined deletion of zzso and zzso was protective zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso against zzso and was observed in 88 (82 zzso with one zzso 6 zzso with two zzso subjects with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with one zzso 19 zzso with two zzso subjects without zzso Other deletions were much less common: zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso combined zzso zzso 18 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined zzso and zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso deletion was observed on a common protective zzso while the others appeared to have arisen on multiple different zzso 

We found copy number variations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Combined deletion of zzso and zzso was associated with a decreased risk of developing zzso Other deletions were not sufficiently common to have a statistically zzso impact on the risk of zzso and zzso were not zzso
