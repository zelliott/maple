The zzso and zzso protein families form zzso zzso factors that play a central role in the expression of cell zzso zzso The crystal structure of an zzso complex shows that the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins both have a fold related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the central zzso sequence of the consensus zzso site is zzso and zzso acids that contact these bases are zzso among all known zzso and zzso zzso The asymmetry in the extended binding site zzso is associated with an zzso extension of zzso in which an zzso binds in the minor groove near the zzso zzso This zzso is zzso among zzso but not present in zzso zzso and zzso interact through an extensive zzso zzso and structural features of this interface suggest it contributes to the preference for zzso over zzso in DNA zzso
