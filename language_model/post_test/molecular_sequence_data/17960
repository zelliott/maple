We report isolation and zzso zzso acid sequencing of three style zzso which segregate with three S zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso were expressed mainly in the upper part of the zzso and showed an increasing concentration during flower zzso The zzso were zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso exchange fast protein liquid zzso The amount of zzso recovered from style extracts varied from zzso to zzso zzso per style, which was zzso of the amount recovered by a simplified zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso within the zzso zzso terminal zzso These zzso acid sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
