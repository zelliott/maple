Many human zzso syndromes have unique zzso consequences, but in most instances it is unclear whether these zzso are attributable to zzso in the dosage of specific zzso In human zzso 13, there is delayed switching and persistence of fetal zzso zzso and zzso of embryonic zzso in zzso Using partial zzso cases, we mapped this trait to zzso band zzso by examining the genes in this region, two zzso zzso and zzso appear as top candidates for the elevated zzso zzso Indeed, increased expression of these zzso in primary human zzso zzso cells results in elevated fetal and embryonic zzso gene zzso Moreover, we show that a direct target of these zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the fetal and embryonic zzso zzso Thus we demonstrate how the zzso regulation of a clinically important human trait can be better understood through the genetic and functional study of zzso syndromes and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may be important therapeutic targets to increase zzso levels in patients with zzso cell disease and zzso
