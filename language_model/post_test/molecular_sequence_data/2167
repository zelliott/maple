A zzso zzso outer membrane protein zzso zzso zzso strain zzso in contrast to its protein zzso parent strain zzso was unable to grow on zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 broth zzso Laboratories, Detroit, zzso zzso of high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso permitted growth of strain zzso at rates approaching those of the parent strain zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso shorter and had a zzso smaller zzso area than did the parent strain growing at similar rates on the same zzso These properties of the zzso zzso were analogous to those previously observed for zzso coli zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we compared zzso zzso protein F and the zzso coli zzso zzso In addition to many similarities previously zzso sequence alignment demonstrated substantial zzso acid sequence zzso throughout the zzso zzso to 180 zzso acids of the two zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso reacted on Western blots zzso with protein zzso zzso of protein F from the cloned zzso gene in an zzso coli zzso zzso double zzso resulted in a zzso increase in cell length and a zzso increase in zzso area compared with values for the same zzso containing only the zzso zzso onto which the zzso gene had been zzso These results favor a structural role for zzso zzso protein F and suggest that it is strongly related to the zzso coli zzso zzso
