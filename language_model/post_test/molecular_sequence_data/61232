zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is believed to be a zzso central to zzso of septic zzso zzso a zzso within the zzso gene promoter, has been associated with enhanced zzso production and negative outcome in some severe zzso 

To investigate the frequency of the zzso zzso in patients with septic shock and to determine whether the zzso is associated with the occurrence and outcome of septic zzso 

zzso zzso study conducted from March 1996 to June zzso 

Seven medical intensive care units in university zzso 

zzso patients with septic shock and 87 healthy unrelated blood zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso among patients with septic shock and among those who died and the level of corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso among patients with septic shock was zzso consistent with the predicted mortality from the zzso Acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the controls and the patients with septic shock differed only at the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso in the septic shock and control groups, respectively, P zzso Among the septic shock patients, zzso zzso frequency was significantly greater among those who had died zzso vs zzso in the survival group, P zzso zzso of zzso were higher in zzso and zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, but their median values zzso zzso vs 29 zzso were not statistically different zzso zzso zzso After controlling for age and the probability of death, derived by the zzso II score, multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that, for the same rank of zzso II value, patients with the zzso zzso had a zzso risk of death zzso confidence zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is strongly associated with zzso to septic shock and death due to septic zzso
