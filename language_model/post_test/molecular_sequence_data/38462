zzso genetic studies were carried out on three zzso of zzso zzso (from Kenya, Tanzania and South zzso and three zzso of zzso zzso (from South Africa and zzso from zzso zzso and from a zzso zzso A probe zzso specific for zzso zzso was obtained by screening a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was zzso zzso in length with an AT content of zzso The sequence is present approximately 200 times per zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso III zzso zzso of the three zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso patterns of the zzso from Kenya and Tanzania were identical and that they differed from that of the isolate from South Africa, indicating the presence of zzso in this zzso A zzso zzso library of zzso zzso was also screened, and one clone zzso was found to be specific for zzso DNA by dot zzso but Southern zzso analysis of DNA samples from eight zzso showed different zzso signals for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No differences in the zzso sequences of the expansion segment V were observed for the zzso zzso zzso However, they differed from those of zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in Africa south of the zzso and its genetic relationship with zzso zzso remain unclear and warrant detailed zzso
