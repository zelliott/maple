zzso peptides are generated in insects exposed to pathogens for combating zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso protein whose expression is induced in the zzso and fat body cells of zzso zzso larvae exposed to zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the role of zzso during zzso zzso We found that zzso expression is induced in zzso zzso zzso infected with the zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso Two zzso genes were cloned using zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso larvae that were zzso infected with zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso tags were incorporated to facilitate zzso isolation, detection and functional zzso The zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso with the two zzso expression plasmids and affinity zzso zzso proteins reduced the quantity of infectious zzso zzso as measured in zzso by plaque zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of affinity column zzso zzso protein caused zzso to be rapidly released from zzso zzso comprised of zzso but not from zzso made up of zzso suggesting that zzso interaction with zzso is rapid and affected by membrane zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso release activities of zzso increased with higher zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso protein that interacts with zzso zzso to cause the contents to be zzso
