zzso class switch zzso zzso occurs by a B zzso zzso zzso process between switch zzso We have developed a zzso transient zzso zzso for zzso to test for the presence of zzso switch zzso The plasmids are novel in that they lack a zzso origin of DNA zzso The zzso activity of these switch zzso is restricted to a subset of B cell lines that support zzso switching on their zzso zzso and to zzso normal zzso B zzso The factors required for zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso B cells and in B cell lines capable of zzso undergoing zzso zzso on their zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso that induce switching on the zzso induce accessibility rather than switch zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence for two distinct switching activities which independently mediate zzso and zzso zzso
