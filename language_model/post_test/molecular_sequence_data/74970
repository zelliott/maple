The level of transcripts zzso the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso was determined during embryonic development in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and delta zzso of the zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso libraries using zzso zzso zzso as zzso The zzso zzso zzso have greater than zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to their zzso zzso and zzso to transcripts that are restricted to the zzso of developing zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that a zzso transcript zzso to the alpha zzso zzso a zzso transcript zzso to the gamma zzso zzso and that two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the delta zzso zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrate that transcripts zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso are zzso expressed at late zzso and that the amount of each transcript increases in parallel with zzso zzso zzso during the ensuing 12 zzso After the onset of muscle activity the level of zzso zzso per zzso remains relatively constant, whereas the level of alpha zzso and delta zzso transcripts decrease fourfold per zzso and the level of gamma zzso transcript decreases greater than zzso per zzso The decrease in amount of zzso transcripts per zzso however, occurs when zzso are paralyzed with local zzso during their zzso These results demonstrate that zzso transcripts in zzso are initially expressed zzso but that gamma zzso transcript levels are regulated differently than alpha and delta at later zzso Moreover, these results demonstrate that zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso muscle cells are not responsive to electrical activity and suggest that zzso transcript levels are influenced by other regulatory zzso
