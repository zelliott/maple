zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests a structure with 12 zzso zzso zzso presumed to be zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso have been raised against regions of the zzso zzso which each recognize a zzso of zzso 40 zzso in rat zzso The zzso of rat zzso was investigated by studying the zzso fragments derived from zzso zzso of the protein in intact rat zzso and leaky zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso was prevented on treatment of leaky zzso but not intact cells, with zzso Y, indicating that the zzso of the protein is zzso zzso zzso Treatment of intact cells in saline buffer with zzso zzso zzso and zzso K (up to 1 zzso resulted in no degradation of zzso indicating the absence of any large exposed zzso zzso In a buffer of low zzso strength zzso zzso zzso was observed with zzso at an zzso site, probably zzso Treatment of leaky zzso with low (less than 100 zzso zzso of several zzso resulted in fragmentation of zzso reflecting zzso at the zzso face of the zzso These treatments generated zzso fragments of apparent molecular mass zzso 17-19 zzso that were resistant to further zzso The zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso were either lost from the membrane or destroyed under most of these conditions, indicating that these regions of the protein are located in the zzso zzso More detailed structural prediction analysis of zzso sequences was made assuming the constraints placed upon the possible arrangements by the experimental data outlined zzso This analysis provided additional strong evidence for the zzso model, with zzso zzso and zzso ends and a large internal loop between zzso and zzso The predicted zzso were assigned moments of zzso and zzso zzso for a number of TM segments this permitted the prediction of the sides of the zzso that faced membrane zzso and the interior of the zzso
