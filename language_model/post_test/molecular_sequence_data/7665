There is increasing evidence for a relationship between specific zzso zzso and the distinctive features of zzso including the course and the response to zzso In Philadelphia zzso positive chronic zzso leukemia zzso the zzso fusion genes can be transcribed in at least two different zzso that can either include zzso or exclude zzso the zzso 3 of the major zzso cluster region in zzso zzso We identified by zzso chain reaction the transcript type in 146 patients with zzso zzso who were enrolled in a prospective study of treatment with zzso zzso for at least 1 year, and were followed for 39 to 84 months zzso 60 zzso The transcript was zzso in 84 cases zzso and zzso in 62 cases zzso A trend in favor of zzso cases was observed, as to the zzso response after 1 year of zzso treatment zzso in the zzso cases vs zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso survival rate, that was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cases vs 57% zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, these differences were not zzso and we conclude that the identification of the transcript type by current methodology does not predict for response to zzso and for zzso Further studies may be required to confirm that conclusion, or to detect a true smaller zzso
