The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso channels are zzso by a single zzso zzso Although these channels differ in the zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso the mechanism underlying these differences remains to be zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso transcript have been zzso to contribute to the respective properties, however, the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso channels have not been zzso To explore zzso zzso zzso we aimed at cloning zzso from isolated mouse zzso cells using zzso reverse zzso because in zzso cells zzso currents dominate over the whole currents zzso with zzso currents zzso As a result, two novel zzso zzso were zzso Compared with the previously cloned mouse zzso two novel zzso had additional 48 zzso acids at the zzso zzso six single zzso acid changes, and zzso variations at the zzso zzso boundary, which produced different zzso zzso Furthermore, one zzso had one zzso editing zzso However, zzso and pharmacological studies indicated that these zzso did not generate zzso current in cultured zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may exist but that zzso processing or modification by zzso interacting proteins is also required for generating the zzso zzso
