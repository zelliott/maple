A total of zzso zzso acid bacteria zzso were isolated from zzso and screened for zzso zzso One zzso zzso strain zzso 20 produced a zzso that not only inhibited closely related zzso but also some food-borne pathogens including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso was zzso even at zzso temperature zzso degrees C for 15 zzso and was active over a wide pH range zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso K but not other zzso The zzso spectrum and some characteristics of this zzso were nearly identical to that of zzso The gene zzso this zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of this gene showed identical sequences to zzso Z as indicated by the substitution of zzso zzso instead of zzso at position zzso The ability of the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented zzso
