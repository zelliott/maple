zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso coli are critical for zzso binding and zzso and the two zzso are in close proximity and zzso By using a functional zzso construct with two tandem factor zzso zzso sites in the zzso loop between zzso IV and zzso it is shown here that zzso zzso in place of zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso spontaneously form zzso bonds in zzso indicating that this region of zzso zzso IV and V is in the zzso zzso To determine if the local structure or environment is zzso by the presence of an zzso charge, either zzso or zzso or both were replaced with Ala, and zzso between the zzso pair zzso was zzso Ala replacement for zzso causes a marked decrease in zzso while Ala replacement for zzso alone or for both zzso and zzso has little zzso The data provide strong support for the argument that zzso and zzso are within close proximity and suggest that an zzso zzso at position 126 causes a structural change at the interface between zzso IV and zzso
