An attenuated form of familial zzso zzso coli, zzso causes relatively few zzso zzso but still carries a significant risk of colon zzso The zzso zzso responsible for this attenuated zzso have been mapped in several families to the zzso zzso coli zzso locus on human zzso zzso Four distinct zzso in the zzso gene have now been identified in seven zzso zzso These zzso that predict zzso products, either by single base pair changes or zzso are similar to zzso identified in families with classical zzso However, they differ in that the four zzso sites are located very close to one another and zzso the zzso end of the zzso gene than any base zzso or small deletions yet discovered in patients with classical zzso
