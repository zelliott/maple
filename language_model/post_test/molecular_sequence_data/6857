zzso zzso is zzso for many of the activities of zzso zzso and, as well as suppressing the development of zzso zzso zzso cells, has been reported to block directly the synthesis of zzso in human zzso However, zzso transgenic mice produce increased amounts of zzso as well as zzso We have compared the ability of rat zzso to regulate zzso zzso in short-term cultures of zzso cells with its effect on the differentiation of T zzso into zzso or zzso zzso zzso rat zzso cells were zzso using a variety of zzso and zzso zzso with or without zzso for zzso zzso and the levels of zzso in the zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show that when normal rat zzso were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso A zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso of zzso after zzso zzso This enhancement was also apparent when zzso from animals zzso 10 days previously with zzso zzso were zzso with zzso in zzso and appeared to be zzso primarily via zzso T zzso In contrast, when zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso addition of zzso had no effect on the amount of zzso zzso When zzso were zzso with Con A for 4 days in the presence of zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was greatly zzso Our results indicate that zzso exerts differential effects on zzso zzso and on the development of zzso zzso
