We report the successful combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso in order to isolate full-length zzso corresponding to genes activated in tobacco cells treated with zzso within 60 zzso Cloning and sequencing of two zzso called zzso zzso and zzso zzso (for tobacco zzso allowed the identification of open reading zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed significant zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso started 30 zzso after the addition of zzso to tobacco cell suspensions and continued up to 180 zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso corresponding zzso was zzso between 30 and 60 zzso These results indicated a zzso zzso of the corresponding genes early after zzso of tobacco cells by zzso The biological significance of this zzso remains to be zzso
