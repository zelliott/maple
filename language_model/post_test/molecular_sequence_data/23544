zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso membrane proteins that have evolved from a single ancestral protein zzso zzso found in zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause a neural tube zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso Studies in model organisms indicate that zzso proteins play a key zzso role in establishing zzso cell polarity zzso and in regulating zzso extension zzso movements during zzso The role of zzso in these processes is virtually unknown, and the molecular function of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso is poorly zzso Using a zzso zzso system, zzso zzso pull-down and zzso zzso we show that both mouse zzso and zzso physically interact with the three members of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso This interaction is shown to require both the predicted zzso zzso half of zzso and a portion of the zzso protein containing zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we show that the two known zzso zzso zzso identified in two independent zzso zzso associated with neural tube defects impair binding to zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the neural tube zzso seen in zzso zzso Our observations indicate that zzso zzso properties parallel those of zzso and that zzso might, therefore, participate in zzso and zzso either in concert with zzso or independently of zzso in discrete cell zzso
