The seven zzso different zzso zzso are highly potent protein toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral zzso zzso The activated toxins consist of the zzso zzso (Mr approximately zzso linked by a zzso bond to the zzso zzso (Mr approximately zzso We have established the complete sequence of zzso zzso type A zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Mr zzso zzso and a partial sequence of zzso zzso type E zzso zzso acid zzso as deduced from the corresponding zzso sequences of the zzso located structural zzso The promoter of the zzso gene is inactive in zzso zzso zzso extension experiments indicated that initiation of zzso of the zzso gene occurred 118 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso A comparison of the protein sequence revealed an overall identity of zzso to that of zzso zzso No significant similarity to other known proteins including zzso toxins could be zzso Three of the six zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso were found in the zzso sequence zzso within a domain of predicted zzso secondary zzso This motif is also found in similar positions of the zzso of zzso toxin and zzso
