We examined the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the life cycle of zzso zzso The zzso forms of zzso zzso the long slender and short zzso zzso have inactive zzso with no zzso zzso zzso The insect form of zzso zzso the zzso zzso has fully functional zzso zzso c is zzso zzso in the zzso forms of zzso but during differentiation to the zzso form, zzso detected zzso c accumulates zzso We have zzso zzso zzso zzso c and raised zzso that react to both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we isolated a partial zzso to zzso zzso zzso An examination of protein expression and zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso did not express zzso c but maintained significant zzso levels of zzso c zzso The results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso c is zzso regulated by a zzso mechanism which prevents either translation or zzso of zzso c in the zzso zzso
