zzso DNA zzso and zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso mosquitoes were examined to investigate zzso and zzso variation amongst the members of the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and D3 zzso and a zzso locus zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso zzso Form B and Form C collected in Chiang Mai Province, zzso The results show that the consensus sequences of the four zzso of the two forms are consistent with those of mosquitoes in the zzso zzso No zzso variation was zzso but zzso variation was present with zzso sequences in some forms for each gene zzso The variation rates were approximately zzso to zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso Form B and Form C in Chiang zzso Thailand are zzso In this study, the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso is reported for the first zzso The region showed a high variation rate zzso zzso compared to the closely related species zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that this zzso locus may provide sequence information to differentiate the members of the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso
