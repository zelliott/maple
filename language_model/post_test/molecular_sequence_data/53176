zzso zzso of the zzso type zzso zzso for cell wall assembly and prevent synthesis of zzso precursors ending in zzso The zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso consists of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three genes are sufficient for zzso zzso encodes a zzso that zzso the zzso zzso for addition to zzso zzso encodes a zzso that zzso zzso and removes zzso from zzso and zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that provides zzso for the synthetic zzso The three genes are zzso the start zzso of zzso and zzso overlap the termination zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Two genes which zzso proteins with zzso to the zzso zzso regulatory system were present downstream from the resistance zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibited 50% identity to zzso and zzso identity to zzso zzso had zzso identity to zzso over a region of 308 zzso acids and zzso identity to zzso over a region of 285 zzso zzso All zzso with important functions in response regulators and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments based on the determination of zzso activity in zzso extracts confirmed that the genes were expressed zzso Using a zzso zzso regions upstream from the resistance and regulatory genes were identified that have promoter zzso
