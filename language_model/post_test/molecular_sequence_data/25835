In order to facilitate the use of zzso vaccines, we have identified and analyzed the parameters that affect their zzso As a model system we used synthetic peptides zzso containing sequences from the zzso zzso tandem repeat region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso protein preparations zzso of zzso outer membrane proteins zzso since we have previously shown that high levels of zzso zzso can be zzso in mice by use of this novel zzso system zzso et zzso zzso We have now examined these preparations by zzso zzso and measured their ability to elicit an zzso response in zzso zzso zzso of freshly mixed zzso and zzso without dialysis, produced a limited number of small complexes, whereas dialysis of the mixture for 4 d yielded zzso sized complexes that became more homogeneous when the dialysis was carried out for 7 or 10 zzso The most homogeneous of these zzso complexes zzso zzso for 10 zzso induced substantial levels of zzso zzso in mice, and shorter periods of dialysis resulted in vaccines that induced zzso lower zzso Analysis of a series of preparations with varying zzso zzso ratios zzso showed that the degree of zzso substitution of the zzso was zzso zzso to the rate of zzso of the complexes and that there exists an optimal degree of zzso zzso to the zzso Our results suggest that the parameters affecting the zzso of the zzso complexes are: zzso zzso density, and zzso size of the zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso zzso may serve as a rapidly performed zzso of zzso zzso
