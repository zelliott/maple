The zzso sequence of the class G zzso resistance zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso has been zzso Two open reading frames of divergent polarity were zzso A resistance gene zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso gene zzso zzso encodes a protein consisting of 210 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid zzso the proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are about zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and about 50% zzso with zzso zzso zzso The relationship of the zzso zzso sequence to five known zzso resistance zzso zzso A to zzso is zzso
