zzso zzso zzso leaves accumulate a mixture of at least eight different zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso These natural products taste intensely sweet and have similar zzso origins to those of zzso acid zzso The initial steps leading to the formation of zzso result from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso via the action of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso probably uses the same mechanism although the genes and zzso from zzso zzso that are involved in the zzso of zzso have not been zzso We have isolated both the zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso and zzso were zzso active, suggesting that the zzso and zzso genes participate in zzso zzso The genes coding for zzso and zzso are usually present in single copies in most plant species and their expression is normally low and limited to rapidly growing zzso The zzso gene has been duplicated in the zzso zzso zzso and both the zzso and zzso genes are highly expressed in mature leaves, a pattern opposite to that found with zzso zzso This pattern may, at least in part, lead to zzso and spatial separation of zzso and zzso zzso and probably helps to prevent zzso from interfering with normal zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso are part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso has recruited two genes to secondary metabolism from a highly regulated zzso involved in hormone zzso
