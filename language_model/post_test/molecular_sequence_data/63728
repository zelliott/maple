zzso such as zzso bacteria and especially zzso are highly variable even within an individual host, intensifying the difficulty of distinguishing and accurately zzso numerous zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso acid zzso The majority of currently available techniques are based on real-time zzso or primer extension and often require zzso adjustments that impose a practical limitation of the number of zzso that can be monitored simultaneously at a single zzso 

Here, we describe a novel method that allows the simultaneous zzso of numerous zzso zzso in a single reaction tube and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso begins with a single zzso amplification step using a pair of zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso Next, zzso products are submitted to zzso sequencing with a zzso primer located upstream of the zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso shows numerous specific diagnostic peaks, attributable to specific zzso signifying their zzso in the DNA zzso Moreover, peak zzso can be zzso and used to estimate the frequency of the corresponding zzso in the DNA zzso Using engineered zzso markers in the zzso of zzso mosaic virus, we reliably monitored six different viral zzso in DNA extracted from infected zzso zzso of the intrinsic zzso of this method, as applied to both artificial zzso DNA mixes and viral zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso is a robust and reliable method of detection and zzso for zzso with a relative frequency of between zzso and zzso 

This simple method is easily zzso to many other biological systems and questions, including those involving high zzso analysis, and can be performed in any laboratory since it does not require specialized zzso
