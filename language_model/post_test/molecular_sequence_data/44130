The cloning and molecular genetic analysis of a locus mapping within the zzso gene zzso complex of zzso zzso is zzso A copy of the zzso element zzso was located in a zzso stretch of DNA upstream of the zzso zzso Comparative zzso sequence analysis showed that this copy of zzso was 711 zzso long and that its zzso regions contained no features common to other characterized zzso sites of this zzso The element was located 37 zzso downstream of an zzso whose product was shown by zzso transfer and zzso acid analysis to carry out zzso of selected zzso zzso in zzso zzso The sequence and zzso of this zzso identified it as zzso zzso the only zzso zzso acting on zzso groups to have been characterized to zzso It was found to be zzso among all clinically significant zzso of zzso The zzso zzso site is of particular interest since it was zzso in all but two rare evolutionary lines of zzso zzso and was absent from 85 zzso strains belonging to 37 other zzso It is thus a zzso significant marker at the zzso zzso
