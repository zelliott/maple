In zzso zzso chain reaction zzso refers to the amplification of specific zzso acid sequences and subsequent zzso of the zzso products in tissue zzso When zzso is performed in fixed cells in suspension the term zzso zzso is normally applied zzso For example, zzso zzso has been used for zzso detection of specific zzso Furthermore, in zzso of cells in suspension with different zzso zzso zzso may be used for zzso detection of DNA or zzso sequences specific for one of the zzso of zzso An zzso zzso method is described that makes it possible to zzso a specific gene of interest derived from one individual in a mixture of cells from two zzso This new method is based on zzso zzso and dependent upon the presence of a well characterized and specific DNA sequence or zzso which has to be present only in the cells from the individual being zzso for the gene sequence of zzso The zzso zzso method might find diagnostic applications in detection of zzso zzso sequences in zzso of cells and in zzso prenatal genetic diagnoses with the use of the few fetal cells circulating in maternal zzso
