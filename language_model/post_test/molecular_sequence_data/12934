We have examined the distribution of two zzso zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso isolated from zzso extracts of the blowfly zzso zzso zzso of dissected zzso zzso zzso and zzso of adult blowflies and the entire central nervous system of zzso flies were zzso by high performance liquid zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso for the presence of zzso To identify the two zzso by zzso we used the retention times of synthetic zzso and II as reference and detection with an zzso raised to zzso II zzso here to zzso both zzso and zzso The brain contains only two zzso zzso and these have exactly the same retention times as zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso material zzso like zzso and II as well as additional material zzso zzso The zzso central nervous system zzso contains material zzso like zzso and II as well as a component that zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and II are present in all zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso material may be present in the body zzso and zzso as well as in the zzso zzso An zzso was raised to zzso for zzso This zzso which was found to be specific for zzso in zzso zzso all the zzso and zzso zzso cells previously shown to react with the less selective zzso zzso It is not clear, however, whether zzso and II are zzso in all zzso cells since there is no zzso probe for zzso
