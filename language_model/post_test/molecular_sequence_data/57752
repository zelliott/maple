The compound zzso is zzso in five steps, zzso and characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso DNA, and the zzso zzso zzso holds metal zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the new compound zzso zzso It zzso a single strand in the zzso zzso nearly as efficiently as zzso zzso and it zzso a restriction zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and more efficiently than zzso The mechanism of zzso was studied in control experiments involving different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso agents, and zzso These experiments indicate that zzso iron and copper zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso are not involved and that zzso is zzso The zzso apparently is done by zzso zzso generated in the vicinity of the DNA zzso The zzso zzso differs from zzso in not containing an zzso This difference in binding modes between the zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso may cause useful differences between the two zzso in zzso of zzso zzso
