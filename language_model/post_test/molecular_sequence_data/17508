To understand more fully the biological zzso and investigate the reported zzso with heart tissue of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso this molecular biological study of the responsible zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso was cloned into zzso coli zzso by a shotgun procedure with zzso as the zzso zzso zzso expressed a zzso fusion protein under the control of the zzso zzso Southern analysis revealed zzso of zzso with DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso coli zzso indicating the presence of a signal zzso This product (of Mr zzso showed partial identity to the native zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso 28 zzso acid zzso of zzso were determined by zzso degradation analysis and an zzso zzso probe corresponding to zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso orientation of zzso by Southern zzso with restriction zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso made against native and zzso did not zzso with human heart zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were isolated after transformation with zzso zzso zzso Each zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to have a defective zzso gene incorporated into their zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
