Nerve growth factor zzso functions as a zzso for two zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso receptors and the zzso repeats of zzso are involved in binding to the zzso Recently, a closely related gene to zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso however, the function of zzso and its relevance to zzso signaling are zzso zzso contains a similar zzso and zzso domain as zzso but lacks the characteristic zzso repeats in the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is expressed in several zzso populations that also express zzso and zzso zzso zzso does not bind to zzso however, zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso is capable of interacting with zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso receptors resulted in the formation of zzso binding sites for zzso These results indicate that a zzso protein related to zzso is capable of modulating zzso zzso binding zzso
