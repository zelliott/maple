zzso studies of zzso have the potential to zzso patterns of host movement and zzso interactions that are not evident from host zzso zzso zzso flies are zzso and generally zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso flies in the family zzso are entirely wingless and depend on their hosts for long-distance zzso their population zzso has been zzso to zzso 

We collected a total of 125 bat flies from three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from eight localities in zzso zzso and zzso We identified specimens zzso and then zzso three zzso DNA gene fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total) from a subset of 45 bat zzso We measured genetic diversity, molecular zzso and population genetic subdivision zzso and used zzso and zzso network analyses to zzso zzso genetic structure across host species and zzso 

All flies were identified as zzso zzso with the exception of two individuals of zzso zzso Low levels of population genetic structure were detected between populations of zzso zzso from across a wide geographic range zzso zzso and tests for isolation by distance were zzso zzso results support a lack of geographic and zzso population structure, with molecular zzso primarily zzso within zzso zzso zzso values from flies collected from island populations of zzso zzso in East and West zzso Malaysia supported predictions based on previous studies of host genetic zzso 

The lack of population genetic structure and zzso variation observed in zzso zzso is most likely due to frequent contact between flying fox species and subsequent high levels of zzso gene zzso Specifically, we suggest that zzso zzso may facilitate movement of bat flies between the three zzso species in the zzso We demonstrate the utility of zzso zzso as an additional layer of information to measure host movement and zzso host zzso These approaches may have wide implications for understanding zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso flies may play a role as zzso of disease in zzso and their competence as zzso of bacterial and/or viral pathogens is in need of further zzso
