The role of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso action of tumor necrosis factor zzso was zzso Recently, we described the characterization of zzso zzso isolated from zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ito, zzso (1991) Cell zzso zzso 16, zzso The most remarkable features of these zzso zzso were the defects in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso activities of these zzso and found a significant decrease in the activity in one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso features, such as zzso requirement and zzso zzso suggested that the high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso was involved in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated the reduced expression of high molecular weight zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of a cloned zzso zzso in zzso cells increased the sensitivity of cells to the zzso zzso These results indicate the crucial role of the high molecular weight zzso in the zzso zzso
