To investigate human zzso infection and genetic variations in zzso B zzso in liver transplant recipients in zzso zzso 

zzso samples were obtained from 21 liver transplant zzso The zzso zzso was used to amplify a region of high sequence zzso in the zzso gene of human zzso zzso followed by direct sequence zzso 

Out of the 21 liver transplant recipients, 5 were proved zzso positive 62 to 180 days after zzso The zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences were compared with published sequences of zzso and zzso laboratory zzso Within the region zzso 2 out of 5 strains possessed a zzso zzso similar to that of strain zzso while another 2 strains displayed a zzso zzso similar to that of strain zzso One strain had zzso acid zzso which was different from those of both zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso 

Our results provide molecular zzso data for zzso strains circulating among transplant recipients in zzso zzso
