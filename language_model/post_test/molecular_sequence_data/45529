The zzso domain zzso of zzso envelope protein zzso has an additional zzso zzso within a zzso putative zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso and forms a zzso sequence (G, zzso X, any zzso the zzso indicates the position within the zzso of an infectious molecular zzso zzso Different from zzso zzso virus G zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso motif of zzso showed higher tolerance against zzso and a simultaneous substitution of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso only modestly decreased fusion activity and replication capacity of zzso When zzso was further zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso the efficiency of membrane fusion zzso with the decrease greatest occurring with the zzso zzso a less severe decrease with zzso and the least severe decrease with zzso zzso with zzso zzso also decreased the incorporation of zzso onto zzso and the zzso showed the most delayed replication zzso Thus the presence of the extra zzso zzso zzso may increase the tolerance of the other two zzso zzso against zzso than zzso The fact that a more severe zzso was observed for the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso suggested that the function of zzso depended on the zzso nature rather than on the simple volume of the side chain of the zzso acid zzso at position zzso Based on this result, we propose a hypothetical model of the association among zzso of zzso in which zzso locates itself near the zzso zzso
