zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with multiple possible functions that are likely influenced by zzso Identification of zzso attachment sites and structural characterization of zzso in human serum zzso has been performed by mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso revealed two molecular weight species of zzso zzso zzso 250 and zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso also revealed molecular zzso associated with both the alpha and beta zzso of zzso consistent with the presence of multiple zzso The data indicate that zzso contains zzso zzso by weight, the alpha zzso contains zzso zzso and the beta zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso with stepped collision energy scanning was used to selectively identify and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis was then used to confirm the identities of the zzso and to define the attachment sites within each zzso A total of six zzso zzso sites were identified, three in the alpha zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and three in the beta zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso Seven different possible types of zzso structures were identified by mass zzso a zzso structure, zzso structures without or with one zzso zzso structures without or with one zzso and possibly a zzso structure with two zzso and/or a zzso zzso Site beta zzso exhibited the least zzso diversity, with two detected types of zzso and site beta zzso exhibited the greatest diversity, with five or six detected types of zzso Overall, the most abundant zzso detected were zzso without zzso and the least abundant were zzso zzso with two zzso and/or zzso zzso peptides accounting for zzso of the primary structure were identified from analysis of the isolated alpha and beta zzso including all zzso and zzso zzso No evidence was found for the presence of zzso or zzso zzso The results provide a molecular basis for developing a better understanding of zzso zzso relationships and the role zzso zzso plays in zzso zzso
