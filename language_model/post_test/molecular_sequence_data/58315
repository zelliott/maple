zzso is a zzso zzso growth factor zzso found in glioblastoma, and in zzso of the breast, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso has a deletion in its zzso domain that results in the formation of a new, zzso zzso zzso Mice were zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to this sequence and zzso zzso A single chain zzso variable domain zzso zzso display library of 8 zzso zzso members was made from the zzso of one zzso zzso A zzso specific for zzso was isolated from this library by panning with successively decreasing amounts of synthetic zzso This was used to make an zzso by fusing the zzso DNA sequence to sequences coding for zzso II and III of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of 22 zzso for zzso and a zzso of 11 zzso for zzso zzso The zzso was very zzso to cells expressing zzso with an zzso of 1 zzso (16 zzso on mouse zzso zzso with zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso There was no zzso activity at 1000 zzso on the zzso parent zzso cell zzso The zzso was completely stable upon incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h in human zzso The combination of good zzso zzso and stability make this zzso a candidate for further zzso zzso
