zzso zzso is a zzso zzso species that has been shown to carry various nuclear genes of zzso or viral origin zzso However, a recent zzso of such zzso has not been zzso Here we determined for the first time the molecular structure of an entire zzso linear zzso zzso indigenous to this zzso The element is related to zzso killer plasmids from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and carries a zzso DNA zzso as well as remnants of a killer toxin system, a zzso zzso zzso Other essential toxin zzso or an immunity function, however, appear to be lost, while two additional small open reading frames are zzso zzso for all four genes located on zzso could be verified by zzso Interestingly, all genes from zzso could be identified as ancestors of zzso located at different zzso within the nucleus of zzso zzso suggesting repeated nuclear capture of fragments originating from zzso
