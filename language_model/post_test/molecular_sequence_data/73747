Although zzso expression of zzso has been studied extensively in the zzso its zzso role during zzso development is not well zzso At the developing zzso junction in culture, zzso application of the zzso zzso or zzso has been shown to acutely zzso synaptic transmission and chronically promote zzso zzso Using the same cell culture model, we have investigated zzso zzso expression in muscle cells and its role in developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by either zzso agents or repetitive electric zzso rapidly and specifically increased the levels of zzso zzso in developing zzso zzso muscle cells in zzso zzso gene expression also was enhanced by zzso zzso the neurotransmitter that causes muscle membrane zzso The effects of zzso were zzso by increasing zzso calcium zzso Moreover, zzso induced by membrane zzso appeared to enhance synaptic transmission at the developing zzso zzso The frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents zzso recorded from zzso zzso was increased significantly after treatment with zzso medium from zzso muscle zzso The zzso rise time, and zzso time of zzso were not affected, indicating a zzso action of the zzso zzso The effects of the zzso medium were zzso zzso by the zzso scavenger zzso suggesting that the zzso of synaptic efficacy was zzso at least in part, to elevated zzso as a consequence of muscle zzso Thus, zzso expression of muscle zzso may contribute to the development of the zzso zzso
