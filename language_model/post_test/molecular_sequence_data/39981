The zzso zzso fold is central to the architecture of zzso zzso zzso which are zzso essential for diverse cellular zzso including DNA zzso repair, and zzso In zzso zzso zzso proteins composed of multiple zzso folds and a zinc finger domain, in a single zzso have been zzso The zzso folds of these proteins were more similar to their zzso counterparts than to their bacterial zzso Thus, the zzso protein is called replication protein A zzso as in zzso Unlike most organisms, zzso zzso harbors multiple functional zzso zzso and it was our interest to determine whether the different proteins play different roles in DNA zzso Of particular interest was zzso DNA zzso where recently zzso has been shown to regulate the size of the zzso region zzso during Okazaki zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein composed of four zzso folds in a single zzso zzso zzso of a long zzso (20 zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso To gain a further insight into the requirement of the different regions of zzso on its zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso truncated derivatives of the protein were made and were zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggested that zzso derivatives with at least three zzso folds maintained the properties required for zzso of zzso zzso zzso Despite these interesting zzso further zzso and genetic analyses are required to gain a deeper understanding of the zzso implications of our zzso
