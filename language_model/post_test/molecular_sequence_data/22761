We zzso cloned new families of zzso repetitive DNA sequences from zzso and zzso zzso DNA of the Syrian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and characterized them by zzso in zzso zzso and filter zzso They were classified into six different types of repetitive DNA sequence families according to zzso distribution and zzso zzso The zzso patterns of the sequences were consistent with the distribution of zzso bands and/or zzso zzso The zzso major satellite DNA and sex zzso and zzso zzso repetitive sequences were zzso in the same zzso zzso but divergent in different zzso The zzso sequence was zzso in two zzso zzso and zzso and a low copy number of repetitive sequences on the zzso zzso arms were zzso in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso By contrast, the other type of repetitive sequences on the zzso zzso arms, which had sequence similarities to a LINE sequence of zzso was zzso through the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso divergence of the repetitive sequences of zzso was well correlated with the zzso relationships of the zzso species, and each sequence has been independently amplified and zzso in the same zzso
