zzso protein zzso is dependent on the reliable charging of each zzso with its zzso zzso zzso Many bacteria, however, lack a zzso zzso In these organisms, zzso is initially zzso with zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso thus charges both zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso found in some bacteria and all zzso exclusively generates zzso Here we present the first crystal structure of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso the zzso shares the overall architecture of the discriminating zzso from zzso zzso zzso We confirm zzso that zzso is zzso and present kinetic parameters for synthesis of zzso and of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ only in base zzso The zzso base of zzso is specifically recognized in zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso this zzso zzso is replaced by zzso zzso presumably allowing both zzso and the zzso zzso base zzso of zzso to be zzso Most other zzso share this structural feature, leading to relaxed zzso zzso
