In a search for highly zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso library zzso was screened with three zzso representative of zzso consensus zzso A total of 170 clones containing human zzso were isolated by zzso to the zzso zzso each was tested for zzso on five random female zzso with six restriction zzso Among the 53 clones demonstrating a zzso pattern, 47 were of distinct zzso Twelve of the zzso zzso were determined to be zzso zzso for the remaining 35 clones were zzso These zzso represent 33 new zzso zzso zzso since two pairs of clones detected partially overlapping zzso A pattern of similar length variation with multiple zzso zzso was demonstrated in 6 zzso of the 12 zzso zzso However, only 3 zzso of the 33 X zzso zzso showed zzso patterns, suggesting a decreased amount of zzso zzso on the X zzso The 33 zzso X zzso were physically localized with a set of zzso zzso human zzso cell hybrid zzso representing nine different zzso zzso
