zzso zzso which do not alter the protein zzso have been shown to affect protein function zzso zzso zzso C zzso Nat Rev zzso zzso However, synonymous zzso are rarely investigated in the cancer zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso sequencing to identify zzso zzso in 29 melanoma zzso zzso of one synonymous zzso zzso in zzso in 285 samples identified 12 cases that zzso the zzso zzso zzso This zzso led to increased zzso zzso and protein levels because of differential targeting of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso made from zzso zzso transcript bound zzso inhibited zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso target gene zzso This report shows selection of a zzso zzso synonymous zzso in zzso Our data indicate that silent zzso have a role to play in human cancer, emphasizing the importance of their investigation in future cancer zzso zzso
