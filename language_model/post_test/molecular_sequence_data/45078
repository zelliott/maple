Coffee grains have an oil content between zzso and zzso with these values associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As the majority of the oil stored in oil seeds is contained in specific structures called oil bodies, we were interested in determining whether there are any differences in the expression of the main oil body zzso the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present the isolation, characterization and quantitative expression analysis of six zzso representing five genes of the coffee zzso family zzso to zzso and one gene of the zzso family zzso Each coffee zzso zzso encodes for the signature structure for zzso a long zzso central sequence containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also indicates that the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso contain an zzso sequence typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the transcripts of all five zzso were predominantly expressed during grain maturation in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso being more highly zzso While the relative expression levels of the five zzso were similar for zzso and zzso significant differences in the absolute levels of expression were found between the two zzso zzso analysis of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso grain generally showed that the levels of these transcripts were lower in the grain after zzso and then further decreased during zzso except for a small spike of expression for zzso early in zzso In contrast, the levels of zzso transcripts remained relatively constant during zzso in agreement with suggestions that this protein is actively involved in the process of oil body zzso Finally, we discuss the implications of the coffee zzso expression data presented relative to the predicted roles for the different coffee zzso during development and zzso
