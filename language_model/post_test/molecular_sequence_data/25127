We have developed a simplified method for the preparation of liver nuclear extracts to study gene regulation and zzso zzso This protocol uses conventional laboratory equipment and standard zzso The liver tissue is zzso in a zzso solution at zzso zzso with subsequent adjustment of the zzso and zzso of zzso by density zzso The nuclear extracts are zzso active in a validated zzso zzso zzso and contain functional zzso zzso This protocol results in the rapid preparation of highly zzso and active liver nuclear zzso
