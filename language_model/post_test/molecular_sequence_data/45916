The evaluation of residual disease, which has zzso value in the treatment of zzso zzso is currently assessed by scoring a limited number of cells by zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso is an easier and more sensitive technique, enables analysis of a larger number of cells, and decreases sampling zzso However, real-time zzso has been applied only to target transcripts of fusion zzso Here, we considered two real-time zzso strategies to zzso a number of cells carrying a partial deletion of zzso 7 mixed with normal zzso zzso The first strategy was based on the amplification of two zzso one on zzso 7 and the other on zzso zzso In the second strategy residual disease was assessed by the ratio between the two zzso of a zzso marker, mapped on zzso 7, measured with zzso zzso Precision and accuracy of the two approaches were tested by reference samples with nominal values of residual disease ranging from 2 to zzso As expected the second strategy resulted in more precise and accurate monitoring within the range from 5 to zzso Furthermore, this method may be applied to assess the number of zzso or zzso clones carrying any unbalanced zzso zzso
