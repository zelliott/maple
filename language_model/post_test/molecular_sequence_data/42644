Previous studies suggested that zzso gene transcripts in human zzso may be derived from an upstream zzso start site in addition to the well characterized zzso start zzso To resolve this issue we characterized the zzso start sites of the human zzso gene in a human zzso tumor cell line zzso and a human breast tumor cell line zzso Using primer extension and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso we identified a discrete upstream zzso start site 579 bases zzso from the zzso site in both zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso start site lacks the zzso and zzso elements often present in zzso zzso zzso but contains the sequence zzso located 84 bases zzso to the zzso start site similar to other genes that lack zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso start site is the major zzso start site, representing zzso of the zzso transcripts in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso Supporting this zzso zzso zzso using a human zzso zzso reporter gene construct containing only the zzso zzso start site has a higher level of zzso activity than the human zzso zzso reporter construct containing only the zzso start zzso A high relative abundance zzso zzso of total zzso zzso were also found in the nucleus of both cell lines, which did not appear to be a consequence of the zzso zzso zzso To determine if this upstream start site was used in normal zzso human zzso we analyzed zzso from a variety of zzso procedure tissue zzso zzso analysis together with Southern zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in human zzso cerebral cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the first time as well as verified zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso start site is used only in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting zzso regulation at this zzso
