zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of type II zzso proteins that catalyze the zzso of zzso and zzso bonds of a variety of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The human genes for two members of this family have been cloned and designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have now cloned the third member of this family from a human prostate zzso library and designated it human zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame which encodes an zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso zzso containing zzso zzso had high zzso I activity compared to the zzso zzso By using in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso we have assigned the locus for the zzso zzso gene to the zzso region of human zzso zzso
