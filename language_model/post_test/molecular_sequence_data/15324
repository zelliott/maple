The objectives of this study were to formulate a vaccine based upon the different zzso of zzso present in sheep intended to be zzso and to determine if a targeted vaccine could be used to decrease the methane output of the zzso Two zzso zzso gene libraries were used to survey the zzso zzso in sheep prior to zzso and zzso representing five zzso were found to account for zzso of the different zzso of zzso zzso A vaccine based on a mixture of these five zzso was then formulated, and 32 sheep were vaccinated on days 0, 28, and 103 with either a control or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that each vaccination with the zzso zzso resulted in higher specific zzso G zzso in zzso zzso and rumen zzso Methane output levels corrected for zzso intake for the control and treatment groups were not significantly different, and real-time zzso data also indicated that zzso numbers were not significantly different for the two groups after the second zzso However, clone library data indicated that zzso diversity was significantly greater in sheep receiving the zzso vaccine and that the vaccine may have altered the composition of the zzso zzso A correlation between zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also exists, which suggests that a highly specific vaccine can be made to target specific strains of zzso and that a more zzso approach is needed for success in the zzso Our data also suggest that zzso take longer than 4 weeks to adapt to dietary changes and call into question the zzso of experimental results based upon a zzso to zzso zzso period normally observed for zzso
