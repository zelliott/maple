The endemic Hawaiian zzso a unique group that are remarkable for their diversity and rapid zzso provide a model for analysis of the process of insular zzso Founder events and accompanying random zzso together with shifts in sexual selection, appear to explain the dramatic divergence in male zzso and mating zzso among these flies, but these forces do not account for their spectacular ecological diversification into a wide array of breeding zzso Although recognized as contributing to the success of this group, the precise role of zzso shifts has not been well zzso 

To delineate the pattern of ecological diversification in the evolution of Hawaiian zzso we generated a molecular zzso using zzso sequences from the zzso protein gene zzso of 42 endemic Hawaiian and 5 zzso zzso By mapping ecological characters onto this zzso we demonstrate that zzso is the primitive condition, and that zzso leaves were the initial zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Shifts to zzso zzso bark and tree zzso followed in more derived zzso By plotting female zzso strategies, as reflected in zzso zzso type, on the molecular tree, we also demonstrate a zzso trend toward increasing zzso We find some statistical support for correlations between ecological shifts and shifts in female zzso zzso 

Because of the short branches at the base of the zzso which lead to ecologically diverse zzso we conclude that much of the zzso radiation into alternate breeding zzso occurred zzso early in the group's evolution in zzso Furthermore, we conclude that this ecological divergence and the correlated changes in zzso patterns that adapt species to their ecological zzso were contributing factors in the major zzso branching within the Hawaiian zzso zzso
