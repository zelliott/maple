The zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso DNA zzso reveals a second zzso zzso bound to each protein zzso The second zzso is in the zzso zzso and is located on the DNA binding domain interacting with the zzso a zzso from the regulatory domain and the DNA (via water zzso The presence of this second zzso site resolves the apparent zzso between the zzso and zzso data on the zzso of zzso and explains the zzso zzso behaviors of the zzso In addition, this site's close proximity to zzso affecting zzso zzso and its zzso interactions with a DNA recognition zzso zzso and DNA raise the possibility that this site has biological zzso
