Numerous features distinguish zzso from zzso chief among which are the distinctive internal membrane systems of zzso zzso These membrane systems form elaborate compartments and zzso trafficking zzso and zzso the zzso within the nuclear zzso The nuclear pore complex is the portal that specifically mediates zzso trafficking across the nuclear zzso Although it is generally understood that these internal membrane systems evolved from specialized zzso of the zzso plasma zzso it is not clear how the nuclear pore complex could have evolved from organisms with no analogous transport zzso Here we use zzso and zzso methods to perform a structural analysis of the seven proteins zzso the zzso zzso a core building block of the nuclear pore zzso Our analysis indicates that all seven proteins contain either a zzso fold, an zzso fold, or a distinctive arrangement of both, revealing close similarities between the structures zzso the zzso zzso and those zzso the major types of zzso coating complexes that maintain zzso trafficking zzso These similarities suggest a common evolutionary origin for nuclear pore complexes and coated zzso in an early zzso module that led to the formation of the internal membrane systems in modern zzso
