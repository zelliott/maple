The metabolism of zzso to zzso alcohol in zzso was examined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The product of zzso zzso zzso had four potential routes to zzso zzso The first, via zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso with subsequent conversion to zzso by zzso zzso operates in zzso cells where zzso appears to be an end zzso This zzso is not required for the synthesis of zzso alcohol because abolition of zzso zzso acid zzso activity in an zzso disruption zzso did not prevent the formation of zzso zzso A second possible route was via zzso zzso however, elimination of zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso triple zzso did not decrease the levels of zzso alcohol zzso A third route zzso zzso zzso (a novel activity in zzso zzso but with no role in the formation of zzso alcohol from zzso because cell zzso could not convert zzso to zzso zzso The final possibility was that a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso appears to be the major route of zzso of zzso to zzso alcohol although disruption of this gene reveals that at least one other unidentified zzso can substitute to a minor zzso
