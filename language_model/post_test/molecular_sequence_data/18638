Several studies have described the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, there is limited data concerning the zzso types of zzso plasmids and the genetic context surrounding zzso in zzso zzso in zzso 

Twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected from six hospitals in five different cities between 2005 and zzso The molecular epidemiology of the zzso was carried out using zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso The genetic location of zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso The genetic structure surrounding zzso was determined by cloning zzso The twelve zzso included two zzso zzso zzso zzso to one zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso to two zzso and seven zzso zzso zzso zzso to two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a potential zzso resistant risk clone carrying both zzso and zzso zzso located on plasmids varied from zzso 52 zzso to zzso 143 zzso All plasmids can be zzso to zzso zzso recipient, but were zzso by the current zzso typing zzso A novel zzso zzso named zzso was identified in zzso plasmids of two zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso Four kinds of genetic contexts of zzso were zzso The zzso of plasmids with structure of zzso family zzso sequence zzso zzso or zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso while others with structure of intact zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

The study revealed the unique features of zzso plasmids in zzso zzso in China, which were different from that of zzso zzso found in European zzso The diversity of the genetic contexts of zzso contributed to various antibiotics resistance zzso
