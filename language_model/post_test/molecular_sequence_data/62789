zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso are thought to contribute to the development of zzso resistance in zzso zzso To test this further, 44 zzso sequences in 18 patient isolate sets of zzso zzso were examined including a unique collection zzso separated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and matched zzso strains zzso zzso of zzso contained zzso zzso that led to premature protein zzso in at least one strain from most zzso patient zzso These zzso were present in all zzso irrespective of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso due to a single zzso deletion at zzso 53 was the most common zzso and was present in zzso from zzso zzso A novel real-time zzso zzso probe zzso zzso zzso applied to a further 119 zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso occurred zzso in zzso of zzso and could be present in zzso as well as zzso strains zzso vs zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso occur in zzso strains as well as in zzso zzso and are thus unlikely to cause zzso zzso
