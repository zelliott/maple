The generation of terminal zzso zzso knockout mice zzso has demonstrated that zzso is the only major activity involved in N region zzso This zzso generates diversity by adding random zzso at the zzso junctions and by zzso the formation of repetitive zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that the zzso heavy chain third zzso region zzso and the N region play a critical zzso 1) in distinguishing between zzso and zzso combining sites in natural and zzso zzso and 2) in the specificity and zzso of natural zzso zzso and in particular of zzso zzso To examine the impact of the lack of zzso on the natural zzso repertoire in adult mice, we have zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is not critical for the generation of B cells expressing zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the generation of a large collection of zzso indicates that the zzso of these cells are reduced in zzso mice mainly due to a lower zzso of zzso also, the lack of N region diversity seems to zzso affect the affinity of zzso zzso The zzso relevance of these data is zzso
