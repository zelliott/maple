The bovine zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso was cloned from three overlapping zzso fragments using zzso based on the human and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso ends were obtained by a modified zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The bovine zzso zzso is 1878 zzso long, excluding the zzso zzso It consists of a zzso region of 133 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to that of the sheep zzso and less related to the human zzso rabbit zzso rat zzso and mouse zzso zzso The predicted bovine zzso protein contains zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated zzso zzso of zzso It is zzso to the sheep zzso and human zzso zzso and less related to that of the rabbit zzso rat zzso and mouse zzso The cloned zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells and the zzso characteristics zzso The zzso functions primarily as an zzso uses zzso and is more active with zzso as a zzso than with cortisol or zzso It is expressed in high zzso in zzso adrenal and zzso and in small zzso in liver, heart and zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso of cattle is very similar to that of other species in its structure and zzso zzso
