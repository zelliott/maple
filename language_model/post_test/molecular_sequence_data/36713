Application of zzso zzso induced a slow zzso in zzso of the zzso abdominal zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced a slow inward current that increased when the membrane was zzso beyond zzso zzso showing a negative slope zzso However, this inward current never reversed to outward current when zzso beyond the equilibrium potential for zzso The zzso response was markedly zzso in zzso media, but depressed in zzso zzso It was unaffected by a change in external zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso significantly depressed the zzso response in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso which did not cause any current response, selectively and zzso blocked the zzso zzso Neither zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso nor zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not augment the zzso response zzso The zzso response was not zzso at all by a relatively large injection of zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso response is produced by the opening of the zzso zzso via zzso of a certain zzso zzso which is different from conventional zzso that activates zzso zzso
