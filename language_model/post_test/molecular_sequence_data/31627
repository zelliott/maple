zzso is used extensively to improve feed conversion rates to enhance the performance of poultry and zzso By expressing zzso in zzso animals, new breeds of genetically modified animals with enhanced feed conversion rates may be zzso However, expression of zzso proteins derived from lower organisms in zzso cells is usually zzso When common zzso of a ''one zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were replaced with rare zzso zzso expression in human embryonic kidney zzso cells increased by zzso to zzso as determined by flow zzso western zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the enhanced expression could not be attributed to altered zzso zzso This study provides an alternative strategy for improving expression levels of zzso proteins in zzso cells, which is potentially helpful for generating genetically modified animals with enhanced feed conversion zzso
