The complete zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined, characterized and compared with seven other species of zzso zzso The order of 37 genes was typical of insect zzso DNA sequences described to zzso Compared with other zzso of zzso the zzso biased zzso of zzso zzso was the zzso Eleven zzso genes zzso zzso the standard zzso but zzso used zzso and zzso used zzso as the initiation zzso Ten zzso genes had the common stop zzso zzso except zzso having zzso as the stop zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the incomplete stop zzso zzso All of the zzso genes had typical zzso secondary structures except zzso in which the zzso zzso arm did not form a stable zzso zzso There was a zzso between zzso and zzso which was common in zzso zzso A zzso motif zzso between zzso and zzso a zzso motif zzso between zzso and zzso and a zzso motif zzso of overlapping region between zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso The zzso region contained an zzso motif followed by a zzso zzso In addition, two potential zzso structures, a duplicated zzso repeat element, and two zzso zzso and zzso were observed in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso relationships of zzso species were constructed based on zzso acid sequences of 13 zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso and maximum likelihood zzso zzso These zzso zzso supported the zzso zzso on relationships within zzso zzso
