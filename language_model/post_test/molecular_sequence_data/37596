The expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in normal cells after induction with zzso or following zzso from an zzso zzso appears on an zzso gel as a zzso Here, the underlying mechanism behind the synthesis of the two species has been zzso By expressing zzso truncated at their zzso end, we found that the synthesis of the more slowly zzso form, called zzso is dependent on a sequence upstream of the first zzso zzso thought to initiate translation of zzso Two potential, in frame, alternative upstream initiation zzso zzso and zzso were individually changed to zzso zzso zzso Analysis by in zzso translation, or zzso of zzso from zzso zzso cells, showed that translation of zzso is initiated at the zzso located 13 zzso upstream of the first zzso When this zzso was zzso zzso was no longer zzso Instead, a shorter form, initiated at an in frame zzso located seven zzso zzso was zzso Finally, when both these zzso were zzso only zzso was zzso Both zzso and zzso bound to zzso and zzso inhibited DNA zzso and caused zzso zzso of a human zzso cell zzso We thus conclude that zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso are functionally indistinguishable as based on these zzso
