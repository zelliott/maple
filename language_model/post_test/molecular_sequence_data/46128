zzso nuclear receptors zzso recruit zzso such as members of the zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso family and zzso zzso responsive element binding protein zzso protein zzso to specific zzso elements and activate target gene zzso In the present study, we isolated a novel zzso from the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso domain of zzso X zzso as a bait in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are different in size but share the overall characteristic zzso such as zzso interacting domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed highest expression levels at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with several zzso including sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human and zzso salmon zzso receptors zzso mouse zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso possesses two functional zzso both of which are dependent on their core zzso zzso Furthermore, preferential interacting zzso for zzso in the zzso are located in the central zzso zzso revealed by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso has a single zzso zzso domain, which interacts with zzso a zzso zzso In addition, transient zzso of the zzso gene in the sea zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso induced abnormal zzso at zzso stage such as the lack of primary zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso is a new member of the zzso family and plays an important role during early embryonic zzso
