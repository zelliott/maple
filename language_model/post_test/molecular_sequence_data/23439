zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unable to zzso the zzso zzso are unable to compete effectively for zzso zzso In this work we show that the locus responsible for the transport and zzso of zzso spans zzso zzso zzso in this region were generated by zzso zzso and representative zzso were zzso The locus contains genes coding for an zzso zzso a putative zzso a probable zzso and a sugar zzso necessary for the transport and subsequent zzso of zzso The regulation of these zzso which are zzso by zzso is carried out in part by a zzso negative regulator zzso that is zzso within the same transcript as the zzso zzso but is separated from the structural genes zzso the zzso by a zzso zzso zzso dot zzso analysis demonstrated that this zzso sequence is correlated with transcript zzso only under zzso zzso Transport zzso utilizing zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso was zzso and dependent upon the presence of the ABC zzso at this zzso zzso analyses of representative zzso from this locus provide genetic evidence that the zzso of zzso differs from previously described zzso zzso zzso
