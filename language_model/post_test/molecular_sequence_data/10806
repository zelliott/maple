A practical combination of comparative modeling and zzso zzso was used to generate a three-dimensional structure of the response regulator zzso zzso The backbone structure obtained compares to the zzso zzso zzso X-ray structure with an zzso of zzso zzso We provide results which suggest that structures obtained by this method are suitable for drug zzso The results of the zzso and zzso methods as applied to the model and X-ray structures of zzso are remarkably similar and tend to suggest the same design zzso This trend is illustrated by these same techniques applied to two zzso derived structures of the analogous zzso zzso which exhibit a zzso zzso on the same order as that found for the two zzso zzso
