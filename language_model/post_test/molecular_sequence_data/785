zzso zzso zzso electron transfer zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso of protein zzso is demonstrated in a hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso are selected in a zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso linear zzso reaction cell and mutually stored with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are collected in an zzso cooler and then analyzed by an zzso mass zzso The zzso structure of the zzso reaction cell allows for a broad zzso zzso mass range distribution and a high zzso storage zzso zzso useful zzso zzso zzso could be obtained at a rate of faster than 2 zzso When used in conjunction with zzso this high speed allows for several zzso and zzso zzso to be obtained across each zzso zzso An zzso scan is used to select the precursor zzso With a 1 m flight tube and single reflection, resolutions of about 10 k and a mass accuracy of 5 zzso were zzso When analyzing a 100 zzso solution of a zzso digest of bovine serum zzso zzso by zzso zzso 27 unique peptides were identified with a summed zzso score of zzso using the Swiss zzso zzso In addition, we explored the capability for analyzing small proteins with the present hybrid zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso leads to the identification of the protein with a zzso score of zzso
