A zzso zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from fermented fish zzso in zzso The cells were curved zzso zzso and zzso The novel strain grew zzso at 37 degrees C, at pH 8 and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso The zzso respiratory zzso was zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso Polar zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analyses indicated that strain zzso was closely related to zzso zzso which comprises three subspecies, and zzso zzso with gene sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed low levels of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso characteristics and the molecular data zzso strain zzso should be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
