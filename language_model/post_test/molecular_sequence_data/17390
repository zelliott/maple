zzso of zzso A was studied in zzso coli cells that differed in expressing the zzso A zzso protein zzso zzso of released and unreleased zzso A were harvested throughout zzso A zzso The amount of zzso A in each pool varied with the time of zzso allowing the definition of two sequential steps in zzso A release, one of which was dependent on zzso Each step of zzso A release was differently affected in cells containing Cal zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by either zzso or zzso preventing them from being zzso and zzso These Cal zzso were only observed in zzso cells, indicating that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso precursor of zzso Cal was found in the zzso fraction of the pools of released and unreleased zzso A together with the zzso of zzso A and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso and zzso strains and found to be zzso indicating that they are formed by newly zzso zzso A binding to mature zzso already incorporated in the outer zzso Cal is a zzso similar to zzso a constituent of the type IV zzso zzso It would interact with zzso zzso to constitute the zzso A export zzso
