zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso designed in an effort to develop alternative treatments against zzso zzso To further zzso the zzso activity, 58 zzso zzso were constructed and used to establish a quantitative zzso relationship zzso A statistically significant model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained using a set of 69 selected molecular zzso Among these, zzso and charged partial surface area zzso played a dominant zzso Analysis of the model indicated that zzso zzso and charge were the most important features influencing activity for this set of zzso Furthermore, the ability of the quantitative zzso relationship model to predict zzso was evaluated by analyzing a set of 400 zzso zzso designed by molecular zzso Out of these 400, 16 new zzso with a higher predicted zzso activity were tested in the suicide expression system, and about three out of four appeared more potent than the parent zzso zzso Combination of zzso and charged partial surface area zzso seems relevant to depict the interaction between zzso and its zzso presumably the microbial cell zzso The presented findings show that modeling and quantitative zzso relationship methods can be useful in the construction of and/or zzso of the zzso of zzso peptides for further development as effective zzso zzso
