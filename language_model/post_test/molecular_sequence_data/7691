In this chapter we review recent molecular knowledge on two structurally related zzso zzso zzso which have evolved from a common ancestral zzso The common property of the zzso family members is that they interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the small zzso in the presence of many dietary zzso other zzso zzso and high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts at the vascular side of the blood vessels where it zzso zzso and some zzso of the circulating plasma zzso A third member of the gene family, zzso zzso is found in the liver of zzso Also, this zzso is involved in zzso zzso The three zzso are zzso related to some zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Hide et zzso 1992) and to a zzso A1 from zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso
