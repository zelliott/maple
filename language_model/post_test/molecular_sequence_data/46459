zzso spectrum disorder zzso is zzso by zzso in social communication and by a pattern of repetitive zzso with learning disability zzso typically seen in up to zzso of zzso A recent study using the zzso statistical framework identified a novel region of genetic linkage on zzso zzso that is limited to zzso families with zzso 

In this study, two families with zzso and/or zzso are described which zzso rare zzso zzso zzso located within this linkage zzso The deletion zzso are mapped at zzso resolution and segregation analysis is performed using a combination of zzso single zzso zzso zzso technology, array comparative zzso zzso zzso long-range zzso and zzso zzso The frequency of similar zzso zzso in control subjects is determined through analysis of published zzso array zzso zzso of zzso the only gene disrupted by these zzso is assessed using reverse zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analysis of 9 week human zzso 

The deletion of zzso zzso was transmitted to three of three boys with zzso and zzso and none of four unaffected siblings, from their unaffected zzso In a second family, an overlapping deletion of zzso zzso was transmitted to an individual with severe zzso from his father with moderate zzso No copy number variations zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the two zzso zzso are present in the developing human zzso 

zzso familial zzso zzso and expression analysis zzso zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso
