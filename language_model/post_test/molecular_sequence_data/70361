We have unexpectedly found that zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and some other similar zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso strongly inhibit zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso the mode of their unusual interaction with zzso II in more detail, we prepared twelve kinds of zzso zzso in which one or two zzso acid zzso in the zzso segment from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso had been replaced or deleted by zzso zzso and determined the zzso zzso of their complexes with zzso zzso Six zzso among them showed zzso zzso one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild zzso Three had higher zzso The results suggest that at least some zzso in this segment are interacting with zzso II in the zzso We also prepared an zzso zzso in which the zzso bridge between zzso and zzso had been eliminated by replacing the two zzso zzso with zzso zzso This zzso zzso inhibited zzso II as strongly as the zzso zzso zzso While zzso bonds in the zzso zzso did not suffer from the zzso action of zzso II except those at the zzso fragile portion, the zzso bond of the zzso was specifically zzso by the zzso This zzso bond, therefore, seems to play the role of the zzso site in the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso
