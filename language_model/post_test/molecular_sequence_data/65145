zzso zzso factor 1 zzso a zzso zzso factor composed of zzso and zzso zzso serves as a key regulator of zzso adaptation to zzso The amount of zzso protein is regulated either by attenuating von zzso protein zzso zzso and subsequent 26 S zzso degradation or by enhancing zzso zzso translation, presumably involving a zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, it became apparent that zzso protects zzso from zzso zzso Here we present evidence that zzso is required for heat shock proteins to stabilize zzso In zzso zzso cell zzso cells, zzso zzso by zzso and zzso or zzso of either a dominant negative zzso or a zzso zzso zzso substantially lowered zzso expressed zzso without altering zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso showed no zzso Considering that zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso as well as zzso expression and zzso attenuated zzso or zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso zzso promoted degradation of zzso indirectly by reducing steady state zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso with zzso and direct binding of zzso to the zzso degradation domain zzso of zzso was proven by a pull-down zzso and a zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso cells under zzso suggesting that heat shock proteins constitute an integral component for zzso zzso We conclude that zzso contributes to zzso stabilization by provoking expression of heat shock zzso
