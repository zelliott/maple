zzso zzso proteins are expressed by virtually all plants in response to pathogen infection and, in many cases, in response to zzso stresses as well and include the zzso zzso However, the precise roles of the zzso protein family in zzso stress responses are not zzso In this paper we report, for the first time, that the zzso expression of a pea zzso gene in zzso zzso enhances their zzso and growth in the presence of zzso Our findings are discussed within the context of zzso protein function and their utility in engineering stress tolerant zzso
