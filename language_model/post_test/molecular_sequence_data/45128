The interactions among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso core promoter zzso zzso in various stages of chronic zzso B virus zzso infection remain unclear and were thus investigated in this zzso 

The sequences of the zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso and PC zzso zzso were determined in 46 zzso chronic carriers zzso and 106 zzso carriers with different stages of liver diseases, including 38 chronic zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso and 50 zzso zzso zzso 

A higher prevalence of zzso deletion and zzso and PC zzso was found in carriers with progressive liver diseases compared with the zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis, patients with zzso deletion and zzso zzso were significantly associated with the development of progressive liver diseases than those zzso Combination of zzso rather than single zzso was associated with the development of progressive liver diseases, especially in combination with zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the deleted regions were more often in the 3' zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Further mapping of these zzso deletion sequences found that all the deletion regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso and most of them lost 1 or more functional zzso 

Our data indicate that patients with progressive liver diseases have a higher frequency of zzso zzso
