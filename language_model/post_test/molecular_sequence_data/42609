Analysis of zzso b zzso sequences of the six extant species of Atlantic zzso and a zzso revealed an excess of zzso and zzso and a deficit of zzso at silent sites on the coding zzso zzso analyses grouped the sequences of the common zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso and little zzso zzso zzso The black zzso zzso zzso sequence formed a sister zzso and the zzso zzso zzso fell outside the other zzso zzso comparisons of zzso indicated that zzso of bases did not zzso but that C was much more likely to be incorporated than was zzso zzso in base composition appear to result from a strand bias in replication zzso which may result from selection on secondary zzso structure and/or the zzso of zzso zzso
