The zzso is a zzso zzso zzso repeated sequence which is zzso with regard to its zzso zzso in zzso circular zzso from D zzso zzso Here we show that a bacterial zzso carrying a cluster of zzso is not able to replicate efficiently in cultured zzso This observation does not support the hypothesis that the overrepresentation results from an autonomous replication of zzso circular DNA zzso
