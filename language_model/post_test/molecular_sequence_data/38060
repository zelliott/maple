zzso zzso on the zzso loop I on the zzso face of zzso has been observed after zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso attached on the zzso loop zzso The characterization of the reaction products by mass zzso both of the zzso protein and of the zzso zzso allows the site of zzso to be determined zzso The specific zzso of the zzso bond between zzso and zzso on loop I leaves the zzso zzso zzso intact, confirmed by zzso detection of the two zzso zzso groups near the zzso of zzso The limited extension of the zzso side chain requires a zzso distance between the zzso site, zzso and the site of zzso attachment, zzso of less than 12 zzso Upon zzso of the zzso no change in the zzso pattern is zzso however, a simulated zzso II intermediate zzso state indicates a much more complex zzso zzso The development of this zzso method, previously used primarily as a zzso zzso in combination with mass zzso may provide a powerful method on membrane protein zzso studies that can be used to complement other zzso zzso
