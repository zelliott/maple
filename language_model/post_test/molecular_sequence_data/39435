zzso of zzso in zzso zzso requires activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes, but how these three complexes work in concert to accomplish this important zzso switch has remained zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso complex and a common zzso zzso to form an active zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The partial loss of function of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso and zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibits a synergistic genetic interaction with zzso and zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso is essential for the repression of zzso This zzso zzso zzso appears to associate physically with zzso zzso zzso and positively regulates the zzso degradation of zzso zzso factors, whereas the zzso controls the zzso modification of zzso essential for zzso zzso Thus, this study suggests a zzso activity connection between zzso and zzso complexes in their cooperation with zzso in orchestrating the repression of zzso
