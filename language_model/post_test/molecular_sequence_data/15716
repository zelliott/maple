The stringent response is a mechanism by which bacteria adapt to environmental stresses and nutritional deficiencies through the synthesis and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and plants contain a single zzso zzso (named for zzso zzso that is zzso Here we report the identification of a new species of bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso and characterization of an zzso zzso in this plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso crown zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso that produces the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in AHL production was found to have an zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso protein showed significant percent sequence identity to zzso proteins of zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso the multiple zzso acid requirements of the zzso coli zzso zzso double zzso by restoring the growth on selection zzso Besides zzso signal production, the zzso zzso also affects soluble zzso production and cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene restored these zzso This is the first discovery of a functional zzso gene in a member of the zzso zzso
