As a pattern recognition zzso zzso mediates innate immune responses to a variety of microbial cell wall components including bacterial zzso We have previously shown that the central region of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso motifs zzso is required for the sensing of bacterial zzso In this study, we have investigated three zzso single zzso zzso zzso located in this region of zzso by generating these zzso and examining zzso zzso We have found that a zzso of zzso based upon the zzso zzso located in the loop of zzso motif 11 zzso is greatly impaired in zzso responses to zzso and a variety of other bacterial zzso for this zzso Despite normal cell surface zzso the zzso zzso also fails to bind to zzso a commonly used zzso zzso Although a number of zzso acid zzso at position 315 impair zzso function, the zzso substitution has the strongest deleterious zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso supporting a crucial role for the loop of zzso in zzso zzso These results also suggest that the zzso zzso may zzso certain individuals to infectious diseases for which the sensing of microbial cell components by zzso is critical to innate immune zzso
