zzso zzso type 1 zzso is an zzso dominant inherited disorder characterized by zzso of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso to the expansion of an unstable zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso stability of zzso repeats in mice, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the human zzso gene with either a normal or an expanded zzso zzso Both zzso were stable in parent to offspring zzso While all six transgenic lines expressing the zzso human zzso zzso had normal zzso cells, transgenic animals from five of six lines with the expanded zzso zzso developed zzso and zzso cell zzso These data indicate that expanded zzso repeats expressed in zzso cells are sufficient to produce zzso and zzso and demonstrate that a mouse model can be established for zzso caused by zzso repeat zzso
