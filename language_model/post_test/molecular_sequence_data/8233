zzso that guide folding of coiled coils were tested by designing three peptides that zzso associate with each other to form a zzso coiled zzso The core positions of the designed zzso contained zzso that promote formation of zzso coiled zzso zzso interactions were employed to mediate zzso and negative design was used to favor formation of the zzso over alternative zzso A program was written to select sequences that zzso the number of attractive zzso interactions in a parallel zzso and the number of repulsive zzso interactions in alternative zzso zzso studies indicate that an zzso mixture of the three peptides forms a zzso zzso with high specificity and zzso These results validate the principles used to guide the design and suggest that the zzso may serve as a useful, autonomous zzso zzso
