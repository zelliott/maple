We describe the identification and characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose expression are restricted to zzso stages and peak at the zzso to zzso zzso We identified a zzso DNA zzso that covers upstream region of zzso as a putative promoter, which can drive the expression of zzso fluorescent protein in a manner similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso genes will be useful zzso markers for the study of zzso zzso
