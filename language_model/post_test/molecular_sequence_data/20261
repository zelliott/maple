Cold zzso in the Gulf of Mexico are often dominated by zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso symbiotic bacteria in their zzso In this study, we zzso zzso diversity, abundance and zzso potential in three zzso species from the northern Gulf of zzso zzso zzso from the West Florida zzso zzso zzso from Atwater Valley and zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed a single zzso zzso in zzso zzso and a dual zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso A previously unknown diversity of four zzso zzso was discovered in zzso zzso a zzso two zzso distinct zzso and a zzso zzso not previously described from any marine zzso zzso A gene characteristic of zzso bacteria, zzso was identified in all three zzso species confirming the zzso potential of their zzso zzso isotope analyses of lipids and whole tissue also confirmed the importance of zzso in the carbon nutrition of all of the zzso zzso of absolute and relative zzso abundance in zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso slot zzso zzso indicated a clear dominance of zzso over zzso zzso in their zzso zzso A zzso zzso in total zzso abundance was observed in zzso zzso with specimens from zzso Canyon zzso much lower zzso than those from Atwater zzso This shows that zzso abundance is not zzso but can vary considerably between zzso
