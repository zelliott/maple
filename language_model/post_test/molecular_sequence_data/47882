zzso is a regulated series of events which leads to the death and elimination of zzso cells during development or in disease zzso It is regulated in part by members of the zzso family of zzso Some of these stimulate cell death, while others prevent zzso zzso of one of these death zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth arrest and subsequently can cause cell zzso zzso of the zzso family that are known to inhibit zzso in zzso cells overcome zzso growth arrest in zzso We describe here a system for isolation of human genes that are able to overcome zzso sensitivity in zzso Two novel zzso identified with this system, have been named zzso zzso selected in zzso zzso These proteins not only overcome toxicity of zzso in zzso but also protect zzso cells from zzso that is induced by zzso or zzso zzso We find that zzso is the more effective of the two zzso
