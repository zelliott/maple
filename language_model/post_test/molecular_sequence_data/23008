The DNA zzso 4 protein zzso of zzso zzso is a member of the X family of DNA zzso whose closest human relative appears to be DNA zzso zzso zzso from previous genetic studies conflict over the role of zzso in zzso Here we show that deletion of zzso in a zzso strain of the zzso genetic background results in sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso However, deletion of zzso in other strain backgrounds and in zzso strains does not yield an zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of a zzso strain can be rescued by deletion of zzso We also show that deletion of zzso results in a 6- to zzso increase in the zzso zzso frequency and in a significant increase in zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso is critical for accurate repair of DNA zzso induced by zzso
