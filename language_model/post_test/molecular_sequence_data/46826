The indigenous zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was entirely zzso and evaluated as a cloning zzso for zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso and the zzso sequence revealed a consensus zzso site zzso described for the zzso family of zzso replicating zzso zzso This zzso site is zzso in a region of high potential to form a number of zzso zzso The predicted protein zzso showed zzso zzso acid zzso and potential zzso regions, containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso replicates by a zzso zzso For use as a cloning zzso for zzso a zzso containing the zzso resistance gene zzso and the stabilization locus zzso was inserted into zzso The new zzso of zzso zzso was designated zzso By deletion of the zzso locus and using zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing unique restriction sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the ends of the zzso resistance zzso was zzso Both zzso showed stability in zzso during 18 h of growth or 72 h of zzso zzso number, and no interference with zzso zzso and zzso however, were incapable of zzso in zzso coli and a shuttle zzso zzso was constructed by zzso of some restriction sites of zzso and zzso to the cloning zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso is zzso is of low molecular weight zzso zzso presents zzso resistance markers for zzso and zzso has unique restriction sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and can be used directly for sequencing with universal zzso It can be maintained in zzso coli and several species and zzso of zzso
