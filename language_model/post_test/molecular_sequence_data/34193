zzso modification of proteins plays an important role in cellular functions and is a key event in signal zzso pathways leading to zzso stress and DNA zzso In this study, we used zzso laser zzso time of flight zzso to investigate the zzso modifications of the zzso expressed proteins in the retinal zzso during early experimental zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was induced in 18 zzso mice with 25 zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with complete zzso zzso zzso 18 mice treated with zzso without zzso served as zzso zzso were removed from the experimental and control groups on day 7 post zzso zzso zzso were extracted and subjected to 2 zzso in gel zzso zzso and the protein spots indicating differential expression were subjected to zzso for protein identification and indication of any zzso zzso 

Of the 13 proteins found to be zzso expressed by zzso (including zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso 70, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso nine were found to undergo zzso zzso zzso was a common modification found to occur on zzso zzso 70, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso 70, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also modified by zzso zzso had a zzso zzso 

Several proteins present in the retinal zzso are zzso modified during early zzso indicating the presence of zzso stress and zzso DNA zzso The most common modifications are zzso and zzso A better understanding of the proteins susceptible to zzso modifications in the zzso at the early stage of the disease may serve to advance therapeutic interventions to zzso disease zzso
