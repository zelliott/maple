zzso zzso a zzso pathogen of humans, switches from a zzso zzso mold in the soil to a zzso zzso form in the human zzso This zzso switch, which is exhibited by zzso zzso and a group of zzso related zzso zzso is regulated by zzso Using zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso for zzso phase zzso which is required for zzso growth at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso irrespective of zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins that includes zzso a master zzso regulator of the zzso transition required for mating in zzso zzso zzso associates with its own upstream regulatory region, consistent with a direct role in zzso control, and both the protein and its transcript accumulate to high levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is required for the expression of the vast majority of zzso zzso including two genes linked to zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a critical zzso regulator of a zzso zzso switch in zzso zzso
