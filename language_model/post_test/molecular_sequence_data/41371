Multiple zzso zzso is an zzso neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system zzso characterized by zzso through zzso cell zzso Current and proposed therapeutic strategies to arrest zzso and/or promote further zzso include: zzso zzso of the host immune system; and/or zzso transplantation of zzso or zzso cells to the circulation or sites of zzso However, significant drawbacks are inherent with both zzso Cell penetrating peptides zzso are short zzso acid sequences with an intrinsic ability to zzso across plasma zzso and theoretically represent an attractive zzso for delivery of therapeutic peptides or zzso to zzso to promote cell survival or zzso The zzso described to date are commonly zzso in the cell types they zzso limiting their therapeutic application in zzso Here, we describe a theoretical framework for design of a novel zzso sequence that selectively zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso and conduct preliminary screens of zzso zzso zzso with immature and matured human zzso and zzso and two zzso cell zzso A candidate zzso termed zzso consistently zzso zzso cells, was significantly more effective at zzso immature zzso than matured zzso and was virtually incapable of zzso two zzso cell zzso zzso human neural cells and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms trafficking of zzso zzso to zzso to mature zzso 3-6 hours after protein application in zzso We propose selectivity of zzso for zzso cells represents a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso disease, such as zzso
