An zzso method has been developed for the direct analysis of normal and zzso plasma factor zzso Using this method, the molecular zzso responsible for mild zzso A has been identified for a patient whose plasma factor VIII activity is zzso zzso even though the factor VIII zzso content is zzso zzso Although the zzso factor VIII has an apparently normal molecular mass and chain zzso the zzso heavy chain accumulates when the zzso protein is incubated with zzso and the zzso heavy chain zzso cannot be zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of the zzso light chain to the zzso zzso is zzso As these data indicate a loss of factor VIII zzso by zzso at zzso the genetic zzso was determined by zzso amplification of zzso 8 of the factor VIII gene and direct sequencing of the amplified zzso A zzso substitution zzso was identified that produces an zzso to zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso zzso These data identify the molecular basis of an abnormal factor VIII, zzso zzso that lacks zzso function because of impaired zzso zzso
