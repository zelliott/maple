Two zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso for solid phase synthesis of zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids could be easily attached to the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After final removal of the zzso groups, treatment with zzso zzso yielded zzso acid and zzso zzso in high zzso As we could show for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso these two zzso with zzso linkages are well suited for the synthesis of zzso zzso peptides using protected zzso acid zzso as starting zzso
