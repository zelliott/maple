zzso zzso protein zzso is a crucial zzso that acts as a bridge to recruit the zzso zzso to activated zzso receptors in response to invading zzso The specific assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Mal and zzso is responsible for proper signal zzso in the zzso signaling zzso However, the molecular mechanism for the specificity of these zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the human Mal zzso zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits an extraordinarily long AB loop, but no zzso zzso or zzso loop, distinguishing it from other zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso AB loop is capable of zzso direct binding to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We also found that zzso can form a back-to-back zzso that may resemble the zzso assembly of the entire Mal zzso Our data demonstrate the bridge role of the zzso domain and provide important information about zzso domain zzso
