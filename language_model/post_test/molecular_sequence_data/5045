Combined zzso of zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and a zzso method specific for zzso zzso zzso of the type zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso were used to study human and rat single zzso to examine the zzso between type II zzso zzso zzso of both zzso We demonstrate that human type II zzso exhibit zzso zzso and zzso region zzso sequence zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Both zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso method used with frozen sections confirmed that all human type II zzso express type zzso and/or type zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to recognize human zzso with zzso characteristics corresponding to hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso activity, determined by quantitative zzso revealed that human zzso zzso (with an optical density or zzso zzso zzso display zzso activity which is comparable to that of the rat type zzso zzso zzso zzso but lower than that of the rat type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results do not support the notion that zzso zzso is expressed in human limb muscles, even in hybrid zzso We conclude that human type II zzso have been zzso in numerous previous publications and that this has important implications in attempts to compare the zzso characteristics of zzso types, particularly when animal models are zzso
