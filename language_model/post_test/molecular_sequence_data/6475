zzso production of zzso zzso zzso is considered the primary output signal of activated zzso zzso zzso The zzso targets of this novel zzso and the identity of zzso involved in its metabolism have not yet been zzso We report here the identification of two zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso forming zzso zzso One of these zzso is the 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso (75 zzso zzso which has previously been demonstrated to metabolize zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have identified a second zzso zzso in the zzso fraction of zzso which forms a complex with the zzso form of zzso zzso This zzso is zzso and zzso distinct from the zzso 43 zzso and 75 zzso zzso and is unique in that it removes the zzso zzso from zzso but does not metabolize zzso zzso or zzso These studies demonstrate the existence of multiple zzso zzso within the zzso
