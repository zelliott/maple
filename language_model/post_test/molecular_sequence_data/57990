The expression of the zzso zzso D binding zzso gene was investigated in zzso and in peripheral blood zzso zzso message was amplified through 35 cycles of zzso amplification using specific zzso zzso zzso products of the expected size were further identified by Southern zzso using a specific zzso zzso No expression of the zzso gene could be detected in peripheral blood zzso nor in the zzso U 937 cell zzso In contrast, message for zzso was identified in zzso activated with zzso when analyzed between 6 and 10 h following zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression of the zzso gene could play a major role in the zzso of zzso by zzso
