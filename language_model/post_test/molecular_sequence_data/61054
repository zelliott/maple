Members of the zzso family of basic zzso zzso zzso factors can affect zzso in either a positive or a negative fashion, depending on their partner zzso and the context of the target zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulator plays a pivotal role in regulating zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso In previous studies, we mapped the human zzso gene within a zzso zzso on human zzso 20, bands zzso We have isolated the human zzso containing the full-length predicted open reading frame zzso Multiple zzso transcripts of approximately zzso and approximately 3 zzso which differ in the length of the 3' untranslated region, are zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso a protein with 323 zzso acids zzso zzso The protein has zzso identity and zzso similarity to the zzso zzso The zzso of the human zzso gene contains no zzso and the gene spans approximately 3 zzso zzso maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in zzso zzso disorders characterized by a deletion of zzso however, we detected no zzso of zzso in leukemia cells with loss of zzso Thus, zzso is unlikely to be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso disorders characterized by abnormalities of zzso zzso
