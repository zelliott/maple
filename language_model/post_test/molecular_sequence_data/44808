The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel that is activated upon binding of zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso bind specifically and with high affinity to the zzso and compete with binding of the natural zzso We employed a zzso zzso zzso library to select zzso reacting with zzso zzso bearing the motif zzso as a consensus sequence were found to bind with high affinity to zzso The zzso zzso zzso bears zzso acid sequence similarities to a region of the zzso of the zzso muscle zzso as well as of other muscle and zzso zzso that bind zzso The zzso zzso and the corresponding peptides containing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as peptides analogous to the above region in the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso that binds zzso inhibit the binding of zzso to the intact zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso A synthetic zzso from a zzso zzso that does not bind zzso zzso human zzso zzso which differs by just one zzso acid from the zzso zzso from the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso not inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso zzso These results indicate the requirement for two adjacent aromatic zzso acid zzso for binding to zzso
