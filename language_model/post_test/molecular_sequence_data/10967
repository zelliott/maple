A human zzso zzso zzso has been identified based on sequences in an expressed sequence tag zzso zzso zzso The protein shows highest sequence identity to the zzso inflammatory protein zzso group of zzso particularly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and has been named zzso Model building confirms that the protein has a similar three zzso structure to other zzso but has an additional third zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso show that the zzso for zzso is expressed at a high levels in liver, zzso and in lung zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and, to a lesser degree, zzso at zzso zzso it has no effect on zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso shows zzso values of 12 zzso for competition with zzso for binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for competition with zzso for binding to zzso It shows no ability to compete with zzso for binding to the two zzso zzso receptors zzso receptors 1 and 2) or to zzso zzso or zzso zzso with this binding data, zzso was only able to induce calcium zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso or zzso
