Many zzso were designed to find ETA zzso zzso on the hypothesis that an ETA zzso can recognize two zzso parts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso over a short zzso They were zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid by zzso chain zzso using the solution zzso The binding affinity of the synthetic peptides to the zzso receptors was examined in zzso cardiac zzso muscle membrane for ETA zzso and in bovine whole brain membrane for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected as an ETA zzso competitive zzso to zzso It zzso against zzso at ETA zzso sites and showed one-third the binding affinity of zzso for ETA zzso and zzso zzso the affinity for zzso zzso It inhibited the zzso increase of zzso free calcium concentration in A-10 zzso The zzso zzso zzso was prepared to distinguish the distribution of ETA zzso from zzso zzso zzso plot analysis of zzso binding of zzso to zzso cardiac zzso showed the same zzso value as that of zzso zzso studies showed that ETA receptors are most abundant in the cardiac muscle, zzso large zzso zzso and zzso
