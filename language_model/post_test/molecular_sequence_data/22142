zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by acting as a decoy zzso The decoy characteristic of zzso is required for normal development and zzso To date, there is no molecular explanation for this unusual characteristic of zzso Here we show that the molecular mechanisms underlying the decoy characteristic of zzso is linked to the replacement of a highly zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso acid is highly zzso among all the type III zzso and zzso to zzso acid, but in zzso it is zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso loop to zzso acid promoted enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso cell proliferation but not zzso It also displayed an zzso zzso as its expression in zzso cells zzso transformation and colony zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso acid to zzso in zzso lowered the zzso of zzso loop zzso zzso and zzso We propose that the zzso zzso acid in the zzso loop favors the zzso of the zzso loop zzso and its absence renders zzso to a less potent zzso by zzso zzso of zzso loop zzso
