Slowly growing, zzso bacteria of a novel zzso species were isolated from zzso zzso samples in two children and pulmonary samples in two elderly patients from different regions in the Netherlands as well as from a surface water sample in zzso Its zzso zzso zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences are unique in comparison with other zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that these zzso are most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso % zzso The zzso sequence shows 96 % similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence shows 95 % similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ITS sequence places these zzso within the zzso zzso complex, as a novel ITS zzso This is not supported by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso Their zzso combined with mostly positive zzso positive zzso zzso and negative zzso reduction tests, set these zzso apart from related zzso The zzso acid patterns, obtained by zzso are similar to that of zzso zzso though the peak heights and distribution present minor zzso We propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for this novel zzso The type strain, isolated from a zzso zzso biopsy sample, is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
