zzso disease is typically zzso with acute zzso illness characterized by zzso and severe zzso anemia zzso zzso followed by benign, chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso agent, zzso zzso is endemic in specific regions of Peru and zzso We describe zzso infection in an expatriate patient who presented with acute zzso and anemia 3 years after visiting zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the patient's blood and serum were negative for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso biopsy was suggestive of zzso zzso but zzso ruled out zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subsequently cultured from the patient's blood and analyzed using zzso sequence zzso protein gel zzso with Western zzso and an zzso zzso zzso against a panel of zzso from patients with zzso fever in zzso The zzso zzso sequences zzso and internal transcribed zzso and protein band zzso pattern were most similar to a subset of zzso zzso zzso from the region of zzso zzso in Peru, where zzso zzso is zzso By zzso the patient's serum reacted strongly to two out of the three Peruvian zzso zzso zzso tested, and zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso fever zzso zzso zzso zzso were also detected in the zzso of the patient, who was zzso infected with zzso zzso and who presumably acquired infection in a region of Ecuador where zzso zzso was not thought to be zzso This study suggests that the range of zzso zzso may be expanding from areas of zzso in Ecuador and that infection may present as zzso clinical zzso
