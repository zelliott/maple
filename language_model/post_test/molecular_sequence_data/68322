Four new zzso zzso were obtained through alkaline zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso By this zzso both the fatty acids zzso and the zzso group of zzso acid were removed to give zzso zzso and zzso the additional loss of the zzso group of the zzso zzso gave zzso zzso and zzso with three free zzso zzso The structures of four zzso zzso were zzso characterized by chemical analysis and zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as by negative zzso zzso The aim of this study was to isolate pure breakdown products of zzso enabling the evaluation of the mechanism of action of zzso through their zzso and identification of structures of potential pharmacological zzso These new substances were prepared as candidates to influence zzso production and the mechanisms dependent on protein zzso C and zzso zzso
