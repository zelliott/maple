Two frequent protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been used as genetic markers in humans for more than two decades, although zzso mapping of the zzso locus in the 1980s produced conflicting zzso To resolve this conflict and develop useful DNA markers for this zzso we isolated and characterized zzso and zzso clones of zzso We have definitively mapped human zzso to the zzso of zzso using several zzso First, two zzso shown to contain the zzso sequence were derived from a zzso zzso zzso Second, by zzso in zzso zzso we mapped the zzso containing the human zzso gene to zzso band zzso Third, we mapped the rat zzso zzso to the zzso region of rat zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso specific to human zzso amplify sequences contained within a zzso from the long arm of zzso 8, that is, a zzso containing the zzso zzso The human zzso zzso sequence spans zzso zzso and consists of 11 zzso ranging in size from 79 to 243 zzso The zzso sequence encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that is nearly identical to the previously reported protein sequence of human zzso The two zzso zzso zzso are the results of a zzso substitution in zzso 14, coding for a zzso in zzso and an zzso in zzso which causes a gain or loss of an zzso restriction zzso In addition, a zzso containing the zzso sequence also contains a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso gene and associated zzso will be useful for linkage and physical mapping of disease zzso that map to the zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso In addition, this will be a useful system for characterizing the zzso region of zzso Finally, determination of the molecular basis of the zzso zzso zzso will permit zzso detection of this zzso zzso
