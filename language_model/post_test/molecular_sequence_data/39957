zzso zzso libraries of zzso constrained peptides against zzso targets is zzso in identifying novel drug leads and in developing new zzso for chemical zzso In methods such as zzso selections, zzso zzso targets are often immobilized on zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the characterization of peptides that bind zzso and zzso is necessary for accurate interpretation of screening and selection zzso Toward this goal, we panned a zzso zzso zzso library against zzso a chemically zzso version of zzso The selection produced a highly zzso consensus motif zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound both zzso and zzso with zzso zzso constants, whereas their zzso counterparts had negligible affinity zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso peptides were very specific for their targets and did not bind the structurally and functionally similar zzso zzso Thus, we have identified a new class of zzso zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results will not only allow for discriminating between desired and background zzso zzso motifs in selections and screens but also provide a new zzso model system and a useful zzso in chemical biology that can have utility in protein zzso zzso and chemical zzso
