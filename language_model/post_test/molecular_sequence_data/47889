zzso zzso synthesis is regulated by several distinct families of zzso zzso Members of one of these families, the type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and are thought to zzso a minor route of synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the partial zzso of a protein zzso that zzso the type zzso zzso zzso at a single site unique to that zzso - zzso This zzso was identified as protein zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso to mimic its zzso had no effect on zzso zzso activity, but promoted both zzso of the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso in zzso cells from the zzso to the plasma zzso and membrane zzso This effect was zzso by zzso of zzso to zzso although not to zzso suggesting a mechanism involving the zzso of a zzso membrane zzso sequence in response to zzso
