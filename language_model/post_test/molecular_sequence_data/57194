The zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso as a precursor with a zzso extension at the zzso zzso which is removed and replaced with an zzso containing zzso that anchors the protein to the plasma zzso We performed zzso zzso on the anchor attachment site zzso and showed that only a subset of zzso acids with small side chains could act as zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso which is the most efficient anchor attachment site, zzso zzso Ala, zzso and zzso function with decreasing zzso zzso analysis also revealed that the 2 adjacent zzso acids to the zzso side of the anchor attachment site are important for efficient zzso These two zzso acids should have relatively short side chains with the second position being more zzso Analysis of the region between the anchor attachment site and the zzso zzso region indicated that this region may not simply perform a zzso zzso
