zzso of the zzso during zzso is an essential step towards process management and zzso Up till now, however, microbial characterization in the zzso process has mostly been done using zzso methods, probably leading to biased estimates of microbial zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial communities using two zzso methods, including Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso samples originated from two harvest years and two zzso houses zzso the same batch of zzso Besides targeting the entire bacterial community zzso emphasis was put on zzso acid bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overall bacterial community richness was zzso but the community structure changed during the zzso zzso in on the zzso community using zzso zzso revealed a total of 47 zzso operational zzso units zzso zzso diversity appeared relatively limited since zzso of the sequences were covered by the same five zzso (representing members of zzso zzso and zzso present in all samples zzso zzso in the relative zzso of the dominant zzso were observed with the process zzso In addition, both the year of harvest and zzso house influenced the zzso community zzso
