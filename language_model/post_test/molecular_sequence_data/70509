The protein product of the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, is structurally related to the zzso growth factor zzso binding proteins zzso We have characterized aspects of structure, function, and distribution of this zzso which, as zzso protein 3 zzso is a proposed member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso zzso zzso human zzso established that zzso binds zzso zzso and insulin with low zzso zzso of binding was shown by competitive zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso was also demonstrated by zzso Western zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a broad range of human zzso Western zzso studies, using a zzso rabbit zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso protein is zzso in zzso by several breast and prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso studies of human biological zzso identified that zzso was present in normal serum, pregnancy serum, serum from patients with growth hormone zzso zzso zzso fluid, zzso fluid, zzso fluid, and zzso fluid, while zzso fragments were identified in zzso fluid, zzso fluid, and zzso and zzso urine zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso exhibits zzso zzso albeit at low zzso and zzso thus merits inclusion in the zzso zzso The low affinity zzso binding suggests that zzso may act primarily independently of the zzso The synthesis of zzso by several zzso cell lines and its presence in human biological zzso suggest that this protein possesses other interesting roles, potentially in cell growth zzso
