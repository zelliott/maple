Plants contain two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that affect the zzso zzso have not been zzso although defects in zzso zzso known in many plant species, indicate a function in starch zzso We describe a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Plants zzso for the zzso zzso are impaired in transient and storage starch zzso Thus, zzso activity of zzso zzso contributes to starch zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso zzso not found in the wild type and is deficient in linear zzso indicating that the zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso during kernel starch zzso Furthermore, in a background deficient in zzso zzso zzso conditions a significant zzso of zzso in the kernel that is not seen in the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso partially compensates for the zzso in zzso zzso suggesting a function during starch synthesis as well as zzso
