zzso of zzso coli containing the zzso locus on plasmids are immune to zzso B which kills cells by dissipating the membrane potential through pore formation in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso region was zzso It contains an open reading frame for a zzso consisting of 175 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence is zzso to the primary structure of the zzso A immunity zzso This, and the strong zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso A and B suggests a common evolutionary origin for both zzso The immunity protein could be identified following strong zzso of zzso The zzso determined molecular weight of 20,000 was close to the calculated molecular weight of zzso The protein contains four large zzso zzso The immunity protein was localized in the membrane fraction and was mainly contained in the zzso zzso It is proposed that the immunity protein zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso
