Recently, a large number of zzso zzso zzso have been found in a wide variety of organisms, but their biological functions are poorly zzso except for several tiny zzso To identify novel zzso with essential functions in flowering plants, we focused attention on zzso zzso III zzso zzso and its zzso activity, because most Pol zzso zzso contribute to key processes relating to cell activities, and have highly zzso promoter zzso upstream sequence zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso stretch as a zzso zzso After in zzso prediction from the zzso zzso 20 novel zzso candidates were zzso zzso zzso zzso 260 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso were identified by efficient in zzso zzso by Pol III in tobacco nuclear zzso zzso zzso was zzso among six additional zzso of zzso and the secondary structure of the zzso was also zzso among the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed in the plant roots and zzso of cultured zzso The zzso was not processed into a smaller zzso and no short open reading frame was zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso responded zzso to hypoxic stress, and this regulation evidently differed from that of zzso zzso
