zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to their zzso and their shedding from zzso Support for the occurrence of this zzso mechanism in intact cells has been obtained by showing that zzso is significantly more zzso when human zzso are incubated with an elevated zzso concentration in the presence of zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso than in its zzso The aim of this work was to identify the zzso zzso on zzso that are removed as a result of the action of zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from intact human zzso incubated for 48 h with 200 zzso zzso and zzso was incubated in zzso with zzso and zzso After reduction of zzso zzso with zzso the protein was zzso with zzso zzso were separated by zzso zzso liquid zzso and the radioactive zzso were analyzed by mass zzso Nine different modified zzso were zzso These were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Some zzso zzso were readily zzso to a zzso extent by zzso in zzso whereas others zzso zzso were slowly and only very partially zzso The zzso peptides containing reduced zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso were much less abundant if the zzso zzso used for the in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso came from zzso incubated with an elevated zzso concentration in the absence of zzso indicating that these zzso zzso had been substantially zzso in intact cells when zzso action was zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to be zzso zzso in intact zzso
