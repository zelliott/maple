zzso fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of zzso zzso acid bacteria zzso are among the zzso microbial species in African indigenous fermented food products and are used for different applications in the food and biotechnology zzso Numerous studies have described zzso zzso profiles of zzso from different parts of the zzso However, there is limited information on zzso resistance profiles of zzso from zzso The aim of this study was to characterize 33 zzso previously isolated from three different African indigenous fermented food products using zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their zzso resistance profiles by the broth zzso method and their zzso activity on sheep blood zzso plates as indicators of safety traits among these zzso 

Using molecular biology based methods and selected zzso tests such as zzso reaction, CO2 production from zzso colonies and cells zzso the zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The bacteria were susceptible to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity profiles to zzso and zzso was observed among the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (except strain zzso and zzso zzso strains being susceptible to zzso whereas zzso strains and zzso zzso strains were zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains were resistant to zzso whereas some zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains had a zzso value of zzso and zzso zzso No zzso activity was observed, however, zzso activity was observed in zzso zzso of the strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The resistance to zzso and zzso is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for zzso Low prevalence of zzso indicator traits were observed among the zzso especially with the presence of poor zzso activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter cultures or zzso for different zzso
