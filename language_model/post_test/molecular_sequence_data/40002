zzso zzso has been known as a zzso producer of two chemically different zzso (red zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso During genetic investigation of such control mechanisms, zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso was zzso The gene concerning such zzso was identified as zzso by DNA cloning followed by sequencing and zzso analysis of the presumed product with 314 zzso The product zzso was the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and classified as a zzso regulator belonging to zzso zzso By zzso analysis, the zzso zzso was shown to zzso the zzso gene (the first gene of the pig cluster involved in zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso was in the level of parent strain zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso demonstrated binding activity to DNA fragments of the upstream region of zzso and zzso genes and not to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso transformed with a zzso zzso carrying zzso demonstrated reduced production of zzso and zzso zzso and reduced activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso except zzso zzso zzso generation of virulent zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of the zzso gene in infected zzso or ex zzso environments was zzso
