The zzso zzso region sequences were determined for the zzso zzso of seven strains of zzso Louis encephalitis virus zzso and one strain of West Nile virus zzso using a single synthetic zzso primer complementary to the zzso of the coding region of a strain of zzso zzso The zzso sequences obtained for the zzso and zzso zzso were compared with published sequences for yellow fever virus zzso Murray Valley encephalitis virus zzso and dengue zzso While only short regions within the zzso sequence were zzso among different zzso zzso significant zzso was observed in this region among members of the same zzso zzso and almost complete conservation was observed between different strains of the same zzso For example, seven strains of zzso isolated from different geographic locations over a 17-year period and differing in their zzso zzso contained only two to four zzso changes in the zzso zzso Interestingly, each of three zzso strains shared the same unique base substitution at position zzso Secondary structures predicted to be formed by the zzso of each of the different zzso zzso zzso were of similar size and shape, in each case consisting of a stem with a small top loop and a larger side zzso The prediction of a common structure among a number of different zzso despite the lack of extensive sequence zzso suggests that this secondary structure is functionally zzso An additional stem and loop structure is predicted to be formed in the region spanning the translation initiation zzso This structure showed significantly less conservation of size and shape than the zzso secondary zzso
