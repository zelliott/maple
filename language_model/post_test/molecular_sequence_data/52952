A novel zzso isolated from the cell wall of zzso zzso was recently zzso This zzso splits internally a zzso zzso and transfers the newly generated reducing end to the zzso end of another 1, zzso zzso forming a zzso linkage, resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso this zzso was cloned and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso to several zzso protein families zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Although the expression of these genes is required for correct zzso in zzso the zzso function of the zzso proteins was zzso The zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that these proteins have a zzso activity similar to that of zzso zzso data and sequence analysis have shown that zzso is attached to the membrane through a zzso in a similar manner as the zzso zzso zzso The activity has been also detected in membrane zzso showing that this zzso is indeed active in zzso Our results show that zzso anchored to the plasma membrane via zzso can play an active role in zzso cell wall zzso
