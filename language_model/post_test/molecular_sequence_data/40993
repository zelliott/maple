Protection against pregnancy associated malaria zzso is associated with high levels of zzso zzso This protection is obtained by the parity dependent acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular signatures have been identified in zzso zzso These two observations combined point to the importance of identifying zzso sequence variation, which facilitate zzso evasion or zzso of host immune zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso are likely to contain zzso zzso and therefore do constitute attractive targets for vaccine zzso 

zzso zzso sequences obtained from zzso of 40 zzso zzso were zzso by a combination of experimental and in zzso zzso Competition zzso zzso on two zzso zzso using plasma samples from women from two different areas and specific mice zzso zzso indicated that zzso possess zzso and zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso identified zzso areas that are zzso by naturally acquired zzso zzso zzso against these peptides zzso the native proteins on the surface of zzso zzso Despite high zzso sequence zzso among zzso zzso sequence analyses identified motifs in zzso that discriminate zzso according to donor's zzso Moreover, zzso proteins of two zzso zzso zzso displayed diverse recognition patterns by plasma from zzso women, and diverse zzso binding zzso 

This study provides insights into zzso and exposed B cell zzso in zzso that might be a focus for cross zzso The importance of sequence variation in zzso as a critical challenge for vaccine development is zzso zzso zzso seems to be essential to its zzso zzso identification of sequence variation sites in distinct locations within zzso affecting zzso and/or binding properties, is critical to the effort of developing an efficient zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso segregation according to parity constitute one such zzso
