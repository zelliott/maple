Total zzso were extracted from brain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and were translated in zzso or in zzso The newly zzso zzso were analyzed through zzso of zzso products or the Western zzso technique using zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the products translated in zzso only one class of zzso of 70 zzso was recognized by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, some in zzso translated products as well as proteins extracted from brain of worms showed identical zzso These zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso and anti zzso zzso These results suggest the existence of zzso common to in zzso and in zzso translated products, to zzso extracted from the brain and to some zzso zzso peptides of the zzso zzso We zzso the presence, in the brain of zzso zzso of precursors of peptides related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Data reported in this investigation do not allow us to propose or even zzso the presence, in the brain of the worm, of one precursor zzso common to zzso related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso precursor molecules exhibit a clear-cut difference in molecular mass with the zzso zzso 70 zzso versus 30 zzso
