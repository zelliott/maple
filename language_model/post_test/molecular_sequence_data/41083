The stability of the characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolate was initially determined in zzso Part of the zzso zzso zzso isolate was cultured without zzso for 4 weeks, and then newly exposed to 200 zzso zzso As a result, this isolate could zzso the same as the zzso zzso indicating that the characteristic of zzso resistance was stable in the zzso zzso Additionally, the level of zzso in the zzso isolate was comparatively lower than in the zzso suggesting that the proliferation potential of the zzso isolate would be lower than that of the zzso zzso to investigate the involvement of zzso DNA zzso in zzso resistance in zzso zzso the zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso were compared with those of the zzso As a result, these three genes were not altered in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso genes were observed by zzso zzso As a result, the gene zzso of those genes in the zzso isolate was not significantly zzso These results indicated that zzso did not affect zzso directly in zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is suggested that zzso should not be deeply involved in zzso resistance in zzso zzso
