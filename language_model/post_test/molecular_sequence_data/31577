zzso bare patch and root rot disease of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso develops as distinct patches of stunted plants and limits the yield of zzso zzso wheat in the Pacific Northwest of the United zzso At the site of a long-term cropping systems study near zzso WA, a decline in zzso patch disease was observed over an 11-year zzso zzso communities from bulk and zzso soil of plants from inside the patches, outside the patches, and recovered patches were analyzed by using zzso with zzso designed for zzso zzso zzso in the class zzso and the zzso zzso were found at higher zzso in the zzso of healthy plants outside the patches than in that of diseased plants from inside the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found at higher zzso in recovered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were found at higher zzso in the zzso of diseased plants from inside the zzso For selected zzso trends were validated by quantitative zzso zzso and observed shifts of zzso in the zzso over time were duplicated in cycling experiments in the greenhouse that involved successive plantings of wheat in zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso inside the patches and exhibited significant antagonism against zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in greenhouse zzso In conclusion, we identified novel bacterial zzso that respond to conditions affecting bare patch disease symptoms and that may be involved in suppression of zzso root rot and bare batch zzso
