A rapid and highly sensitive zzso zzso for zzso toxin zzso has been developed using zzso zzso zzso outbreaks are relatively rare, but their results can be very zzso usually leading to death from respiratory zzso To exert their zzso the biological toxins must first bind to receptors on the cell surface, and the zzso zzso has been identified as the cell zzso for zzso zzso in this study, zzso was used to prepare the zzso by spontaneous zzso into the zzso zzso In a zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso is detected as a colored band on a zzso membrane strip, where zzso bound to the zzso are captured by zzso zzso immobilized in a band across the zzso The intensity of the colored band can be visually estimated, or measured by zzso using computer zzso The limit of detection zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso system was 15 zzso zzso which is comparable to the limits of detection achieved with the most sensitive zzso previously zzso However, this rapid zzso can be completed in less than 20 zzso These results demonstrate that the sandwich zzso using zzso for detection of zzso is rapid and very sensitive, suggesting the possibility for detecting zzso in field zzso simply and zzso without the need for complex zzso
