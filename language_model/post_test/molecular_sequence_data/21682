zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets a linear zzso within the highly zzso membrane zzso external region zzso of the zzso envelope protein zzso integral zzso Prospective vaccine developments warrant efforts currently zzso to unveil the zzso and structural basis of its mode of zzso One open question relates to the putative role that membrane zzso might play in the zzso zzso In this work, we establish experimental conditions that allow monitoring zzso zzso into zzso zzso Then, we compare the abilities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recovered from zzso rabbits to directly penetrate into zzso zzso and block the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced membrane zzso which was blocked on interacting with the zzso zzso thereby suggesting that such phenomenon was primarily zzso by the zzso zzso The long, zzso zzso region zzso loop contributed little to this zzso In contrast, the zzso loop was required for blocking the zzso activity of zzso peptides and viral zzso Thus, our results suggest that core zzso binding plus association with zzso zzso are not in conjunction sufficient to support viral zzso by zzso Moreover, they support a role for the zzso loop in establishing secondary interactions with lipids and/or zzso that would block the zzso activity of zzso during zzso
