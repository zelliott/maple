We previously reported the sequence of zzso one of the two genes zzso zzso zzso protein zzso With the aim of conducting an evolutionary study we have cloned and zzso a second zzso zzso The disruption of both genes is zzso Unlike other duplicated zzso protein zzso each open reading frame is interrupted by two zzso containing long zzso zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso sequences reveals that the zzso of the zzso gene must have occurred very zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso sequences of zzso proteins from various species show the existence not only of zzso zzso proteins but also of a family of zzso zzso These are present in at least three species of zzso and seem to be functionally distinct from zzso zzso
