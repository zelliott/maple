A new cryptic zzso zzso from an zzso zzso strain isolated from Spanish wines is zzso zzso sequence analysis zzso zzso revealed the presence of three major open reading frames zzso whose zzso sequence and zzso proteins exhibit high zzso with those of zzso a previously described zzso of zzso zzso Common features in other plasmids from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been found in zzso They have three major zzso in the same zzso the putative zzso proteins by two of these zzso exhibit zzso with the replication zzso and the zzso zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso family and related zzso bacteria zzso these plasmids contain the DNA sequences required for zzso replication by the rolling circle mechanism and for zzso zzso zzso origin, zzso zzso origin, zzso zzso sites, zzso and zzso and finally, all these plasmids have a third zzso of unknown zzso These features suggest that zzso could constitute together with zzso and zzso a family of small cryptic plasmids of zzso zzso
