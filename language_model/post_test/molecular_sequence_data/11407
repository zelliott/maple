We have previously cloned a zzso of a rat zzso zzso which is strongly expressed in skeletal zzso Both the highest zzso activity, as well as the highest zzso level, are present in this zzso To understand the basis of the expression of this zzso we have cloned and zzso the rat gene and its zzso region from a rat zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso was found to span zzso zzso of zzso DNA, and to consist of two zzso and three zzso zzso 1 contains the zzso zzso region, and zzso 2 and 3 zzso the regions containing the zzso initiation zzso and two zzso zzso In the zzso zzso there are a zzso box and two zzso pairs known as consensus binding sites for zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of zzso zzso zzso expression zzso demonstrated the zzso zzso to be active in rat zzso zzso cells shown to express this zzso but inactive in rat zzso zzso shown not to express the zzso The zzso activity was increased zzso after induction of zzso differentiation by serum zzso These observations give an account of zzso expression of the zzso gene in skeletal zzso
