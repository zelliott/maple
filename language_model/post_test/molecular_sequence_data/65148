The zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso through zzso zzso within its zzso zzso domain zzso However, these zzso linkages are zzso for the formation of the zzso zzso and for the functional zzso of two inactive zzso In this study, using molecular zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso we examined the importance of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso for the zzso zzso and functional zzso We found that the zzso zzso carrying zzso and zzso still exists mostly as a zzso linked zzso and has a significantly higher apparent affinity for calcium than the zzso zzso However, a combination of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduces zzso zzso and markedly zzso the zzso We also found that zzso and zzso mediate the zzso zzso interactions important for functional zzso Because mutating either the two zzso or the two zzso enhances the apparent zzso affinity of the zzso it is likely that the changes in zzso relationships between two zzso zzso linked by these zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso are unlikely to have negative effects on the secondary structure of each zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso effects of the combined zzso on the function of the zzso further suggest that zzso zzso through its zzso is essential for the formation of a functional zzso structure of the zzso
