The zzso protein of human zzso zzso strain zzso and canine zzso strains zzso and zzso exhibited greater than zzso zzso acid identity within their group, but showed less identity with zzso proteins of other zzso and animal zzso zzso the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso being most similar to them zzso zzso acid zzso To exclude the possibility that these three strains were members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed using zzso to zzso viruses containing the zzso gene from each of zzso zzso and zzso The result established close zzso similarity among the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso and revealed only a marginal degree of similarity between the zzso proteins of these three strains and that of strain zzso These sequence and zzso data suggest that the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso represent a new P zzso which we propose to assign zzso
