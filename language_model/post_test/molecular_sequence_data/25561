The roles of the zzso element and sequences near the zzso initiation site in specifying the location of initiation sites in zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso The importance of spacing was demonstrated by analysis of a series of deletions that removed from zzso zzso between the zzso element and zzso translation initiation site of this zzso zzso extension mapping showed that increasing deletion length is associated with a progressive shift downstream in the location of the initiation zzso The distance of a given site from the promoter affected the relative ability of the site to be zzso for zzso For this zzso a zzso region for zzso initiation exists between 55 and 125 bases downstream of the zzso element, and a zone of zzso bases allows zzso usage of an initiation zzso The presence of a zzso sequence was shown to be necessary in zzso zzso for maintaining the location of this zzso of zzso The zzso sequence is essential for function of the gene in zzso zzso This zzso as well as the majority of the 63 zzso zzso genes surveyed, uses initiation sites which fit a zzso zzso zzso zzso were recovered which restored zzso activity to a deletion zzso that zzso its zzso downstream of the zzso DNA sequence and transcript analysis with these zzso confirmed the requirement of proper spacing and conformity of initiation sites to the zzso consensus for efficient transcript zzso
