zzso zzso production requires robust zzso cocktails to produce zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso are a potential source of zzso and zzso adapted to harsher reaction conditions than commercial zzso zzso zzso microbial zzso were adapted to zzso at zzso to develop zzso zzso zzso for detailed zzso zzso community analysis using zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing demonstrated that zzso adaptation to zzso resulted in zzso bacterial zzso with a high abundance of bacteria related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At lower zzso zzso zzso and an zzso lineage of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso isolated from these zzso had high levels of zzso and zzso zzso Compared to commercial zzso zzso the zzso zzso had a higher zzso and were more stable in the presence of zzso zzso zzso an zzso liquid used for biomass zzso The zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso at elevated temperatures (up to zzso demonstrating that these zzso are an excellent source of zzso for the development of zzso cocktails tailored to more extreme reaction zzso
