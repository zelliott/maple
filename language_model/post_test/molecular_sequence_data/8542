Two separate unrefined models for the secondary structure of two zzso of the zzso zzso were independently constructed by examining patterns of variation and conservation within zzso protein zzso assigning surface, interior, zzso and active site zzso to positions in the zzso and identifying zzso in zzso A consensus model for the secondary structure of the entire zzso was then zzso The prediction tests the limits of an unrefined prediction made using this approach in a large protein with substantial functional and sequence divergence within the zzso The protein belongs to the zzso zzso with the core beta strands aligned zzso The zzso structural elements that are readily identified in this model is a parallel beta sheet built by strands C, D, and zzso with zzso 2 and 3 connecting strands zzso and zzso respectively, and an analogous zzso unit zzso G and zzso 7) toward the end of the zzso The resemblance of the zzso model to the zzso structure formed by zzso zzso barrel proteins is almost certainly not zzso
