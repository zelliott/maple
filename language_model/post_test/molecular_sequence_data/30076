zzso from zzso zzso is zzso by two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso The two genes were fused by replacing a segment extending from near the end of zzso into the zzso end of zzso by a synthetic zzso The construction removed the zzso stop zzso at the end of zzso the intervening region of 26 base pairs, and the initial zzso of zzso A zzso site was included at the junction between the two genes and an zzso site was created near the end of zzso without altering its zzso acid zzso In zzso coli the fused zzso gene could be expressed to produce functional zzso that gave about zzso of the activity in cells without the zzso An zzso zzso exists close to and preceding the zzso of the zzso zzso This was removed and the entire fused gene bracketed by several restriction zzso zzso The fused zzso gene was successfully expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by transferring it to appropriate zzso zzso
