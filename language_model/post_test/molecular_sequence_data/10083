Unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso transition of zzso of factor zzso apparently requires not only conversion of the zzso to active form factor zzso zzso but also interaction of zzso with tissue factor zzso To determine the region of interaction that zzso with maturation of the zzso active site, we modified zzso zzso bonds in zzso and examined the interaction of the modified zzso with soluble zzso zzso We found that partial reduction and zzso of zzso bonds in zzso led to losses of zzso activity and the binding ability to zzso To determine the sites of modification that associate with the loss of functions, partially zzso zzso was separated on a column of immobilized zzso Each of the zzso and zzso zzso and native zzso was then zzso by zzso and the digest was analyzed by zzso high performance liquid zzso We found that reduction and zzso of a zzso bond between zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of zzso led to loss of the binding ability with zzso and the modification of a zzso bond between zzso and zzso of zzso led to loss of the zzso zzso In the three-dimensional structures of zzso and zzso the zzso bonds corresponding to zzso and zzso of zzso are, respectively, in and adjacent to the zzso domain, which has flexible zzso in zzso but not in zzso Furthermore, the crystal structure of human zzso complex indicates that the region next to zzso is in contact with zzso We speculate that a regional flexibility, reflected by the zzso nature of zzso bonds of zzso and zzso in the zzso domain, contributes to the inability of zzso to attain the active zzso zzso of zzso with this flexible region may stabilize the structure in a zzso similar to that of the active state of zzso
