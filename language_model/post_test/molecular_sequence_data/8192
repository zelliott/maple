zzso a zzso zzso is a potent skin tumor promoter in zzso zzso mouse zzso In the present study zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso classical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso skin tumor zzso were examined for their ability to inhibit zzso tumor zzso Female zzso mice were initiated with 200 zzso zzso and promoted with zzso promoting doses of either 5 zzso zzso zzso or 200 zzso zzso twice weekly for 25 weeks and zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso zzso or 2 zzso or zzso were applied 30 zzso prior to each zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso with both doses of zzso and by zzso zzso with both doses of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso formation was not inhibited by either dose of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso by only zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were zzso to zzso and zzso demonstrated the same zzso of zzso zzso as zzso or zzso zzso without zzso and zzso treatment, further indicating that the zzso activity of zzso and zzso is zzso and not solely dependent on zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso treatment completely abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso S zzso cells, however, zzso had no zzso effect on the weak zzso response induced by zzso zzso these results indicate that the promotional activity of zzso as well as its weak zzso response, result from a distinct promoter mechanism and/or that zzso promotes a unique population of zzso cells that are insensitive to zzso and zzso and cannot be distinguished by their zzso zzso zzso
