This work deals with the zzso study of 12 zzso bacteria isolated from zzso zzso rice zzso and zzso contaminated with zzso from the chemical and salt industries, which were assigned to the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso as well as of some strains described previously as zzso zzso The study revealed three zzso species, whose members and the type strains of the closest species of zzso had DNA similarity levels between 24 and zzso The strains of the zzso species differed from each other and from the known species of zzso in some zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the sugar and zzso composition of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed the assignment of the environmental zzso to the zzso zzso and showed the zzso distinction of the three zzso zzso The results obtained in this study allow three new zzso species to be zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
