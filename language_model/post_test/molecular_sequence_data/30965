Spreading of tobacco mosaic virus in infected plants is of two modes: zzso movement (to adjacent zzso and long-distance movement (to distant parts of the zzso zzso coat protein has been suggested to be involved in long-distance zzso To analyze the function of coat protein in the movement, we used zzso with modifications in the coat protein gene or in the assembly origin on the zzso zzso A zzso which has the coding region for the zzso 5 zzso acids of the protein deleted and zzso with 1 zzso acid inserted after zzso 101 or 152 of the protein retained both the abilities of long-distance movement and assembly into virus zzso Other zzso in the coat protein gene eliminated the two zzso A zzso with modifications in the assembly origin displayed greatly reduced abilities of both the movement and zzso These results suggest that both the coat protein with its ability to assemble into virus particles and the assembly origin are involved in long-distance movement, and that virus particles may play a pivotal role in the zzso
