A gene bank was created from zzso zzso strain 27 zzso DNA, and a clone was isolated that zzso the expression of two separate modes of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso The original zzso zzso strain zzso contained zzso zzso with a zzso insert from zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso strain 27 zzso DNA cloned into the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso and deletion zzso were tested for expression of zzso activity in a standard tube zzso measuring zzso of zzso zzso as a function of zzso zzso Cell suspensions of zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso activity, zzso by zzso and heat treatment but not dependent on calcium zzso and not zzso by zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated a heat zzso dose dependent zzso zzso zzso experiments localized the zzso region of the insert to a zzso zzso under direction of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the entire insert revealed the presence of multiple open reading frames (1 to 3) in this region which correlated to different forms of zzso zzso such that zzso containing all open reading frames 1 to 3 demonstrated strong zzso zzso on blood plates and in the tube zzso zzso containing only zzso demonstrated zzso on plates, but not in the tube zzso zzso containing only open reading frames 2 and 3, but not zzso demonstrated zzso in the tube zzso but not on zzso zzso searches of DNA and protein databases have not revealed significant zzso with reported zzso or proteins in any of the open reading zzso
