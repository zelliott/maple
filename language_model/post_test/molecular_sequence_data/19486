zzso Mental zzso zzso occurs in 1 in 600 males and is highly genetically zzso We used a novel human X zzso zzso zzso zzso to survey the expression profile of zzso genes in zzso of zzso zzso Genes with altered expression verified by Northern zzso and/or quantitative zzso were considered zzso To validate this approach, we documented the expected changes of expression in samples from a patient with a known X zzso zzso and from patients with multiple copies of the X zzso We used our zzso to survey zzso zzso samples from 43 unrelated zzso males and found 15 genes with significant zzso reduction in expression in at least one zzso Of these, subsequent analysis confirmed altered expression in zzso We followed up one, zzso at zzso which exhibits approximately fourfold decreased expression in two zzso zzso analysis in both patients revealed a promoter zzso zzso that alters the zzso site of the zzso factor zzso We showed that zzso is sufficient to cause reduced expression using a zzso reporter system and is enriched in a cohort of males with probable zzso zzso of zzso zzso as compared to normal males (9 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in the zzso cells of zzso and zzso cells of the zzso in the zzso We conclude that our zzso screening is an efficient strategy to identify genes that show significant changes in transcript abundance as candidate genes for zzso
