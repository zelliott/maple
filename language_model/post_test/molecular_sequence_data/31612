zzso zzso are a class of short zzso zzso small zzso molecules of about zzso zzso in zzso Their main function is to zzso gene expression in different manners like zzso repression, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso predictions have raised the number of zzso in wheat significantly using an zzso based zzso zzso a zzso approach which is amalgamation of zzso software and zzso script was used to identify new zzso to add to the growing database of wheat zzso Identification of zzso was initiated by mining the zzso zzso zzso zzso database available at National Center for Biotechnology zzso In this investigation, zzso mature zzso sequences belonging to 50 zzso families from different plant species were used to predict zzso in zzso A total of five zzso zzso new zzso were predicted and named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, four previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predicted in newly identified zzso sequence and 14 potential target genes were subsequently predicted, most of which seems to zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors which are involved in growth, development, metabolism and stress zzso Our result has increased the number of zzso in zzso which should be useful for further investigation into the biological functions and evolution of zzso in wheat and other plant zzso
