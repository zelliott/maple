The zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso is an zzso zzso factor that is intimately linked to the processes of DNA replication and cell cycle zzso Previously, we defined a novel zzso element, the zzso zzso element zzso that zzso induction by the zzso zzso zzso upon the human zzso zzso To better understand the regulation of zzso expression by zzso zzso we have identified cellular zzso factors that associate with the zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso the zzso formed three major complexes zzso zzso and zzso with proteins in nuclear extracts from zzso or zzso zzso zzso of complexes zzso and zzso which zzso with zzso promoter activity in zzso requires the zzso zzso factor zzso binding site found within the zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso zzso interference experiments and mobility shift zzso performed with in zzso protein indicated that the zzso factor zzso is a major component of these zzso Similar zzso demonstrated that the zzso B virus zzso protein zzso constitutes a major component of the zzso zzso In addition, we examined the binding of proteins to the minimal zzso promoter to identify other factors important for zzso from the zzso zzso zzso shift zzso revealed that a zzso encompassing the region from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso initiation site forms at least five complexes, zzso with zzso cell nuclear zzso The zzso factor zzso associates with the zzso element of the zzso zzso The identification of these zzso factors will allow their roles in the zzso of zzso by zzso to be zzso
