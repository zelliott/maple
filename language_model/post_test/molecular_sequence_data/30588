A 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned from the zzso of the spontaneously zzso rat zzso displayed restriction zzso length zzso zzso compared with the zzso of the zzso rat zzso when total zzso Southern zzso analysis was performed for two restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the DNA zzso cloned from zzso zzso and zzso libraries revealed that this 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso three point zzso Two of them zzso to T and A to zzso are situated in the middle of the restriction sites for zzso and zzso thus zzso the recognition sites for these zzso in the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis using total complementary zzso DNA obtained from zzso libraries of zzso smooth muscle cells from zzso and a whole zzso zzso with this 3 zzso zzso zzso as a probe, showed zzso bands suggesting that these point zzso are reflected in the sequences of zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the gene zzso in this 3 zzso zzso zzso of two bands by a Northern zzso analysis for zzso from various zzso zzso indicates that this 3 zzso zzso is actively transcribed in zzso
