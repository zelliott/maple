The ability of zzso to activate or repress zzso suggests that its biological function as tumor zzso is in part accomplished by regulating a number of genes including such required for zzso of cell zzso We here give evidence that zzso also may regulate genes responsible for the zzso degradation of the zzso zzso which is considered a crucial feature for local invasion and zzso of zzso zzso An important and highly regulated cascade of such zzso events involves the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and promoter of the human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene through a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso lost the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso zzso specifically binds to and activates the promoter of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, one of the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso promoter zzso Our results suggest that altered function of zzso forms of zzso may lead to altered expression of the zzso zzso and their zzso and thus to altered zzso of the zzso system during tumor zzso
