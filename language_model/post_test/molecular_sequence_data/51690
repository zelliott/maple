zzso zzso zzso isolated from human adult liver tissue are readily separated by zzso zzso in two zzso zzso and zzso which differ from each other in the nature of the zzso acid zzso at position zzso In fetal liver zzso the presence of a third zzso zzso zzso has been previously zzso We determined its partial zzso acid sequence and the sequence of a zzso clone zzso this zzso zzso This confirmed the existence of another human zzso zzso zzso named zzso which is characterized by the presence of a zzso charged zzso acid at position 8, and by a zzso to zzso substitution in a strictly zzso region of the zzso Taking into account these zzso we are able to zzso human zzso zzso into three instead of two zzso groups, based on the nature of three zzso acid zzso The unique presence of zzso in zzso enabled us to develop an zzso amplification by the zzso chain reaction, which revealed the presence of zzso zzso in adult liver zzso samples, in spite of the total absence of this zzso at the protein zzso This suggests the involvement of zzso regulatory mechanisms in the expression of this fetal zzso zzso
