zzso zzso and structural studies have defined a critical role for zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In 1984, a new class of zzso was isolated in which this zzso zzso was replaced with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso has been questioned based on zzso zzso and structural studies zzso den zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and de zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the structures of two crystal forms of the zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The refined models, along with complementary zzso analysis, clarify the structural basis for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
