zzso disease is an zzso error of zzso zzso resulting from deficient activity of zzso zzso A zzso zzso A rare alternative zzso that introduces a zzso zzso zzso sequence to the zzso A transcript from zzso 4 of the gene has been zzso In addition, a novel zzso base substitution that results in substantially increased alternative zzso has been identified in a patient with zzso disease who has the cardiac zzso zzso The sequence of the patient's zzso 4 contains a single zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ), located at the minus zzso position of the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso 4 sequence with G, A, C, or T at zzso zzso within an zzso A complementary DNA expression zzso were prepared and expressed in zzso zzso Whereas zzso of the G or T zzso transcribed predominantly zzso zzso the zzso of the A or C zzso produced a large amount of the alternatively spliced zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso within an zzso domain, results in increased recognition of the alternative zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not observed in 100 unrelated unaffected men but was present in 6 unrelated patients with cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction of total zzso of various normal human zzso revealed that the alternatively spliced transcript was present in all of the samples, and especially at a higher ratio in the lung and zzso The normal transcript was present in the patients' zzso and resulted in approximately zzso residual zzso activity, leading to a cardiac zzso of zzso zzso
