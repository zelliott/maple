The zzso of members of the zzso factor zzso and zzso factor zzso protein families bind to zzso forming zzso zzso factors which regulate expression of genes involved in zzso development and the growth of normal and zzso colon zzso zzso levels of zzso are found in colon tumor cells with zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The elevated levels of zzso result in increased zzso of zzso including zzso important for the growth of these tumor zzso Here we analyze the interaction between zzso and zzso and show that the zzso 53 zzso acids of zzso bind with high affinity to zzso We show that this zzso interaction involves multiple contact points including zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso In addition to zzso family members, zzso binds to zzso and zzso We found that the binding of zzso to zzso zzso or zzso was mutually zzso These results are discussed with regard to how zzso interacts with its binding partners and to the potential for identifying specific, small zzso zzso of these zzso
