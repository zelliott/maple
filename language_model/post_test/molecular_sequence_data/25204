Complete zzso zzso resonance assignments are presented for the zzso rich region of the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein contains short zzso regions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso It is clearly distinct from the zzso class of zinc finger protein typified by the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso We also find that the first zzso zzso a recently proposed DNA binding motif zzso 41 to zzso appears to be tightly packed against the metal binding zzso
