A human zzso previously isolated by virtue of its ability to complement partially the ultraviolet sensitivity of a zzso zzso cell line was further zzso The zzso unit is expressed as a single zzso zzso that encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso possibly initiating from an internal zzso zzso The gene zzso this zzso named zzso has been extremely well zzso during evolution, zzso an important role for this gene product in cell zzso The transcribed zzso is zzso expressed in a wide variety of human zzso The protein zzso by this gene is predicted to contain a zzso structure and is likely to be metabolically unstable based on the occurrence of a strong zzso zzso zzso was assigned to human zzso 11 by Southern zzso to a zzso cell hybrid zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso coupled with zzso analysis of zzso zzso cell hybrids containing segments of human zzso 11 has localized this gene to a zzso of zzso in between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso this region has been shown to be amplified in a variety of human zzso including breast zzso
