zzso is a zzso protein present in the zzso zzso zzso which zzso light (at 460 zzso in the presence of zzso We report here that zzso can be used as a reporter zzso to monitor gene expression in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was fused to several zzso zzso including those of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and introduced into several cell lines such as zzso zzso and zzso At appropriate times after zzso the zzso activities in cell extracts were measured by monitoring the intensity of light zzso at 460 zzso when triggered by zzso by the use of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be as sensitive as the conventional zzso zzso and the relative activities of various promoters estimated by the zzso zzso were in general agreement with those obtained by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be done within zzso h from the preparation of extract to the measurement of activity without using radioactive zzso
