zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 2 gene cause progressive zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso 2 protein zzso is similar in sequence to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with zzso D and zzso zzso C stimulates the zzso activity of native zzso a reaction regulated by zzso zzso 2 zzso Here we show that in the presence of zzso D, zzso protein also stimulates the zzso activity of zzso We find that this function is abolished by zzso in an zzso zzso that is zzso in both zzso C and zzso zzso zzso that alter this zzso zzso cause familial zzso zzso Our data imply that this zzso acts as an zzso zzso to trigger the zzso zzso activity and suggest that loss of this function in zzso contributes to retinal zzso We also show that in zzso zzso both zzso C and zzso partially complement the zzso zzso resulting from deletion of the zzso C zzso demonstrating their functional overlap in zzso Finally, we find that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso providing a link between zzso and several zzso zzso zzso in which also cause zzso zzso
