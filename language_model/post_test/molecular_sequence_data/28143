zzso zzso strain zzso was previously shown to zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso only after the end of exponential zzso Here we show that the closely related strain zzso zzso large amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso during exponential zzso Only a small amount (less than zzso of the zzso zzso was initially retained by the zzso growing cells to be subsequently zzso in a fatty zzso zzso zzso Despite the absence of fatty acids in zzso zzso zzso the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso maturation indicated that all of the zzso zzso by strain zzso is processed by zzso signal zzso
