zzso of human growth zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to stimulate zzso release in zzso by injecting the peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso involved zzso with zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso with or without zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The potency of the zzso was compared to that of zzso testing their ability to release zzso at 5, 15 and 30 zzso after the zzso In zzso test the potency of the zzso was zzso times higher than that of the zzso and no significant differences were detected between the zzso of the zzso with or without zzso zzso In the zzso test the analogue with zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso times higher potency than the zzso however, the analogue with similar modifications but with zzso showed the same low potency zzso as in the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso experiments were similar to those of SC zzso The most potent zzso were those which had zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed that zzso in position 15 increased the stability of the zzso zzso zzso which improved the zzso of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
