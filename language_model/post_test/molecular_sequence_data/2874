zzso clones of the chicken zzso zzso gene and zzso have been isolated and zzso Two highly zzso regions have been identified in the 3' zzso sequence of the human and chicken zzso zzso The zzso regions include sequences that have been shown to be involved in the zzso regulation of human zzso zzso zzso These sequences can be modeled as two different types of zzso secondary structures, one containing zzso structures that are similar to the zzso elements found in zzso zzso and the other being a stable, zzso zzso Both forms show considerable similarity between chicken and human zzso The expression of zzso is zzso regulated during zzso zzso and immature zzso cells express exceptionally high levels of zzso zzso
