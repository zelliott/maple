Human zzso growth zzso factor zzso a zzso protein classified as zzso zzso the survival and the zzso formation of cultured zzso Despite its approximately zzso zzso acid sequence identity with those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso exhibits growth zzso zzso In this study, structural features of the zzso clusters in zzso zzso and zzso and in part also in synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated by using circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso The CD and zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso confirmed the existence of distinct zzso and zzso located in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, a mutual structural stabilization of both zzso was zzso The zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso were conducted at different magnetic fields zzso and zzso zzso and temperatures zzso and 323 zzso At zzso K the zzso revealed seven zzso signals at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A striking feature of all zzso is the absence of resolved zzso zzso zzso and large apparent line zzso (between 140 and 350 zzso which account for the absence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso On the basis of a close correspondence in chemical shift positions of the zzso signals at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with those obtained in our previous studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso these zzso can be assigned to a zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso the remaining three zzso signals at zzso zzso and zzso zzso originate from a zzso cluster in the zzso However, the latter zzso show a markedly reduced and zzso intensity zzso zzso when compared with those of the zzso indicating that the majority of the signal intensity remained zzso To account for the observed zzso features of zzso we suggest that dynamic processes acting on two different zzso time scales are present: zzso fast exchange processes among zzso cluster zzso giving rise to zzso zzso zzso and zzso additional very slow exchange processes within the zzso associated with the formation of zzso cluster zzso The implications of the structure fluctuation for the biological activity of zzso are zzso
