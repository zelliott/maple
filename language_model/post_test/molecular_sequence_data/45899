zzso appropriate tumor zzso is critical to the development of successful specific cancer zzso zzso analysis of tumor zzso by a zzso zzso expression library zzso allows the systematic cloning of tumor zzso recognized by the spontaneous zzso repertoire of cancer zzso We applied zzso to the zzso expression library of cell line zzso which led to the isolation of six known characterized genes and 12 novel zzso Known zzso including ring finger protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were related to the development of different zzso zzso was performed to predict 12 novel zzso (multiple myeloma special zzso zzso The prediction of tumor zzso provides potential targets for the zzso of patients with multiple myeloma zzso and help in the understanding of zzso Crude zzso zzso methodology indicated that the optical density value of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso patients than in healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso Green real-time zzso showed that zzso presented with a high number of copy messages in zzso In zzso the zzso identified in this study may be potential candidates for diagnosis and targets for zzso in zzso
