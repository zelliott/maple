The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso with an unusually large second zzso loop zzso loop, approximately zzso zzso zzso To determine the function of this unique structure, zzso and deletion zzso were prepared and analyzed in zzso zzso zzso Whereas replacement of the zzso zzso segment with that from the human zzso zzso had minimal effect on zzso zzso substitution of the zzso loop with a smaller zzso loop from the zzso zzso zzso abolished binding of zzso and zzso calcium zzso However, as much as zzso of the zzso loop sequence zzso acids zzso may be removed without affecting zzso binding or calcium zzso The zzso loop sequences adjacent to the zzso zzso contain multiple zzso zzso and are found to play an important role in zzso binding based on deletion zzso Replacement of five zzso zzso in the zzso loop with zzso zzso significantly compromised both the binding and functional capabilities of the zzso zzso zzso by intact zzso or by two zzso analog zzso These data suggest a zzso zzso interaction model similar to that established for zzso The zzso zzso near the N and C zzso of the zzso zzso loop constitute a zzso secondary interaction site with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region of zzso whereas the zzso zzso sequence zzso engages the primary zzso site in zzso
