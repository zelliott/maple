zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of respectively zzso and zzso zzso We aim to investigate the ecology of these zzso species using population zzso We sampled zzso from zzso trapped in the East of zzso After confirming the species identification of the zzso using zzso zzso DNA zzso we isolated and characterized twelve zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A multiplex panel was zzso Application to a set of 30 individuals allowed clear and easy characterization of zzso zzso The number of zzso ranged from 2 to 6 per locus with observed zzso ranging from 0 to zzso A test on zzso zzso zzso revealed that eight zzso among twelve zzso and five were zzso These sets of zzso zzso provide high zzso capacity for population genetic zzso
