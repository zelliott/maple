In order to characterize the zzso gene product for zzso zzso protein associated with zzso we prepared zzso to synthetic peptides that zzso to zzso acids zzso zzso zzso within the zzso These zzso were used to analyze the zzso structure, and function of zzso Western analysis with these zzso revealed that zzso was a 46 zzso protein which was expressed during zzso zzso Further, zzso studies showed that zzso localized to thin zzso regions in skeletal zzso Interestingly, when muscle zzso from diabetic and control zzso Indians were zzso no differences in zzso protein or zzso expression were zzso Similarly, no differences were observed in protein expression in diabetic and control zzso diabetic fatty zzso zzso zzso analysis of muscle zzso revealed that its zzso activity was inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso beta S but not zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activity was zzso by the zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso corresponding to this zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that 1) zzso is a 46 zzso zzso protein localized to thin filaments in muscle and its expression increases during zzso fusion, 2) expression of zzso in zzso Indians and zzso rats does not correlate with diabetes, and 3) the zzso acids zzso may be involved in regulating zzso activity, perhaps by interacting with a zzso zzso regulating zzso exchange and/or zzso
