Two zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso were zzso from zzso of the Taiwan Russell's zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Their primary structures were solved by both protein sequencing and zzso cloning and zzso The zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso reaction using a pair of synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso and the zzso zzso regions of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were zzso identical to those of the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, from the Bulgarian zzso zzso zzso zzso itself was zzso whereas zzso had much lower zzso activity and was not zzso The low zzso activity of zzso may be attributed to five zzso zzso at positions 7, 17, 59, 114 and zzso which presumably impair its binding to zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence comparison among all the known group II zzso zzso 6, 12, zzso and zzso were identified as important for the zzso zzso and zzso exist in the crude zzso as zzso which were again formed by mixing together the zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso in zzso but zzso its lethal potency and zzso It is suggested that zzso may facilitate the specific binding of zzso to its zzso binding sites, probably by preventing its zzso zzso
