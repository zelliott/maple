The zzso zzso of the zzso of the human zzso sodium channel zzso increases the functional and surface expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The context of this zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso is important for this effect, as a zzso change in zzso zzso zzso zzso does not alter functional and surface expression of zzso zzso of a zzso database suggested that the zzso zzso might be zzso by zzso General zzso of zzso with zzso C decreased the functional and surface expression of zzso and not zzso and was without effect on zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso outside of the zzso zzso zzso are important for zzso of zzso trafficking by zzso In contrast, expression of zzso decreased the functional and surface expression of zzso and the functional expression of zzso zzso and was without effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso suggesting that it acts indirectly to regulate zzso zzso zzso was retrieved from the zzso membrane more slowly than zzso and zzso C increased the rate of zzso removal from the zzso membrane to a rate similar to that of zzso In contrast, zzso did not alter the rate of removal of zzso from the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso altered rates of zzso zzso and/or delivery to the plasma zzso These data are consistent with zzso zzso effects on the zzso trafficking of zzso zzso zzso
