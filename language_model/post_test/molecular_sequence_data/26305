The comparison of protective effects of native zzso zzso and of preparation zzso containing zzso zzso zzso which specifically binds on zzso zzso receptors showed that zzso exhibits much more powerful protective effect on zzso in zzso zzso It was found, however, that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protected zzso as well as zzso despite its inability of binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a similar way decrease copper concentration in zzso It was shown that copper zzso and zzso decrease in zzso are two independent and concurrent zzso the copper and zzso zzso are not the factors determining zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso the reaction of zzso zzso generation as a result of zzso interaction with zzso groups of zzso zzso the effect is more pronounced than the effect of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso preparations equally inhibit this zzso Apparently zzso reception on zzso leads not only to membrane protection from zzso and zzso zzso but represents a more complex zzso
