It has been established that many zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso the orphan receptors zzso and zzso about as efficiently as the zzso zzso zzso for entry into target zzso Most studies were performed, however, with zzso of human zzso We found that zzso from captive zzso zzso zzso can zzso both human and zzso zzso and zzso with comparable zzso zzso however, only human zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso zzso functioned efficiently as an entry zzso for a variety of zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso A single zzso acid substitution of zzso in zzso impaired zzso activity, and the reverse change in zzso greatly increased zzso zzso In comparison, zzso sequence variations in zzso zzso in zzso had only moderate effects on zzso zzso These results show that a zzso zzso located just outside of the cellular membrane in the N zzso of zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso derived from zzso zzso a natural host of zzso also contained a zzso at the corresponding position and was used efficiently as an entry zzso These results suggest that zzso is not a relevant zzso in the zzso model but may play a role in zzso replication and transmission in naturally infected zzso zzso
