The zzso portion of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso is zzso Besides initiating translation of the zzso zzso zzso elements in the zzso 200 bases of the zzso zzso zzso or its complement at the 3' end of the zzso zzso play key roles in the synthesis of both zzso and zzso zzso We used here a combination of genetic and zzso approaches to further dissect the functions of this zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso end in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with sequences from a zzso related zzso zzso Forest virus zzso resulted in zzso zzso The addition of five zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso restored zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso but not their replication in zzso zzso of various zzso zzso were isolated, and zzso zzso were mapped to zzso sequences added to the zzso end of the original zzso zzso sequence or its zzso zzso Early zzso had zzso zzso zzso that were inefficient for replication relative to the parental zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of these zzso viral populations in zzso cells under competitive conditions yielded evolved, more homogeneous zzso sequences that were highly efficient for zzso synthesis and zzso These zzso sequences always began with zzso followed by one or more zzso repeats or short stretches of zzso Further analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of repeat units and replication zzso Interestingly, some zzso modifications restored high-level viral replication in zzso cells, but these viruses were impaired for replication in the cells of zzso zzso These studies provide new information on sequence zzso required for zzso zzso replication and suggest new strategies for restricting cell zzso and zzso the packaging of zzso zzso
