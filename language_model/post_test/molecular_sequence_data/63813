In this study, we employed zzso zzso zzso extracted from a zzso of Venezuelan origin to clone express and test the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We first confirm the zzso nature of the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso which, as with its zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso type III zzso region, functions as an zzso zzso This zzso the possible importance of zzso in tissue invasion, thus providing a rational explanation for its efficacy as a zzso As protection against zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso therefore, zzso may also serve as a diagnostic zzso as is indeed the case for zzso zzso
