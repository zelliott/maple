zzso growth factor binding protein zzso has been reported to inhibit differentiation of zzso and zzso In the current study, we explored the mechanisms underlying zzso effects on zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso protein was zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and human bone cells inhibited zzso formation, zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the culture media was not required for any of these effects suggesting that zzso suppressed zzso differentiation by an zzso zzso A zzso zzso screen of an zzso library was conducted to identify zzso binding partners to account for zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was identified as a high affinity zzso binding zzso Physical interaction between zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso Fluorescent protein fusion zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso into zzso to provide evidence of zzso locations for each zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in overlapping zzso zzso of zzso and zzso To determine if there was a functional association of zzso and zzso as well as a physical association, we studied the effect of zzso zzso and their combination on type I zzso promoter zzso zzso increased promoter activity while zzso reduced promoter activity, and zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies provide evidence that zzso of zzso suppresses human and zzso zzso zzso that zzso and zzso physically zzso and supports the conclusion that this interaction may be functionally zzso
