This article deals with the zzso of the zzso site of human sex zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso reacted with highly zzso zzso in a zzso and irreversible zzso The interaction could be totally inhibited by the simultaneous addition of an excess of zzso At the completion of the reaction, the zzso ratio of zzso to zzso was approximately zzso zzso was affinity labeled with zzso and submitted to acid zzso The released zzso acids were evaluated on high performance liquid zzso and virtually all of the zzso was identified as zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso with zzso followed by isolation of the released zzso peptides by zzso high performance liquid zzso The zzso was localized to a single zzso zzso It contained 2' zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 235 and 251 in the known zzso acid sequence of zzso Although most of the zzso or its zzso zzso was trapped on the filter of the zzso acid zzso sufficient zzso emerged to identify zzso zzso 235 as the labeled zzso zzso
