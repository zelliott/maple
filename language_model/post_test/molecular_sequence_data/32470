zzso stalled on problematic zzso in bacterial cells can be rescued by zzso zzso zzso its helper protein zzso protein B, zzso and zzso factor Tu zzso through a mechanism called zzso In this work we used zzso zzso to probe the interactions of zzso with zzso and other components of the translation machinery at different steps of the zzso zzso zzso with a short nascent zzso stalled on a truncated zzso were reacted with zzso zzso and other translation components to initiate and execute zzso Free zzso was zzso with zzso zzso with and without zzso and zzso bound zzso was zzso in one of four different zzso states stabilized by zzso addition or selective exclusion of translation zzso For comparison, we also analyzed zzso zzso patterns of zzso in zzso in a zzso as well as in an zzso zzso coli zzso We observed some specific zzso in zzso for the individual steps of zzso but the overall zzso zzso appeared to be similar in the stages zzso Our findings suggest that, in zzso a dominant fraction of zzso is in complex with zzso and that, in zzso zzso remains zzso bound at the initial steps of zzso
