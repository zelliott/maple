Miniature zzso zzso elements zzso are a specific group of zzso DNA zzso and they are distributed in a wide range of zzso However, the origin and evolutionary history of zzso in zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, six zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso Five elements are grouped into four known zzso of DNA zzso and one represents a novel class of zzso zzso six similar zzso are also present in the zzso bug zzso zzso that zzso from the common zzso with the zzso about 370 zzso However, they show different lengths in two species, suggesting that they are different derivatives of zzso zzso Three direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also identified in some other organisms, and several lines of evidence suggested that these autonomous elements might have been independently and zzso transferred into their zzso Furthermore, it is speculated that the zzso zzso may be the candidate zzso for these horizontal zzso The data presented in this study provide some new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso
