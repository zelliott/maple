The zzso zzso divides zzso into an embryonic zzso cell and a zzso cell with mostly zzso zzso This fundamental asymmetry sets the stage for further embryonic development, but the events zzso it are poorly zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso named zzso that promotes zzso cell fates in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso does not zzso properly, and the cells of the zzso lineage are eventually incorporated into the zzso instead of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cause exaggerated growth of the zzso and can suppress embryonic development to a degree where no recognizable zzso is zzso Our results imply that a zzso zzso cascade acts as a molecular switch promoting zzso zzso
