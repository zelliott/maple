Identification of a novel class of potent and highly selective zzso zzso zzso is zzso First, the zzso relationship in the zzso zzso core of our previously reported zzso class of zzso selective zzso was explored by a small zzso library constructed in solid zzso This led to the identification of zzso zzso with a novel zzso zzso and significantly improved zzso selectivity from a previously reported zzso zzso modification on the terminal zzso part of the newly identified class gave zzso as a potent zzso selective zzso that had zzso selectivity versus the zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The possible rationale for its extraordinarily higher zzso selectivity than reported zzso zzso was hypothesized by sequence alignment of multiple zzso receptors and a zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso
