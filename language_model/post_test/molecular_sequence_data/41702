zzso hair cell death is a leading cause of hearing and balance disorders in the human zzso zzso cells are remarkably sensitive to environmental insults such as excessive noise and exposure to some otherwise therapeutic zzso However, individual responses to damaging agents can vary, in part due to genetic zzso We previously carried out a forward genetic screen using the zzso lateral line system to identify zzso that alter the response of zzso hair cells to the zzso zzso one of a class of zzso compounds that cause hair cell death in zzso The zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso are indistinguishable from zzso siblings, but differ in their retention of lateral line hair cells upon exposure to zzso The zzso in zzso maps to the zzso zzso zzso and introduces a single zzso substitution in zzso This zzso prevents delivery of the zzso to the cell surface and zzso the ability of the protein to import zzso across the plasma zzso Loss of function of zzso reduces hair cell death caused by exposure to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso drug zzso zzso block of zzso transport with the zzso zzso derivatives zzso and zzso or exposure to zzso zzso also protects hair cells against zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso larvae show reduced zzso of labeled zzso zzso zzso also show reduced zzso zzso indicating a potential impact on zzso activity in the zzso We propose that tight regulation of the zzso environment of sensory hair cells, zzso by zzso activity, is critical for their sensitivity to zzso zzso
