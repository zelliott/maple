zzso regulatory elements can zzso the human zzso response to environmental zzso Thus, there is a possibility that variation in zzso regulatory elements may zzso some of the diversity in human zzso However, this idea has remained largely untested due to the difficulty in accurately identifying regulatory elements in the zzso of the human zzso that does not zzso zzso The recent recognition that small zzso zzso zzso to zzso and regulate gene expression provides a means to identify and test such zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso of zzso can be attenuated by a common human zzso We have identified an element zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso repression by zzso The repressive activity of this element is attenuated by a common human zzso zzso that zzso a zzso critical for its interaction with zzso Because deletion of the zzso gene leads to an aggressive zzso in mice, we hypothesized an association between the zzso zzso and aggressive zzso in a sample of zzso college zzso As predicted, individuals zzso for the ancestral zzso reported more zzso behaviors than individuals with the zzso Our studies suggest that such functional zzso may be common and may help to refine the search for genes involved in complex behavioral zzso
