zzso zzso is a genetic mechanism that restricts zzso in flowering zzso In the zzso family zzso zzso is controlled by a single zzso S zzso zzso rejection in this system requires the interaction of two S locus zzso a zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso zzso zzso S has not yet been zzso Our understanding of how this gene functions comes from studies of plants with zzso that affect the zzso but not the zzso zzso response zzso zzso These zzso are frequently associated with duplicated S zzso but the absence of an obvious additional zzso in some plants suggests zzso S can also be zzso We studied zzso zzso plants with an additional S zzso and show that zzso causes a zzso zzso in several different genetic zzso zzso of the zzso was consistent with a competitive interaction model in which any two zzso S zzso cause a breakdown of zzso when present in the same zzso zzso We also examined plants with presumed deletions of zzso S and found that they instead have zzso that included zzso S but not the zzso zzso This finding is consistent with a zzso structure for the S zzso The absence of zzso S deletions in this study and perhaps other studies suggests that zzso S might be required for zzso zzso possibly because its product acts as an zzso zzso
