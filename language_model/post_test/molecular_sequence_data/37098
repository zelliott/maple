The adjacent zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso functionally related zinc finger zzso factors that collaborate to initiate development of the second zzso wing vein zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the third zzso zzso wing disc in a narrow stripe of cells just anterior to the broad central zone of cells expressing high levels of the related zzso zzso Here, we identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso element from the zzso locus that faithfully directs gene expression in the zzso zzso We find that three independent zzso zzso have zzso mapping within the zzso element and show that two of these observed zzso eliminate the ability of the zzso element to direct gene expression in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be subdivided into distinct zzso and repression zzso The zzso domain mediates the combined action of the general wing zzso zzso and a putative locally provided factor, the activity of which is zzso by a single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We also find that zzso of genes in zzso that are normally expressed in veins other than zzso results in abnormal zzso zzso These experiments provide a zzso basis for understanding how zzso and zzso link zzso patterning to zzso of the zzso vein by orchestrating the expression of a selective subset of zzso genes in the zzso zzso
