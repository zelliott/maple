We previously isolated and identified steroid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as zzso for zzso using the zzso domain of zzso as bait in a zzso zzso zzso As part of our continuing effort to identify zzso that influence the zzso activity of zzso we now report the isolation of a novel zzso from zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso a nuclear protein with zzso zzso acids and zzso by 13 zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso zzso is zzso expressed in many zzso of adult zzso zzso contains two zzso signature zzso The zzso zzso motif zzso acid position zzso to zzso of zzso was found to be necessary for nuclear zzso interaction, but the second zzso motif zzso acid position zzso to zzso appeared unable to bind zzso zzso of the last 12 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the abolition of the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and this binding is increased in the presence of specific zzso zzso acts as a strong zzso for zzso in the zzso and also zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A truncated form of zzso zzso acids zzso acts as a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a genuine zzso
