We have studied a zzso upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso gene zzso which is important for zzso expression in the zzso central nervous system zzso This region contains two redundant elements which when simultaneously zzso result in lowered zzso expression in zzso zzso We uncovered a protein binding site within one of these elements and have cloned a factor which binds to the zzso This factor is the product of the zzso zzso a complex zzso finger protein previously identified by binding to an zzso regulatory zzso The in zzso profile of zzso in the zzso zzso shows intriguing overlap with zzso in specific zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso is related to a human zzso factor zzso The multiple zzso and zinc finger motifs in these two proteins show a similar linear arrangement which implies coordinate action among the zzso In addition, the zzso defines a new zzso zzso
