Chemical reverse transformation of zzso and other cells is a well-established phenomenon, in which zzso transformed cells zzso zzso zzso contact zzso and zzso growth, in response to zzso zzso and other zzso A limited number of changes in gene zzso and zzso activity have been demonstrated to coincide with these zzso and zzso zzso We have used a partial differential display to identify four genes that are zzso modulated in reverse zzso One of these, zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso zzso probably as a result of the zzso zzso Three others are zzso zzso One has zzso to zzso zzso chain 4 zzso and is also probably changed as a result of the zzso zzso Another is zzso to a human sequence which encodes a 27 zzso zzso zzso that is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and in cell lines of zzso origin binds to beta zzso This has not previously been described as zzso and could have a zzso role in reverse zzso The third has zzso with zzso or processing variations, to a human zzso zzso a zzso candidate for a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein which interacts with the zzso zzso zzso
