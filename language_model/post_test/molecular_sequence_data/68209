zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso was randomly incorporated into zzso precursor molecules by zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were trimmed at their zzso with zzso P zzso to yield mature zzso The zzso zzso derivatives were zzso and bound to the P site of zzso zzso from zzso coli in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso of the complexes at 300 zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso proteins and zzso within both the zzso and zzso zzso The labeled proteins were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were attached to zzso zzso or zzso within the D loop of zzso whereas zzso protein zzso was zzso to zzso zzso in the variable zzso Both of these sites occur in or near the central fold of the zzso These results permit us to map the D loop of P zzso zzso to the region between the central zzso and the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso while the variable loop can be placed above the zzso on the head of the zzso zzso
