The diversity of indigenous bacteria in sediments from several sites in the Elizabeth River zzso able to degrade multiple zzso aromatic zzso zzso was investigated by the use of classical selective enrichment and molecular zzso zzso cultures containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso as a sole carbon and energy source were monitored by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso to detect changes in the zzso profile during enrichment and to determine whether the representative strains present were successfully zzso The zzso profiles of the final zzso grown solely on zzso and zzso showed no clear relationship with the site from which the zzso was zzso The zzso grown solely on zzso for two sample sites had zzso zzso which suggests that common zzso strains may be present in these zzso The final zzso grown on zzso and zzso remained diverse by site, suggesting that these strains may be influenced by environmental zzso One hundred and one zzso were zzso zzso representatives of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso including seven novel zzso with zzso zzso gene sequences less than zzso similar to known zzso The ability to degrade multiple zzso was demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso and growth in pure zzso This supports our hypothesis that a high diversity of bacterial strains with the ability to degrade multiple zzso can be confirmed by the combined use of classical selective enrichment and molecular zzso This large collection of diverse zzso strains provides a valuable resource for studies on mechanisms of zzso degradation and zzso
