zzso zzso zzso processing zzso zzso zzso have been shown to have an zzso zzso that is caused by an increase in zzso zzso levels, leading to increased zzso zzso levels and a resulting late zzso zzso Here we describe the molecular zzso behind this zzso zzso zzso normally disappears rapidly as cells complete zzso but the level remains high in zzso zzso zzso This is in direct contrast to other zzso zzso and is the result of an increase in zzso zzso zzso We found that highly zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso in several places in an in zzso zzso In zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso products on the zzso zzso that closely matched in zzso zzso zzso of these products was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and not the zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso in its zzso to allow rapid zzso to 3' degradation by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso provides a novel way to regulate the cell cycle that zzso the protein degradation zzso In addition, these results zzso a new mechanism of zzso degradation not seen before in the zzso zzso zzso
