zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso and many other zzso and is a central zzso for cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso and can therefore, like all other zzso zzso not be directly expressed in zzso coli, since zzso proteins are zzso by a highly zzso translation zzso This machinery involves a secondary structure, zzso element, in the zzso zzso directing zzso zzso at the position of an zzso zzso zzso normally zzso termination of zzso It is zzso structural features and positions in the zzso zzso of the zzso elements that zzso have hampered zzso production of zzso zzso We have discovered, however, that rat zzso can be expressed in zzso coli by fusing its open reading frame with the zzso element of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso element designed to zzso the zzso zzso end of the zzso zzso and positioning parts of the zzso element in the zzso region was also zzso This finding revealed that the zzso element in bacteria does not need to be translated for full function and it enabled expression of zzso active zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was produced at dramatically higher levels than zzso zzso O, the only zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli under the conditions zzso demonstrating a surprisingly high reserve capacity of the bacterial zzso synthesis machinery under zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso further increased the efficiency of the zzso production and thereby also increased the specific activity of the zzso zzso to about 25 % of the native zzso with as much as 20 zzso produced per liter of zzso These results show that with the strategy zzso here, the capacity of zzso synthesis in zzso coli is more than sufficient for making possible the use of the bacteria for production of zzso zzso
