zzso of complement zzso is essential in the prevention of damage to zzso zzso This activity is zzso by the presence of specific complement regulatory proteins on the surface of host zzso In humans, one zzso involved in this regulation is a zzso zzso that has been designated zzso factor zzso We present the full-length zzso sequence and zzso zzso of the mouse genetic zzso of the human zzso zzso Interestingly, two classes of zzso clones were obtained that, rather than representing alternately spliced zzso were derived from two separate but closely related linked zzso Both genes zzso proteins with an zzso signal zzso followed by four short consensus repeats and a domain rich in zzso and zzso zzso plots and alignment with human zzso predicted that one gene zzso a zzso form of mouse zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity to human zzso The product zzso by the second gene was predicted to have an alternate zzso signal sequence and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two mouse zzso genes share zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso and have been designated zzso and zzso to reflect the two alternate mechanisms of membrane zzso zzso expression analysis indicated that the two mouse zzso genes were zzso expressed in the adult zzso zzso zzso studies mapped the mouse zzso genes to zzso 1, where they zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso
