A zzso soluble form of the low density zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from the culture medium of zzso cells and a number of other cell zzso It is produced from the zzso mature LDL zzso by a zzso zzso which is zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the release of a soluble zzso that constitutes the bulk of the zzso domain of the LDL zzso By labeling zzso cells with zzso and chasing in the presence of zzso we demonstrated that up to zzso of zzso were released into the medium in a zzso zzso zzso the level of labeled cellular receptors was reduced by zzso in those cells treated with zzso compared to zzso cells, as was the total number of cell surface zzso zzso by the binding of zzso zzso to whole zzso To determine if zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso were created by zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso cells, and zzso for zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso was significantly greater in the case of the zzso receptors than for zzso zzso both in the absence and presence of zzso Similar results were seen in human skin zzso zzso for each of the zzso LDL zzso zzso LDL zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating the resemblance of the LDL zzso zzso mechanism to that of other surface released membrane zzso
