zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of two identical zzso of 109 zzso zzso each of which contains four zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso acid zzso this zzso clearly belongs to the zzso zzso zzso and will be classified in class III of the zzso zzso as defined by zzso zzso in From zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Academic Press, zzso It contains ten zzso and nine zzso zzso in each zzso and eight zzso and eight zzso linked to the four zzso groups were found to be zzso on alignment of all known zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso bridges have been determined between zzso zzso 5 and 46 of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from D zzso is clearly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso from the same strain, with which it shows only zzso sequence zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Norway, the three-dimensional structure of which has been determined, zzso of the zzso have been zzso In the zzso from zzso zzso Norway, zzso interactions have been described across the zzso zzso zzso involved in similar interactions seem to be well zzso in the equivalent zzso zzso zzso This sequence provides structural data to allow zzso of this new zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso shown to contain two zzso bridges linking two identical zzso which could induce more rigid zzso The folding and the evolution of this family of zzso zzso are zzso
