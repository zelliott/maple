The zzso green zzso zzso zzso is an attractive model zzso for studying zzso responses and the zzso II zzso damage and repair process in the zzso zzso zzso during cell growth defines both the zzso and the zzso repair status of the zzso To identify genes specific to these zzso a zzso library was created from zzso zzso zzso From the zzso library, zzso randomly selected expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso Because zzso constitute the expressed part of the zzso the strategy of randomly sequencing zzso clones at their zzso allowed us to obtain information about the transcript level of numerous genes in zzso zzso zzso The results of a zzso search performed on the obtained total set of zzso showed that approximately zzso of the zzso could be assigned to genes coding for proteins that are known to be zzso in response to zzso zzso Specifically, after 48 h of zzso exposure of the cells, an increase in the expression level of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso was observed, as well as elevated levels of the zzso transcript, a zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso zzso gene was also zzso in zzso zzso cells after 48 h of exposure to high zzso The results provide initial insight into the global gene regulation process in response to zzso
