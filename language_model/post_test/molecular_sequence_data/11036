The zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of both small zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to exist in zzso The zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso by zzso is the zzso stable zzso zzso of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that individual variation in both zzso zzso activity and zzso stability in humans are zzso As a step toward understanding molecular mechanisms responsible for the genetic regulation of zzso in humans, we report here common zzso zzso zzso that are associated with zzso variation in both zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso When zzso human subjects were zzso for zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso stability, activity varied more than zzso and zzso stability varied over zzso DNA was isolated from the blood of 33 of these subjects selected on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso high activity and high zzso zzso low activity and low zzso zzso or low activity and high zzso zzso These 33 subjects were zzso for zzso by zzso amplification and sequencing of the entire open reading frame zzso as well as approximately 1 zzso of zzso DNA zzso One common zzso zzso was zzso associated with both very low zzso zzso activity and low zzso zzso The zzso frequency of zzso in a randomly selected population sample of 150 Caucasian blood donors was zzso zzso indicating that approximately zzso of this population would be zzso for that zzso
