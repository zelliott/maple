zzso zzso zzso gradually increase their rate of forage zzso as they gain zzso zzso This increase in zzso performance has been proposed to occur as a result of zzso however, factors affecting flight ability such as changes in zzso components of flight metabolism could also contribute to this zzso Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of zzso changes to the increase in zzso zzso zzso We investigated aspects of zzso flight muscle zzso throughout the adult life, from zzso hive zzso through young and mature zzso to old zzso near the end of their zzso zzso gel zzso analysis on zzso zzso muscle revealed an increase in several proteins from hive bees to mature zzso including zzso T zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the activities zzso of zzso involved in zzso performance, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso c zzso did not increase in the flight muscles of hive zzso young zzso mature zzso and old zzso However, zzso zzso activity was found to increase with zzso zzso zzso our results suggest plasticity in both structural and zzso components of flight muscles with zzso zzso
