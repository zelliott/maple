A zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso named zzso is shown to be a zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso The zzso element zzso at a site in the large zzso zzso gene which is midway between two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in most insect zzso Based on the structure of its open reading frame and the sequence of its reverse zzso domain, zzso elements do not appear to be a family of zzso or zzso elements that have changed their zzso zzso zzso is most similar in structure and in sequence to the element zzso which is not specialized for zzso into zzso zzso Thus zzso represents a separate zzso zzso element that has become specialized for zzso in the zzso genes of its zzso Using zzso zzso directed to a zzso region of the reverse zzso zzso domain, insertions in the zzso site were also amplified from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Why several zzso zzso elements have become specialized for zzso into a short zzso zzso region of the large zzso zzso gene is zzso
