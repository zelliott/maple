zzso body formation in zzso is a highly complex process that is under zzso control and is a fundamental part of the zzso sexual life zzso However, the molecular zzso regulating this cellular process are largely zzso Here we show that the sterile zzso zzso is defective in a zzso WW domain protein that plays a pivotal role in zzso body maturation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although WW zzso occur in many zzso zzso zzso of zzso are present only in zzso zzso zzso analysis with different zzso zzso zzso using zzso or truncated versions of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the C zzso of zzso is crucial for restoring the fertile zzso Using differential zzso and zzso protection zzso we determined that a zzso fusion protein is located within zzso Further microscopic investigations of fusion proteins with zzso or green fluorescent protein zzso showed a zzso of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso However, the integrity of zzso bodies is not affected in zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We discuss the function of zzso in zzso body zzso
