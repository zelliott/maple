The zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso genes play crucial roles in regulating the zzso to zzso phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso leaves, zzso and zzso In flowers, zzso was expressed more in young flower buds than in mature flowers and was predominantly expressed in zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was regulated by zzso with the highest expression from the 8th to 12th hour of the light period and the lowest expression at zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso was only detected in zzso bud and zzso and was not influenced by zzso zzso expression of zzso in transgenic zzso plants showed novel zzso by flowering early and losing zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso was able to partially complement the late flowering zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso In transgenic zzso zzso plants, zzso delayed flowering and rescued the zzso of terminal zzso Furthermore, substitution of the key single zzso acid zzso by zzso was able to convert the zzso function to zzso by promoting flowering in zzso transgenic zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that the expression of zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso and zzso plants, and was zzso in zzso transgenic zzso zzso Our data indicated that zzso and zzso are putative zzso protein genes in zzso that regulate flower transition similar to their zzso in zzso
