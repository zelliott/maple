The possible generation of zzso stress induced by aromatic hydrocarbon degradation suggests that ancillary zzso activities could facilitate the zzso of zzso aromatic zzso as sole carbon zzso To investigate the zzso profiles of low molecular weight zzso aromatic zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the determination of the activity of putative detoxifying zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was combined with genetic zzso All the studied strains were able to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity was found in zzso zzso strains grown on zzso and it was related to the presence of the zzso zzso since zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso paralleled the induction of zzso zzso transcript in the zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso activity was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso All strains showed zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso where increase of zzso zzso activity was significantly induced by growth on zzso
