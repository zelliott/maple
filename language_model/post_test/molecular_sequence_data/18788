A heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso soil and evaluated for use in zzso mine tailing soil and for plant biomass zzso zzso exhibited plant zzso traits, including zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso activity, zzso production, and P zzso zzso were more available in mine tailing soil zzso soil with zzso than in zzso zzso the order of zzso zzso was zzso zzso effectively removed zzso in the order of zzso from liquid media containing zzso zzso zzso mine tailing soil with the fungus significantly increased the dry biomass of zzso roots zzso and shoots zzso zzso total soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein contents increased by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared to plants grown in zzso zzso zzso increased heavy metal zzso in zzso roots by zzso zzso to zzso zzso and in shoots by zzso zzso to zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso would be beneficial for zzso and plant biomass production as a potential source of zzso in the quest for renewable zzso
