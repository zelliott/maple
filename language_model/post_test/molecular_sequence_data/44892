We have identified and characterized the zzso zzso required for assembly of zzso zzso A DNA zzso containing most of the head zzso genes was cloned and zzso The zzso of a previously identified gene zzso 6) and eight complete open reading frames (7 to zzso were zzso We have assigned genes 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 to these zzso by zzso genetic and zzso data with DNA and protein sequence zzso zzso was identified as a minor structural component of zzso and heads, zzso as the scaffold zzso zzso and zzso as head minor proteins and zzso as the coat zzso zzso of zzso in head zzso which accumulate during infection with zzso deficient in DNA packaging or in zzso zzso allowed the definition of the head assembly zzso No zzso processing of any of the head components was zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to the zzso of zzso structures and zzso particles which are similar to the zzso formed by zzso zzso in the absence of other zzso zzso The native molecular masses of zzso and zzso are about 350 zzso and larger than zzso zzso respectively zzso molecular masses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso and zzso assembles from zzso into some zzso zzso The organization of the DNA packaging and head genes of zzso resembles the organization of genes in the analogous regions of zzso zzso and zzso
