To investigate the role of zzso zzso protein of Mr 37 zzso zzso a zzso inflammatory zzso on zzso cell zzso 

zzso cells used in this study were obtained from human lung zzso and rat zzso The latter was a kind gift of zzso Paula zzso The zzso 6 cell line used in this study was the generous gift of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell proteins zzso C activity was determined by measuring zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell migration was determined using zzso zzso zzso Cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined using flow zzso zzso was used to amplify the zzso from zzso cells treated with zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso which was originally identified as having potent zzso activity and zzso activity for zzso was capable of modulating zzso cell zzso zzso activated zzso cell protein zzso C in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the adhesive properties of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso the well known zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso promoted zzso cell zzso Further investigations indicated that zzso was induced in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso and zzso alpha as well as inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso cells did not zzso express zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso was determined and found to be highly zzso to the sequence obtained for zzso zzso 

Our studies strongly suggest that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso interactions and the zzso of zzso from the zzso into zzso zzso
