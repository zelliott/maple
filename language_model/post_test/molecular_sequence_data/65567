Brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are well established in the clinic as zzso of heart zzso zzso hormone and the inactive zzso are predominantly zzso in the zzso of the heart in response to pressure overload and, consequently, are being investigated as markers of drug-induced cardiac zzso in rat to support drug zzso In the work presented here, an zzso zzso zzso was developed and validated to measure a selective zzso zzso of zzso in rat zzso The zzso covers the range of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso intact zzso A stable zzso version of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso was prepared by zzso zzso synthesis and was used as an internal standard to minimize zzso zzso Due to zzso zzso present in rat serum, human serum was used as the control zzso and zzso between rat and human serum was established by standard zzso zzso accuracy zzso zzso and precision zzso zzso were measured at three zzso on each of 4 days and did not exceed zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, study data are presented from the application of this zzso in which rats demonstrated a significant increase in zzso serum concentration following administration of an agent known to induce cardiac zzso In this study, the relationship between serum zzso and cardiac zzso was zzso by increases in heart weight and magnetic resonance imaging of the test subjects' left zzso To our knowledge, this represents the first reported zzso for zzso in zzso species for the assessment of cardiac zzso
