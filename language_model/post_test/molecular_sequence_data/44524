The zzso of patients with zzso a group of zzso blistering skin diseases, contain zzso directed against components of adhering junctions termed zzso zzso a human zzso zzso derived from a zzso patient, recognizes an unknown zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The third zzso region of the zzso heavy chain zzso was shown to share a zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso 2 which interact with components of, respectively, the zzso and zzso zzso Computer modeling of zzso showed that the zzso sequence zzso inside the zzso site and thus might be involved in zzso zzso The zzso sequence is essential to zzso function, since a zzso containing the zzso inhibited its binding to target zzso while zzso peptides with specific modifications of the zzso sequence did zzso These data allow us to zzso that certain zzso produced during the course of an zzso disease can behave as zzso zzso through the molecular mimicry of the motif involved in zzso zzso and to propose a new zzso binding mechanism for some zzso
