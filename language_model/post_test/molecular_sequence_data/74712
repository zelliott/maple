Seven strains of a novel zzso species were isolated from seven water samples collected from a zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso domain of the large zzso zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the sequences of five strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identical and differed from the other two strains zzso and zzso by only one zzso substitution in 544 zzso zzso The closest species in terms of zzso sequences similarity was zzso zzso but the level of zzso substitution (six to seven zzso zzso in 544 zzso was sufficient to justify the description of a separate zzso The zzso tree based on the sequence of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso gene rather suggested that the new species is a sister species of zzso zzso and forms a zzso with the other six recognized species of zzso zzso analysis of the internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso region supported their distinct status as a zzso The zzso characteristics of the seven strains were typical of the zzso zzso On this basis, the seven strains were assigned to a single novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
