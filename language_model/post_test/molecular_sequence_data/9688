zzso factor zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso recognizes regulatory regions of several zzso zzso mice deficient for this protein display only mild zzso but have abnormal zzso and lack circulating zzso A number of zzso marker genes have been extensively zzso but none of them is regulated by zzso To find target genes for zzso zzso in zzso we used an in zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments bound to zzso zzso in the zzso of a zzso cell line were zzso with an zzso zzso and zzso One of these fragments belongs to the second zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso which is mainly expressed in zzso is indeed directly regulated by zzso zzso First, its promoter contains a functional zzso binding zzso second, the zzso zzso binding site is located within a zzso zzso zzso third, zzso zzso zzso do not express zzso zzso zzso although zzso expression can be detected in other zzso These data, and the structure of the zzso promoter and zzso suggest that zzso belongs to a distinct zzso of genes involved in zzso formation and zzso
