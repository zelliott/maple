zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, a zzso element zzso was identified within the second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding protein zzso region within the zzso was responsive to zzso whereas the 3' zzso region alone was zzso This report describes the minimal promoter region of the zzso gene and investigates the zzso elements and zzso factors responsible for zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso factors enhanced the zzso activity of the zzso gene through the zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to the newly identified zzso zzso zzso site, distinct from the previously described zzso site, within the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity of the zzso gene through the newly identified zzso zzso These results show that a zzso zzso zzso is mainly involved in the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso zzso gene zzso
