zzso II zzso zzso zzso termination depends on two independent genetic zzso zzso signals and downstream zzso zzso The latter may either promote zzso zzso zzso or pause zzso Pol zzso We demonstrate that the previously characterized zzso pause element promotes Pol II termination downstream of a zzso zzso dependent on both the proximity of the pause site and zzso signal and the strength of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso termination by degrading the 3' product of zzso site zzso The human zzso gene also possesses zzso site zzso pause zzso which like zzso are G rich and promote zzso zzso zzso depletion causes an increase in both zzso zzso and Pol II levels downstream of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we provide new insights into the mechanism of pause zzso termination and establish a general role for the zzso zzso zzso in Pol II zzso
