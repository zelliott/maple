zzso or zzso sequence zzso are DNA sequences read from both ends of expressed gene zzso The zzso zzso Project and several other public zzso projects are being performed to rapidly discover the complement of human zzso and make them easily zzso These zzso are widely used to discover novel members of gene families, to map genes to zzso as zzso zzso zzso and to identify zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso strategies for zzso the zzso databases are discussed, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the zzso zzso There is a compelling need to build on the zzso synthesis of human gene data, and to devise facile methods for determining gene zzso
