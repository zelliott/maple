A recent molecular zzso for major lineages of the zzso indicated that zzso and possibly zzso originated in the zzso while the remaining families originated in the zzso This zzso was based on zzso evolution in genetic and zzso partitions of zzso zzso and zzso b DNA zzso and assumed that zzso diversification of zzso around 90 million years ago and zzso whenever appropriate, minimum age constraints based on the fossil zzso This approach is not ideal, as it did not account for uncertainty in zzso branch lengths and time, including the zzso time, and zzso in the rate of DNA substitution among sites and in different zzso zzso all the information available in the DNA sequences was not included, and may have been affected by zzso error in individual gene zzso Here, we present a follow-up analysis by zzso divergence times using a zzso framework that accounts for these possible sources of zzso Our results based on combined and separate analyses of zzso DNA sequences comprised of zzso sites of zzso zzso zzso and zzso b indicated that zzso zzso and zzso and likely zzso originated in the zzso zzso estimates based on zzso genes are less affected by zzso error among sites and less influenced by the zzso signals of individual gene zzso which are zzso distributed along the zzso zzso and zzso the use of only an external molecular zzso results in lower zzso of most zzso zzso zzso We also point out that zzso fossils may not be as useful for point zzso as was previously suggested, but instead may be better employed as zzso for the zzso of zzso ages under a zzso zzso
