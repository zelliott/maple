zzso is a zzso expressed protein originally identified by its ability to bind and repress the zzso zzso zzso It contains five zzso zinc fingers and a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso found in a growing number of zinc finger zzso can inhibit DNA binding and mediate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso In the current study, a zzso amplification and selection of targets zzso protocol detected preferred zzso binding sites which are highly zzso zzso to these sites by zzso depended upon the zinc fingers and was enhanced when the zzso domain was zzso Using transient zzso zzso zzso was shown to activate the zzso zzso and repress the zzso zzso The zzso domain was shown to mediate zzso zzso zzso and zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso can both activate and repress in the context of different natural promoters and that its zzso domain can affect two zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso
