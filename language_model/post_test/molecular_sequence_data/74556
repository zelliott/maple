An experimental zzso was constructed using zzso zzso and a propagation zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso based on zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, zzso Badgett, zzso zzso zzso zzso Experimental zzso generation of a known zzso Science zzso zzso The zzso presented in this study has a considerable variation in branch lengths and is less zzso than the one presented by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, zzso Badgett, zzso zzso zzso zzso Experimental zzso generation of a known zzso Science zzso zzso These features are known to present additional difficulties to zzso zzso zzso The performance of several zzso methods zzso and less zzso was tested using restriction site and zzso zzso Only methods that zzso a molecular clock or those based on sequence signatures recovered the true zzso zzso a likelihood ratio test rejected the hypothesis of the existence of a molecular clock when the whole sequence data set was zzso This fact or the particular substitution pattern zzso zzso and zzso may be related to the unexpected performance of distance methods based on sequence zzso To test if the results could have been predicted by simulation studies we estimated the evolution parameters from the real zzso and used them to simulate evolution along the same tree zzso zzso We found that simulation could predict most but not all of the problems encountered by zzso zzso methods in the real zzso Short interior branches may be more prone to error than predicted by theoretical zzso
