The crystal structure of zzso C from turkey skeletal muscle has been refined at zzso A resolution (1 A zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso R factor (R zzso zzso where zzso and zzso are the observed and calculated structure factor zzso is zzso for the zzso reflections with zzso I greater than or equal to 2 zzso within the 10 A to zzso A resolution zzso With zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso C provides a good sample for zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso angles zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso agree with values observed for zzso regions in other zzso The zzso are all curved and/or zzso In particular, the 31 zzso acid long zzso zzso is smoothly zzso with a rather large radius of zzso of 137 zzso zzso packing is different in the zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain zzso The zzso angles for the two zzso motifs in the regulatory domain are 133 degrees and 151 degrees, whereas the value for the two motifs in the zzso domain is 110 degrees, as observed in the zzso of zzso These differences affect the packing of the respective zzso zzso of each domain, in particular the disposition of aromatic zzso zzso arrangement of zzso zzso is common to both states, but the zzso is markedly zzso zzso of one to the other can be achieved by small cumulative changes of zzso zzso zzso The integrity of loop structure is maintained by numerous zzso zzso Both salt bridges and zzso interactions are observed in zzso There are more zzso zzso than zzso zzso salt zzso zzso interactions occur because the pH of the zzso is zzso and there is a multitude of zzso and zzso zzso One is zzso and four are zzso Polar zzso interactions occur more commonly with zzso zzso and zzso than with other polar zzso These interactions are mostly short range, and are similar to those observed in other proteins with one zzso zzso charged zzso interact more frequently with zzso zzso oxygen zzso However, out of 19 such zzso 10 involve oxygen atoms of the zzso zzso These zzso interactions are compensated by the favorable interactions with the zzso zzso and with zzso zzso They are a trivial consequence of the tight fold of the zzso zzso
