We have constructed defined deletions in the zzso gene from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a significant reduction in zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso caused no or only partial reduction in the zzso of zzso as an iron zzso We also show that expression from the zzso zzso zzso promoter exhibits minimal regulation by iron and zzso whereas zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter shows both significant iron repression and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso in zzso function and expression exists among zzso zzso
