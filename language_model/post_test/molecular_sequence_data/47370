zzso analysis using zzso host systems localized putative zzso zzso zzso zzso transport genes and zzso sequences to a zzso genetic region downstream from the zzso regulator zzso zzso sequencing identified a zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso predicted to zzso a zzso with high zzso acid sequence similarity with known bacterial zzso zzso zzso In zzso coli, the zzso genes of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed the production of a zzso zzso zzso the predicted size of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to zzso zzso zzso and in zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso was restored to this zzso by zzso the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso was defective in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and no longer produced a zzso zzso outer membrane zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso gene in trans regained zzso zzso zzso transport and zzso functions and produced the zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso zzso fusion confirmed that zzso is subject to iron regulation at the zzso level and that zzso zzso control elements zzso zzso iron zzso reside within the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso fusion gene under iron zzso conditions was shown to be zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso outer membrane zzso protein required for transport and zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes by zzso zzso
