Purple zzso bacteria are capable of generating cellular energy from several sources, including photosynthesis, zzso and zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, cellular energy can be used to zzso carbon and zzso This study provides the first evidence of a molecular link for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso regulatory system in zzso zzso zzso analyses and in zzso zzso studies showed that zzso indirectly activates zzso synthesis by binding to and zzso the expression of zzso which encodes one of the two functional copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso is reduced in the zzso zzso up to zzso under zzso conditions and is also reduced under zzso zzso Thus, although zzso is absolutely required for zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso of zzso We also demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso synthesis and activity are increased up to zzso zzso binds to the promoter of the zzso gene zzso and therefore directly zzso its zzso Thus, the zzso system controls such diverse processes as zzso photosynthesis and zzso zzso as well as the zzso processes of zzso fixation and zzso zzso
