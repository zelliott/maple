The presence of a zzso element within a region of the human zzso zzso zzso promoter located at zzso to zzso base pairs zzso to the start site of zzso suggested that the zzso protein complex may play a role in the regulation of zzso expression during zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso interference analysis showed that the zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso contained proteins that bound to this region of the zzso gene in a manner that correlated with zzso zzso zzso Also, use of zzso against zzso and Max and zzso zzso zzso and Max protein in the zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed that these proteins can specifically bind this portion of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that increase in the level of zzso and/or Max led to a significant enhancement of expression of a human zzso zzso reporter zzso Moreover, treatment of actively growing zzso cells with an zzso zzso to zzso reduced the amount of zzso protein complex formed and the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies show that the zzso protein complex plays a role in the zzso regulation of human zzso in zzso
