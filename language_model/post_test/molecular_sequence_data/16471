zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso factor that zzso the hypoxic response in many zzso The cellular abundance and activity of zzso are regulated by its zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which are zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which blocks the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso preventing zzso of zzso genes under zzso zzso In the present paper, we report studies on possible mechanisms for the regulation of zzso zzso Recently solved crystal structures of zzso indicate that it is zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso designed to disrupt zzso were generated in order to examine the importance of the zzso state in determining zzso zzso A single point zzso zzso zzso was shown to be predominantly zzso and to have lost zzso activity as measured by zzso monitoring zzso turnover and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was predominantly zzso and zzso zzso The results imply that the zzso form of zzso is required for productive zzso zzso The structural data also revealed a zzso interaction formed between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso which is close to the zzso zzso A recent report has revealed that zzso of zzso which is adjacent to zzso enhances the zzso response in zzso zzso with this, we show that zzso of zzso prevents the zzso of zzso by zzso
