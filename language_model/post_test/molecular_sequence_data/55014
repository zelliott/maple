zzso novel methods for zzso switching of zzso structures expands the design principles of functional zzso and zzso Here, a simple method for zzso synthesis of zzso zzso peptides was zzso Whereas addition of zzso metal zzso such as zzso and zzso to a zzso bearing a pair of zzso zzso at the i and i + 4 positions led to the formation of a zzso complex of zzso with metals, addition of zzso yielded a zzso structure of zzso zzso This feature was zzso for the selective detection of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso switching of the zzso structure was also achieved by multiple additions of zzso metal zzso to the zzso
