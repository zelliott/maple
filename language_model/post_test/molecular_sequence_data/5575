The process of zzso zzso zzso involves interaction between zzso viral proteins and zzso zzso zzso The zzso signal on human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso is a zzso structure composed of functional zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso precursor contains two copies of a zzso box motif that have been demonstrated to be important in zzso zzso To further characterize the role of the zzso boxes of the zzso NC protein in zzso zzso the relative efficiency of zzso zzso for virus particles that contained zzso within the zzso boxes was zzso zzso that disrupted the first zzso box of the NC protein resulted in virus particles that zzso zzso zzso less efficiently and zzso zzso more efficiently than did zzso zzso zzso within the second zzso box did not significantly affect zzso zzso In addition, a full complement of zzso NC protein in virus particles is not required for efficient zzso zzso or virus zzso Finally, both zzso boxes of the NC protein play additional roles in virus zzso
