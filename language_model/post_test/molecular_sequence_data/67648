The global outbreak of novel zzso spread in human population worldwide has revealed an emergency need for producing a vaccine against this zzso Current influenza vaccines encounter problems with safety issues and weak response in high-risk zzso It has been established that zzso is the most important viral zzso to which zzso responses are directed, and zzso zzso vaccines, zzso of influenza A and B zzso have been considered in order to facilitate vaccine zzso In the present study, we have focused on construction of a zzso zzso zzso the large zzso of novel influenza virus zzso zzso The full zzso of zzso was cloned into zzso zzso and zzso The large zzso of the zzso gene was amplified by zzso using specific zzso and cloned into zzso zzso donor zzso which was then confirmed by restriction zzso analysis and sequencing and transformed into zzso coli zzso competent zzso The zzso DNA was zzso into insect cells to produce zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in insect cells was determined by zzso and zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso insect cell expression system has suitable zzso in human and can be considered as a candidate flu zzso zzso Here we produced large amounts of the zzso protein of novel influenza zzso zzso zzso in insect zzso The zzso and efficacy of the zzso zzso will be evaluated as a vaccine candidate and compared to the zzso zzso produced in a zzso zzso
