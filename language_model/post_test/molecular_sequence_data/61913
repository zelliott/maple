How zzso shape the immune response to viral infection of the central nervous system zzso has largely been considered within the context of recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso are expressed early following viral infection, suggesting an important role in zzso innate immune zzso zzso we evaluated the contributions of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso in promoting innate defense mechanisms following coronavirus infection of the zzso zzso infection of zzso mice with a zzso zzso zzso coronavirus zzso zzso zzso resulted in protection from disease and increased survival that correlated with a significant increase in recruitment and zzso of natural killer zzso cells within the zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in a reduction in viral zzso that was dependent on gamma zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso expression plays a pivotal role in defense following coronavirus infection of the zzso by enhancing innate immune zzso
