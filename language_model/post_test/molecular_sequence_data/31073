Major zzso complex zzso zzso play an important role in the development of an effective immune zzso An important zzso function is the ability to bind and present zzso zzso zzso to T zzso We show here that the zzso human class II zzso zzso zzso binds peptides that have been shown to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso and a zzso form of the protein lacking the zzso and zzso regions have similar zzso binding zzso A total of 39 single zzso were made throughout an zzso restricted zzso zzso and the results determine one zzso acid in this zzso which is crucial to zzso Based on this analysis, a synthetic zzso was designed containing two zzso from the original zzso zzso embedded in a chain of zzso This zzso binds to zzso indicating that the majority of zzso side chains are not required for high affinity zzso zzso
