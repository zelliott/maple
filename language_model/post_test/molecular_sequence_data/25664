zzso zzso of human zzso III have been implicated to involve in the zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso Borders, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have performed chemical modification of zzso with zzso zzso in order to determine the locations of these zzso zzso zzso was modified with 12 zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso by weight to zzso In the absence of zzso about zzso zzso of zzso of zzso were modified within 60 zzso and the modification led to the loss of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity as well as zzso zzso enhancement and 50% of its progressive zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the extent of modification was diminished by zzso and modified zzso retained approximately zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and subsequent sequence analysis revealed that selective zzso modification occurred at zzso and zzso and that their modifications were protected upon binding of zzso to zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso are situated within the zzso binding site of human zzso zzso
