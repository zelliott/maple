The zzso of the temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso site and the zzso site of the host during zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also functions in a wide variety of zzso bacteria and in zzso zzso In this report, in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso were developed and the zzso was zzso in order to study in greater detail the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso extract of zzso coli at 42 degrees C, the zzso zzso promotes efficient in zzso zzso between a zzso zzso zzso and a linear zzso zzso The zzso which was zzso to apparent zzso showed no absolute requirement for accessory factors, unlike the majority of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso derivatives of the zzso site were constructed and tested for zzso with the zzso site in zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing five scattered putative zzso zzso sites was sufficient for function of the zzso zzso In contrast to the right arm of zzso most of the left arm could be deleted without drastically reducing the zzso zzso In zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso in trains between zzso and zzso sites present on two separate zzso This property was used to confirm in zzso the results of the deletion analysis of the zzso site performed in zzso
