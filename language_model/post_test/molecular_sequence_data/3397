Plant zzso are organized into specific cell zzso zzso that have been implicated in diverse cellular zzso including cell division and organized cell zzso zzso in four zzso genes collectively called the zzso group result in lethal zzso that consist of one or a few zzso enlarged zzso The zzso zzso lack zzso but not zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso is not localized properly, trafficking of the putative zzso zzso carrier zzso to the plasma membrane is zzso The four zzso group genes were isolated by zzso cloning and are shown to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso C, D, and zzso and associated small zzso zzso that mediate the formation of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso C zzso zzso was detected in zzso protein complexes and did not zzso with zzso Another gene with a zzso although weaker, zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso a zzso A zzso Our genetic zzso of zzso shows their requirement in cell division and zzso trafficking during zzso whereas cell growth is zzso by zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma membrane during zzso
