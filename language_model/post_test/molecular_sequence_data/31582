zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of zzso are associated with human deafness zzso In zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso forms dense zzso zzso resembling the inner ear hair cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4 and 5 leads to hearing loss in mice due to the absence of zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso bundle formation by zzso is not fully zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso 4 and 5 contain two repeated zzso referred to here as zzso and zzso To examine the potential role of zzso and zzso motifs in zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso proteins deleted for zzso and/or zzso and then assessed their zzso activity and bundle formation in zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso and electron zzso Cellular zzso of the zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso We showed that deletion of both zzso and zzso motifs completely disrupted the zzso zzso activities of zzso and impaired its zzso to cellular zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso lacking only zzso zzso retained its zzso bundling ability and remained localized to zzso filaments in cells, similar to full length zzso On the contrary, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which mainly consists of the zzso zzso formed thin zzso zzso in zzso but failed to zzso to zzso filaments in zzso These results indicate that zzso motif is the major zzso domain of zzso and the binding of zzso motif with zzso filaments is zzso
