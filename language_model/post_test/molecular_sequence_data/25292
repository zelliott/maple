zzso and zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, according to Human Gene zzso zzso were isolated from human zzso and zzso zzso using two rat cardiac zzso zzso type; and zzso zzso type as zzso and zzso The zzso type cardiac zzso DNA clone and the zzso type cardiac zzso clone were used as zzso in the Southern analysis of human zzso DNA from zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso The results showed that the human cardiac zzso gene is assigned to zzso 14 and the human cardiac and skeletal zzso genes do not zzso as do the mouse cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso For further analysis, a regional mapping method was zzso DNA from 4 human deletion and 3 human zzso cell line were prepared for southern zzso zzso with human cardiac zzso and zzso DNA zzso and the zzso intensity relative to 46, zzso or 46, zzso DNA was zzso The results showed that two human cardiac zzso genes zzso with the zzso region of the long arm of human zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso human cardiac zzso probe to normal human zzso zzso independently confirmed this zzso
