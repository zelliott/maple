Alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha zzso and a risk for the development of zzso and liver zzso However, whereas there is an increased risk for zzso associated with at least 10 alpha zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso disease is observed only in a subset of these zzso suggesting that it is not the reduced serum levels of alpha zzso per zzso which cause the liver zzso The present study characterizes the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that like the common Z zzso zzso zzso is associated with both alpha zzso zzso and zzso zzso Capitalizing on the identification of the zzso inheritance of the rare zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso it was demonstrated that although caused by a very different zzso the zzso zzso shares with the Z zzso the association of liver disease with the same type of abnormalities of alpha zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso gene and sequence analysis demonstrated that it differs from the normal alpha zzso zzso zzso by deletion of the entire zzso zzso for zzso zzso Liver biopsy of the zzso zzso revealed zzso mild fibrosis, and zzso zzso of alpha zzso zzso of de zzso alpha zzso zzso in alpha zzso cells of this individual demonstrated normal levels of alpha zzso zzso transcripts but abnormal zzso zzso of newly zzso alpha zzso at the level of the rough zzso zzso with zzso reduced alpha zzso zzso Finally, zzso gene transfer of a normal alpha zzso zzso and an alpha zzso zzso with the zzso zzso deletion into zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso cells reproduced the abnormal zzso of newly zzso alpha zzso thus directly demonstrating that the deletion zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of the newly zzso alpha zzso Thus, not only is the liver disease associated with alpha zzso zzso restricted to a subset of alpha zzso zzso zzso it appears to be restricted to those zzso associated with zzso zzso of newly zzso alpha zzso suggesting that it is the abnormal zzso alpha zzso zzso which zzso the liver zzso
