To zzso the role of the zzso zzso in the zzso resistance of zzso zzso 

The presence of the zzso zzso was verified by zzso The zzso relationship between the outer membrane proteins known to be involved in functional zzso zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The contribution of zzso to resistance to a variety of compounds was investigated by zzso testing of the zzso zzso The role of zzso in the expression and function of zzso was assessed by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes formed an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso coli formed a distinguishing zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to several zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso and chemical compounds zzso zzso cyanide zzso crystal violet, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso deletion of zzso caused a polar effect on the expression of zzso which compromised the resistance to zzso and zzso Nevertheless, the presence of the zzso protein made an insignificant contribution to the function of zzso in the resistance to zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso makes a significant contribution to the zzso resistance of zzso zzso
