The zzso zzso zzso is one of the most zzso zzso found in bacteria and has three known different natural zzso The zzso zzso zzso SAM zzso zzso is organized around a zzso junction which is characterized by the presence of a zzso and a zzso zzso By replacing the zzso involved in a zzso base pair at position 138 in the core region of the zzso with the fluorescent analogue zzso zzso we show that the zzso reorganization of the zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso process is specific to SAM on the basis of the observation that the structural analogue zzso does not promote a similar zzso We find that the zzso is important for the reorganization of the core domain and that the zzso motif also has a marked influence on the core domain zzso most probably through its important role in zzso zzso Finally, we show that SAM zzso zzso binding is facilitated by the zzso zzso binding zzso which suggests that zzso motifs may be protein anchor sites used by zzso to promote zzso zzso
