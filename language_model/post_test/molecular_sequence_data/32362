A novel and unusual strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso during the zzso survey of zzso zzso infection in Chiang Mai province, Thailand from June 2000 to July zzso zzso characterization of gene zzso by sequence analysis showed a low level of zzso acid sequence identity, ranging from zzso to zzso while comparison of zzso portion showed zzso to zzso identity, with the 26 P zzso recognized to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence revealed that zzso was only zzso related to the other 26 P zzso and was located in a separate zzso zzso analysis of gene zzso showed the highest level of zzso acid identity zzso with the zzso zzso reference strain zzso but a lower level of identity with those of human zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso analysis of gene zzso revealed two major lineages among zzso zzso strains based on the host zzso zzso strain zzso clustered exclusively with zzso zzso strain zzso in a novel lineage that is distinct from the major zzso human zzso Moreover, strain zzso displayed a zzso zzso and zzso with zzso I zzso while bearing an zzso with some genetic group B zzso zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso should be considered as a novel zzso zzso zzso
