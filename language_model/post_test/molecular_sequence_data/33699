zzso root hair formation is determined by the patterning genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but little is known about the later changes in cell wall material during root hair zzso A combined zzso infrared zzso components analysis zzso method was used to detect subtle differences in the cell wall material between zzso and root hair zzso in zzso Among several root hair zzso only the zzso zzso affected root cell wall zzso Five of the 10 genes zzso cellulose zzso zzso and 4 of 33 zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso are expressed in the zzso but only zzso and zzso were affected by the zzso zzso The zzso sequence located in the promoter region of these genes was recognized by the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso directly regulates cell zzso gene expression during root zzso
