The regulation of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso translation occurs via zzso zzso migration zzso zzso and is zzso by an zzso hairpin structure in the zzso The replacement of the viral leader by a series of short, low-energy stems in either orientation supports efficient zzso zzso showing that the stem per se, and not its zzso is recognized by the translation zzso The requirement for zzso sequences from the zzso terminal regions of the viral leader was zzso the zzso zzso stretch and the short upstream open reading frame zzso A stimulate translation, whereas the zzso region seems not to be zzso Based on these results, an artificial leader was designed with a stable stem flanked by zzso sequences derived from parts of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This artificial leader is zzso in translation zzso in zzso and in zzso indicating that a low-energy zzso broadly used as a device to successfully interfere with zzso zzso can efficiently support translation, if preceded by a short zzso The synthetic zzso leader can functionally replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso leader, thus implicating the universal role that zzso zzso scanning could play in translation initiation in zzso
