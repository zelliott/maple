We have cloned zzso of the zzso zzso controlled tumor protein zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in a zzso promoter zzso as zzso zzso fusion zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have a molecular mass of approximately 28 zzso with the zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that there is a zzso similarity between the two zzso zzso at zzso acid levels and are zzso zzso Analysis of soluble proteins from various zzso stages of zzso zzso suggested that the expression of zzso might be zzso regulated and occurs in zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to form zzso in solution under zzso zzso The tendency for zzso zzso to become zzso was predicted by the presence of the zzso coiled zzso structure in their zzso Despite the absence of a signal zzso zzso is present abundantly in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies showed that both zzso and zzso are zzso proteins and have zzso function in zzso When injected zzso both the zzso zzso induced inflammatory zzso of zzso into the zzso cavity of mice suggesting that the zzso zzso may have a role in the allergic inflammatory responses associated with zzso zzso
