Recently we reported zzso zzso Evans, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sharma, 1991, zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso the zzso zzso and characterization of zzso zzso proteins with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso as examples, we describe here the use of genetically engineered alternating zzso in the zzso of these zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso In these zzso an alternate zzso zzso was fused to the zzso of zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were retarded on immobilized zzso very strongly and could be completely zzso only by the use of 100 zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso proteins were zzso between 10 and 35 zzso zzso When the DNA coding for the zzso was removed, the resulting zzso were recovered from the zzso column at 35 zzso zzso The strong and specific interaction between the zzso protein and the immobilized metal zzso was also abolished when the zzso was specifically zzso by human zzso It is concluded from these studies that tailoring zzso proteins with three or more alternate zzso should result in the isolation of such zzso proteins from crude zzso in a single zzso Since zzso is zzso to scale up, the tailored specificity engineered into the protein of interest via an zzso should allow one to achieve large-scale isolation of zzso proteins from bacterial and zzso hosts in a highly predictable zzso
