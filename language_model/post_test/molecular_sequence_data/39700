Changes in community structure and activity of the zzso zzso community were investigated across a zzso zzso in the Central zzso to gain insight into the zzso pattern of this functional group and the driving environmental zzso Bulk soil and zzso soil of zzso zzso was sampled in five replicates in August during the flowering stage and in September after the first zzso along a zzso from 25 to 129 years after zzso and at a reference site outside the zzso zzso zzso years zzso In a zzso zzso nitrate zzso activity was determined zzso after 24 h of zzso zzso In selected zzso soil samples, the community structure of zzso zzso was zzso by restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso for the zzso gene zzso the active site of the zzso nitrate zzso zzso libraries of the early zzso zzso and late zzso zzso succession were constructed and representative clones zzso The activity of the zzso community increased significantly with age mainly due to higher carbon and nitrate availability in the late zzso The community structure, however, only showed a small shift over the 100 years of soil formation with pH explaining a major part zzso of the observed zzso zzso library analysis of the early and late succession pointed to a trend of declining diversity with progressing zzso Presumably, the pressure of competition on the nitrate zzso was relatively low in the early zzso stage due to minor zzso of zzso compared with the late zzso zzso a higher diversity could persist in this sparse zzso These results suggest that the nitrate zzso activity is regulated by environmental factors other than those shaping the genetic structure of the zzso zzso
