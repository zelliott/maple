Short hairpin zzso zzso zzso within an expression zzso has proven an effective means of harnessing the zzso interference zzso zzso in zzso zzso A survey of the literature revealed that zzso zzso construction can be hindered by high zzso rates and the ensuing sequencing is often zzso Current options for constructing zzso zzso include the use of zzso complementary zzso zzso % of surveyed zzso a zzso approach using hairpin containing zzso zzso zzso and primer extension of hairpin templates (4 zzso 

We considered primer extension the most attractive method in terms of zzso However, in initial experiments we encountered a zzso frequency of 50 % compared to a reported zzso % for other zzso By zzso the technique to be an zzso reaction using the DNA zzso zzso we reduced the error rate to 10 zzso making primer extension the most efficient and cost-effective approach zzso We also found that inclusion of a restriction site in the loop could be exploited for confirming construct integrity by automated sequencing, while maintaining intended gene zzso 

In this study we detail simple improvements for constructing and sequencing zzso that overcome current zzso We also compare the advantages of our solutions against proposed zzso Our technical modifications will be of tangible benefit to researchers looking for a more efficient and reliable zzso construction zzso
