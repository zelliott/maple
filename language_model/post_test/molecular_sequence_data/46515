The evolutionary potential of plant species that reproduce via predominantly zzso means and the conditions under which zzso is zzso are not well zzso zzso zzso reproduction is expected to result in a number of readily zzso genetic signals not present in populations that reproduce by sexual zzso We use a zzso sampling strategy to assess zzso probabilities and confirm that two rare sister zzso of zzso zzso have contrasting modes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reproduces zzso zzso had low levels of zzso diversity and were comprised of large zzso patches consisting of many zzso that covered hundreds of square zzso and showed little zzso The zzso was genetically zzso zzso Na zzso zzso mean P zzso zzso mean He zzso zzso had high levels of genetic differentiation between populations zzso zzso zzso and populations exhibited excess zzso and linkage zzso zzso among zzso suggesting historically high levels of zzso In contrast, the sister zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which occurs in an area with more than twice the annual zzso and less extreme minimum and maximum temperatures, showed no evidence of zzso high levels of zzso diversity, greater genetic diversity zzso Na zzso zzso mean P zzso zzso mean He zzso zzso lower levels of genetic differentiation between populations zzso zzso zzso and no evidence of excess zzso or zzso among zzso We suggest that the development of zzso in zzso zzso is associated with its more marginal environment and enhanced by response to zzso zzso
