The zzso A zzso database lists more than 160 zzso zzso each represents a molecular zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso bleeding disorder zzso A with a clinical presentation varying from mild to zzso Without a three-dimensional zzso structure it is in most cases impossible to explain biological dysfunction in terms of the underlying molecular zzso However, recently the crystal structure of the zzso human plasma zzso protein zzso zzso has been zzso and the A zzso of zzso share approximately zzso sequence identity with zzso This advance has enabled the building of a molecular model of the A zzso of zzso based on the sequence identity between the two zzso The model allows exploration of predictions regarding the general features of the zzso zzso such as the zzso for factor zzso and activated protein zzso it has also allowed the mapping of more than 30 selected zzso with known zzso from the database, and the prediction of hypothetical links to dysfunction in all but a few zzso A computer-generated molecular model such as that reported here cannot substitute for a crystal zzso However, until such a structure for zzso becomes available, the model represents a significant advance in modeling zzso it should prove a useful tool for exploiting the increasing amount of information in the zzso A zzso database, and for selecting appropriate targets for investigation of the zzso relationships via zzso and expression in zzso
