zzso zzso zzso is a genetically zzso birth zzso characterized by zzso of the anterior segment of the eye associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene has been identified as a cause of zzso We report a novel zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which is associated with brain zzso One patient had a small zzso zzso likely to reflect zzso of the zzso zzso and consistent with the critical role identified for zzso in zzso development in zzso Two patients had an enlarged zzso zzso one with a zzso zzso and two had executive skills deficits one in isolation and one in association with a below average intellectual zzso The zzso caused a typical zzso zzso zzso All affected had iris zzso anterior iris to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso varied significantly in severity and showed some zzso All affected also had redundant zzso skin, a zzso zzso zzso and zzso missing between 20 and 27 teeth with an unusual pattern of tooth zzso zzso zzso were documented as they are often poorly characterized in zzso zzso All affected individuals showed an absence of first permanent zzso with variable absence of other rarely absent zzso the permanent upper central zzso zzso and zzso first and second zzso and the zzso zzso Based on the distinctive dental anomalies, we suggest that the dental zzso can assist in predicting the presence of a zzso zzso and the possibility of brain zzso
