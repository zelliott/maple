zzso zzso zzso and an zzso coli expression system for bovine cholesterol side chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 377 and zzso are found to play crucial roles in binding bovine zzso required for transfer of electrons to zzso zzso These zzso zzso are zzso among zzso zzso and have been implicated previously by chemical modification studies as being important for zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso producing either neutral or positive zzso acids at 377 or zzso has no effect on the structure of side chain zzso zzso zzso as determined zzso or on the zzso conversion of cholesterol to zzso However, the estimated zzso of zzso binding is increased approximately zzso depending on the particular zzso Therefore these zzso positively charged zzso in zzso zzso are the key sites for zzso binding which is zzso in zzso
