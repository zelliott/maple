The zzso zzso zzso is the central zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from zzso in the zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of the zzso zzso we zzso the zzso from a 38-year-old patient affected with zzso zzso diffuse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA amplification followed by DNA sequencing revealed a point zzso zzso at zzso position zzso in one of two zzso This leads to the replacement of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso at zzso acid position 52 of the predicted zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions indicated a major change of protein structure as a result of the zzso By using zzso zzso we were able to show that this zzso is zzso zzso of 50 random individuals revealed that four of them also carried this zzso in the zzso zzso This study shows the presence of different forms of the zzso gene in the zzso The zzso which is in a portion of the zzso apparently involved in binding of zzso zzso is discussed as to its possible zzso role in zzso zzso
