A large zzso zzso zzso identified with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso was isolated from human zzso The isolation required zzso zzso followed by gel zzso through a zzso zzso zzso The zzso bound specifically to zzso zzso The binding was not reduced by high salt zzso (up to 4 zzso and was inhibited at low pH zzso zzso The binding was inhibited by the zzso and zzso (but not the zzso zzso of zzso Limited zzso of the zzso gave rise to a relatively stable zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was identical to the zzso zzso sequence of zzso a large human zzso zzso A zzso zzso raised against bovine zzso and recognizing the zzso core protein reacted by zzso with the zzso isolated from human zzso The zzso was used to zzso the zzso in zzso zzso sections of bovine spinal zzso The zzso of the zzso in the central nervous system was identical to that previously reported for zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso of the brain zzso zzso zzso However, a major difference was observed with respect to the sensitivity of the two zzso to zzso As previously reported, zzso was released from the tissue by zzso zzso whereas the zzso persisted under these zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso in brain zzso contain both zzso and zzso that zzso is only retained in the zzso by its interaction with zzso and that the zzso is anchored in some other manner and probably connects cell surfaces with the zzso since it was not released by zzso zzso
