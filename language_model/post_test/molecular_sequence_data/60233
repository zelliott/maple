Group 1 grass zzso zzso are recognized by zzso zzso of almost zzso of allergic individuals and therefore belong to the most important zzso of Type I zzso zzso We have previously isolated the zzso coding for the group 1 zzso from zzso grass, zzso p 1, and demonstrated that zzso zzso p 1 contains most of the B cell as well as T cell zzso of group 1 zzso from a variety of grass and corn zzso Here we determine continuous B cell zzso of zzso p 1 by gene zzso zzso zzso of grass zzso allergic patients identified five continuous zzso areas that on an average bound zzso of zzso p zzso zzso zzso and were zzso recognized in the course of zzso In contrast to zzso patients, patients undergoing grass zzso zzso started to mount zzso zzso to the zzso zzso fragments in the course of zzso The protective role of these zzso zzso is demonstrated by observations that 1) increases in zzso p 1 zzso zzso were in parallel with decreases in zzso p zzso zzso and 2) zzso of zzso p 1 with patients zzso containing zzso p 1 zzso zzso blocked zzso release from zzso of an zzso grass zzso allergic zzso We propose to use zzso zzso p 1 fragments for active zzso in order to induce protective zzso responses against zzso zzso in grass zzso allergic zzso This concept may be applied for the development of zzso vaccines whenever the primary sequence or structure of an zzso is zzso
