A full-length zzso coding for zzso isolated from an adult rabbit fast skeletal muscle library has been zzso and expressed in an zzso coli zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the coding region agrees with the published protein sequence except that the first two zzso are zzso The expressed protein was found to be identical to zzso rabbit skeletal zzso based on zzso zzso in zzso gels containing either zzso or zzso and on zzso These results establish that our zzso zzso clone is suitable for zzso zzso studies on the structure and function of zzso
