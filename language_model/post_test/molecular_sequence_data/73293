A zzso chain reaction zzso zzso procedure has been developed for the canine major zzso complex zzso gene zzso which allows us to distinguish all the zzso zzso described to date and reveals the existence of new zzso The zzso second zzso of the zzso gene was amplified and the product zzso for restriction zzso length zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nine zzso combinations could be associated with previously known zzso Two new zzso combinations corresponded to new zzso and were confirmed by DNA sequencing zzso and zzso Close associations between zzso in the zzso second zzso and the presence of specific zzso acid zzso included in the zzso pockets of the zzso site of the DR zzso are also zzso
