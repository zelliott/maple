In the mixed evergreen forests in the western United States, zzso zzso is able to quickly zzso following zzso and, as such, act as a nurse tree during forest zzso The mechanism for this nurse tree effect has frequently been ascribed to zzso zzso but no detailed zzso studies of the zzso zzso communities associated with zzso zzso roots have yet been zzso zzso 

We examined the structure of the zzso zzso communities associated with zzso zzso in varying forest types and seasons and assessed the potential for common zzso networks between zzso zzso and zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso Study sites were located in the zzso region in southern Oregon, United zzso zzso approaches were used to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso and plant hosts zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso hosts a highly diverse zzso zzso community with similar composition to communities found on other zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that host species and geographic location had little effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent and abundant than zzso zzso zzso and there was high potential for the formation of common zzso networks with zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest zzso zzso is a major hub of zzso zzso diversity and connectivity in mixed evergreen forests and plays an important role in forest zzso by enhancing zzso resilience to zzso
