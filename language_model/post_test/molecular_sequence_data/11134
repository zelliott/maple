zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso and a zzso growth factor that acts on diverse cell zzso zzso zzso its effects via binding to zzso zzso of which both zzso and zzso forms have been zzso In this study, we analyzed the structure and expression of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A full-length clone of the zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso alpha protein was prepared by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso using DNA zzso from total zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso and zzso pregnant rats as zzso The zzso sequence of a full-length clone was determined and further confirmed by analysis of shorter DNA zzso prepared by zzso using zzso zzso The gene for zzso alpha encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso alpha protein shows a high degree of similarity to mouse and human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso Only one molecular species of zzso for the zzso alpha gene was detected in the liver and zzso zzso alpha was expressed in liver of both zzso and pregnant zzso The level of zzso for the zzso alpha gene in zzso was maximum on day 16 of zzso
