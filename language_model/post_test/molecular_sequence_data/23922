The zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production from zzso zzso cells, and zzso fusion and zzso of human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso viruses by zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to identify the zzso in zzso responsible for its zzso binding and zzso zzso To do so we focused on zzso acid differences with zzso zzso zzso which, although zzso identical with zzso has minimal binding activity for zzso and we generated 22 zzso with zzso in the regions of zzso located on the putative surface of the zzso Two zzso situated on the face of zzso predicted to be involved in its interaction with the zzso zzso A, were shown to be critical for zzso and the zzso of zzso fusion and zzso In contrast, four zzso in zzso specifically designed to abolish the zzso zzso activity of the protein failed to zzso its zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso on the other hand, was zzso by zzso zzso either the zzso binding or zzso function of the zzso These findings shed light on the structural basis of the molecular mimicry of the zzso function by a zzso protein and provide a basis for further modification of zzso into an zzso zzso
