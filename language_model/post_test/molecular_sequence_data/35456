zzso zzso zzso zzso have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for heart disease and zzso zzso is a particularly interesting target because it is zzso in blood, breast, zzso and stomach zzso and promotes cell survival in the face of DNA damaging zzso As the only known member of the zzso zzso family to catalyze the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also mechanistically zzso As a part of a program to characterize the mechanisms and regulation of the zzso and develop chemical zzso targeting these zzso we characterized the zzso zzso zzso and kinetic mechanism of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso positively charged zzso contribute to zzso binding in a synergistic zzso Additionally, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, the results of initial zzso product, and dead-end zzso studies indicate that zzso uses a rapid equilibrium random mechanism with dead-end zzso and zzso zzso In total, these studies will guide zzso inhibitor development and lay the foundation for studying how the activity of this medically relevant zzso is zzso
