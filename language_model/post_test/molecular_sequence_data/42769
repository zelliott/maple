A zzso clone containing an insert of about zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the chicken liver zzso library and identified as a clone for the chicken zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity with that of the mouse zzso and 17 out of the 20 active site zzso of the pig heart zzso zzso were zzso Another zzso zzso zzso containing an insert of about zzso zzso was isolated from the chicken zzso zzso zzso This zzso contained an open reading frame for zzso zzso acid zzso whose sequence had partial similarity to two zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and chicken zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso using corresponding zzso clones revealed that both genes are localized on the Z zzso the zzso gene at the middle of the short arm and the zzso gene at the boundary of zzso on the long zzso Southern zzso zzso to male and female zzso DNA preparations from six species representing five avian zzso suggested that these two genes are zzso in all the species zzso
