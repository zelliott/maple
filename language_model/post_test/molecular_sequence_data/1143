zzso changes in nature occur by a variety of mechanisms, and zzso zzso zzso was one of the first studied zzso However, the precise genetic causes of the zzso value of zzso remain zzso Here we investigate the impact of the widespread inversion zzso of zzso zzso on the expression of the zzso zzso whose coding region is located only 12 zzso away from the inversion zzso zzso This gene is transcribed into a zzso zzso present in all zzso zzso zzso zzso More importantly, the expression level of zzso is reduced zzso in zzso of lines zzso for the zzso inversion compared with lines without the zzso An zzso zzso that originates in the zzso zzso zzso inserted at the zzso junction in all of the zzso lines and that forms duplexes with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is most likely responsible for the near zzso of the zzso Few examples of zzso interference caused by zzso elements zzso have been previously zzso but this mechanism might be prevalent in many organisms and illustrates the potential of zzso as a major source of genetic zzso In addition, because zzso zzso are usually induced by zzso position effects might be more common than previously recognized and contribute significantly to the evolutionary success of zzso
