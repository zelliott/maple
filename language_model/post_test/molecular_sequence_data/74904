By a method of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso a zzso expression library was constructed from total zzso zzso that was prepared from immature zzso of zzso zzso Essentially full-length zzso clones for two seed zzso zzso and zzso A, were selected from the library by zzso screening of the colonies and in zzso zzso synthesis and zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined from the zzso sequence of the corresponding zzso and was found to be very zzso to zzso seed proteins of other zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso predicts a zzso extension in the precursor at the zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso levels at successive stages of the seed development were estimated by zzso zzso zzso and results indicated that the two zzso levels are differently zzso
