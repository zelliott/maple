zzso zzso and zzso have been proposed to function as scaffolds in the assembly of zzso clusters in zzso To investigate the roles of these proteins further, single and double zzso strains of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso were constructed by zzso zzso of genes zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Demonstrating the zzso nature of their products, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso grew zzso with doubling times that were similar to the wild type under standard growth zzso In contrast, attempts to zzso the zzso gene only resulted in stable zzso These results imply that zzso but not zzso or zzso is the essential zzso scaffold protein in zzso When cells were grown under zzso conditions, the zzso and zzso zzso strains exhibited less zzso than the wild zzso Under zzso growth conditions, zzso transcript levels, a marker for iron limitation in zzso as well as transcript levels of genes in both the zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso than in the wild zzso Under zzso zzso stress conditions, the transcript levels of the zzso genes are notably higher in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso than in the wild zzso The growth zzso and zzso abundance patterns of the zzso strains contradict the proposed scaffold function for the zzso and zzso proteins in generalized zzso cluster assembly and instead suggest that they play regulatory roles in iron zzso and the sensing of zzso stress in zzso
