Two zzso with different zzso region zzso zzso an zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso were cloned from head kidney of Japanese flounder, zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that they were generated by alternative zzso The predicted protein consists of zzso zzso acid zzso which shares the highest identity of zzso to fish zzso and possesses a zzso domain zzso an zzso association domain zzso and a zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso The presence of these zzso along with zzso analysis places it into the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was expressed zzso in limited tissue types including head zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso A quantitative real time zzso zzso was employed to monitor expression of zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso in zzso head kidney and zzso All three genes were zzso by zzso acid zzso and zzso disease virus zzso with an earlier but slight and less persistent increase in zzso levels seen for the zzso Finally, zzso zzso was proved to induce fish type I zzso promoter in zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line, by a zzso zzso These results provide insights into the roles of fish zzso in the zzso zzso
