The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso constitutes one of the few known zzso between viruses and zzso zzso particles are injected with the zzso eggs into zzso larvae, and the viral genes thus introduced are used to manipulate zzso host zzso The zzso packaged in the particles is composed of 35 zzso DNA zzso circles produced in zzso zzso by amplification of viral sequences from zzso segments integrated in tandem zzso in the zzso zzso These segments and their zzso regions within the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were recently isolated, allowing extensive mapping of amplified zzso The zzso zzso packaged in the particles were found to be amplified within more than 12 replication zzso zzso the zzso zzso the genes of which zzso particle structural zzso was also zzso although not zzso zzso of zzso sequences was shown to involve successive head-to-head and zzso zzso which was not expected given the zzso origin of zzso
