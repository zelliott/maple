zzso zzso is an important white rot fungus of both industrial and ecological zzso zzso zzso are the major decomposition agents in zzso zzso and rarely form zzso zzso therefore zzso zzso interactions continually zzso zzso have different outcomes including replacement of one species by the other or zzso We have made zzso zzso libraries to enrich for genes that are expressed when zzso zzso interacts with another zzso zzso zzso zzso an interaction that results in the replacement of the zzso zzso sequence tags zzso zzso were used for zzso analysis, and their expression compared during interaction with three different zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of significantly more zzso changed in the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso suggesting a relationship between interaction outcome and changes in gene zzso
