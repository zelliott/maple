On pig zzso 6, the zzso zzso is located in the region corresponding to several quantitative trait zzso zzso such as those for intramuscular fat content and for body weight at 4 weeks of zzso The zzso sequence of approximately zzso zzso was obtained from seven zzso clones encompassing the zzso region corresponding to human zzso By searching the zzso zzso using zzso and zzso this zzso segment was found to contain eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one putative gene zzso The average G + C content in the sequence of this zzso was zzso and 33 zzso islands were zzso zzso islands were scattered throughout the region in which most of the putative genes were zzso zzso zzso islands of approximately 840 zzso were observed, including within the zzso zzso and zzso 1 of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso segments of six species showed that zzso ratios of the zzso gene in zzso and rearranged segments were significantly different at zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated the zzso organization of pig zzso 6, including the gene order surrounding zzso which provides important information for comparative zzso Moreover, the genes revealed in this study may be zzso candidate genes associated with zzso on zzso 6 that affect fat deposition in zzso
