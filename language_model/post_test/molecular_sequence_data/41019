We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a sea zzso zzso zzso including the entire zzso zzso zzso and approximately 500 and 700 zzso adjacent to zzso on the zzso and 3' sides, zzso This gene is split between zzso 121 and 122 and within zzso 204 by two zzso which are 233 and 181 zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the two zzso indicates a region of distant zzso which covers about zzso of their zzso suggesting that these sequences might have derived from a common ancestral zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso which matches zzso than zzso when compared to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso regions indicates the presence of sequences similar to those thought to be important for initiation of zzso and zzso of zzso The location of these sequences and the size of an zzso zzso transcribed from this or a very closely related zzso suggests that initiation occurs 347 zzso zzso of coding and zzso approximately 515 zzso 3' of zzso
