zzso factor zzso represents one kind of basic zzso which binds and zzso zzso and exhibits strong zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of Chinese zzso crab zzso zzso zzso Edwards, zzso zzso as zzso was identified from zzso by expressed sequence tag zzso and zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso consisted of 700 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso tail, and an zzso frame of zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso The high similarity of zzso zzso acid sequence shared with the zzso from other species indicated that zzso should be a member of zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in the zzso of heart, zzso zzso zzso zzso and muscle was examined by Northern zzso analysis and zzso transcripts of zzso were mainly detected in zzso heart and zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso after zzso zzso challenge was recorded by quantitative real-time zzso The relative expression level of zzso was zzso rapidly at 2 h zzso and reached zzso to that in blank zzso After a drastic decrease to the original level from 4 to 8 zzso the expression level increased again and reached zzso to that in the blank group at 12 h zzso The zzso DNA sequence of zzso gene consists of zzso zzso containing three zzso and two zzso The coding sequence of the zzso mature zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso to further zzso its biological zzso The zzso zzso product showed zzso activity against both zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, which demonstrated that the zzso was a zzso zzso zzso All these results indicated that zzso was an zzso protein involved in the immune responses of Chinese zzso zzso and provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in zzso
