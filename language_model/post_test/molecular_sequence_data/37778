zzso patterns of zzso zzso were studied over a period of 3 zzso in wild zzso zzso zzso populations associated with commercial zzso cages and inhabiting various sites along the Israeli Red Sea zzso zzso was first recorded from the Red Sea in 1990 in farmed sea bass zzso zzso and is absent from records of studies on zzso and diseases of wild zzso carried out in the 1970s and zzso A sharp increase in the prevalence of the disease in cultured and wild fish in the region has occurred zzso A total of zzso zzso were examined over a 3 zzso period from inside zzso net zzso from the cage surroundings and from several sites along the zzso zzso sections of zzso were examined for presence of zzso zzso zzso prevalence levels of 50% were recorded in the zzso sampled inside the net cages and zzso at the zzso close surroundings, zzso at a sandy beach site zzso zzso zzso zzso at Eilat zzso 3 zzso to the south and zzso at a coral reef site about 10 zzso south of the zzso In addition, 147 fish belonging to 18 native Red Sea species were sampled from 2 sites, the net cage farm perimeter and the coral reef area, and examined for similar zzso None of those from the coral reef were infected with zzso however, 9 of 14 species collected from the cage surroundings were zzso An increase in prevalence of zzso in the zzso farm area was noted from 1995 to zzso At the same time, a significant increase in prevalence was also apparent at the coral reef sampling zzso Two zzso zzso zzso from zzso captured at Eilat zzso and the coral reef site were shown by zzso zzso sequencing analysis to be identical to zzso from zzso trapped inside the zzso cages as well as zzso from locally cultured sea bass zzso zzso The implications of spreading of zzso zzso infection in wild fish populations in the Gulf of Eilat are zzso
