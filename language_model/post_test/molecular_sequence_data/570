zzso zzso disease) is linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies demonstrate that the level of soluble zzso zzso forms zzso better with the progression of the disease than the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed to detect either zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that structural differences between these forms of zzso zzso Using conditions which yield zzso zzso zzso or zzso we studied the secondary structure of these species by zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso was organized in a parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed distinct spectral features, which were attributed to an zzso zzso zzso We also noted striking similarities between zzso zzso zzso and those of bacterial outer membrane zzso We discuss our results in terms of a possible organization of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso which may be related to reported effects of these highly toxic species in the zzso zzso associated with zzso
