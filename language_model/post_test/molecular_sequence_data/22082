In the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso receptors pass through early, recycling, and sorting zzso compartments before returning to the cell zzso zzso motifs in the zzso domain zzso and protein interactions with these sequences presumably direct zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that association of a potential sorting heat shock protein zzso zzso with the zzso was regulated by zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Mass zzso and zzso analyses identified five of these zzso proteins as the molecular zzso zzso 96, zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso binding zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether any of the zzso protein complexes zzso zzso or zzso were selectivity associated with the zzso In conjunction with molecular zzso zzso and zzso were recovered from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was independent of the zzso status of the CD zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso prevented zzso recovery within an zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso from zzso thereby altering zzso trafficking also, inhibited zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with an inhibitor of zzso zzso formation, zzso The data presented provide evidence that recruitment of zzso and zzso which is necessary for appropriate zzso trafficking, is zzso by the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
