The zzso shows responses to acute ethanol exposure that are similar to those observed in humans, mice, and zzso namely zzso followed by zzso and zzso We used in this report the zzso zzso zzso as a model system to identify and characterize the genes that are affected by ethanol exposure and to link those genes functionally into an zzso gene zzso By analyzing the expression profiles of all zzso zzso zzso using zzso we identified 230 genes affected by zzso While the ethanol response of some of the identified genes was significant at early time points, that of the majority was at late time points, indicating that the genes in the latter case might represent the zzso consequence of the ethanol zzso We further characterized the early response genes that may represent those involved directly in the ethanol zzso These genes included many heat shock protein zzso indicating that high concentration of ethanol acts as a strong stress to the zzso Interestingly, we identified two zzso protein genes that were specifically responsive to zzso zzso was the only zzso zzso gene to be induced by zzso zzso which encodes a protein with limited zzso to human zzso was also specific to ethanol zzso Finally, by analyzing the promoter regions of the early response zzso we identified a regulatory element, zzso that was necessary for the expression of zzso of ethanol response zzso
