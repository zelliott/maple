The zzso associated with zzso processing zzso plays a pivotal role in the major zzso complex zzso class I zzso immune response against infected or zzso transformed zzso It belongs to the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso and consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso each of which possesses a zzso and a zzso domain zzso Here we describe the generation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments to human TAP from a zzso cell line expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was mapped to the very last five zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fragments were zzso expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso from zzso extracts by affinity zzso The zzso and zzso zzso bind with zzso affinity to the last five zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso as demonstrated by zzso and surface zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso stability to the zzso TAP zzso At the same time TAP is arrested in a zzso transport incompetent zzso although zzso and zzso binding to TAP are not zzso Based on our results we suggest that the C zzso of zzso zzso TAP function presumably as part of the zzso interface of the zzso
