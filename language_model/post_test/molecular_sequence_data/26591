Plant zzso zzso are usually transmitted to the progeny from the maternal zzso However, cases of paternal transmission are known and are perhaps more common than once zzso This review will consider recent evidence, both direct and zzso of paternal transmission zzso of the zzso zzso of seed plants, especially in natural zzso and how this can result in offspring that carry a mixture of zzso and zzso derived copies of the zzso a type of zzso It will further consider how this zzso zzso zzso between genetically distinct zzso a process that can enhance zzso zzso zzso This will then form the basis for a discussion of five evolutionary questions that arise from these zzso Questions include how plant zzso zzso evolution can be placed on a sexual to asexual zzso whether zzso male zzso zzso zzso the evolution of paternal zzso whether paternal leakage is more likely in populations undergoing zzso how leakage influences patterns of gene flow, and whether zzso occurs in natural populations at a frequency greater than predicted by crossing zzso It is proposed that each of these questions offers fertile ground for future research on a diversity of plant zzso
