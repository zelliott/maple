We investigated the role of beta 3 zzso a member of the beta zzso zzso zzso family, in zzso zzso focusing on the expression of zzso a zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A clone permanently expressing an zzso zzso of beta zzso was obtained from the human zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso Both beta zzso activity and zzso expression are dramatically impaired in the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso in cells metabolically zzso with zzso zzso shows that a relevant amount of zzso is associated to large zzso zzso mostly releases zzso alpha zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso from such zzso of zzso zzso but zzso beta zzso and type 2 chain zzso including zzso alpha zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso from those of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso zzso in the culture media but not zzso while zzso clone zzso mostly zzso and zzso of both zzso is prevented by zzso These data indicate that beta zzso suppression turns synthesis of type 1 chain zzso to zzso zzso zzso and termination by zzso In other cell lines and zzso beta zzso transcript, beta zzso activity, and zzso zzso are also zzso but zzso the relative expression ratios are very different from cell type to cell zzso We suggest that beta zzso plays a relevant role in gastrointestinal and pancreatic zzso zzso the zzso pattern associated to zzso and is necessary for the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso whose expression still depends on multiple interacting zzso
