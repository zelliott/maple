DNA zzso were selected for their ability to bind simultaneously to the protein zzso c and to the zzso zzso Such zzso each contained a zzso zzso core, analogous to sequences shown previously to form a zzso site when zzso The detailed study of zzso a deletion zzso of one zzso indicated that in the presence of zzso the zzso core of the zzso folded to form a zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were required for this zzso The binding of fully oxidized zzso c to this zzso complex resulted in an zzso difference spectrum in the zzso region, which could be used as an indicator of binding zzso It was found that zzso c bound more tightly to the folded zzso zzso complex than to the folded zzso DNA zzso A single zzso zzso and a single zzso c bound to each zzso of folded zzso zzso experiments showed the binding site of the zzso c to be a partial duplex element of the zzso immediately zzso its zzso zzso zzso The order of addition of zzso and zzso c appeared not to affect either the formation rate or the structure of the final zzso zzso The zzso complex represents the zzso of a zzso zzso complex to zzso c (a zzso zzso Future experiments will focus on investigating the optimal zzso path between the two iron centers through intervening protein and zzso
