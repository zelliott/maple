Three novel zzso zzso zzso an existing zzso zzso zzso and five existing zzso zzso zzso which target zzso zzso from zzso or zzso were zzso The zzso were tested on DNA extracted from zzso zzso human zzso and zzso animal zzso zzso samples collected in zzso The three novel zzso zzso compared zzso to the existing zzso zzso exhibiting sensitivities of zzso and zzso of zzso as compared to a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for the existing zzso zzso Of the five zzso zzso zzso the zzso targeting the zzso zzso group was the most promising, exhibiting a sensitivity of zzso (with human sewage zzso and a specificity of zzso When tested on rural water samples that were naturally contaminated by zzso feces, the three novel zzso zzso tested positive with a much greater percentage zzso of samples than the existing zzso zzso zzso These novel zzso zzso show promise for microbial source tracking and merit further field testing and specificity zzso
