zzso zzso has become an important method for the rapid identification of zzso zzso since the 2001 anthrax zzso Most real-time zzso zzso for zzso zzso have been developed to detect zzso genes located on the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, only two published zzso targets exist, the zzso gene and the zzso zzso In the present study, zzso with a zzso zzso zzso tester strain and a zzso zzso driver was used to find a unique zzso zzso By targeting this region, a real-time zzso was developed with the zzso Advanced zzso Identification zzso Further testing has revealed that the zzso has zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso with a limit of detection of 50 zzso of zzso The results of a search for sequences with zzso with the zzso program demonstrated significant alignment to the recently published zzso zzso Ames strain, while an inquiry for protein sequence similarities indicated zzso with an zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The importance of this zzso zzso will be to verify the presence of zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso
