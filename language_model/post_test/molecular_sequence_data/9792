zzso zzso zzso from bovine and zzso species produce unique molecular zzso of type C zzso zzso zzso The SEC animal zzso have greater than zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso a zzso zzso The two SEC animal zzso have been designated zzso and zzso according to their corresponding host zzso We showed previously that these toxins induce zzso different levels of zzso stimulation in several animal zzso The present study compared the abilities of these closely related zzso SEC zzso to stimulate zzso T cells from bovine and human zzso All three toxins expanded human T cells bearing zzso zzso zzso elements zzso 3, 12, zzso 14, 15, 17, and zzso However, zzso resulted in greater expansion of zzso than either zzso or zzso In addition, bovine T cells zzso in a zzso manner in response to these zzso zzso All three toxins induced the proliferation of bovine T cells bearing the previously zzso zzso element zzso from the bovine zzso clone zzso zzso zzso and zzso also were able to induce proliferation of bovine T cells bearing zzso which zzso failed to zzso The zzso differences in zzso proliferation exhibited by these closely related SEC zzso may reflect the evolutionary adaptation of zzso zzso presumably to increase its host range by the manipulation of the immune system in a zzso zzso
