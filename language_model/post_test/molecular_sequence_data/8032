In the present study, the zzso specificity and species selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso as well as its in zzso antagonism of zzso Y zzso second zzso have been zzso zzso zzso is zzso displaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso expressing Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso is zzso because the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso displays almost no affinity zzso zzso 10,000 zzso In contrast, zzso up to 10 zzso zzso zzso do not zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso the rabbit zzso zzso zzso and the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonism could be shown for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, none of the formerly described putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be characterized as high affinity zzso zzso zzso The 18 zzso acid zzso analog zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso affinity with in zzso zzso properties zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first potent and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
