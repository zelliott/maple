There is considerable interest in human zzso arising from the observation that it is expressed selectively on the surface of zzso zzso the fetal cell population directly in contact with the zzso We investigated several aspects of the molecular biology of this unusual zzso Limited zzso at the zzso level, and even more restricted variation at the zzso acid level, was found in our Caucasian zzso A further unusual aspect of zzso is the occurrence of alternatively spliced zzso zzso messages that could give rise to either zzso or soluble proteins have been reported and six of these alternative forms were detected in all first zzso and term zzso highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the cell lines, zzso and zzso An additional novel zzso zzso involving loss of part of the zzso region was observed with two zzso Using a sensitive zzso protection zzso higher levels of the zzso zzso as compared to the soluble forms were detected in first zzso and term zzso as well as in zzso zzso to previous findings our term samples taken from the maternal aspect showed higher levels of both zzso species when compared to first zzso zzso The question of zzso was addressed through the detection of zzso both in zzso tissue and, more zzso in the zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso In addition we did not find zzso for zzso in human two to eight-cell zzso or in zzso or in zzso zzso
