The lifetimes of activated zzso zzso channels contribute to the efficiency of synaptic zzso Here we show that structural differences within the interface dividing zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors account for the large differences in zzso lifetime and time of zzso onset between these contrasting members of the zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso single-channel currents appear mainly as isolated brief openings zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso currents after a step pulse of zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast for zzso zzso zzso single-channel currents appear as clusters of many long openings in quick succession zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso currents zzso slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso exhibits functional properties intermediate between those of the parent zzso but the functional signatures of each parent are zzso after substituting the major zzso within the interface of the zzso and zzso zzso from the corresponding parent zzso Furthermore, these structural zzso contribute to zzso lifetime and time of zzso onset in a zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is the major zzso of the lifetimes of activated zzso and zzso receptors and that functional differences between the two receptors arise primarily through structural differences at the interface between zzso and zzso zzso
