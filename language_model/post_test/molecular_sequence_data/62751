The zzso protein of zzso zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso variation, although its precise role has yet to be zzso We demonstrate that the nearly identical zzso from zzso zzso binds DNA with little specificity for sequence or structure, like the zzso coli zzso We also show that neither protein is able to zzso zzso tension in relaxed zzso These data exclude several possible roles for zzso in zzso zzso variation and suggest that zzso performs a similar function in both zzso coli and the zzso zzso
