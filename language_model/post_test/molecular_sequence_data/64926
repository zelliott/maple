Analysis of genetic variation in 16 zzso virus zzso zzso selected at random and circulating in the Irish population between March 2002 and February 2003 was carried zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso E gene zzso reading frame zzso encompassing zzso zzso at which a zzso zzso defines the escape zzso zzso and including two other zzso regions zzso and zzso was zzso No new single zzso zzso zzso were zzso indicating stability of these zzso in clinical zzso of zzso However, when four zzso zzso markers consisting of defined regions from genes 1, 21, 50, and 54 were zzso 14 variable zzso positions were zzso zzso analysis showed the presence of three highly supported zzso A, B, and C circulating in the Irish zzso zzso one third zzso zzso of the Irish zzso zzso in this study belonged to zzso C, zzso zzso to zzso A, and zzso zzso to zzso zzso A smaller number zzso zzso belonged to zzso zzso This indicates remarkable zzso in the Irish population given the small sample zzso No evidence was found to suggest any of the 16 zzso was a zzso These findings have implications for the model of geographic isolation of zzso zzso to certain regions as the circulating Irish zzso population appears to comprise approximately equal numbers of each of the main zzso This data is inconsistent with a model of strict geographical separation of zzso zzso and suggests that zzso diversity is more pronounced in certain areas than had been thought zzso
