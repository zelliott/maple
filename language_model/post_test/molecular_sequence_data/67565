zzso receptors zzso are seven zzso zzso proteins that mediate cell signaling thereby controlling many important zzso and pathological zzso zzso get activated upon zzso binding and trigger the signal zzso zzso zzso exist in multiple inactive and active zzso and there is a finite population of the active and inactive states even in the zzso zzso An understanding of the nature of the zzso ensemble sampled by zzso and the atomic level mechanism of the zzso transitions require a combination of zzso methods and experimental zzso We have developed a coarse zzso discrete zzso sampling zzso method called zzso to map the zzso ensemble sampled by zzso in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso method can also be used to predict functional selective zzso states starting from the inactive state of the zzso zzso has been applied to map the zzso ensemble of zzso zzso a class A zzso We have shown that zzso zzso samples a larger zzso space in the zzso state and that different zzso select and stabilize zzso from this zzso In this review we describe the zzso method in detail and zzso the uses and pitfalls of this zzso
