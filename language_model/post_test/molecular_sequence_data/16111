We have determined the zzso sequences of 55 spontaneous zzso that zzso a zzso gene of zzso T4 zzso Most of the zzso caused zzso or deletions of single zzso at 18 different positions in the zzso Two of three zzso that allowed the synthesis of mature zzso had zzso zzso at the junction of the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that this region of zzso is important for zzso The third zzso that zzso zzso had a zzso deletion in the zzso loop, which presumably affected the zzso capacity of the zzso We also zzso 58 spontaneous zzso zzso derived from strains with the inactive zzso zzso Some of these zzso the initial zzso zzso while other generated a zzso zzso in the zzso These zzso zzso restored zzso zzso to the zzso that had been eliminated by the initial zzso The new zzso involved zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso pair at certain positions in the zzso This finding establishes the existence of zzso zzso pair in zzso zzso
