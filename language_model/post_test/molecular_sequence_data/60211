zzso a family of genes with a zzso domain zzso from insects through to zzso are believed to be involved in zzso guidance during zzso zzso We report the expression patterns of mouse zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso mouse zzso H is structurally most similar to zzso zzso the first zzso identified as a collapsing factor for sensory zzso However, its expression patterns apparently differ from those of zzso zzso The zzso zzso are distributed in the brain widely but zzso during development, in particular, in the main zzso bulb, zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso the expression level is high in zzso zzso surrounding the zzso root zzso while it is low in the spinal zzso Moreover, we examined whether this zzso has activity to collapse growth cones of sensory zzso as well as zzso zzso Mouse zzso H collapsed growth cones of sensory zzso of the zzso root zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso zzso inhibited this zzso Taken together, these results suggest that mouse zzso H can function as a zzso to guide sensory peripheral nerves, most likely via zzso as a zzso
