zzso B is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is pivotal in the induction of target cell zzso Here we describe the expression of zzso human zzso B in zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso a zzso including an zzso zzso site, and the mature zzso B sequence followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso from the medium by immobilized zzso zzso affinity zzso and then activated by zzso zzso yield is approximately 1 zzso per zzso The zzso zzso resembles native zzso B in size and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with equivalent efficiency zzso 82 zzso zzso 12 zzso processes zzso to zzso form, and is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso It efficiently zzso DNA degradation and zzso of human zzso The availability of zzso human zzso B will facilitate further investigation of its structure and role in immune zzso zzso
