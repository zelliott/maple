In zzso zzso zzso acids are a major source of N and are absorbed as zzso by small zzso zzso Although the zzso activities of 2 zzso transport systems have been described for zzso little is known regarding the regulation of their gene zzso This study was conducted to test 2 zzso zzso the small zzso zzso of beef cattle zzso express zzso for 3 zzso zzso 2, 3) and 2 zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of these zzso is responsive to small zzso zzso supply of zzso microbes zzso zzso energy zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Angus zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso of zzso were fed an alfalfa zzso diet at zzso zzso zzso Six zzso in each of 3 periods were blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso Within each block, 3 zzso were randomly assigned to 3 treatments zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso water infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso water infusion, or zzso water zzso zzso zzso The dosage of zzso infusion amounted to zzso of ME zzso After a zzso zzso infusion period, zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were harvested for total zzso extraction and the relative amounts of zzso expressed were determined using real-time zzso zzso zzso All 5 zzso zzso were found expressed by each zzso but their abundance differed among zzso Specifically, zzso expression of all 5 zzso zzso was higher than that by the zzso whereas zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was higher, or tended to be higher, than zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was higher than zzso zzso With regard to zzso infusion treatments, zzso infusion increased zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion increased zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and tended to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study has uniquely characterized the pattern of zzso zzso expression by growing beef cattle and found that the zzso abundance for zzso zzso and zzso in small zzso zzso can be increased by increasing the zzso supply of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
