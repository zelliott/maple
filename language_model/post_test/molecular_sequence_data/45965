Several key zzso acids within zzso zzso 8 of the human zzso zzso zzso were zzso to characterize their role in signaling by G zzso zzso zzso of zzso at position zzso in the zzso interface to zzso zzso prevented the zzso of the zzso indicating that the orientation of zzso 8 is important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid at position 382 in the zzso interface to zzso zzso reduced the binding and zzso the zzso from G protein zzso zzso of the basic zzso zzso at position zzso to zzso zzso or to zzso acid zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed features associated with zzso active receptors because inverse zzso markedly reduced their elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso and promoted the zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the wild type zzso but failed to produce these effects in zzso and zzso because these receptors were zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso distribution of the wild type zzso zzso and zzso were localized mostly within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso distribution of zzso and zzso indicating that they recycled normally when their zzso zzso was blocked by inverse zzso These data combined with computer modeling of the putative three-dimensional organization of zzso 8 indicated that the zzso character of zzso 8 and side chain projections of zzso and zzso within the zzso interface might serve as a zzso site for the G zzso
