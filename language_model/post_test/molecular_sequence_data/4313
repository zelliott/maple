The current study was designed to test the ability of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso essential components of an artificial zzso cell to activate zzso T cells in zzso We have constructed a set of zzso zzso separately or in combination a zzso T zzso zzso (the zzso zzso of chicken zzso the zzso class II zzso zzso and zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso both the zzso and the presenting zzso but not either one alone, could activate cloned zzso T cells specific for the zzso zzso Additional zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in further enhancement of T cell zzso Thus, our zzso zzso expressing four different foreign gene products zzso the highest proliferation rates of zzso cloned T zzso
