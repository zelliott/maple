Three zzso zzso strains recovered from the zzso oral cavity were zzso by traditional zzso tests, the zzso zzso ID System, and zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence zzso The molecular biological methods revealed that these strains differ from zzso zzso forming a new zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, sequence analysis and multiple alignments of zzso zzso and the zzso gene established that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strains described here possess high genetic zzso
