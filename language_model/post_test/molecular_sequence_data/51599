In order to screen for zzso active zzso zzso during zzso zzso we generated transgenic fish by zzso two different zzso reporter zzso into zzso zzso zzso fish were screened among the progeny of injected fish zzso crossed to zzso zzso Groups of 15 to 20 progeny of each cross were tested for zzso expression and/or transmission of injected sequences using zzso and Southern zzso zzso from 2 of 102 fish injected with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso virus promoter sequences showed apparently zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso However, we were not able to detect this reporter construct in DNA from fins of F1 zzso zzso of a linear reporter construct containing mouse zzso promoter sequences revealed transmission of injected sequences to F1 progeny in about zzso of cases (8 of 129 fish, tested with zzso We found one zzso line that showed a zzso and temporally restricted expression of zzso and, therefore, features typical characteristics of zzso zzso zzso In this line, zzso expression starts at 16 hours zzso in zzso zzso zzso At about 24 hours zzso expression can be detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the development of these two cell types shows common zzso The reporter gene has integrated as a single zzso The founder fish was zzso zzso of its offspring (3 of 16 tested zzso carried the reporter construct in their zzso about 51% (13 of 27 tested zzso of the progeny of F1 fish were zzso positive indicating full zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
