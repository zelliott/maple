zzso zzso a major cell zzso zzso is found in plasma and in the zzso zzso At least three distinct cell surface receptors for zzso belonging to the zzso zzso have been identified in normal and zzso zzso Many cell zzso zzso including zzso contain an zzso zzso sequence zzso in part, the zzso zzso These zzso bind different zzso with varying specificity and zzso The mechanism of zzso specificity remains zzso To determine the role of the zzso sequence in zzso zzso we amplified the zzso for human zzso from a liver zzso library and generated two separate zzso by utilizing zzso zzso resulting in zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso substitution and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression zzso zzso was used to zzso baby zzso kidney cells which zzso zzso proteins into the zzso All zzso proteins were isolated by zzso zzso and tested for interaction with three known zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 3 on zzso zzso alpha v beta 3 on human zzso vein zzso cells and alpha v beta 5 on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved in a fashion similar to zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins showed complete loss of cell zzso activity, regardless of the zzso These results confirm the essential and central role of the zzso sequence in zzso for cell zzso This expression system allows further zzso analysis of zzso
