We have cloned a zzso coding for a novel steroid zzso zzso protein termed zzso from a rat prostate zzso Although the zzso sequence of the zzso has zzso identity to that of the human steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso which was reported to act as an zzso transcript without being translated into protein zzso McKenna, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1999) Cell 97, zzso the zzso of zzso is capable of generating a functional zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso showed that zzso associates with the partial zzso zzso zzso protein composed of a zzso domain and an zzso function zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso enhances the zzso activity of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Using a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated in zzso translation of the zzso fusion protein in zzso cells zzso with zzso and reporter gene in the presence of 5 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein expression zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso whereas incorporation of zzso in zzso of the fusion protein resulted in loss of enhancement of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso are expressed in rat and human prostate cancer cell lines zzso In zzso cells and the human prostate cancer cells line zzso zzso with zzso the zzso zzso activities of zzso were not completely inhibited by the zzso zzso but the zzso activities still remained high even in the presence of 5 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play an important role in enhancing zzso activity in prostate zzso
