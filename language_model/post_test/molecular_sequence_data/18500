A zzso negative, strictly zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from fresh water and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to grow at zzso and at pH zzso in the absence of zzso on zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was shown to belong to the family zzso and to be related to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was determined to be zzso The major zzso was determined to be zzso and the major fatty acids were identified as summed feature 7 zzso zzso zzso as defined by the zzso system; zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA and zzso data supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be differentiated zzso and zzso from the recognized species of the zzso zzso The novel isolate therefore represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
