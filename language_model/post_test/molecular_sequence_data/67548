zzso and zzso are genes zzso in zzso syndrome zzso a condition resembling osteogenesis imperfecta zzso but that is also typically associated with zzso joint zzso zzso we sought zzso in six zzso zzso families and detected changes in either zzso or zzso in all zzso Two zzso were found with a zzso zzso zzso in the alternative zzso zzso of zzso indicating that specific zzso of the longer protein zzso zzso by this gene is sufficient to cause zzso In addition, by zzso zzso followed by a candidate gene approach, we identified a zzso donor zzso site zzso in zzso in a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso of additional samples also revealed compound zzso zzso in zzso in two brothers, one affected with mild zzso and the other with mild zzso Thus, zzso in addition to causing zzso is also associated with zzso zzso of variable zzso
