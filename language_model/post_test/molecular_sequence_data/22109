zzso a zzso of zzso is a zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso zzso cell walls by zzso the zzso linkage between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso cells through its zzso 92 zzso known as the targeting domain, is functionally important for zzso zzso The zzso domain belongs to the zzso domain family, the zzso counterpart of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso crystal structure of the targeting domain shows an zzso fold similar to typical zzso but with unique zzso The structure reveals patches of zzso zzso among zzso targeting zzso forming surface regions that can potentially interact with some common features of the zzso cell zzso zzso domain binding studies employing various bacterial zzso demonstrate that the length of the zzso bridge, as well as the zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso the maximum binding of the targeting domain to the zzso zzso zzso of the highly zzso first 9 zzso zzso results in loss of specificity to zzso zzso cell zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso specificity to zzso zzso cell zzso
