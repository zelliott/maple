zzso male zzso zzso in plants is usually associated with the expression of specific zzso regions within rearranged zzso zzso zzso zzso plants express high amounts of a zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso which is associated with the observed zzso zzso This transcript carries two zzso open reading zzso zzso and zzso both unique to zzso zzso zzso also contain free linear DNA plasmids bearing terminal zzso repeats zzso These zzso recombine with zzso sequences that zzso zzso within the main zzso zzso to produce linear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is initiated from a promoter within the zzso only when they are at linear zzso zzso of zzso to fertility occur in certain nuclear backgrounds and are usually associated with loss of the S plasmids and/or the zzso zzso We describe an unusual set of independently recovered zzso from a single maternal lineage that retain both the S plasmids and an intact zzso region but which do not produce the zzso zzso A zzso inversion resulting from illegitimate zzso between zzso zzso has separated the zzso zzso sequences from the zzso zzso Although zzso containing zzso can still be detected in the zzso they are not highly expressed during zzso development and they are no longer initiated from the zzso promoter at a zzso linear zzso They appear instead to be zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso inversion was not detected in zzso or in other fertile zzso zzso this inversion appears to be a de zzso zzso that has continued to sort out within a single maternal zzso giving rise to fertile progeny in successive zzso
