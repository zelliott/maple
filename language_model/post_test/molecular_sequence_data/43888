zzso I is a zzso protein of synaptic zzso that serves as a zzso sensor for neurotransmitter release and was the first member found of a large family of trafficking zzso We have now identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that is highly expressed in brain and at lower levels in other zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso region and two zzso zzso but is most closely related to zzso IV with which it forms a new zzso of zzso The first zzso of zzso I (the zzso binds zzso as a function of zzso and contains a zzso site, the zzso that binds at least two zzso zzso via five zzso zzso and is zzso in most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sutton, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso IV and zzso however, one of the five zzso zzso in the zzso is zzso for a zzso suggesting that these zzso do not bind zzso To test this, we produced zzso zzso from zzso IV and zzso with either wild type zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso both zzso but not wild type zzso against zzso zzso indicating that the zzso restore zzso to the wild type zzso Furthermore, wild type zzso of zzso IV and zzso exhibited no zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso bound zzso as a function of zzso similarly to wild type zzso zzso These experiments suggest that a class of zzso was selected during evolution in which the zzso site of the zzso was zzso by a single point zzso Thus, zzso must have zzso functions as well as zzso functions that are selectively maintained in distinct members of this gene zzso
