In the present study, we report the zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso alias zzso 402 zzso by the use of the data available in public zzso This analysis allowed characterization of the zzso zzso identification of the gene promoter region, presentation of the putative complete sequences of two zzso zzso zzso and definition of the structure of zzso zzso surrounding the zzso editing zzso
