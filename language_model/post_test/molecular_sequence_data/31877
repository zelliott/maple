In this study, we cloned and characterized zzso sequences of two zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso and zzso from Japanese flounder, zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso long and consists an open frame zzso of zzso a zzso region zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso is zzso including a zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso quantitative zzso results revealed that zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all detected zzso Interestingly, the levels of zzso zzso in all detected zzso were higher in female than male, but zzso was precisely the zzso At different embryonic zzso the levels of zzso zzso were typically higher than zzso After zzso zzso zzso was gradually decreased to a relatively lower zzso However, the expression of zzso zzso was increased after zzso including 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 20 and zzso zzso zzso and it presents a higher level until 29 zzso zzso 36 zzso and zzso (the end of zzso In zzso sodium salt zzso the main form of zzso hormone in zzso and zzso zzso larvae, the expressions of zzso had not visibly changed, except in zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso were distinctly increased from 17 to zzso but suddenly dropped to a lower level in and after zzso However, the levels of zzso zzso during metamorphosis were greatly zzso after zzso zzso These results provided basic information for further studies on the role of zzso system in zzso development and zzso
