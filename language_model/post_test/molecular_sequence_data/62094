zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso zzso through its potent ability to bind and zzso zzso It also represents a zzso for binding proteins that control zzso of other zzso growth factors such as the bone zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a distinctive structure comprised principally of three zzso zzso zzso These are preceded by an zzso segment shown by us previously to contain zzso zzso essential for zzso zzso To establish the contribution of the zzso zzso themselves to zzso zzso we prepared zzso with deleted or exchanged zzso and zzso point zzso zzso were expressed from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and evaluated for zzso binding and for biological activity in zzso measuring differing aspects of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and suppression of zzso zzso in primary zzso cell zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso alone could not bind zzso or suppress zzso transcription, either alone or combined in solution with the zzso domain region zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 or 2 abolished zzso binding and biological activity in both zzso whereas deletion of domain 3 was zzso zzso was also reduced or eliminated after exchange of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or doubling of domain 1 zzso zzso or domain 2 zzso zzso Several zzso zzso clustered within the zzso region of zzso zzso 1 and 2 are highly zzso among all zzso zzso zzso of any of these to zzso or Ala either reduced or eliminated zzso zzso and disrupted distant zzso for zzso binding zzso domain 1) or zzso recognition zzso domain zzso suggesting their role in maintaining the zzso integrity of the domain and possibly the zzso zzso as a zzso These results are consistent with the importance of domain zzso as well as the overall order of the zzso in zzso zzso A continuous sequence zzso the zzso domain and followed by zzso zzso 1 and 2 fulfills the minimum structural requirement for zzso binding and zzso zzso
