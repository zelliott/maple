A zzso neural zzso was reported to be recognized by zzso cell zzso in serum of a patient with zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that this neural zzso is recognized by zzso known as zzso cell zzso type I zzso Type I) and zzso The latter's zzso is reported to be specific for the zzso to zzso zzso zzso Assuming that the zzso and zzso to zzso zzso share a common zzso recognized by all of these zzso we examined the zzso region on the zzso protein by zzso with deletion zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso A major zzso was localized in the region of zzso acid zzso 94 to 133 of the zzso zzso which is the site of a zzso zzso zzso The potential zzso of zzso Type I is zzso
