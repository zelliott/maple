zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel reaction that involves the transfer of zzso acid between host and zzso zzso In this paper, we report kinetic isotope effect studies on zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso isotope effects were measured for a good zzso zzso and a slow zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso The zzso isotope effect for zzso in the acid zzso reaction was zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso isotope effects for zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso transfer zzso the zzso and primary zzso effects for zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The isotope effects for zzso describe a zzso zzso zzso and these data are contrasted by the data for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso isotope effects are lower by a factor of 2, but the primary carbon isotope effects are higher by a factor of zzso This pattern describes a mechanism involving zzso participation in the zzso transition zzso
