zzso skeleton protein zzso plays a key role in modulating the interactions of zzso zzso and integral membrane proteins in zzso and zzso zzso We have investigated its structure and expression during embryonic development of zzso zzso An analysis of the complete zzso sequence and predicted translation of 801 zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso reveals that, within overlapping regions, zzso protein zzso is zzso identical to a composite zzso acid sequence of human zzso and zzso protein zzso and has an identity similar to that of zzso acid motifs zzso expressed in either human zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protection analysis demonstrates the presence of a single species of protein zzso transcript in zzso zzso produced against zzso zzso protein zzso fusion protein recognize two bands of 180 and 115 zzso on Western blots of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and, using zzso techniques, label the developing zzso most zzso In zzso zzso of a zzso construct fully zzso zzso zzso protein zzso yields a synthetic zzso which, when translated in zzso produces a zzso that zzso on zzso gels with the zzso form of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is found exclusively in zzso following the terminal zzso of retinal zzso When retinal zzso is complete, protein zzso is also expressed in the inner zzso In adult zzso zzso protein zzso is detected in zzso bipolar cells, and zzso cell zzso As these cell types have previously been shown to express zzso zzso and zzso it is likely that the membrane skeleton of zzso and retinal cells share functional zzso
