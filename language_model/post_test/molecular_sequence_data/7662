We report a highly zzso zzso zzso site zzso at the zzso locus that was previously identified by a less zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso This marker, which was also localized to the physical map of zzso zzso by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso should assist in the precision mapping of genes in the area zzso
