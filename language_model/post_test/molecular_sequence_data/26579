To uncover molecular functions and networks in biological cellular systems, it is important to dissect interactions between proteins and zzso Many studies have been performed to investigate and analyze interactions between protein zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso In terms of interactions between zzso in zzso it is generally accepted that an zzso acid zzso at interacting sites has zzso together with the partner zzso in order to keep the interaction between zzso in zzso Based on this hypothesis, in our previous study to identify zzso contact pairs in interacting zzso we made calculations of mutual information zzso I) between zzso acid zzso from some multiple sequence alignment of zzso zzso and combined it with a zzso random field zzso approach, which is a special type of conditional random fields zzso and has been proved useful for the purpose of zzso distinguishing areas from a photograph in the image processing zzso Recently, the evolutionary correlation of interactions between zzso and DNA bases has also been found in certain zzso factors and the zzso zzso 

In this paper, we employ more generic two-dimensional zzso than such zzso to predict interactions between protein zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we introduce labels representing kinds of zzso acids and bases as local features of a zzso Furthermore, we examine the utility of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso For evaluation of our method, we use zzso interactions between several zzso zzso and zzso entries, conduct zzso and calculate the average zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that our zzso method using mutual information and labels with the lasso is useful for further improving the performance, especially provided that the features of zzso are successfully reduced by the lasso zzso 

We propose simple and generic two-dimensional zzso models using labels and mutual information with the zzso Use of the zzso method in combination with the lasso is particularly useful for predicting the zzso contacts in zzso zzso
