A neutral and basic zzso acid zzso zzso cloned from rat kidney was recently localized to zzso cells and enteric zzso We used an zzso directed against a synthetic zzso representing a putative zzso domain of zzso to determine whether this zzso was also present in other zzso and neural zzso including rat adrenal zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso highly zzso labeling for zzso was observed in the zzso of zzso and zzso cells in the adrenal zzso A small population of intensely labeled zzso processes was also seen in both the zzso and the zzso of the adrenal zzso More numerous, intensely labeled zzso processes were detected in zzso and spinal zzso zzso including the locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the solitary zzso zzso motor nucleus of the zzso and zzso cell column of the zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso labeling for zzso was only detected in zzso and spinal zzso following zzso zzso treatment, which increased the number, distribution, and intensity of zzso zzso These zzso zzso were most numerous in the locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the solitary zzso and zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso of the solitary tract of normal rats showed that zzso was localized predominantly to zzso zzso Within these labeled zzso zzso was associated with large dense core zzso and discrete segments of plasma zzso The observed zzso of zzso suggests that this zzso specific zzso acid zzso zzso a role as a zzso or zzso zzso in zzso cells, including zzso cells and zzso zzso
