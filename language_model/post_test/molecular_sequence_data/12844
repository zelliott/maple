zzso zzso have been identified that are consistently associated with zzso zzso and Ewing's zzso zzso diagnostic zzso for these zzso zzso are important tools for the differential diagnosis of pediatric small round cell tumors presenting in the bones or soft zzso However, the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso in these zzso has complicated these molecular diagnostic zzso To simplify the molecular detection of typical and zzso zzso the authors have developed an approach consisting of consensus reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso In the first step, consensus zzso for each tumor type permit amplification of the zzso transcripts resulting from both the common and zzso zzso In the second step, the common and zzso zzso are distinguished by zzso with zzso zzso zzso This approach provides a sensitive, specific, and efficient strategy for the detection of these zzso zzso
