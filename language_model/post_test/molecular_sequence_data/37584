zzso zzso zzso produces multiple zzso zzso the zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, and zzso In this study, we zzso and characterized the zzso 5 of zzso zzso zzso and amplified a part of zzso 5 gene zzso The zzso zzso 5 was found to be a single zzso with molecular mass of 140 zzso It was an zzso showing optimum temperature 40 degrees C and optimum pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small amount of zzso were detected as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence and several internal zzso acid sequences of zzso 5 were zzso From the zzso a zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso using forward and reverse zzso DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of zzso sequences corresponding to the zzso zzso acid sequence and the internal zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso
