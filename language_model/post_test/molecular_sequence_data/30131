The zzso with respect to the plane of the membrane of zzso in the internal sequence zzso and of zzso in the zzso sequence zzso of the zzso of sodium and zzso zzso activated zzso have been zzso These zzso are found in peptides released from the intact zzso by the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and by zzso zzso zzso peptides containing terminal sequences of these were used to prepare zzso zzso which were then used to prepare zzso directed against the respective zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso containing native zzso + zzso were labeled with zzso zzso and sodium zzso in the absence or presence of zzso The labeled zzso was isolated from these zzso and zzso with appropriate zzso The incorporation of zzso into the peptides binding to the zzso directed against the sequence zzso increased zzso in the presence of zzso as a result of the increased accessibility of this portion of the protein to the zzso when the zzso were breached by zzso zzso this sequence is located on the zzso face of the zzso It was zzso that the zzso sequence zzso is on the zzso face since the incorporation of zzso into peptides binding to the zzso directed against the sequence zzso did not change when the zzso were breached with zzso
