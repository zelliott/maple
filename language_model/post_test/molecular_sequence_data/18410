We have studied the zzso and helper T cell responses in mice to a malaria zzso vaccine candidate currently undergoing human zzso Following zzso of B10 zzso mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso draining zzso zzso cells were challenged in zzso with a series of overlapping synthetic peptides which span the zzso Surprisingly, only a single zzso from the protein was zzso in that it could zzso elicit a significant zzso response from the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is also the repetitive zzso B cell zzso of the zzso However, zzso of mice with synthetic peptides revealed at least 3 cryptic zzso zzso not revealed by protein zzso of which represent zzso regions of the zzso While cryptic zzso did not elicit zzso zzso T cells, it did reveal zzso helper T cells, as shown by an in zzso zzso Identification of zzso zzso not only for malaria but for other infectious diseases may aid vaccine design, especially in situations where zzso vaccines are zzso
