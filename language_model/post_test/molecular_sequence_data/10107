zzso syndrome zzso caused by zzso represents one of the most frequently observed human zzso zzso We have identified three copies of a zzso repeat zzso located within and zzso the zzso common deletion region and show that zzso represents a repeated gene zzso We have isolated a corresponding zzso clone that identifies a novel junction zzso from 29 unrelated zzso patients and a zzso junction zzso from a patient with zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of a zzso repeat gene cluster is a mechanism for this common zzso zzso
