The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a family of seven type III zzso system zzso zzso that contain both a zzso repeat and an zzso zzso This structure is reminiscent of a class of typical zzso proteins called zzso zzso The latter, together with zzso and zzso zzso constitute the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and control specific protein zzso In the zzso cell, depending on the nature of the zzso chain, the zzso proteins either see their properties modified or are doomed for degradation by the zzso zzso This zzso is essential to many zzso processes in plants, ranging from hormone signaling and flower development to stress zzso Here, we show that these previously zzso zzso zzso are putative bacterial zzso proteins capable of interacting with a subset of the 19 different zzso zzso proteins like bona fide zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain in which all of the seven zzso zzso genes have been deleted or zzso was no longer zzso on zzso and less virulent on zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso is a zzso factor, required for disease on zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso are essential to zzso zzso to control zzso Because the zzso domain is essential to the zzso function of zzso we zzso that these zzso act by zzso their host zzso zzso zzso zzso to interfere with their host zzso zzso to promote zzso
