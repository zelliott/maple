Human influenza is primarily an infection of the upper respiratory tract and central zzso The zzso zzso system appears to have a role in limiting viral spread and initiating recovery before the development of zzso and zzso responses in primary zzso All cellular responses to zzso result from interaction with cell surface receptors that trigger the expression of a number of cellular zzso Among the zzso gene products, the zzso proteins have attracted much attention because they have potential activity against influenza virus and possibly against other zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso proteins with intrinsic zzso zzso They seem to act indirectly against viruses by zzso cellular functions needed along the viral replication zzso In mice the zzso protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to protect against influenza virus infection because the resistance does not require a functioning immune zzso In humans the zzso protein has zzso activities against influenza zzso The zzso protein is zzso on the zzso part of the long arm of zzso 21 together with several other proteins implicated in the zzso zzso Patients with zzso syndrome zzso zzso have an increased expression of zzso zzso and their cells display an increased sensitivity to zzso in zzso because of gene dosage zzso These patients, however, are more susceptible to upper respiratory infection than normal zzso This zzso has been related to deficiencies in the immune zzso zzso induction of zzso in man does not zzso sufficient to prevent influenza zzso and, in contrast to the zzso zzso system, a functioning immune system is necessary for zzso
