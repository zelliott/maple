A common theme in medical zzso is that the amount of zzso acid sequence variation in proteins that are targets of the host immune system greatly exceeds that found in zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis genes coding for targets of the host immune system were zzso in 16 strains representing the breadth of zzso diversity in the zzso Of the 24 zzso 19 were zzso and only six zzso zzso sites were identified in the 5 genes that did have zzso The results document the highly unusual circumstance that prominent zzso tuberculosis zzso proteins have negligible structural variation zzso The data are best explained by a combination of three factors: zzso zzso recent global dissemination in humans, zzso lengthy zzso zzso and zzso active replication in relatively few fully zzso zzso The very low level of zzso acid diversity in zzso proteins may be cause for optimism in the difficult fight to control global zzso
