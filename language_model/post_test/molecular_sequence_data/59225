A growing number of cellular regulatory mechanisms are being linked to protein modification by the zzso zzso These include key transitions in the cell cycle, class I zzso processing, signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso In most, but not all, of these examples, zzso of a protein leads to its degradation by the zzso zzso Following attachment of zzso to a zzso and binding of the zzso protein to the zzso the bound zzso must be unfolded (and eventually zzso and zzso through a narrow set of channels that leads to the zzso interior, where the zzso is zzso into short zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso by large zzso families, and the zzso itself comprises a family of related but functionally distinct zzso This diversity zzso both the high zzso specificity of the zzso system and the variety of regulatory mechanisms that it zzso
