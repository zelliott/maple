The signal sequence trap technique was applied to identify genes coding for zzso and membrane bound proteins from zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso library was constructed in the zzso zzso such that randomly primed zzso were fused with a zzso alkaline zzso reporter gene lacking its zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a functional signal zzso were selected by their ability to rescue zzso of alkaline zzso by zzso cells that had been zzso with the zzso zzso zzso positive clones were identified and zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences showed significant similarity with zzso acid zzso zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso proteins without zzso Three sequences were transcribed zzso to zzso zzso expressed sequence zzso All the zzso were expressed in zzso and adult zzso but some of them were not found in zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso and membrane bound proteins identified are likely to play important roles in the zzso development and survival in the host and represent potential targets for diagnosis, drugs and vaccines against zzso zzso
