We have isolated a member of the zzso gene family in zzso as a means to determine the role of zzso genes in zzso zzso The zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library, exhibits a zzso zzso domain most similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a single copy gene but there is at least one other related zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells beginning during the late zzso zzso During zzso zzso expression occurs in the prospective zzso cells, which zzso at the vegetal pole, and in the zzso zzso and zzso cells, which zzso over the anterior and lateral lips of the zzso zzso However, this gene is not expressed in the zzso muscle cells, which zzso over the zzso lip of the zzso zzso expression continues in the same cell lineages during zzso and axis formation, however, during the zzso stage, zzso is also expressed in zzso cells of the brain and spinal zzso The functional role of the zzso gene was studied using zzso zzso zzso which zzso reduce zzso transcript levels during zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso cleave normally and initiate zzso However, zzso is incomplete, some of the zzso and zzso cells do not enter the zzso and undergo subsequent movements, and axis formation is zzso In contrast, the prospective muscle cells, which do not express zzso undergo zzso and later express muscle zzso and zzso markers of muscle cell zzso The results suggest that zzso is required for zzso movements of the zzso and zzso precursor cells during zzso and axis zzso The effects of zzso zzso expression on embryonic axis formation in zzso are similar to those reported for knockout zzso of zzso in the zzso suggesting that zzso genes have an ancient and fundamental role in organizing the body plan in zzso
