The ice nucleation protein zzso of zzso zzso has gained scientific interest not only because of its zzso of zzso zzso but also for its wide range of potential applications, such as in snow making, frozen food preparation, and zzso system zzso However, studies on the transport activity of zzso remain zzso In the present study, a newly identified zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso strain was zzso Its structural zzso signal zzso and the zzso or zzso of each domain, were then zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shares similar protein zzso with three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were identified as an zzso domain, a central repeating domain, and a zzso zzso The expression of the full-length zzso and of various truncated zzso was induced in zzso coli to analyze their zzso transport and zzso activities, while using the green zzso protein zzso as the fusion zzso With two zzso segments and a weak zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso alone was found to be responsible for the transport process as well as for the binding to the outer zzso whereas the zzso region was zzso in protein zzso Increased membrane transport and zzso capacities were induced by a low zzso concentration zzso zzso but not by culture temperatures (15 zzso to 37 zzso Furthermore, by constructing the zzso proteins with a single zzso as well as two and three zzso aligned zzso zzso the transport and zzso activities of these proteins were compared using Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso specific zzso intensity of zzso zzso and flow zzso which showed that the increase of zzso repeats resulted in a coordinated increase of the zzso zzso zzso the results of this study can serve as a molecular basis for improving the performance of zzso cell zzso zzso
