Growth zzso due to continuous cropping of asparagus is a major problem; the yield of asparagus in zzso fields is low compared to that in new fields, and missing plants occur among young zzso Although zzso disease and zzso are considered to be involved in this effect, this is still zzso We aimed to develop a technique for the biological field diagnosis of growth zzso due to continuous zzso zzso in this study, zzso community structure and zzso community structure in continuously cropped fields of asparagus were analyzed by zzso chain zzso gel zzso zzso zzso samples were collected from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were taken from both continuously cropped fields of asparagus with growth zzso and healthy neighboring fields of zzso The soil samples were collected from the fields of 5 sets in 2008 and 4 sets in zzso We were able to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso by using zzso and zzso as the second zzso zzso and zzso zzso community structure was not greatly involved in the growth zzso of asparagus due to continuous zzso By contrast, the band ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso fields were higher than those in neighboring healthy zzso In addition, there was a positive correlation between the band ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ratios of missing asparagus zzso We showed the potential of biological field diagnosis of growth zzso due to continuous cropping of asparagus using zzso
