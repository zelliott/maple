zzso zzso constitute a family of zzso interaction zzso that bind to peptides displaying an zzso zzso zzso We report that the zzso domain of zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso displays a novel and unique binding zzso By a combination of approaches including zzso screening of zzso random zzso libraries, zzso mapping of the binding regions on three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso scanning of binding peptides and zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrate that a zzso zzso consensus is indispensable for binding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso database allowed the identification of three zzso zzso whose zzso also display unusual binding preferences and constitute a zzso distinct zzso within the zzso zzso Thus, zzso identifies a novel family of zzso proteins that do not bind to zzso zzso zzso and that establish distinct interactions in the signaling zzso
