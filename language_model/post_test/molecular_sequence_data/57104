zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso This reaction is part of the zzso pathways for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso from a zzso that degrades zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a molecular weight of about zzso and is composed of identical zzso with a molecular weight of about zzso Thus the zzso appears to exist as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence did not show significant zzso to other published zzso acid zzso zzso loss of zzso activity occurred when the zzso was incubated with zzso in the presence of sodium zzso This suggested the intermediate formation of a stable Schiff base between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and by the reaction product zzso The zzso converted zzso zzso and zzso
