We performed the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso of a new zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was found in a case of zzso zzso occurring in human alpha heavy chain zzso A rearranged alpha 1 gene zzso was cloned and shown to contain zzso 9 information by Southern zzso on sorted zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the junction point region established that the breakage occurred 3' to the heavy chain joining zzso In contrast to the data obtained in other zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso the zzso did not involve the zzso heavy chain locus specific zzso signals on zzso 14, or zzso sequences on zzso zzso In the present case, the existence of two almost perfect zzso repeats zzso the junction point suggests that the zzso originated from a local pairing of the two zzso 9 and zzso zzso 9 fragments zzso in the vicinity of the zzso did not share significant zzso with sequences listed in zzso and zzso data zzso
