zzso in the family zzso are the zzso zzso zzso in a variety of subsurface environments in which zzso reduction is an important process, but little is known about the mechanisms for electron transport to zzso in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to contain a zzso zzso zzso consisting of two tandem zzso zzso The last genes of the two zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso putative outer membrane zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso The role of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso reduction in zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were both expressed during growth with zzso as the electron donor and either zzso or zzso as the electron zzso zzso was zzso twofold more abundant under both zzso zzso zzso or zzso by gene replacement had no impact on growth with zzso However, the zzso zzso was greatly impaired in its ability to reduce zzso both in cell suspensions and under growth zzso In contrast, the ability of the zzso zzso to reduce zzso was similar to that of the wild zzso When zzso was reintroduced into the zzso zzso the capacity for zzso reduction was restored in proportion to the level of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso but not zzso has a major role in electron transport to zzso and suggest that electron transport to the outer membrane is an important feature in zzso reduction in this zzso
