zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in high zzso in zzso In zzso zzso 2 zzso were found to zzso zzso The first zzso zzso codes a total of 149 zzso acids with a calculated mass of zzso zzso The second, zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with a calculated mass of zzso zzso The predicted secondary structures showed the presence of 8 zzso which is the basic characteristic of zzso zzso alignment revealed a high zzso with the other zzso zzso The 2 clones contained the characteristic zzso zzso at zzso positions B10 and zzso zzso which are zzso that have been previously shown to contribute to the high oxygen affinity of zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso were raised with no zzso zzso zzso revealed the proteins to be distributed generally throughout the zzso zzso but absent from the zzso and zzso zzso The cell mass of the eggs of the zzso stained positive to zzso but not zzso suggesting the zzso expression of these zzso
