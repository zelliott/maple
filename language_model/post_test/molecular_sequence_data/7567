zzso diabetes zzso zzso is most often an zzso disorder in which urine is not concentrated due to zzso resistance to zzso zzso We recently identified four zzso type 2 zzso gene zzso in unrelated zzso zzso families, including zzso delta zzso zzso and zzso All these zzso reduced zzso binding activity to zzso zzso of the normal without affecting zzso zzso To zzso whether the receptors are expressed on the cell surface, we analyzed zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso receptors zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, using two zzso directed against distinct zzso zzso and surface labeling studies revealed that the zzso clone had both zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins (40 and 75 zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso and delta zzso clones lacked the surface zzso despite relatively increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell produced no proteins despite an adequate zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso reaches the cell surface, whereas the zzso and delta zzso zzso are retained within the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso result in three distinct zzso that is, a simple binding impairment at the cell surface, blocked zzso zzso and ineffective zzso zzso accelerated degradation of the zzso respectively, and therefore are responsible for zzso This zzso zzso will help understanding of molecular zzso of this zzso
