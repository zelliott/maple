Alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a highly regulated process that allows expansion of the potential of expression of the zzso in higher zzso and involves many zzso Among them, the family of the zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso plays a pivotal zzso it has essential functions during zzso assembly and also interacts with zzso regulatory sequences on the zzso as well as with multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso because of their capacity to recognize multiple zzso sequences with a broad zzso are at the heart of the regulation pathways that lead to the choice of alternative zzso zzso Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that the mechanisms of zzso regulation are not limited to the basic involvement of zzso and zzso factors at the zzso level, but result from intricate zzso initiated sometimes by stimuli that are external to the cell and integrate zzso proteins (and other zzso within an extremely sophisticated network of molecular machines associated with one zzso This review focuses on the molecular aspects of the functions of zzso zzso In particular, we discuss the different ways in which zzso proteins manage to achieve a high level of specificity in zzso regulation, even though they are also involved in the zzso zzso
