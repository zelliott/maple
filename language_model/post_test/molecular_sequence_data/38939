The zzso zzso zzso is essentially a female that produces zzso In zzso zzso zzso promotes female fates and must be zzso to achieve zzso zzso In an effort to learn how mating systems evolve, we have cloned zzso from zzso zzso the closest zzso relative of zzso zzso We found its structure to be similar to that of zzso but its sequence to be zzso zzso interference demonstrates that zzso promotes female zzso Two sites of zzso regulation are required for the onset of zzso zzso in zzso zzso One, the zzso region of zzso is as well zzso in zzso zzso as it is in zzso zzso (another zzso zzso suggesting that this control is not unique to zzso Another, the zzso element of the zzso 3' zzso was not detected by sequence zzso However, zzso zzso demonstrate that a factor in zzso zzso can bind specifically to the zzso 3' zzso suggesting that this zzso control is also zzso We propose that both controls are general and do not constitute a novel zzso that enables sexual zzso in zzso However, subtle quantitative or qualitative differences in their employment may zzso differences in mating system seen in zzso
