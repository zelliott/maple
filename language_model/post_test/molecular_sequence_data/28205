A zzso zzso factor zzso of human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso functions as an zzso for expression of zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso in the long terminal repeat of zzso In addition to zzso and a tumor promoter zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, we report here that zzso an zzso of zzso zzso also zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was not zzso by solely a zzso zzso sequence that is repeated three times in the zzso whereas the zzso zzso element can act as a sufficient zzso sequence for zzso by both zzso and zzso In addition, we found that nuclear zzso like the zzso zzso element zzso binding factor could bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a difference was found in sequences required for zzso by zzso and zzso A zzso related sequence present in the zzso zzso element was enough for zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso required a much longer sequence that is overlapping but not identical to the zzso related zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be partly involved in, but not sufficient for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
