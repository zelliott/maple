We previously reported the characterization of a rabbit zzso zzso clone zzso which zzso part of the light zzso of smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso We have now characterized a second zzso clone zzso which also encodes part of the light zzso but differs from zzso in the following zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrates that the two zzso heavy chain zzso are identical over zzso zzso but differ in part of the zzso coding region and a portion of the zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso encodes a unique stretch of 43 zzso acids at the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso contains a shorter zzso zzso of 9 unique zzso acids which is the result of a zzso zzso Recent zzso mapping of smooth muscle zzso heavy chain identified two zzso with differences in the light zzso zzso that were designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso and Murphy, zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso In this study we present direct evidence that zzso and zzso zzso zzso the two smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso analysis using zzso against specific zzso zzso sequences deduced from zzso and zzso zzso zzso
