zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso inhibit the zzso and biological activities of the zzso while peptides from the zzso region do not affect either zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso protein synthesis caused by zzso coincidentally with its zzso of zzso zzso Several zzso peptides also inhibit zzso activity of zzso when zzso is the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso significantly decreases zzso zzso by zzso in the chick zzso membrane zzso
