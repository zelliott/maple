In zzso brain, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso respectively, from the two zzso which have been transcribed and processed by alternative use of the two zzso start points and by differential zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso chicken zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were isolated, and the zzso acid sequences of chicken zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis showed that chicken brain contains a major zzso protein together with a minor unidentified zzso and zzso brain contains only a zzso zzso All available zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso were aligned and zzso Three zzso motif sequences were noted: zzso an zzso site near the zzso zzso zzso an zzso site at the zzso zzso and zzso a probable zzso site resembling the active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso The second and the third motifs are zzso also in goldfish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been shown recently to have zzso zzso zzso The third motif (probably zzso zzso was assigned for the first time in the present zzso
