The heart contains proteins of the zzso family, a unique group of calcium binding zzso This study was aimed at identifying the major cardiac zzso and determining their distribution in the rat zzso 

zzso were isolated by affinity zzso and zzso by zzso exchange high pressure liquid zzso Identification of isolated proteins by zzso was confirmed by partial zzso acid sequence zzso zzso raised against the isolated proteins were used for zzso by the zzso zzso 

Two zzso were isolated and zzso zzso acid sequencing confirmed their identities as zzso V and zzso zzso showed that both zzso were present in cardiac zzso and zzso but a distinct pattern of distribution was seen for each zzso zzso V zzso was enhanced in the zzso compared with the zzso whereas zzso VI was more zzso zzso In individual cardiac zzso zzso V was distributed throughout the cell by contrast with zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso discs displayed zzso for both zzso most prominently for zzso zzso The most striking zzso for zzso V occurred in vascular zzso cells, both in the zzso and in the major coronary zzso zzso for zzso VI in vascular structures was zzso to the zzso of zzso and smooth muscle zzso 

zzso V and VI are the major cardiac zzso The zzso of these zzso to different components of cardiac zzso will serve to direct the search for their functions in the zzso The striking zzso for zzso particularly zzso zzso in the coronary vessels indicates that the functions of cardiac zzso include a role in the coronary circulatory zzso
