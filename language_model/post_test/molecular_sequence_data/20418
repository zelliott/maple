Type II DNA zzso are essential, ubiquitous zzso responsible for performing vital functions in zzso zzso and segregation and in regulating zzso DNA zzso zzso II zzso zzso performs these DNA transactions by passing one segment of DNA through the other using a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso This zzso of the DNA backbone is coupled to the opening and closing of the DNA gate, a critical step for strand passage during the zzso zzso To monitor the opening and closing of the DNA gate, we designed an zzso zzso with a pair of zzso zzso the zzso II zzso site, such that the zzso undergo efficient zzso resonance energy transfer zzso in the intact DNA zzso but the zzso efficiency decreases as zzso II opens the DNA zzso Here we present a method for creating the DNA zzso and using it as a tool to monitor the zzso changes at the zzso II DNA zzso We detail how to collect and process zzso zzso to determine the zzso efficiency of the DNA zzso
