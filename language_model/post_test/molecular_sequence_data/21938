The present study was performed to evaluate the expression and function of zzso zzso zzso the zzso resistance type I zzso zzso protecting from zzso in zzso zzso during in zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso were cultured to obtain the zzso zzso zzso first zzso and second zzso zzso zzso The zzso function was assessed by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso with zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The zzso transcript was detected in the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso analysis using primer sets based on the human zzso zzso zzso significantly blocked the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso whereas the zzso were ineffective in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso was accelerated at the zzso stage more than at the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso function is poor at the zzso stage, but the function improves during zzso zzso
