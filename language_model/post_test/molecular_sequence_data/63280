Enteric zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for the majority of zzso zzso in humans of all age zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso genes has provided evidence for a huge genetic diversity, but the understanding of their ecology is zzso In this study, we investigated the presence of zzso enteric zzso in the zzso of zzso with zzso A total of 209 samples from 118 zzso were zzso and zzso zzso was detected by zzso in 68 sample zzso and in 46 zzso zzso alone or in mixed infection with group A and C zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso samples characterized the majority as zzso III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related to the representatives of the other zzso zzso were identified in five zzso while one outbreak was associated with a zzso zzso related genetically to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso strains were not zzso Altogether, these data suggest the zzso relevance of zzso enteric zzso and suggest a role in the zzso of zzso zzso
