Human zzso 8 was expressed in zzso zzso and found to accumulate zzso in an zzso zzso The protein could be zzso and converted to a biologically active form with high yield by a zzso zzso The zzso 8 was further zzso to apparent zzso by zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso and fully characterized by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis, mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso predictions from CD zzso indicate that the zzso is correctly zzso zzso mapping supported the correct sequence and the expected zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso on zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso as two zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso sequence analysis of the minor component indicated the existence of an zzso zzso group for the later zzso zzso In zzso zzso the two zzso forms were equally zzso zzso zzso of this zzso preparation could be zzso On the basis of the zzso mobility, zzso profile, and biological activity zzso the zzso material was judged to be identical to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso form was found to be stable for up to 24 months and, therefore, could be used for long-term storage, particularly for material intended for clinical zzso
