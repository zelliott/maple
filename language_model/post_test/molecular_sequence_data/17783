zzso binding protein is a complex zzso zzso three zzso zzso C2 and zzso organized into two different zzso zzso and zzso The rat zzso prostate genes zzso all three constituent zzso are expressed under zzso zzso Analysis of zzso fragments containing the genes and zzso sequences revealed in each case one zzso zzso region upstream of or within the promoter and another in the first zzso The effect of zzso on the expression of these genes may, therefore, be zzso by these direct zzso zzso The zzso fragments which contain zzso zzso regions all contain zzso sequences reminiscent of zzso response elements zzso zzso in these sequences in restriction fragments and in synthetic zzso significantly decreased their affinity for zzso complexes and their introduction into zzso sequences zzso affinity for zzso zzso Based on these data, a consensus sequence for putative zzso response elements zzso is zzso However, despite the specific recognition of these sequences by the zzso zzso in zzso only the zzso zzso zzso could zzso significant zzso responsiveness on a zzso zzso While this could be due to the fact that the zzso sequences present in the other fragments are not strong zzso alternative hypotheses are being investigated zzso Not least of these is that the similar zzso of the binding sites in each gene might zzso a more complex zzso regulation zzso
