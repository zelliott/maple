A hybrid zzso zzso zzso was assembled from two protein zzso that were treated as discrete zzso One module contained the zzso binding domain from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the second module contained the zzso machinery and the zzso zzso binding domain from the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but had a zzso transfer efficiency of zzso A zzso zzso approach was used to improve the zzso and zzso transfer properties of the hybrid zzso The zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso was initially expressed as a fusion to the zzso of zzso zzso were selected for improvement in zzso by determining which clones were capable of zzso using a zzso zzso One clone was further characterized and found to have an improved efficiency of transfer of the zzso increasing this property to zzso
