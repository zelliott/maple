A zzso clone zzso a precursor of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso skin was recently isolated and zzso in our zzso In this study, by using the restriction zzso of this clone as a zzso probe, we have identified the zzso zzso another new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso distinct from zzso The zzso encodes a zzso of 875 zzso acid zzso which contains a region extensively zzso to zzso precursor at zzso The zzso protein characteristically has a putative zzso domain near zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso formation of peptides in zzso skin is regulated by at least two distinct zzso zzso
