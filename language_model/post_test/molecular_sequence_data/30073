zzso factors can be divided into classes on the basis of their mode of interaction with the target promoter zzso Different protein zzso responsible for DNA recognition have been zzso In this review we discuss the zzso zzso structure, which has been found in several nuclear factors, including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso considerations are summarized to help understand how zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso and how this is the prerequisite for optimal target DNA recognition by the adjacent basic zzso
