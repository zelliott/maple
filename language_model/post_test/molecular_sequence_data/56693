The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso also called zzso can undergo considerable zzso changes upon binding to the A and B blocks of zzso zzso After binding to DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as an assembly factor to recruit an initiation factor, zzso via its zzso 131 zzso We have cloned the gene zzso the zzso 131 zzso and named it zzso This gene is unique, essential for cell zzso and encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated the presence of a single zzso 131 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 131 contains two sequence zzso accounting for nearly one-half of the protein mass, that may provide a molecular explanation for the properties of zzso zzso A series of 11 copies of the zzso repeat motif may account for the flexibility and interaction properties of zzso A motif akin to the basic zzso motif of zzso suggests the direct involvement of zzso 131 in promoting DNA binding of zzso
