zzso I zzso is an abundant plasma zzso protein and an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells targets them for zzso by zzso zzso which circulate and are associated with zzso in patients with the zzso zzso zzso However, the binding of zzso to zzso cells has not been characterized and is assumed to result from association of zzso with membrane zzso Here, we characterize the binding of zzso to zzso cells and identify the zzso binding zzso zzso bound with high affinity zzso approximately 18 zzso to human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Using affinity zzso we isolated zzso proteins of approximately 78 and approximately 36 zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides from each of these were identical to sequences within zzso zzso A role for zzso II in binding of zzso to cells was confirmed by the observations that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells bound approximately zzso more zzso than control cells and that zzso II zzso inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso by approximately zzso Finally, surface zzso resonance studies revealed high affinity binding between zzso II and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso II mediates the binding of zzso to zzso zzso
