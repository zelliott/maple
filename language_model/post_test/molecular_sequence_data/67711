Yellow seed is a desirable quality trait of the zzso zzso zzso Previously, several seed coat color genes have been mapped in the zzso species, but the molecular mechanism is still zzso In the present investigation, zzso cloning method was used to identify a seed coat color zzso located on A9 in zzso zzso zzso analysis with the zzso zzso showed that there were 22 zzso genes in this region including zzso to zzso zzso zzso test exhibited a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that the candidate gene was a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated the zzso of zzso zzso in the seed zzso zzso analysis of two zzso revealed a large zzso of a new class of zzso zzso zzso in yellow zzso In addition, no zzso expression of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso It indicated that the natural zzso might have caused the loss in function of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that shares a high degree of similarity with other zzso proteins in the zzso Further expression analysis also revealed that zzso was involved in controlling the late zzso genes zzso of the zzso zzso Our present findings provided with further studies could assist in understanding the molecular mechanism involved in seed coat color formation in zzso species, which is an important oil yielding quality zzso
