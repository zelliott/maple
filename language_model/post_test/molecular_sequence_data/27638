The major zzso components were isolated from the seeds of the zzso species zzso zzso a putative source of zzso wheat zzso The isolation procedure included zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso proteins were characterized by zzso mobility in zzso gel using acid zzso system and a system containing sodium zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of isolated zzso was zzso Using zzso zzso on zzso zzso it was found that zzso of zzso zzso contain no zzso and/or zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso were found to contain three types of zzso zzso acid zzso one of which, zzso in zzso wheat is zzso by zzso zzso It was shown that some zzso of zzso zzso have blocked zzso zzso zzso The major component of the zzso was found to contain an zzso sequence of gamma 2 type zzso in zzso wheat by zzso zzso zzso with zzso mobility in the zzso of the spectrum possess the zzso sequence of zzso The results obtained are discussed in terms of the origin of zzso wheat zzso
