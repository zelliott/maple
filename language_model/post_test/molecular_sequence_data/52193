A systematic structural comparison of several carp zzso with high zzso contents was made by the zzso prediction together with computer zzso based on the established X-ray structure of calf zzso zzso The overall surface zzso profile and the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso chains are very similar among these carp zzso In addition, their general zzso packing is close to the characteristic 2 zzso motif Greek key three-dimensional zzso depicted for the calf zzso zzso Interestingly, most zzso zzso zzso are located on the protein surface with only a few buried inside the protein surface or in the interface between two motifs of each zzso The exposed zzso and zzso zzso cluster on the protein surface may have a bearing on the zzso stability and dense packing in the zzso species, and probably also provides a malleable zzso surface for the interaction with other zzso components for the maintenance of a clear and transparent zzso
