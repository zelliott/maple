zzso zzso and growth differentiation zzso zzso are closely related proteins involved in muscle cell growth and differentiation as well as zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso regulate their zzso zzso possess a single zzso of the zzso zzso In order to understand the role of zzso in zzso the gene zzso was identified and characterized in the zzso shrimp zzso zzso The overall protein sequence and specific functional sites were highly zzso with other members of the zzso zzso Gene transcripts of zzso assessed by real-time zzso were detected in a variety of tissue types and were actively regulated in muscle across the zzso zzso To assess zzso function in shrimp, zzso gene expression was zzso by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso Shrimp with reduced levels of zzso transcripts displayed a dramatic slowing in growth rate compared with control zzso zzso from this study place the zzso gene at the zzso of growth regulation in shrimp, but suggest that, compared with higher zzso this gene has an opposite role in zzso such as shrimp, where levels of gene expression may positively regulate zzso
