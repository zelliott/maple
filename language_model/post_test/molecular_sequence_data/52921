A gene zzso the zzso zzso in zzso strain zzso has been zzso zzso and expressed in an active zzso A zzso zzso product generated using zzso designed from zzso acid sequence data was used to isolate a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso A zzso open reading frame zzso the zzso zzso was identified, and the deduced zzso protein minus its signal sequence corresponded well with the published mass of 58 zzso estimated by zzso gel zzso The zzso sequence showed zzso to zzso and zzso with different zzso zzso from the zzso of other zzso No zzso activity could be detected when the zzso gene was cloned into zzso coli expression zzso However, cloning the gene into a zzso expression zzso did produce active zzso This is the first zzso zzso to be zzso and zzso A second open reading frame zzso zzso was identified immediately upstream from the zzso zzso coding in the opposite zzso Its sequence has close zzso to zzso proteins that zzso modify other zzso By zzso this protein is predicted to catalyze the modification of a zzso group to a zzso group at the active center of the zzso zzso which is necessary for zzso zzso
