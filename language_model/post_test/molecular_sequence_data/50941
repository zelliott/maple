In past years, most of the X-ray structure zzso of zzso were for zzso peptides or for short linear zzso zzso peptides usually presented many difficulties in obtaining suitable zzso since the molecules are zzso very zzso More recently, it has been appreciated that the zzso acid zzso zzso which occurs naturally in many peptides of microbial origin, zzso zzso zzso Several score of 7- to zzso linear peptides containing zzso have been zzso zzso and had their structures determined to high zzso Many of the zzso structures have been determined in more than one zzso zzso These zzso structures have yielded a plethora of information on types of zzso modes of zzso water penetration into zzso zzso zzso bent by Pro zzso parallel and zzso association of zzso effects of zzso zzso on association of zzso an example of a zzso assembly by side zzso and an example of a possible zzso channel with a gating zzso
