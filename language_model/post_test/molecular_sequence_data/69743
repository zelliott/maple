We have determined the zzso of an analogue of the zzso coli zzso signal zzso inserted into a model membrane using the transferred nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso In order to make zzso analysis zzso a zzso zzso signal zzso analogue was designed by inserting three basic zzso zzso into the zzso region of the zzso sequence (with a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso For the purpose of the zzso study, the binding affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso was tuned by adjusting the proportion of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso signal zzso spontaneously inserted into the zzso zzso with a zzso transition from a mostly random zzso to a predominantly zzso zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the zzso extended from approximately the beginning of the zzso core zzso zzso to the zzso The continuity of the zzso was somewhat disrupted at the end of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso arrangement of the zzso within the zzso zzso was explored by zzso line broadening induced by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso results demonstrated that the zzso in the zzso region are well integrated into the zzso chain region of the zzso The zzso part of the zzso showed many zzso but without any indication of a zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicates that this part of the zzso primarily interacts with the membrane zzso
