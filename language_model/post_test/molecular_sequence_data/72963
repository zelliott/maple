The zzso cell wall core consists of an outer zzso layer of zzso acids connected, via zzso zzso to an inner zzso zzso An zzso zzso has been shown to be a key component linking the zzso zzso to the zzso and, therefore, the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso was investigated as the first step of developing zzso of its zzso zzso zzso were used to show that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the same four zzso steps used by zzso coli and other zzso zzso zzso based on consensus regions of known sequences of the first zzso in this series, zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify zzso DNA from zzso zzso The entire zzso gene was then cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed a zzso Da putative protein product which showed similarity to zzso proteins of other bacteria zzso identity to that found in zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso the zzso gene did not reveal any of the other zzso genes required for zzso zzso zzso the four zzso zzso genes are not clustered in zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso gene product was confirmed by transformation of zzso coli with zzso zzso containing the zzso gene from zzso zzso Analysis of zzso extracts prepared from this zzso revealed an zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso
