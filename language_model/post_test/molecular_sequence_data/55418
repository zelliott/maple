The gene zzso a zzso from zzso zzso 71 was isolated, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso in zzso coli produced an zzso of 47 zzso with an optimum temperature of zzso The optimum pH of the zzso is zzso but it is active over a broad pH zzso This protein showed the highest sequence identity zzso with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain that belongs to the zzso zzso family 10 zzso zzso exhibited good pH stability, remaining stable after treatment with buffers ranging from pH zzso to zzso for 6 zzso Its activity was partially inhibited by zzso and zzso but strongly inhibited by zzso The zzso follows zzso zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso zzso The zzso was free from zzso activity and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The action of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso produced zzso and zzso
