We have identified zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two zzso affected by the zzso skin blistering disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, DNA sequencing and clinical and zzso analysis are combined to provide the first detailed description of classical zzso Both zzso show similar blistering on zzso indicating that both zzso compromise the structural resilience of the zzso zzso by affecting the zzso zzso The location of these zzso in the zzso zzso which bisects the zzso rod region of intermediate filament zzso identifies another zzso zzso cluster leading to zzso skin fragility zzso
