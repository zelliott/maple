A novel tumor necrosis factor zzso family member has been cloned and zzso This zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 281 and zzso zzso in the human and zzso forms, respectively, which share zzso zzso zzso TRAIL is a type II membrane zzso whose zzso zzso domain shows clear zzso to other zzso family zzso TRAIL transcripts are detected in a variety of human zzso most predominantly in zzso zzso and zzso The TRAIL gene is located on zzso 3 at position zzso which is not close to any other known zzso zzso family zzso Both full-length cell surface expressed TRAIL and zzso zzso of soluble TRAIL rapidly induce zzso in a wide variety of transformed cell lines of diverse zzso
