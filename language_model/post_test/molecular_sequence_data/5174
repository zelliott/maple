zzso zzso is commonly used to provide zzso help for small, linear peptides containing zzso zzso zzso However, carrier zzso is expensive, variable and often results in adverse side effects if the zzso is administered zzso To eliminate the need for carrier zzso we examined two synthetic peptides for their ability to elicit sustained zzso zzso in female rabbits and zzso One zzso zzso was based on the sequence of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso This zzso stimulates helper zzso zzso The other zzso zzso was a zzso between an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from zzso toxin which has been shown to bind to and stimulate many different major zzso complex zzso Both peptides were zzso in rabbits and zzso The zzso zzso consistently high zzso zzso and was zzso in zzso zzso female zzso When 14 zzso zzso zzso were zzso their fertility was reduced by zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso This zzso construct can be incorporated into zzso zzso which may provide long-term protection from pregnancy with a single zzso
