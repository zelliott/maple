A synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso site on the 84 k protein of bovine zzso was zzso zzso This synthetic zzso could be zzso by zzso and therefore possessed the zzso binding site present on the authentic zzso Further proof that this zzso zzso the authentic zzso zzso site was the specific reaction of zzso serum with the 84 k zzso The reaction of zzso serum with infectious virus neutralized zzso thereby supporting the biological importance of this zzso Another interesting characteristic of this zzso was its ability to bind to the zzso protein resulting in a zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (90 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 66, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 53, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 67, zzso zzso zzso proof of binding was provided by the fact that the increments in the zzso corresponded to the molecular weight of the synthetic zzso and that zzso serum specifically reacted with the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso could be eliminated by incubation with zzso thus further supporting the formation of a synthetic zzso zzso Due to the ability of the zzso to bind to zzso and to the zzso protein its biological activity was zzso It appeared that increasing zzso of the zzso reduced the rate of virus plaque formation, thereby suggesting that virus replication was zzso These results illustrate two features of this synthetic zzso which warrant further zzso zzso its capacity to mimic an zzso zzso site and, zzso its ability to complex tightly to another zzso In zzso experiments performed using a zzso model, animals zzso with zzso provided protection zzso to zzso zzso on the immune zzso against a virulent zzso The potential applications of this zzso in zzso diagnosis, therapy and synthetic peptides based vaccine is zzso
