zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found in a variety of proteins involved in the control of cellular signaling and zzso The possible zzso between zzso are not easily investigated, even though several cases of multiple zzso zzso have been studied zzso As a complement to direct structural methods, we have developed consolidated zzso and tested their binding to the zzso zzso zzso Consolidated zzso combine in the same zzso zzso sequences recognized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these are joined by zzso zzso Four types of zzso were chemically zzso representing all the possible relative zzso of zzso Their affinities were found to vary with binding portion zzso and zzso zzso Two of these types were shown to bind to both zzso and zzso dual zzso with high affinities and zzso showing increases of one order of zzso as compared to the most strongly bound zzso zzso These results suggest that the relative orientation of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is not zzso and this synthetic approach may be generally useful for determining the structures of zzso complexes and for developing zzso with high affinities and zzso
