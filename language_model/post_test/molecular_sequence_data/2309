Five regions of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso long terminal repeat zzso have been shown to be important in the zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso These include the negative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies in which zzso zzso was used showed that the three zzso sites in the zzso zzso were important in the in zzso zzso of this zzso However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso have been zzso To determine the role of zzso sites in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso in zzso these sites were subjected to zzso zzso both individually and in zzso The zzso were tested by zzso I zzso with both zzso affinity zzso zzso and partially zzso zzso extract and by zzso zzso zzso in both the presence and absence of the zzso zzso zzso of each zzso site resulted in minimal changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso of zzso sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of all three zzso sites resulted in a marked decrease in zzso zzso The latter zzso also greatly decreased zzso I protection over the zzso zzso and zzso regions when partially zzso zzso nuclear extract was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sites which converted them to consensus zzso zzso sites with the sequence zzso resulted in increased zzso gene expression compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso through its interaction with other zzso zzso is critical for in zzso zzso regulation of zzso
