zzso zzso are involved in multiple biological processes and are recruited to specific processes by designated J zzso zzso or J zzso To understand the evolution and functions of zzso zzso and J zzso we identified the zzso zzso J protein constituency using a combination of zzso and zzso database searches and individual protein import zzso We show that zzso zzso have at least 19 J zzso the highest number of confirmed J proteins for any zzso These 19 J proteins are classified into 11 zzso for which zzso and zzso only have zzso for one zzso green algae have an additional three zzso and all the other 7 zzso are specific to land zzso Each zzso also possesses a zzso novel motif that is likely used to interact with different client zzso Gene expression analyses indicate that most land zzso J proteins show highly variable expression in different zzso and are down regulated by low zzso These results show that zzso of zzso zzso in land plants is accompanied by more than doubling of the number of its J protein zzso through adding new J proteins with novel zzso not through zzso within existing zzso These new J proteins likely recruit zzso zzso to perform tissue specific functions related to zzso rather than to stress zzso
