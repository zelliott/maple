zzso probing zzso was used to identify zzso or zzso bacteria under zzso conditions in activated zzso A sludge sample obtained from wastewater treatment systems was incubated in a zzso batch reactor fed with synthetic wastewater containing zzso or zzso as the main carbon source and nitrate as the electron zzso We analyzed how growth of bacterial populations was zzso by zzso or methanol as the external carbon source in zzso zzso Most of the zzso or zzso bacteria identified by zzso have been known as zzso in wastewater treatment zzso When zzso was used as the carbon source, zzso zzso gene sequences retrieved from zzso DNA were closely related to the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso When methanol was used as the carbon source, zzso zzso gene sequences retrieved from zzso were affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso for clones retrieved from zzso showed that the diversity levels for zzso bacteria were considerably lower than those for zzso zzso Furthermore, we characterized zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso as functional marker genes for zzso communities in zzso or zzso populations and detected the zzso or zzso sequence related to that of some known pure cultures, such as zzso zzso and zzso However, most of the zzso or zzso sequences retrieved from zzso were clustered in some unidentified zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene clone libraries retrieved from zzso these unidentified zzso sequences might be identified by examining the zzso gene in candidates for true zzso zzso the families zzso zzso zzso and zzso
