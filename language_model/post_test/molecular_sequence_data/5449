In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play critical roles in establishing the basic embryonic body plan and are involved in the development of a large variety of zzso and zzso To study the evolution of zzso we isolated zzso for three members of the zzso zzso gene family: zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso consist of zzso and 400 zzso respectively and show high zzso to their counterparts in zzso chick and zzso The deduced zzso zzso sequence consists of 411 zzso and the mature protein shows zzso and zzso identities to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of the zzso of these three genes has been analyzed by whole mount in zzso zzso and zzso Areas of zzso zzso and zzso expression suggest evolutionary zzso mechanisms of zzso dependent differentiation between lower and higher zzso
