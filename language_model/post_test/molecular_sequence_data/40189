The structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a response regulator zzso in the zzso regulatory system from zzso zzso zzso was determined by a combination of X-ray zzso at a resolution of zzso A and zzso X-ray scattering zzso The boundary of the three component zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and the bound zzso zzso were zzso assigned in the electron density map at zzso A zzso zzso forms a zzso with zzso zzso symmetry and two zzso zzso bind to the zzso zzso zzso experiments also confirmed this association state in solution and specific binding between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The association interface between zzso and zzso contains the zzso His zzso in the zzso indicative of an efficient zzso of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso domain does not interact with the other zzso domain, but with the zzso domain of the same zzso chain and with one zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions reveal a zzso zzso of signal zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, we propose a responsible role of zzso for the feedback regulation of sensing and/or zzso activities of zzso
