zzso maturation of classic zzso supposedly proceeds through the zzso of the zzso germ line zzso zzso It is less evident to zzso how this can be accomplished by zzso zzso zzso lacking light zzso Although these zzso are subjected to zzso zzso their zzso zzso consists of a single domain with restricted flexibility in favor of binding zzso An zzso domain derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated five zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso upon maturation against zzso Three of these zzso have zzso side zzso replacing zzso and participate in the zzso core of the zzso in the mature zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might occur in this loop during zzso However, transition state analysis of the binding zzso of mature zzso and germ line zzso show that the maturation of this zzso relies on events late in the reaction zzso This is reflected by a limited zzso of zzso and a significantly decreased zzso upon zzso In addition, binding reactions and the maturation event are predominantly zzso zzso zzso maturation proceeds through the increase of favorable binding zzso or by the reduction of the zzso penalty for zzso as opposed to large zzso penalties associated with zzso changes and structural zzso Furthermore, the crystal structure of the zzso with a restored germ line zzso sequence illustrates that the matured zzso core of zzso in zzso might be compensated in the germ line precursor by burying zzso molecules engaged in a stable zzso network with zzso and zzso
