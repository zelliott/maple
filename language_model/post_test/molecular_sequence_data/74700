zzso zzso precursors of the inner layer zzso of the egg zzso are regarded as sensitive zzso for zzso zzso In this study, two full-length zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the zzso H and L forms, respectively, were isolated from a brackish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso expression of zzso and zzso was observed starting at embryonic stage 34 and restricted exclusively to the zzso In zzso zzso induction of zzso was stronger than that of zzso zzso exposure of adult fish to zzso zzso 1, 10, 100, and 500 zzso zzso zzso 0, 1, 10, 100 and 500 zzso zzso zzso 0, 1, 10, 100, and 200 zzso and zzso A zzso 0, 1, 10, 100, and 200 zzso in artificial seawater for 7 days resulted in zzso induction of both genes in the zzso In the male zzso the sensitivity of zzso to these zzso compounds was higher than that of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso were 10 zzso 10 zzso 100 zzso and 100 zzso respectively, and on zzso were 100 zzso 100 zzso 100 zzso and 200 zzso zzso All these suggest that zzso can be used as a highly sensitive zzso for monitoring zzso chemicals in the marine zzso
