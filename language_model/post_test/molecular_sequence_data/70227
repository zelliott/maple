A zzso zzso at position 370 zzso in zzso Shaker zzso channels resides within two overlapping sequence motifs zzso among most zzso zzso the zzso segment and a zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate the effects observed upon substitution of zzso with many other zzso zzso acid zzso We find that smaller or more zzso zzso produce greater zzso in both zzso and zzso gating than does substitution with other large zzso zzso In addition, zzso containing less conservative zzso at position 370 are restricted in their assembly with zzso zzso and are unlikely to form zzso channel zzso zzso with the idea that zzso influences the zzso structure of these channels, the results indicate that zzso zzso specific zzso interactions during the zzso transitions of zzso similar interactions may take place during the zzso zzso or assembly of Shaker zzso channel zzso
