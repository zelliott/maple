zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is initiated by the recognition of zzso zzso factors zzso by host zzso zzso are zzso modified derivatives of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso defense responses in zzso Recent evidence has shown that both zzso and zzso zzso are recognized by structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso roots indicated that zzso not only activate zzso genes but also zzso activate zzso genes through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to activate zzso genes independently of zzso zzso zzso using zzso genes consisting of the zzso zzso domain of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of an zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that substitution of a portion of the zzso zzso in zzso with the zzso acid sequence zzso from the corresponding region of zzso enables zzso zzso zzso to establish zzso with zzso zzso We also showed that the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which also possess the zzso zzso suppress the symbiotic zzso of zzso These results strongly suggest that, in addition to adaptation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso limited zzso in the zzso domain of zzso receptors have played a crucial role in shifting the zzso signaling to zzso from defense responses, thus zzso one of the key genetic events in the evolution of root zzso zzso in zzso zzso
