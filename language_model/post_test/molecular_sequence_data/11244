A near full-length zzso clone zzso was isolated from a zzso library constructed from zzso root zzso The predicted zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso is largely zzso and contains 26 repeats of a motif the consensus sequence of which is zzso The function of the putative protein remains to be zzso The zzso zzso accumulates to the highest levels in young roots, and is also present in mature roots and stems of zzso Further analysis of young roots indicates that the lowest level of zzso zzso is near the root tip, with relatively high levels throughout the remainder of the zzso In zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso accumulates predominantly in the cortical zzso cells of the zzso In zzso nuclear zzso zzso experiments indicate a dramatically higher level of zzso gene zzso in zzso old roots than in zzso old zzso A zzso zzso zzso which includes the transcribed region and zzso zzso of upstream zzso was isolated and zzso
