The regulatory DNA sequence elements that control the expression of the zzso B virus major surface zzso gene in the zzso cell line zzso were analyzed by using transient zzso zzso In this system, the zzso B virus zzso increases zzso from the surface zzso promoter approximately zzso The promoter elements regulating the expression of this gene are within a zzso sequence located immediately upstream of the zzso initiation zzso The promoter consists of an zzso zzso element which increases zzso from the surface zzso gene by two- to fourfold and a zzso element of approximately 115 zzso which is essential for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso promoter elements were shown to bind factors present in zzso nuclear zzso which is consistent with the regulatory role demonstrated for these zzso The regulatory role of these promoter sequences in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso was also demonstrated, indicating similar zzso regulation of the surface zzso gene in each of these differentiated zzso cell zzso
