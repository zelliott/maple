The authors have previously reported that the zzso of the zzso zzso strain of rabies virus is required to zzso for adult zzso A cluster region of zzso acid zzso exists at the positions zzso to zzso on the zzso between zzso and virulent zzso In this study, the authors generated a zzso strain having the region at the positions zzso to zzso of the zzso derived from the zzso zzso strain in the genetic background of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain restores the zzso for adult zzso This result clearly shows that the region at the position zzso to zzso of zzso plays an important role in the zzso for adult zzso Moreover, the authors observed that the zzso for adult mice correlated well with the viral growth in a brain but not with the zzso fusion activity in zzso
