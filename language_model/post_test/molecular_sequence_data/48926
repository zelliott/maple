The study and exploitation of zzso peptides zzso now extends into a third exciting zzso zzso zzso including the more common sequences zzso zzso and zzso markedly enhance the zzso delivery of small drugs, zzso zzso and zzso We introduced the term zzso to distinguish cell zzso peptides with intrinsic zzso from more typically zzso zzso zzso Our first examples included zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides presenting zzso for both cellular zzso and zzso zzso distributed within the primary zzso However, it is zzso zzso to employ the same zzso to zzso zzso zzso that comprise an zzso zzso zzso zzso to an otherwise zzso zzso zzso In such cases the zzso provides an obvious address function whilst the zzso zzso often a protein zzso zzso is the zzso Additional targeting zzso usually added as zzso zzso can also be zzso within the design of zzso and zzso to enable zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the identification and exploitation of zzso provides further scope to employ zzso as research tools, zzso and zzso spanning a range of zzso
