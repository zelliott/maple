A novel virus, termed zzso zzso virus zzso is described that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso enveloped zzso about 100 zzso in diameter, contain a major zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso A viral envelope zzso a zzso zzso core containing linear zzso zzso The zzso infection cycle does not cause zzso of host zzso The viral zzso was zzso and contains zzso zzso The zzso is unique for known zzso viruses in that none of the zzso including that zzso the major structural zzso show any significant sequence matches to genes in public sequence zzso zzso for an zzso zzso DNA virus, almost all the recognizable genes are located on one DNA zzso The ends of the zzso consist of zzso zzso repeats that contain multiple copies of short direct zzso The two DNA strands are probably zzso linked at their zzso On the basis of the unusual zzso and zzso properties of this DNA virus, we propose to assign zzso to a new viral family, the zzso
