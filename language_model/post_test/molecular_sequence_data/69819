The molecular basis of four zzso and activity zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the mouse was examined by amplification and sequence analysis of zzso Compared with the zzso coding sequence for zzso designated zzso there were five zzso changes for zzso zzso three for zzso zzso and five for zzso zzso There was only a single zzso change between zzso and zzso the deduced substitution of zzso 176 by zzso Similarly, there was only a single zzso change between zzso and zzso resulting in substitution of zzso 258 by zzso There were three zzso changes between zzso and zzso resulting in substitution of zzso 22 by zzso zzso 39 by zzso and zzso 152 by zzso These zzso acid zzso to neutral, neutral to zzso and zzso to zzso in agreement with the zzso properties of the gene products of zzso relative to zzso zzso and zzso previously described by zzso zzso zzso differences were confirmed by zzso or single zzso primer extension analysis and extended to include the assignment of other strains as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso analysis of amplified zzso DNA and Southern analysis are consistent with single but unique zzso zzso present in the zzso and zzso zzso As these data do not support the previous zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose and employ a new single locus multiple zzso zzso for zzso on the basis of the sequence zzso
