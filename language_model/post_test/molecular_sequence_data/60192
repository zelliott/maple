The early steps of the zzso zzso between plant zzso and soil bacteria zzso are zzso by an exchange of chemical signals between the two zzso Upon gene zzso by plant root zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso (called zzso zzso zzso that induce root hair zzso cortical cell zzso allow bacterial entry and produce zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso zzso occurring on the zzso core are essential for recognition and zzso zzso of these molecules is now fully zzso by looking at the structural changes in zzso induced by gene zzso or gene zzso From the zzso studies of zzso it appears that their structures belong with the zzso evolution of plants, rather than that of bacteria, suggesting a zzso of symbiotic bacteria with their plant zzso Some preliminary and indirect observations indicate that similar molecules seem to exist in zzso plants, in zzso and zzso zzso possibly involved in their zzso but they are probably at at a so low concentration that all attempts to detect them directly fail up to zzso
