We have recently shown that the multiple tumor zzso gene 1 zzso ) zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso by deletion or disruption in most human zzso acute zzso zzso zzso representing the most frequent genetic event thus far described in this zzso To analyze the mechanism of these zzso events, we used zzso sequencing, and/or zzso chain reaction mapping to study 15 zzso occurring in the zzso zzso We found that these zzso occur in two clusters zzso and zzso zzso The three zzso occurring in zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 10 of 12 zzso within zzso are located at a zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this sequence might play a role in the zzso For both zzso and zzso sequence analyses and zzso mapping experiments show that the tightly clustered zzso are located in the vicinity of zzso whose sequence is similar to those involved in the zzso zzso Moreover, short zzso zzso random zzso additions, and zzso zzso sequences are present in all cases, further suggesting that the zzso are due to illegitimate zzso zzso zzso These data are the first demonstration that a tumor zzso gene can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they reinforce the view that this process, normally required for zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso
