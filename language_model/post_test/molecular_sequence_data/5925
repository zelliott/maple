We have cloned and characterized a new member of the zzso group of zzso protein zzso here termed zzso zzso comparisons revealed that zzso is approximately zzso identical to the other three zzso zzso but only zzso to the other zzso protein zzso family zzso It contains the zzso dual zzso site present in all zzso group members and is activated by a group of zzso stimuli including zzso and environmental stresses that also activate the other three known zzso zzso However, unlike the other zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso is not blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be activated by zzso and zzso known zzso of the other zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso zzso provide evidence for additional zzso The data presented zzso show that zzso has many properties that are similar to those of other zzso group zzso Nonetheless important differences exist among the four members of the zzso group of zzso and thus each may have highly specific, individual contributions to zzso events involving zzso of the zzso zzso
