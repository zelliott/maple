zzso zzso cell zzso molecules zzso are used by several human pathogens to anchor themselves to or invade host zzso Interestingly, human zzso express a specific zzso zzso that zzso together with zzso and zzso in the recognition of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso can direct efficient, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is blocked by zzso versions of the small zzso zzso Moreover, zzso engagement triggers membrane recruitment and increased zzso loading of zzso that are not observed upon bacterial binding to zzso zzso and zzso stimulation are also inhibited by compromising the integrity of an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso sequence in the zzso tail of zzso or by interference with zzso family protein zzso zzso that zzso zzso In contrast to interfering with zzso zzso of zzso events reduces the ability of primary human zzso to zzso and eliminate zzso bacteria, indicating an important role of zzso in the control of zzso pathogens by the innate immune zzso
