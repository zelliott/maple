Although DNA zzso and zzso repression are generally zzso a zzso role for DNA zzso in zzso of zzso zzso has not been zzso The newer generation zzso stem cell virus zzso zzso zzso lacks many of the repressive zzso DNA sequences identified in zzso zzso leukemia virus but remains sensitive to zzso zzso in various cell zzso To determine the contribution of zzso zzso to zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso long terminal repeat zzso that are clustered in the zzso region and directly spanning the zzso start site in the R zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso were assessed in zzso embryonic stem zzso An analysis of numerous zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso in both clusters eliminated zzso zzso that were completely zzso zzso expression was shown to represent a substantial component of zzso zzso and was independent of the presence of zzso in the zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso delayed establishment of the silenced state but had only a modest effect on expression of some zzso zzso at late times zzso These results are direct evidence for a zzso contribution of DNA zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso and define the promoter region zzso as a repressive element in embryonic stem zzso Furthermore, distinct mechanisms are suggested for establishment and maintenance of the silenced zzso zzso
