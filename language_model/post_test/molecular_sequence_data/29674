In blood banks, D zzso are routinely used to zzso donors and zzso However, most D zzso do not zzso zzso that zzso express zzso The use of higher affinity zzso could overcome this zzso In this work, an attempt has been made to increase the affinity of the human clone zzso an zzso zzso by light zzso zzso followed by selection using zzso zzso 

zzso of three zzso individuals were used to construct the zzso zzso repertoire that was zzso with the zzso heavy chain in a zzso zzso system zzso Scripps Institute, La Jolla, zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected on intact zzso and characterized by zzso indirect zzso and sequence zzso 

zzso zzso combined with zzso display permitted the selection of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with improved zzso with weak D zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso L chains are zzso by different zzso segments of the zzso family and different J zzso thus showing a relatively low degree of zzso zzso 

The use of a zzso such as zzso could permit a further increase of the potency of existing zzso zzso The low zzso between zzso and zzso zzso sequences further exemplifies the zzso role of the heavy chain in determining the specificity of the zzso
