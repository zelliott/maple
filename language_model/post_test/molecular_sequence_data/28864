We previously reported the existence of type B influenza genes in the gastric zzso of three zzso The purpose of the present study was to further characterize gastric zzso infection with type B influenza virus, in which the natural host is limited to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso sequential analyses were performed to detect type B influenza virus genes in gastric zzso that was zzso in the summer, when influenza was not zzso zzso analyses of the clinical backgrounds of the patients were also zzso 

The zzso genes of type B influenza virus were detected and confirmed in 37 of 80 patients by sequence analyses of the second zzso products, although they were not detected in the first zzso zzso The three patients who were receiving acid suppression therapy who were positive for the influenza virus zzso gene 37 months previously were found to be positive zzso zzso sequential analyses of the zzso gene revealed two zzso zzso from the reference strain, suggesting the characteristics of persistent influenza virus zzso zzso analyses of the patients' clinical backgrounds showed a correlation between influenza zzso zzso in gastric zzso and acid zzso zzso 

These results suggest that influenza viruses zzso and probably persist in the gastric zzso under conditions of acid zzso
