We report here a novel zzso clone with a predicted protein sequence similar to zzso zzso This full-length zzso clone of zzso base pairs zzso was isolated from human zzso on the basis of its zzso in zzso zzso It encodes an zzso zzso whose protein is a member of the scavenger zzso zzso family, because it contains four scavenger zzso zzso zzso that are found in several zzso or cell surface zzso The zzso protein has a zzso identity with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein at a region corresponding to zzso 2-6, zzso the existence of a zzso zzso gene zzso The pattern of zzso gene expression by zzso parallels zzso zzso zzso Its zzso level is induced by transforming growth factor zzso and zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in all tumor cell lines examined that attach to culture dishes but not in cell lines that grow in suspension and is also zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso gene encodes an zzso protein that may be specifically involved in cell zzso and zzso
