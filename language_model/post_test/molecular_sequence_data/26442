Using a partially zzso zzso zzso protein zzso we designed a new zzso method for the measurement of zzso of zzso zzso The present method uses zzso zzso and zzso involving an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso peptides were zzso online by measuring the zzso zzso zzso zzso and analysis were performed zzso Furthermore, the method permits a direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso and has a potentially universal zzso zzso it is usable with any kind of zzso in a given range of zzso This zzso was designed for specificity studies, which are of major importance at the molecular level, in order to understand active site zzso and the zzso requirements of zzso protein zzso As examples, data on zzso zzso of zzso II zzso (five to ten zzso acids in zzso are zzso as well as for other zzso zzso such as zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We adapted our experimental conditions to accommodate crude extracts from zzso zzso zzso experiments clearly indicated that other biological sources can be zzso Despite the existence of numerous methods published in the literature for the measurement of zzso activities, the method presented zzso is the only one to the zzso knowledge that can be used in and has been assessed for specificity zzso zzso do not require particular features such as charged zzso zzso zzso to be zzso
