To better understand the major zzso complex zzso genetic character of domestic birds, we zzso and analyzed chicken zzso II zzso genes of 3 local chicken breeds, derived from 3 separate areas in zzso We amplified zzso sequences from 105 individuals, accounting for 35 zzso Some of the same zzso zzso with a high frequency were found in all zzso The putative zzso zzso had few zzso sites, whereas the zzso zzso had several zzso zzso Most of the zzso positions were located in the zzso zzso domain zzso by zzso 2, especially in the zzso zzso This indicated that the highly zzso zzso region could zzso binding diverse zzso zzso The comparison of 3-D zzso structures of chicken zzso and human zzso revealed a distinctly structural zzso but the chicken zzso zzso had more zzso sites than the human zzso zzso which presumably might be a mechanism to compensate for responding to a wider array of pathogens due to fewer zzso for zzso Moreover, some zzso sites in human and chicken zzso class II molecules reflected their common ancestry and similar zzso These results suggest that the chicken zzso gene showed more zzso sites and distinctly dominant zzso zzso potentially to adapt to zzso
