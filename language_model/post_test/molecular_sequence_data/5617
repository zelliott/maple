We have previously characterized two zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso disruption of the zzso promoter revealed two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso that continue to be zzso These zzso arise from unique promoters and are zzso zzso is expressed in several discrete areas in the zzso zzso These include the lateral zzso the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso In the zzso expression is highest in cortical areas such as the prefrontal and insular zzso that are associated zzso zzso By contrast, zzso is most highly expressed in the zzso and zzso and is also present in all zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at very low levels with wide distribution throughout the zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso active and induce gene expression in transient zzso with a zzso response zzso zzso This activity is inhibited by protein zzso A regulatory zzso the protein zzso zzso and the chemical inhibitor zzso We also demonstrate that zzso is zzso at the zzso zzso like the zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso is zzso The discrete expression of zzso zzso in the brain suggests specific functional roles in zzso zzso
