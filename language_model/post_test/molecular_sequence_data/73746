zzso disease zzso is one of at least six neurodegenerative diseases caused by expansion of a zzso repeat zzso a zzso tract in the disease zzso To study the molecular mechanism of disease, we isolated both normal and expanded repeat zzso zzso and generated zzso against the zzso gene product, called zzso Using this zzso we demonstrate that in disease zzso both the normal and zzso zzso protein are expressed throughout the body and in all regions of the brain zzso including areas generally spared by zzso In brain, certain regions (the zzso for example) express zzso in only a limited subset of zzso zzso studies in normal and disease brain, and in zzso cells, indicate that zzso is predominantly a zzso protein that zzso to zzso processes as zzso We conclude that in zzso as in other zzso repeat diseases, cellular expression of the disease gene is not itself sufficient to cause zzso zzso other zzso factors must be invoked to explain the restricted zzso seen in zzso The restricted expression of zzso in certain regions, however, may influence the pattern of zzso and provide clues to the zzso zzso
