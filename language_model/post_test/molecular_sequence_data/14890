zzso are zzso bacteria that live in zzso and associate with zzso plants to establish zzso zzso The ability of these bacteria to undergo horizontal gene transfer zzso is thought to be one of the main features to explain both the origin of their symbiotic zzso and the plasticity and dynamics of their zzso In our laboratory we have previously characterized at the species level the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and have found a high zzso of zzso activity in many plasmids zzso et zzso zzso In this work we characterized the zzso zzso region of one of those zzso zzso This zzso region was found to represent a previously zzso zzso type in zzso zzso zzso highly ubiquitous in zzso zzso and found in other zzso of zzso bacteria as well; including zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso described here could be located by function within a DNA zzso of zzso zzso between the divergent genes zzso and zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that this protein groups close to the previously defined zzso and zzso type of zzso but is located in a separate and novel cluster that we have designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were frequently associated with plasmids present in zzso soil zzso A comparison of the zzso locations with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that the symbiotic genes are found on diverse plasmids bearing any of the four zzso types, thus indicating that zzso plasmids are not specifically associated with any particular zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso promoted the zzso of plasmids from zzso zzso to zzso zzso as well as from these zzso to other bacteria by means of their own helper zzso The results present an zzso and seemingly ubiquitous zzso system that provides a zzso support for the zzso between zzso zzso of zzso roots, and between other soil and zzso zzso
