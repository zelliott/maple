The primary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso cells has been determined by parallel analysis of the zzso acid sequence of the protein and the zzso sequence of the corresponding zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso which is larger by about zzso Da than that of the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found between the sequences of mouse zzso zzso and fetal rat liver zzso
