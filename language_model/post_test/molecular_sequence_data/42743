zzso arthritis zzso and type II collagen zzso arthritis zzso in the rat serve as models of chronic human zzso zzso transfer of AA was observed in 21 of 25 Lewis rats given zzso A zzso zzso zzso cells prepared from animals zzso with zzso zzso in mineral oil zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso changes were noted in rats given zzso cells obtained from donors that had received incomplete zzso zzso zzso zzso type I collagen in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Administration of zzso cells from zzso zzso or zzso animals did not modify the development of zzso when these rats were subsequently challenged with zzso However, partial protection against induction of AA was provided by the transfer of zzso cells prepared from rats zzso with zzso zzso but not by those obtained from rats injected with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso that did not develop clinically evident arthritis following the administration of zzso cells prepared from zzso rats were also resistant to AA induction by zzso zzso of rats with a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of the zzso 65 zzso heat shock protein (65 zzso zzso significantly delayed the onset of zzso but not that of zzso zzso resistance to zzso provided by zzso cells prepared from rats injected with zzso and by zzso with the 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso may result from the induction of protective tolerance to zzso zzso present in the zzso and zzso zzso
