The zzso acid sequence of the rat zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was deduced from the sequence of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has 96 zzso zzso the zzso zzso is removed after translation of the zzso and has a molecular weight of zzso zzso protein zzso has a single zinc zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 13 or 14 copies of the zzso zzso The zzso for the protein is about 500 zzso in zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and to zzso zzso zzso We have identified in the data base a DNA sequence that encodes the chicken zzso of rat zzso
