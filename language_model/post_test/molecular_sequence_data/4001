This study was initiated to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso of expression of the human cone zzso zzso gene by zzso acid zzso in an in zzso model of zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso or zzso cell lines were cultured in the absence or presence of zzso zzso with zzso or translation zzso for various zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by Northern zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein was also zzso The zzso zzso activity and its responsiveness to zzso treatment was evaluated by transient zzso of the zzso zzso reporter zzso followed by promoter deletion analysis to map the specific regions responsible for the zzso zzso 

In our in zzso model, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso effect was blocked by either zzso or protein synthesis zzso however, zzso zzso stability was not affected by zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso Although all zzso and zzso zzso were zzso only zzso and zzso increased dramatically after treatment with zzso An zzso zzso but not an zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso and protein expression in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in transient zzso zzso zzso a region between zzso and zzso of the zzso promoter, with zzso elements zzso was discovered to be responsible for the zzso zzso 

The zzso gene is zzso zzso by zzso acting through zzso elements within zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the cumulative data, zzso is most likely the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso regulation by zzso
