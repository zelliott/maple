Using zzso DNA prepared from peripheral blood samples of a patient with factor IX zzso all eight zzso as well as sequences around the zzso junctions and putative promoter region of human factor IX DNA have been subjected to zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and zzso zzso of these sequences with normal factor IX gene sequences revealed an zzso in zzso VIII that resulted in the zzso of 11 zzso acids and the addition of 23 zzso zzso all at the zzso terminal of factor zzso This zzso destroys an zzso I restriction zzso carrier detection and zzso diagnosis in affected zzso can be performed by testing for the absence of this zzso This is the first characterization of a zzso in which zzso in the zzso terminal region of factor IX causes factor IX zzso The genetic change in factor IX in this patient is called Factor zzso zzso
