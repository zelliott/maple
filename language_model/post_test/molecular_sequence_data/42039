In order to zzso the role of inflammatory zzso in the central nervous system, we examined the production of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso in brain tumor cell zzso The zzso cell lines tested exhibited high levels of zzso and zzso zzso expression upon stimulation with zzso or zzso while none of the zzso cell lines expressed these zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso expression depended on the dose of zzso alpha and zzso and appeared very zzso reaching zzso levels at 3-6 zzso with substantial production of these zzso in the culture zzso When various zzso drugs were tested, zzso but not other zzso drugs markedly inhibited the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a potent regulator of these inflammatory zzso production in the neural zzso In addition, reverse zzso chain reaction zzso revealed the expression of zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso brain tumor zzso including glioblastoma, zzso grade 2, zzso and zzso indicating that these inflammatory zzso are expressed in zzso
