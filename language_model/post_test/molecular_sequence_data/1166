In humans, zzso encodes a protein of dual function that plays a role in both modification of zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso Recently, it was found that zzso a zzso zzso in zzso is important for the development of the zzso cell layers in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the structure and function of a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso encodes a small protein with a zzso nuclear zzso signal at its zzso and good zzso with the corresponding genes from diverse plants and zzso zzso zzso was present at comparable levels in zzso roots, flowers, and zzso A zzso fusion of the full length zzso protein was localized to the zzso in distinct structures, while a zzso fusion of its zzso 80 zzso was targeted to the nucleus, suggesting zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso did not affect its growth and the expressed protein was present in the zzso in particulate zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso resulted in subtle zzso of leaf zzso and color, without significantly affecting plant viability or zzso Thus the zzso zzso apparently does not play an essential role in the development of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to the essential role of sail in formation of the zzso cell layers during zzso zzso zzso
