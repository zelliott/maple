In zzso coli, a zzso zzso zzso assembly zzso complex is responsible for recognition and assembly of outer membrane zzso zzso The functionality of zzso in protein zzso is mainly orchestrated through the presence of two essential zzso zzso and zzso Here, we present crystal structures of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins display scaffold zzso typically implied in transient protein zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso eight zzso zzso zzso shows an zzso fold on the basis of five zzso repeats, three of which form the scaffold for protein zzso The zzso zzso protein has evolved through the gene zzso of two zzso zzso known to mediate protein interactions in structurally related zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso is formed through a domain swap and indicates fold similarity to the zzso inhibitor protein family, possibly zzso cell wall stability in zzso zzso zzso and zzso data show evidence for the specific recognition of zzso sequences through the zzso repeat architecture of zzso zzso our data advance the understanding of the zzso complex and highlight the functional importance of zzso in zzso outer membrane zzso protein motif recognition and protein zzso
