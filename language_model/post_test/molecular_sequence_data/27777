zzso I zzso is one of the major proteins of the outer membrane of zzso zzso Like zzso protein F zzso it is a vaccine candidate because it zzso zzso with all zzso strains of the International zzso zzso zzso Since zzso I was expressed in zzso coli under the control of its own promoter, we were able to isolate the gene by screening a zzso zzso zzso library with a mouse zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a precursor protein of 83 zzso acid zzso including a signal zzso of 19 zzso The mature protein has a molecular weight of zzso not including bound zzso and zzso Although the zzso acid sequences of protein I of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli differ considerably zzso zzso identical zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso coli, are zzso Using zzso I expressed in zzso coli, it can now be tested whether this protein alone, without zzso zzso zzso zzso has a protective effect against zzso zzso zzso
