zzso is a zzso protein from zzso coli that zzso on zzso DNA, forming a zzso filament that pairs with zzso duplex DNA and carries out strand exchange in zzso In this study, we measured zzso pairing and strand exchange in solution by energy transfer between fluorescent zzso on the ends of zzso By varying the position of the zzso in separate zzso we were able to detect the pairing of zzso zzso filament with duplex DNA as an increase in energy transfer, and strand displacement as a decrease in energy zzso With these zzso the zzso of pairing and strand displacement were studied by zzso zzso The data revealed a zzso second order, zzso pairing step that was followed by a zzso zzso first order strand exchange zzso These data indicate that an initial unstable intermediate exists which can readily return to zzso and that a further, zzso step (or zzso is required to effect or complete strand zzso
