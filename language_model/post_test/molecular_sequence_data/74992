The zzso and adrenal zzso produce steroids classified into five major groups which include the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso steroids control the differentiation and growth of the zzso system, induce and maintain sexual characteristics and zzso zzso zzso zzso steroids also influence differentiation as well as being zzso zzso The effects of each steroid depend primarily on its specific zzso the nature of which could therefore provide a basis for zzso of steroid hormone zzso The successful zzso sequencing and expression of the human zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA, plus zzso from various species, provides the first opportunity to study zzso structure and its influence on gene zzso zzso comparison and zzso analysis show structural features common to all groups of steroid hormone zzso The receptors share a highly zzso zzso region which functions as the zzso zzso This common segment allows the zzso to be scanned for related gene zzso zzso zzso for example, was isolated using an zzso zzso zzso In this study, using the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso as a zzso probe, we have isolated two zzso clones zzso zzso with structural features suggestive of cryptic steroid hormone receptors which could participate in a new hormone response zzso
