To investigate a zzso zzso zzso variation at the N terminal of zzso C virus zzso zzso and the zzso response of zzso T zzso zzso to this zzso 

Two patients infected with zzso were followed up for 7 zzso Blood samples taken at the first year and the fifth year were used for viral zzso zzso Using zzso the N terminal gene of zzso region was amplified from the extracted zzso The amplified segments were zzso and zzso to assess the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso according to the sequencing zzso zzso types of the two patients were determined by zzso zzso The peripheral blood zzso were separated from the two patients at 7th year after infection and cultured with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso to assess the zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso individual, there was an amber zzso at the first zzso acid of the zzso in the first year after infection, but the amber zzso disappeared after 5 zzso However, in the zzso individual, the zzso had neither variation nor amber zzso in 5 years after zzso 7 years after zzso infection, T zzso from both individuals had no zzso response to the zzso zzso 

The amber zzso of the zzso at N terminal of zzso may be associated with viral immune zzso zzso have no response to the zzso zzso in the N terminal of zzso zzso in the later stage of chronic zzso zzso
