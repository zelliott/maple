The gene fragments zzso outer membrane protein 1 zzso and zzso protein B zzso amplified from zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso by zzso were inserted into zzso expression zzso zzso to construct zzso expression plasmids zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso was zzso with zzso of zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli cells transformed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso proliferation zzso and zzso detection demonstrated that the animals zzso with zzso or zzso exhibited stronger zzso and cellular immune responses compared with animals zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Seven days after challenge of zzso 50% infection dose of zzso zzso mice were zzso and their zzso were zzso The zzso weights of mice zzso with zzso or zzso were significantly lighter than that of mice zzso with zzso or zzso By real-time zzso zzso the zzso loads of zzso of mice zzso with zzso or zzso were also significantly lower than that of mice zzso with zzso or zzso The data from this study indicate that fusion zzso zzso is a good zzso for zzso zzso against zzso zzso and it may be a more suitable candidate for preparing zzso vaccine against Q zzso
