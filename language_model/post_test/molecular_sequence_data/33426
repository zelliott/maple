zzso zzso occurs when ecologically based, divergent selection causes the evolution of zzso zzso There are many empirical examples of this process; however, there exists a poorly characterized stage during which the traits that distinguish species ecologically and reproductively segregate in a single zzso By using a combination of genetic zzso zzso experiments, field zzso and population zzso we studied a butterfly population with a zzso wing color zzso and found that the butterflies exhibited zzso zzso zzso mate zzso These traits represent the zzso ecologically based signal and preference components of sexual isolation that usually distinguish zzso and sibling zzso The association between behavior and recognition trait in a single population may enhance the probability of zzso and provides an example of the missing link between an zzso population and isolated zzso
