zzso peptides zzso have been studied for three decades, and yet a molecular understanding of their mechanism of action is still zzso Here we zzso current knowledge for both synthetic zzso experiments and zzso experiments, with a focus on comparisons between the zzso zzso experiments are done at zzso to zzso ratios that are at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than zzso zzso To close the gap between the two concentration zzso we propose an zzso activity zzso which is based on an zzso testable molecular image of zzso zzso The zzso activity model may be useful in driving engineering and design of novel zzso
