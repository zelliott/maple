A higher frequency of a zzso of the zzso gene characterized by a transition in zzso 2 causing a replacement of zzso by zzso zzso has recently been found in zzso individuals, but not all authors were able to confirm this zzso We examined zzso 219 patients with primary hypertension, zzso 92 zzso controls zzso and zzso a sample of the general population zzso donors, zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso DNA was performed by zzso amplification and zzso were separated on zzso zzso In the general population and in zzso spouses the respective zzso of the T and M zzso were: general population: M zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso spouses: M zzso zzso T zzso zzso A significantly higher frequency of the zzso zzso was found in zzso individuals with a family history of hypertension and an onset of hypertension before 50 years of age zzso zzso versus zzso with age of onset zzso or zzso 50 years and family history of zzso zzso P zzso zzso by zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study confirms the observation of a higher frequency of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in hypertension and identifies individuals with family history and early onset of hypertension as individuals at zzso
