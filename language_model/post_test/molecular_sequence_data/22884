Mass zzso analysis of a prion protein zzso complex isolated from zzso zzso zzso fluid revealed a protein that showed zzso to a zzso protein previously identified in cat urine zzso Using zzso zzso zzso bands were detected in corpus and zzso zzso fluid from all zzso tested zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the ram, the protein was also present in seminal fluid but not found to be associated with zzso The bands reacting with the zzso zzso coincided with those having zzso activity in a zzso zzso and its levels paralleled the zzso activity of native zzso zzso A partial zzso sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to 380 zzso zzso was obtained by zzso amplification from total zzso from the corpus zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence shows a high degree of zzso (up to zzso with the different zzso proteins found in databases but only up to zzso with other known zzso By zzso strong zzso expression was found in the corpus and zzso zzso while the zzso zzso and zzso zzso had low zzso No zzso was detected in the zzso heart, or zzso These data demonstrate that an zzso form of the zzso zzso is zzso into zzso zzso zzso In the ram, it is associated with a high zzso zzso complex and may be responsible for the majority of the zzso activity in the zzso zzso fluid of this zzso
