Those of us who study zzso action share at least two important long-range zzso zzso to understand the zzso specificity of steroid action in full molecular detail, by zzso zzso action with our rapidly expanding knowledge of the molecular biology of insect development, and zzso to better understand the nature of the steroid response and its evolution by taking advantage of the unparalleled opportunities for both genetic and comparative study afforded by the diversity of the zzso zzso However, until recently, the molecular fundamentals of the zzso system were unknown and our efforts have, of necessity, been devoted to their zzso Now that the situation has zzso we have a small but varied catalog of zzso genes for study and it is clear that some of these are zzso and zzso in their zzso The zzso zzso zzso like other steroid receptors a member of the nuclear zzso family, is now accessible to molecular study, and we have a preliminary understanding of the DNA sequences zzso that bind zzso and specify a gene as zzso With these tools in hand and with the opportunity to turn to larger questions, it is a propitious moment to consider the nature of those questions and how zzso can contribute to the zzso
