zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted against either zzso or zzso receptors on zzso release of growth hormone zzso and zzso were studied in male zzso The stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso was completely inhibited by the zzso zzso targeted against the cloned zzso zzso and significantly reduced by the zzso zzso targeted against the cloned zzso zzso The zzso zzso targeted against the cloned zzso zzso but not that targeted against the cloned zzso zzso abolished the zzso effect of acute zzso on zzso zzso It is concluded that both the zzso and zzso zzso stimulating effect of zzso is mainly zzso by the cloned zzso zzso Further, the cloned zzso zzso is involved in the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso
