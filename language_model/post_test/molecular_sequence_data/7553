The purpose of this study was to explore the gene expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso pregnant sheep with singleton or twin fetuses at a zzso age ranging from 100 to 140 days were used for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were collected and processed for zzso zzso acid analysis by Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso 

By use of a zzso zzso human zzso complementary zzso acid probe, a prominent zzso zzso zzso acid transcript of zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso and zzso A minor band of zzso zzso was also found but only in the zzso and zzso The abundance of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was highest zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and lowest in the zzso In these zzso zzso chain zzso products corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso zzso In addition, a zzso chain reaction zzso corresponding to zzso was zzso These fragments produced specific zzso signals with the human zzso radioactive probe where the intensity of the signal was strongest for zzso and weakest for zzso 

zzso gene expression was detected in the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that vascular zzso growth factor may play a role in the induction of zzso and promotion of zzso in the zzso that zzso the zzso and fetal zzso
