The structure of the coding region of mouse zzso X zzso was zzso The predicted protein sequence indicated an approximately 240 zzso molecular mass with zzso zzso zzso When aligned with the structure predicted for calf zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso extremely highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tail zzso 4 domain were apparent in the tail region, suggesting their importance for zzso X's zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the existence of a zzso X zzso zzso zzso in size, in various mouse zzso while a similar size of human type zzso X zzso was recognized mainly in the zzso In addition to the zzso transcripts in mice, a smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso in size, was identified in early to late embryonic zzso suggesting the presence of a shorter zzso X zzso in mouse zzso In zzso zzso experiments with mouse zzso revealed that zzso X zzso was restricted to zzso cells at stages zzso of the zzso cycle, suggesting that zzso X is implicated in the supporting cells during the zzso zzso
