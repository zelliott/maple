To compare the zzso gene zzso zzso formation, growth rate and zzso resistance of a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso with those of the zzso strain zzso 

The zzso genes of zzso and zzso were amplified and the zzso products were zzso zzso was established and detected with scanning electron microscope 8 zzso 24 zzso 3 d and 6 d zzso zzso counting method was used to compare the growth zzso of zzso and zzso International standard plate dilution method was used to detect the zzso of common antibiotics for zzso and zzso in zzso 

There was a zzso deletion zzso in zzso gene of zzso The zzso formation rate and growth rate of zzso were noticeably lower than those of zzso The zzso resistance profile of zzso was identical to that of zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso with a new type of zzso of zzso gene is zzso The zzso characteristics of this strain are different from those of the zzso zzso zzso strain reported zzso which may be related with the newly discovered zzso of zzso zzso
