In this study we describe a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene that resulted in a total zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso formation in zzso in the zzso zzso of the patient were below the limits of zzso However, zzso zzso was zzso at a similar size and concentration as compared with normal zzso zzso when measured by Northern zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene showed the presence of two zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 7 and C zzso in zzso zzso These zzso were zzso and located in different zzso The latter zzso has already been reported as one of the zzso of the zzso gene resulting in total zzso zzso zzso The former zzso was further zzso by zzso zzso studies in which zzso zzso was zzso to zzso cells by zzso The results of zzso studies showed that the cells zzso with zzso zzso expressed similar size zzso molecules to those of cells zzso with zzso zzso but that they lacked zzso zzso The two zzso of the zzso gene resulting in the total zzso zzso zzso in the patient zzso from her zzso
