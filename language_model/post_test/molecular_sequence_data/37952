The orphan zzso zzso zzso has a limited domain of expression which includes the developing and adult mouse zzso zzso is expressed in the developing liver zzso with the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso Nuclear Factor zzso zzso Although preliminary characterization of the mouse zzso promoter has recently been reported, the identity of the molecular regulators that drive liver expression is not zzso We hypothesized that putative zzso and zzso elements within the zzso promoter would zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression zzso The zzso promoter region from zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso cells, with the region from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the promoter via response elements located within zzso zzso whereas zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element significantly reduced promoter activity in zzso cells, whereas this element in isolation zzso zzso responsiveness to a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso were performed to confirm zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso contribute to zzso expression of zzso
