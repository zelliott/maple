zzso of the zzso zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso is dependent on cell density and requires an zzso regulatory zzso zzso and other zzso for zzso zzso coli transformed with the zzso zzso zzso very low levels of light, and this zzso can be partially alleviated by zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter was analyzed in zzso by primer extension mapping to examine the function of zzso zzso isolated from zzso coli transformed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to have a start site at 123 zzso upstream of the first zzso zzso of zzso This is in sharp contrast to the start site found for zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso at 26 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso However, when zzso coli was zzso with both the zzso zzso and zzso the start site of the zzso zzso shifted from zzso to zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso gene caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso stimulating initiation at the zzso zzso zzso
