zzso strains of zzso zzso produce a 146 zzso toxin zzso that acts as a potent zzso zzso analysis of the structural gene for zzso zzso previously suggested it was zzso acquired, because it had a low G + C content relative to the zzso zzso zzso To address this, the sequence of DNA zzso zzso was zzso The sequence analysis showed the presence of zzso to zzso tail protein genes and a zzso zzso suggesting that the toxin gene resides within a zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso zzso DNA contained a zzso of a zzso system that was shown to be zzso The presence of a zzso was demonstrated in spent medium from zzso zzso zzso zzso Its production was increased by zzso C addition, a treatment that is known to induce the zzso cycle of many temperate zzso The zzso of zzso from three different zzso zzso zzso strains had similar but not identical restriction profiles, and were approximately zzso zzso in zzso The zzso from two of these had integrated at the same site in the zzso in a zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis confirmed that these zzso contained the zzso zzso
