The 3' processing of most bacterial precursor zzso involves zzso trimming to yield a mature zzso zzso This step is carried out by zzso zzso a member of the large zzso family of zzso We report the crystal structures of zzso T from zzso coli and zzso zzso which show that this zzso adopts an opposing zzso arrangement, with the zzso zzso zzso from one zzso closely juxtaposed with a large basic patch on the other zzso This arrangement suggests that zzso T has to be zzso for zzso zzso and agrees very well with prior zzso zzso zzso The zzso architecture of zzso T is very similar to the arrangement seen in zzso another bacterial zzso family zzso The zzso zzso in these two zzso are organized very similarly to the zzso domain of the third zzso family zzso in zzso coli, zzso D, which is zzso
