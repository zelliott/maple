zzso is a member of a class of proteins zzso that zzso themselves from a precursor protein and in the process zzso the zzso protein sequences zzso We report here the zzso resolution crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso containing 10 zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocking in zzso protein zzso allowed the zzso to be zzso and zzso The structure reveals both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso bonds to be in distorted trans zzso zzso approximately 100 degrees zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso based on the zzso structure indicates a large zzso change zzso of zzso zzso must occur to allow zzso to be zzso A zinc atom was discovered at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with a water zzso zzso zzso the zinc zzso The crystal structure of zzso has captured the zzso in its zzso zzso
