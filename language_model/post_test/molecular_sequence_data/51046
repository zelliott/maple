zzso zzso T cells recognize the minimal fully active synthetic zzso zzso zzso This sequence zzso with the eight zzso zzso zzso binding motif previously predicted from direct sequencing of naturally occurring zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso T cell recognition of a panel of zzso with single zzso zzso between the two putative zzso anchor zzso at zzso and zzso suggested that at least one zzso zzso at position zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso transgenic mice, where the zzso originates from an zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that differences in zzso zzso pairing determined the specificity for zzso zzso zzso These data support the notion that zzso 262 of the zzso T cell zzso corresponding to position 6 within the zzso zzso represents a contact site for zzso This zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso or with a site on the zzso zzso whose zzso is affected by zzso zzso zzso
