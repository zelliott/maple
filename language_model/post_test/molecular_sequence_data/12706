Multiple cycles of zzso and zzso display selection have been investigated as a method for obtaining zzso with altered zzso zzso A library of zzso zzso zzso displayed on zzso was created by zzso zzso zzso and selected for binding to zzso or zzso zzso zzso After discarding zzso the binding zzso were then subjected to further zzso and selection zzso After four zzso and selection cycles, the zzso properties of some of the resulting zzso were studied and one zzso with nine accumulated zzso was found to have a zzso reduction in zzso for DNA zzso but a zzso increase in zzso for zzso of a zzso containing small zzso zzso The possibility of this technique for in zzso evolution of zzso properties is zzso
