Responding to viral infection, the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso to inhibit cellular and viral protein zzso To overcome this host defense zzso many zzso express the protein zzso containing an zzso zzso binding zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain zzso While zzso is thought to inhibit zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and by directly binding the zzso the role of the zzso domain in zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso domain is required to suppress the zzso properties associated with expression of human zzso in zzso to inhibit zzso zzso activity in zzso and to reverse the zzso effects of zzso on reporter gene expression in zzso cells treated with zzso Whereas previous studies revealed that the zzso binding activity of zzso is critical for viral zzso we identified point zzso in zzso that functionally zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso Thus, our studies reveal a molecular distinction between the zzso acid binding and zzso zzso functions of the zzso zzso domain, and they support the notion that zzso contributes to viral zzso by targeting zzso and other components of the cellular zzso defense zzso
