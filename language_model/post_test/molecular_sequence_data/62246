zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso motor protein involved in the regulation of cell division and zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso is likely to interact with several other zzso To identify zzso zzso we used the zzso region of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso This screening resulted in the isolation of a novel zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso with its single zzso zzso bound zzso at a zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed protein and native zzso zzso shift studies, and zzso zzso with the zzso motor confirmed that zzso interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso Interestingly, although both zzso and zzso were able to interact with zzso and inhibit its zzso binding activity, the concentration of zzso required to inhibit the zzso zzso activity of zzso by zzso was zzso less than that required for zzso Two zzso zzso binding proteins and a zzso from zzso which contain one and four zzso zzso respectively, bound zzso but did not affect zzso binding and zzso zzso activities of zzso indicating the specificity of zzso sensors in regulating their zzso zzso of zzso in zzso resulted in zzso with reduced branch number resembling the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the activity of zzso in response to changes in zzso zzso and regulates zzso zzso
