zzso zzso of water channel proteins called zzso zzso induce zzso injury which is implicated in Crohn's disease and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso are zzso similar and belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized on the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso called the zzso while zzso is selectively targeted to the zzso zzso Despite the high sequence similarity and evolutionary zzso the molecular mechanism involved in the zzso selective targeting and function of zzso and zzso in the zzso is largely zzso Our hypothesis is that the differential polarity and selective targeting of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cells is influenced by zzso acid signal zzso We performed sequence and structural alignments to determine differences in signals for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sorting motif zzso is present in zzso but absent in zzso while zzso signals are present in zzso but absent in zzso Furthermore, the zzso region of zzso is longer compared to zzso The sequence and structural differences between zzso and zzso provide insights into the differential zzso and function of these two zzso commonly expressed in human zzso
