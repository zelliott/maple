In B cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso revision is a common route for zzso unwanted zzso zzso via a mechanism called zzso zzso This in zzso process, mostly affecting zzso zzso involves the replacement of all or part of a previously rearranged zzso gene with another zzso zzso gene located zzso Two different mechanisms of zzso replacement have been reported: type 1, involving the zzso zzso genes complex and requiring a framework region 3 internal zzso zzso and type 2, involving an unidentified mechanism different from that of type zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso editing ensures that a second zzso zzso zzso This helps to maintain zzso by generating a novel zzso with a new zzso zzso We report that human B cells can, surprisingly, undergo type 2 replacement associated with zzso zzso zzso The de zzso zzso products result from the partial replacement of a previously rearranged zzso gene by a new zzso zzso zzso zzso and without deletion or addition of zzso There are zzso motifs at the zzso zzso recipient zzso zzso as described for type 2 zzso replacement, but zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was not zzso This unusual mechanism of zzso zzso seems to be a zzso of gene zzso zzso which does not require zzso The zzso phenomenon described here provides new insight into zzso locus zzso and zzso zzso repertoire zzso
