zzso of zzso proteins during the process of heat zzso cell death of a human pancreatic cancer cell line, zzso zzso were investigated using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and cell biology zzso zzso of zzso zzso at 45 degrees C for 30 zzso decreased the cell growth rate and cell viability without causing zzso DNA zzso zzso at 51 degrees C for 30 zzso suppressed cell growth and again led to death without DNA zzso The cell death was associated with the loss of an zzso protein of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso This protein was determined to be zzso initiation factor zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso region of zzso fragments obtained by zzso zzso treatment of the protein zzso onto a zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences detected were zzso and zzso which were zzso with the sequence of zzso from zzso 20 to Pro 36 and from zzso 43 to zzso 61, zzso Furthermore, the result of sequencing suggested that the protein was an active form of zzso zzso because zzso 46 could be detected but not zzso 49, which is the site for zzso These results suggest that loss of the active form of zzso is an important factor in the irreversible process of heat zzso death of zzso zzso zzso
