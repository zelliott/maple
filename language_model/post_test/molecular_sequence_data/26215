zzso This gene completely lacks the intervening zzso zzso This gene is truncated at the zzso end zzso zzso region by 433 base pairs zzso zzso The 502 zzso of this gene containing zzso signal are completely identical to the 3' half of zzso zzso region of functional zzso zzso This gene has a zzso tail and is flanked by direct repeat of 6 zzso zzso Here we report for the first time the complete sequence of a human zzso for zzso zzso and this is the first report of cloning of zzso for zzso zzso zzso
