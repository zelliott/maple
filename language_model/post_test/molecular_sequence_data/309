zzso modifications zzso of zzso tails play a key role in zzso regulation of gene expression in a range of organisms from zzso to zzso however, little is known about zzso proteins from the zzso that causes malaria in humans, zzso zzso We characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso using advanced mass zzso driven zzso zzso proteins were resolved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso Through the combination of zzso and zzso mass zzso we obtained high mass accuracy of both precursor and zzso zzso which is a prerequisite for zzso identifications of zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso marker zzso to validate the identification of zzso modifications and report the zzso 143 zzso as a novel zzso marker zzso for zzso zzso We identified all known zzso zzso zzso and mapped 44 different zzso providing a comprehensive view of zzso marks in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso exhibits a zzso modification pattern that is distinct from its human zzso A general preponderance for modifications associated with a zzso zzso state was zzso Additionally, a novel differentiation in the modification pattern of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed, suggesting divergent functions of the two zzso zzso in the zzso Taken together, our results provide a first comprehensive map of zzso modifications in zzso zzso and highlight the utility of tandem zzso for detailed analysis of peptides containing multiple zzso
