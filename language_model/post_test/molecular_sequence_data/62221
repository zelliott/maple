In contrast to cancer cells and embryonic stem cells, the lifespan of primary human cells is zzso After a defined number of population zzso cells enter in an irreversible zzso state termed zzso zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso can contribute to zzso In a genetic screen for zzso bypassing zzso zzso of normal human prostate zzso cells zzso we identified zzso a gene that encodes a zzso zzso as shown by sequence zzso its interaction with zzso and its zzso to nuclear zzso zzso zzso extends the lifespan of a wide range of normal human cells and zzso mouse zzso by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso does not zzso or zzso with zzso and both can exert their actions independently of each other as shown by reverse zzso zzso expression is zzso during zzso zzso and its zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited growth of normal cells though induction of the zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso controls cellular lifespan through regulation of both the zzso and the zzso zzso
