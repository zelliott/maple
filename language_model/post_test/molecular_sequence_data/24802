A branching zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated from an extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 72 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shares zzso similarity to known bacterial branching zzso zzso Similar to the zzso branching zzso the predicted protein has a shorter zzso zzso acid extension than that of the zzso coli branching zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence does not appear to contain a signal zzso suggesting that it is an zzso zzso The zzso zzso branching zzso was successfully expressed both in zzso coli and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed optimum zzso activity at pH zzso and 65 degrees zzso The zzso was stable after 30 zzso at 80 degrees C and retained 50% of activity at 80 degrees C after 16 zzso zzso activity of the zzso was higher toward zzso than toward zzso This is the first zzso branching zzso isolated from an extreme zzso
