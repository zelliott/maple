Evidence suggests that the products of the human zzso zzso zzso genes are involved in viral DNA replication during zzso zzso A zzso zzso was raised against the zzso open reading frame zzso to characterize its function in zzso zzso utilizing the zzso zzso identified seven distinct protein bands zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed during the zzso infectious zzso After screening a zzso library constructed from cells 72 h after infection with zzso only four different zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso corresponded to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The proteins zzso zzso and zzso were further shown to be selectively included within mature zzso zzso zzso zzso enveloped particles and dense zzso zzso protein zzso was used to prepare the samples for liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso This analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso were derived from the zzso ORF, most likely through zzso zzso zzso
