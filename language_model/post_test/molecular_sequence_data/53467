zzso genetic theory predicts that selectively driven changes of zzso frequency for both beneficial and deleterious zzso reduce zzso at tightly linked zzso All else being equal, these reductions in zzso are expected to be greater when zzso rates are zzso zzso the empirical observation of a positive correlation between zzso rates and amounts of DNA zzso across the zzso zzso zzso can be explained by two very different types of natural zzso Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on linked sites by comparison of zzso and zzso zzso We present zzso data from 40 genes distributed across zzso arms X and zzso of zzso zzso a sibling species of zzso zzso We find significantly less silent zzso in zzso zzso on the X zzso than on zzso but no difference between arms for silent divergence between zzso This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on linked zzso We propose that some form of positive selection having greater effects on sex zzso than on zzso is the better explanation for the zzso zzso zzso
