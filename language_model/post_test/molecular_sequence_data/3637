A maternal plant exquisitely promotes the success of its offspring by orchestrating zzso development and zzso protection even after the zzso zzso It uses zzso zzso for physical and zzso contact with the developing zzso and for subsequently zzso the seed with a seed coat zzso The zzso is zzso and metabolically zzso but its molecular biology is not well zzso We show here that the inner zzso in zzso zzso zzso organized development and then programmed cell death zzso as evident from zzso starch zzso DNA fragmentation and eventual zzso We have identified a zzso zzso gene zzso that is expressed only in the inner zzso as it zzso zzso well before the zzso begins storage protein zzso Two zzso zzso zzso have been recruited in zzso for the zzso of zzso and for leaf zzso and these differ zzso in their primary structure and zzso zzso Despite zzso being closely related to zzso and an indication of zzso zzso of its inner zzso the zzso zzso is suggestive of only one zzso zzso that shows approximately zzso identity to zzso It is, however, leaf zzso and the other zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso also differs from zzso zzso zzso zzso in lacking the hallmark zzso tail and being zzso zzso one of the very few plant genes known to function only in the seed coat, will be useful in zzso zzso development of this important organ in zzso
