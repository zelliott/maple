The cloning and expression of the genes for zzso zzso and human zzso have resulted in major advances in our knowledge of this zzso and the biological processes in which it is zzso Such advances include the primary structures of the zzso zzso the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso that resulted in zzso synthesis of zzso by the zzso cell line zzso These advances have facilitated studies of the control of zzso gene expression in normal and zzso cells, which is an ongoing area of zzso The use of the cloned zzso gene in a zzso expression zzso has allowed the generation of experimental zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso and human zzso has verified that zzso is a zzso zzso regulator in each of these zzso Although it is clear that in each of the above species zzso promotes the growth of a wide variety of zzso zzso the regulation of stem-cell division and maturation by zzso and its zzso with other regulators requires clarification and remains an active area of zzso The discovery that zzso stem cells from certain zzso strains do not zzso in response to zzso alone has provided a model system in which to analyze the synergistic activities of zzso It will be interesting to see whether analogous differences in the responsiveness of stem cells to zzso also exist in zzso Our work on the zzso of blood cell development in embryonic and fetal mice indicates that in every strain, early zzso zzso cells respond to zzso plus zzso or to zzso plus zzso rather than to zzso zzso or zzso zzso The difficulties encountered in acquiring sufficient cells to work with from embryonic sources could possibly be overcome by developing a fetal sheep model in which access to the zzso and fetus can be achieved at several sequential points in zzso It may then be possible to determine the molecular events that regulate primitive stem-cell responsiveness to zzso as well as other zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins should continue to prove valuable in further biological studies of zzso in the generation of zzso zzso against zzso and for further studies of the zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
