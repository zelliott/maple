zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso is first produced as a zzso zzso which consists of a signal zzso or zzso for zzso (27 zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso between the signal zzso and the mature zzso While the zzso zzso gene could not be maintained in zzso coli, we have been able to show that expression and zzso of the neutral zzso can be achieved from the zzso gene when its zzso binding site zzso is zzso The results suggest that the failure to observe expression of the zzso zzso gene is due to the zzso effect of the zzso gene product on zzso coli host cells and that translation initiation in zzso coli can be achieved even in the absence of a classical zzso binding zzso
