The zzso zzso T4 DNA replication complex can be manipulated in zzso to study zzso aspects of the zzso phase of DNA zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso of DNA synthesis zzso by the T4 zzso zzso is greatly increased by the interaction of this zzso with its accessory proteins zzso and zzso and the T4 zzso DNA binding protein zzso The assembly of this T4 zzso requires zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso T4 zzso DNA synthesis can be obtained without zzso of zzso by simply adding zzso to the T4 DNA zzso at extremely high zzso effectively bypassing the zzso zzso zzso of the accessory protein zzso The amount of zzso required for the zzso zzso event is reduced by addition of the zzso crowding agent zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso A zzso strategy involving zzso has been used to demonstrate the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is ultimately responsible for increasing the zzso of DNA synthesis via a direct and functionally significant interaction with the T4 DNA zzso A zzso to this notion is that the specific role of the zzso complex is to zzso link zzso to zzso
