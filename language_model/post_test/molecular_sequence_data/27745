zzso zzso strain zzso capable of growth on zzso acid zzso was zzso to the zzso strain zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Using cloned DNA from the region zzso the zzso a zzso sequence zzso zzso was identified which was repeated several times on the zzso zzso and was also present on zzso zzso zzso Various zzso fragments containing this sequence were cloned and their zzso sequence was zzso zzso of zzso revealed the presence of zzso terminal zzso repeats immediately flanked by zzso direct zzso The translated sequence of the single large open reading frame of zzso showed structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Thus the zzso repeated sequence has several structural features in common with zzso sequence zzso Three copies of zzso were mapped near zzso genes zzso degradation of zzso an intermediate in zzso zzso Neither zzso nor the zzso genes zzso to DNA isolated from zzso zzso including zzso zzso suggesting that both gene fragments may be of foreign origin recruited in strain zzso The origin of these two DNA segments as well as the role played by zzso in the recruitment of zzso genes in zzso are presently under zzso
