In this report, we describe zzso regulation of the human Gal beta zzso zzso alpha zzso II zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso showed that the forms of two zzso differed only in the zzso region zzso 1 and zzso According to analysis of the zzso structure, the zzso regulation of Type 1 and Type 2 zzso zzso depended on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso were detected in various human zzso except zzso skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood zzso by zzso zzso In colon zzso the Type 2 zzso was zzso however, Type 1 zzso was not zzso To zzso the molecular basis of zzso II gene zzso we isolated and characterized the function of the zzso region of zzso II containing the zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso promoter is much higher than that of the zzso promoter in the colon zzso cell line, zzso These results suggest that the zzso II gene is expressed specifically by alternative promoter zzso and is regulated in a zzso fashion at the level of zzso
