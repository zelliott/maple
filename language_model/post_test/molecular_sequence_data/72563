We have recently demonstrated that both zzso to Gal zzso and the Gal zzso binding zzso zzso bind a synthetic zzso zzso there being a similar recognition of zzso and zzso zzso We now report that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also react with peptides zzso by zzso genes zzso 1, 3, zzso known to be rich in zzso zzso and zzso This activity was demonstrated zzso by the ability of zzso derived peptides to block the reaction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a Gal zzso pig zzso cell line; the reactions were specific and did not occur with a random zzso containing the same sequences or with other zzso zzso zzso by the fact that zzso zzso could react with the Gal zzso expressed after zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso the pig zzso zzso and zzso that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso could react with zzso 1 found on the surface of human breast cancer zzso Thus natural occurring zzso zzso zzso found in all human serum can react with self zzso peptides expressed in large amounts on the surface of zzso cells but not on normal zzso The findings are of interest and serve to explain the previously reported findings that human cells can, at times, express Gal zzso such expression is an zzso the reaction is due to the phenomenon described zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso react with zzso zzso
