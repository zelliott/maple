zzso by molecular replacement remains difficult for targets that are far from the search model or in situations where the crystal zzso only zzso or to low zzso Here, the process of determining and refining the structure of zzso a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso resolution is described using a combination of zzso modeling with zzso zzso phasing with zzso zzso elastic network zzso refinement and automated model building using zzso in a zzso fashion, followed by final refinement cycles with zzso and zzso This difficult zzso case illustrates the power of including DEN restraints derived from a starting model to guide the movements of the model during zzso The resulting improved model zzso provide better starting points for automated model building and produce more significant difference zzso in anomalous difference zzso maps to locate anomalous zzso than does standard zzso This example also illustrates a current limitation of automated procedures that require manual adjustment of local sequence zzso between the zzso model and the target zzso
