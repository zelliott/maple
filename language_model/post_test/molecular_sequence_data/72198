zzso complexes zzso are structures that are formed between zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso They consist of two zzso zzso one along each zzso that are connected along their length by numerous zzso filaments zzso The zzso zzso one major component of zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso has recently been isolated and zzso In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso the human protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso acid zzso The most prominent structural features and zzso acid sequence motifs of zzso have been zzso in zzso Most probably, zzso is functionally zzso to zzso The zzso gene was assigned to human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
