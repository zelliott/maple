The mechanism of chemical zzso with zzso zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso group to the zzso nitrogen atom of the zzso zzso with the formation of a zzso ammonium zzso is shown to be the first step of the zzso it is this zzso that activates the zzso zzso zzso This method of zzso can be used to obtain zzso derivatives of zzso without DNA zzso zzso conditions of the chemical zzso were zzso
