A zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso zzso has previously been shown to induce zzso zzso that protect against zzso after active and passive zzso Here we present new data providing a corrected structure of the zzso and the zzso against which the zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was compared with zzso acid zzso extracted using zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out by chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso specificity was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso there was structural identity between zzso and zzso of the zzso of the two zzso The basic zzso zzso structure was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at position zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso We also detected a novel zzso at position zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso bound equally well to zzso and zzso zzso as to the originally described zzso zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso killing by the zzso to zzso zzso with zzso whole bacterial cells did not induce a significant proportion of zzso directed against zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso activity was inhibited completely by both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is structurally and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso are directed predominantly to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso
