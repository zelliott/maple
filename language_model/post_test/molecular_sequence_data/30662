The zzso zzso repetitive protein zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso a small family of abundant surface proteins whose expression is restricted to the zzso form of the zzso They are found at two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso is zzso zzso The region of zzso upstream of the A and B zzso genes is only 640 base pairs long and may contain sequences responsible for zzso initiation and zzso zzso upstream of this putative promoter region is not zzso regulated and is much less active than that of the zzso zzso the zzso responsible is inhibited by zzso whereas that zzso the zzso genes is zzso zzso of the zzso genes is strongly zzso by low levels of zzso zzso The putative zzso promoter, when placed upstream of the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to cause production of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso DNA transformation zzso Taken together, these results suggest that a promoter for an zzso zzso zzso lies less than 600 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso
