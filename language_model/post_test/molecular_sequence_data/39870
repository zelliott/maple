The metal tolerance of metal zzso plants is a poorly understood zzso In order to unravel the molecular basis of zinc zzso tolerance in the zzso zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso we carried out a functional screening of an zzso zzso zzso library in the zzso zzso zzso to search for genes zzso zzso tolerance to zzso zzso The screening revealed four zzso zzso zzso genes zzso which induced zzso but not cadmium zzso tolerance in zzso The expression of zzso under the control of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso made the transgenic plants more tolerant to zzso than zzso plants, but did not change the tolerance to zzso copper zzso zzso zzso iron zzso or sodium zzso Thus, zzso is able to zzso zzso tolerance both to zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso are zzso accumulated at a higher level in shoots than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pools are zzso both at the zzso and protein zzso In zzso zzso some but not all zzso genes are induced by zzso treatment, and these genes are not induced by zzso zzso zzso found in a very large number of organisms, are known to be involved in the innate immune system but have never been found to play any role in metal zzso Our results support the proposition that zzso could be involved in zzso tolerance in zzso zzso and that a role for plant zzso in metal physiology should be zzso
