It is known that the miniature zzso terminal element zzso zzso zzso into zzso sequences or zzso zzso zzso of the second largest zzso of zzso nuclear zzso zzso II zzso has indicated that zzso and zzso have shaped the zzso zzso zzso in the St and H zzso of zzso species in zzso The aims of this study was to determine if there is zzso in the zzso gene in zzso zzso and to compare the gene evolution of zzso with other zzso zzso zzso The sequences were used to reconstruct the zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso regions from all zzso species of zzso one zzso species zzso zzso and ten zzso of zzso zzso species were amplified and zzso zzso analysis of the DNA zzso was performed in order to reveal the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso was detected in the Xu zzso A zzso zzso zzso sequence was found in the I and Xu zzso but deleted in the zzso and some H zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso length in H zzso zzso well to their geographical zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequences positioned the H and zzso zzso in one zzso zzso The I and Xu zzso are distinctly separated from the H and zzso zzso The zzso data also separated all New World H zzso species except zzso zzso zzso zzso from the Old World H zzso zzso 

zzso and large zzso have shaped the zzso zzso between the Xu and zzso I and zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso sequences confirmed the zzso of zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated the four zzso to be subdivided into two zzso
