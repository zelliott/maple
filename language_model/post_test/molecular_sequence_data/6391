Evolution of the zzso zzso ITS 2, is examined by comparing 17 DNA sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The distribution of fixed zzso differences and the relative frequency of base changes zzso zzso zzso matches the distribution and relative frequency for zzso variable zzso This suggests that most zzso variation is not effectively selected zzso The base composition of the ITS 2 transcript is zzso and zzso But, zzso regions enriched zzso 80 per zzso for A or U occur more frequently than expected while zzso and zzso regions occur less frequently than zzso Enriched sequences may be prone to replication zzso accounting for the zzso bias in zzso zzso gains and losses of zzso tandem repeats apparently account for most zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso folded transcripts share major structural zzso zzso inertia arises from zzso base pairing within stems that allows most zzso to be absorbed as new zzso off zzso Yet, there is evidence of selection to maintain the zzso First, zzso variable sites are concentrated at the ends of stems in zzso and zzso structures that do not contribute to zzso base zzso Moreover, some zzso that have become fixed in one species compensate for the presence of zzso zzso However, high rates of sequence evolution within stems and absence of zzso base evolution zzso selective zzso zzso dispersed and tandem copies of two zzso each approximately 20 bases long, may account for much of the ITS 2 zzso These are approximately zzso of each other and are, consequently, capable of significant zzso hydrogen bonding to produce folded transcripts of low zzso Evolution of the ITS 2 sequence may largely entail replication zzso gains and losses of these repeats or their composite zzso
