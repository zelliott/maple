zzso zzso receptors zzso play a major role in zzso synaptic transmission in insects and are also the target site for zzso zzso such as zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel zzso beta zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso an economically important zzso zzso zzso analysis has identified an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids with features typical of zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed as a single major transcript of zzso zzso considerably larger than the predicted length of the zzso open reading frame zzso zzso By zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso has been shown to zzso with the previously cloned zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, no zzso of zzso could be detected with either zzso or zzso With the aim of gaining a clearer insight into the influence of zzso composition upon zzso the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso
