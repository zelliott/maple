zzso zzso cells have the feature of zzso of the precursor cells of the gut zzso zzso converts them to zzso cells or liver zzso Using zzso differential display techniques, we have identified a novel zzso member of the zzso zzso carrier zzso which is expressed during the course of zzso and have designated it zzso The corresponding zzso comprises an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso of 469 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has high similarity with other zzso carriers, and the zzso has three zzso zzso zzso motifs and has calcium binding zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed zzso zzso to the rabbit zzso zzso member of the zzso zzso but the zzso zzso of the protein was exclusively zzso not zzso Northern zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed its zzso expression in the liver and the skeletal zzso In the liver, the expression level of zzso was higher in the adult stage than in the fetal stage, and zzso was highly zzso in zzso zzso cells before the expression of zzso Taken together, zzso may play an important role in regulating the function of zzso rather than in differentiation in zzso
