Despite differences in size and zzso the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso are functionally redundant for dosage compensation of the zzso zzso male X zzso zzso with functional zzso we found that zzso zzso of distant zzso species could complement zzso zzso zzso zzso despite low zzso zzso of a zzso predicted zzso structure in zzso containing a short zzso zzso zzso in its 3' zzso resulted in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso on the X zzso in spite of apparently normal zzso of the zzso zzso Two copies of the zzso zzso newly termed the zzso zzso were functionally redundant in zzso as zzso in a single zzso box had no zzso but double zzso showed reduced zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of two of three zzso boxes in the 3' end of zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso Finally, fusion of zzso sequences containing a zzso box restored function to a zzso deletion zzso lacking its zzso zzso zzso These results support a model in which the functional zzso between zzso and zzso zzso is based, at least in part, on short zzso sequences that regulate the activity of the zzso zzso
