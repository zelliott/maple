zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been found in various zzso zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and is associated with increased tumor growth, zzso resistance to zzso agents and poor zzso As such, zzso is a potential target for zzso therapy and several zzso zzso have been investigated in zzso or clinical zzso In the present study, we used small interfering zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression while evaluating the effect of zzso zzso on cell zzso and the combined effects with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso and tumor growth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index were evaluated by zzso The results showed that zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso expression and inhibited cell growth of zzso Treatment with zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso with a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso delivered by zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These cumulative results suggest that zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso may be a feasible strategy to enhance the effects of chemotherapy in patients with zzso
