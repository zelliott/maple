We have constructed two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the human X zzso a region that was previously poorly zzso One zzso of at least zzso zzso links the zzso zzso to the genes zzso zzso and zzso and also contains zzso implicated in zzso syndrome and zzso zzso A second zzso mapping zzso to the first, is estimated to be over zzso zzso and links the zzso locus zzso to zzso and also contains a zzso channel gene that is responsible for zzso zzso We have used zzso rescue, inverse zzso and zzso to generate 20 novel markers from this region, 1 of which is zzso and have positioned these relative to one another on the basis of zzso zzso The order of previously known markers within our zzso zzso zzso agrees with zzso zzso maps of the zzso In addition, we have constructed a zzso restriction map for a zzso region of the zzso zzso and have identified three zzso zzso These zzso and new markers will provide a useful resource for more detailed analysis of zzso a region implicated in several genetic zzso
