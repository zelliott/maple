zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial steps of zzso carbon reduction and zzso carbon zzso cycles by combining zzso and zzso respectively, with zzso Many zzso organisms have form I zzso comprised of eight large zzso and eight small zzso zzso The crystal structure of the complex of activated zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso and the reaction intermediate analogue zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution zzso of zzso % and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso arrangement of zzso zzso is the same as those of the previously solved form I zzso zzso the present structure is very similar to the activated spinach structure zzso with zzso in the zzso folding and zzso zzso but differs in zzso zzso The central zzso of the zzso zzso forms the longer zzso loop that zzso deeper into the zzso channel of zzso than higher plant, zzso and red zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso extension of the zzso zzso does not zzso into the zzso channel, unlike that of the red zzso zzso but lies on the protein surface anchored by interactions with the zzso region of the zzso Further, the present high-resolution structure has revealed novel zzso zzso zzso 1 of the zzso is zzso zzso 104 and 151 of the zzso are zzso and zzso 256 and zzso of the zzso are zzso Furthermore, the unusual electron density of zzso zzso of the zzso which has been deduced to be zzso from the zzso DNA zzso suggests that the zzso is zzso produced by zzso editing or zzso
