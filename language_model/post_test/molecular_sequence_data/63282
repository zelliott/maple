Six zzso epidemic zzso viruses zzso were isolated from the zzso samples of zzso infected with zzso in 2006 in zzso The membrane zzso protein genes of six zzso zzso were amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso then zzso zzso and compared with each other as well as those ten zzso reference zzso The M protein genes of six Chinese zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso containing a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif zzso as previously recognized in zzso was found in the 5 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of M protein genes of six Chinese zzso zzso The zzso motif was also found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The M protein of six zzso had three main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The M protein of one zzso zzso had one potential zzso site, but those of the other five zzso had zzso The zzso sequence zzso was highly zzso in the M proteins of six zzso zzso The six zzso zzso showed zzso sequence zzso between zzso and zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence zzso between zzso and zzso with each zzso The zzso and zzso acid identity of M protein genes between the six zzso zzso and ten reference zzso strains varied from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso relationship of M protein zzso six Chinese zzso zzso composed of a separate cluster including one Chinese strain zzso however, not including the Chinese strain zzso These results demonstrated that there was a new zzso of zzso prevailing in zzso
