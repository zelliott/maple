zzso zzso is the precursor of the zzso zzso which in plants and zzso are involved in heavy metal zzso The regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in zzso zzso For the heavy metal zzso zzso zzso zzso a partial zzso zzso was cloned by zzso Treatment of zzso dark grown zzso with zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a strong increase of zzso zzso in roots and zzso zzso with an increase of zzso and zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso was observed at 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas maximum zzso was obtained at 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was decreased in response to the zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 50 zzso caused a zzso reduction in shoot growth without affecting the amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 500 zzso did not reduce growth but induced transient increases of zzso and zzso zzso The implications of the results with respect to differential regulation of zzso and zzso during heavy metal exposure are zzso
