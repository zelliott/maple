Three genes zzso zzso starch zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso approach, and from zzso zzso zzso by screening a zzso DNA zzso Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes had the same zzso and zzso zzso structure as the previously reported zzso gene from zzso The lengths of the three zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, each covering 31 zzso in the untranslated leader and the entire coding region consisting of 11 zzso and 10 zzso The three genes had identical lengths of zzso except zzso and shared over zzso identity with each other within the zzso zzso The majority of zzso were significantly variable in length and zzso differing mainly in length zzso zzso as a result of zzso and zzso deletion zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from these three genes indicated that the mature zzso zzso and zzso proteins contained the same number of zzso zzso but differed in predicted molecular weight and zzso point zzso due to zzso acid zzso zzso The predicted physical characteristics of the zzso proteins matched the respective proteins in wheat very closely, but the match was not zzso zzso the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso genes were different from a zzso zzso a zzso gene of common wheat previously zzso The striking difference was that an zzso of 11 zzso acids occurred in the zzso sequence that could not be observed in the zzso of the A, B, and D zzso It was noted, however, that the 3' end of zzso of these genes could account for the additional 11 zzso zzso The sequence information from the available zzso genes identified the zzso region as being diagnostic for sequence variation in zzso The sequence variation in the zzso genes provides the basis for primer design to distinguish the respective genes in common zzso and its zzso using zzso
