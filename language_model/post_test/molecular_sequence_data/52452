Previous studies have indicated that most zzso peptides are 9 zzso acid zzso zzso long, with a zzso at position 2 zzso and a Val or zzso at zzso We compared the binding properties of different peptides by measuring the rate of zzso of beta zzso from zzso zzso zzso The simplest zzso that we identified that could form zzso complexes had the sequence (in single letter zzso zzso zzso indicating that three zzso zzso are sufficient for binding to zzso To determine whether most zzso that contained zzso at zzso and Val or zzso at zzso could bind to zzso we tested the binding of zzso selected from published zzso and melanoma protein zzso and found that six of seven tested formed stable zzso zzso We identified an optimal zzso zzso from the zzso zzso protein that could form stable zzso complexes that contained apparent anchor zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that the spacing between anchor zzso can be somewhat zzso Finally, we tested the importance of every zzso in the influenza A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding to zzso by using zzso and zzso zzso We found that multiple positions were important for stable zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that the zzso and zzso anchor zzso are of prime importance for zzso binding to zzso However, other zzso side chains (especially at zzso contribute to the stability of the zzso In certain cases, the optimal length for zzso binding can be longer than 9 zzso
