The zzso zzso gene zzso in patterning and growth of the zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso gene and shown that it encodes a protein zzso to the zzso proteins of zzso zzso The zzso zzso also includes a highly similar zzso zzso zzso zzso and genes for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso and zzso differ significantly from these other two classes of such zzso zzso and zzso zzso to green fluorescent protein were localized to zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso share redundant zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was at significantly higher levels than zzso zzso in zzso with the opposite pattern in zzso This differential expression can explain the confinement of effects of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso Our zzso of the nature of zzso shows that zzso defects can have specific effects on zzso zzso
