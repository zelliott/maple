The sequences of two zzso and one rabbit protein zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso were determined from their zzso The sequence of zzso zzso alpha 1 was deduced from a zzso zzso zzso from an embryonic zzso library, while that for zzso zzso beta was obtained from overlapping clones isolated from both a head zzso library and an eye zzso disc zzso zzso The gene for zzso zzso alpha 1 is at zzso on zzso 3 and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The gene for zzso zzso beta is localized at zzso on the X zzso and encodes a protein of 330 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 shows zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso zzso an zzso whose gene is located in the zzso region of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Glover, zzso Cohen, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta shows zzso identity to zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha 2 over the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that at least three genes are present in zzso that zzso different zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso beta show zzso zzso acid sequence identity to rabbit zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso respectively, demonstrating that the structures of both zzso are among the most zzso proteins known throughout the evolution of the animal zzso The presence of characteristic structural differences between zzso alpha and zzso zzso which have been preserved from insects to zzso implies that the alpha and beta zzso may have distinct biological zzso
