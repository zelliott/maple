zzso approach is applied for the analysis of seed zzso of 14 rice varieties zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which can zzso to five aromatic rice and nine zzso zzso The two-dimensional zzso zzso protein patterns for 14 rice varieties were similar within pH ranges of zzso and zzso To characterize aromatic zzso zzso we compared zzso gels of aromatic rice to zzso rice using zzso image zzso Four out of six differential spots were identified as hypothetical zzso but one zzso zzso was identified by zzso assisted laser zzso of fight zzso as zzso with three matching peptides based on zzso zzso zzso is a class of storage proteins with three different zzso of 10, 13, and 16 zzso Spot zzso was identified as a 13 zzso zzso of zzso by combination of mass zzso and zzso sequence zzso In contrast, one zzso 16 zzso zzso of zzso was found in extremely high intensity in zzso of deep-water rice compared to zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a powerful step to open the way for the identification of rice zzso
