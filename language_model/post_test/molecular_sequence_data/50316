A quick and simple method has been developed to detect the presence or absence of the zzso zzso virus zzso element zzso in zzso The procedure consists of a zzso multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso involving three zzso zzso that are specific for the upstream zzso region, the long terminal repeat zzso and the downstream zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso The multiplex reaction allows for the zzso discrimination between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method works best with zzso zzso DNA as zzso but can also be used with rapidly prepared, zzso DNA zzso The combination of speed with the safety of a zzso zzso and the ability to perform large numbers of zzso by a zzso zzso make this method attractive for large-scale screening zzso The zzso locus has been used as a model system to demonstrate the feasibility of the zzso diagnostic zzso However the same principle should be zzso to the analysis of other zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso elements belonging to other families of viruses as sequence information for the zzso regions of these zzso becomes zzso
