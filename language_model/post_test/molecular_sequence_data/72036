The nuclear orphan zzso zzso has been shown to bind as a zzso with zzso X zzso zzso to direct repeat 4 zzso response zzso It remained zzso however, whether this represents the only or the optimal binding site for this zzso zzso we performed a DNA binding site selection zzso that allows the identification of novel DNA binding sites for zzso in an unbiased zzso While zzso alone was not able to select a specific sequence from the pool of zzso the zzso zzso selected a highly zzso zzso element, termed zzso with two zzso motifs spaced by one zzso The functional activity of the consensus binding site was verified in transient zzso zzso and zzso by in zzso zzso Based on the sequence of the consensus zzso we located putative natural binding sites in the zzso zzso regions of the rat zzso gene and the rat zzso type A zzso zzso Furthermore, we could show that although the zzso zzso has a distinct binding orientation on a zzso element, it is able to bind in both zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso does not bind as a zzso with zzso to the zzso element, indicating that these zzso despite their zzso are involved in the regulation of different sets of zzso
