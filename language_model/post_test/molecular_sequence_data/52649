Rev is an essential zzso regulatory protein that binds the Rev responsive element zzso within the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso and is involved in transport of zzso or partially spliced viral zzso from the cell nucleus to the zzso Previous studies have shown that a short zzso zzso derived from Rev (Rev zzso and a truncated form of the zzso sequence provide a useful in zzso system to study this interaction while still preserving the essential aspects of the native zzso We have selectively incorporated the fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso into the zzso sequence in zzso positions zzso and zzso such that the binding of both Rev zzso and zzso zzso could be characterized directly by zzso zzso Rev zzso binding to the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso increase that provided a useful signal to monitor this binding interaction zzso zzso 20 zzso 7 zzso Using zzso kinetic zzso we have shown that specific Rev zzso binding occurs by a zzso process involving zzso encounter, followed by zzso of the zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso three classes of binding sites for the zzso zzso were zzso zzso The first site is zzso to Rev binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second site inhibited Rev binding in a competitive fashion zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso and the third much weaker site (or zzso is attributed to zzso binding zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that zzso forms both a specific zzso complex with zzso and a specific zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso data further suggest that zzso occupies a similar zzso binding site in both the zzso and zzso complexes, and that this site is located in the lower stem region of zzso
