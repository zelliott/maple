The zzso zzso across cell zzso generate a zzso zzso that regulates the function of numerous membrane proteins such as zzso channels, zzso pumps and zzso The mechanisms by which proteins sense zzso is zzso zzso channels have a zzso positively charged zzso region that moves in response to changes in membrane potential, some zzso coupled receptors possess a specific zzso motif and some membrane pumps and zzso use the zzso that they transport across zzso to sense membrane zzso zzso the general features of zzso sensors might lead to the discovery of further membrane proteins that are zzso zzso
