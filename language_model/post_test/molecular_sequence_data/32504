zzso of zzso zzso takes place on the zzso surface of zzso zzso that form after infection of the host zzso It is generally accepted that zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a complex with viral protein zzso which binds to zzso by means of a zzso anchor sequence that is located near the zzso of the 3A zzso In this study, we used zzso and zzso zzso methods to define the topography of the anchor sequence in the context of 3A and zzso proteins inserted in model zzso zzso with a single zzso near the center of the anchor sequence but lacking zzso elsewhere in zzso were constructed which, after the emergence of zzso zzso zzso well in zzso zzso When a zzso containing the zzso anchor sequence was incorporated in model membrane zzso zzso of zzso depth within the zzso zzso indicated formation of a zzso zzso However, rather than the zzso length predicted from zzso considerations, the zzso segment had an effective length of 16 zzso such that zzso likely formed the zzso zzso zzso experiments using full-length proteins bound to zzso model membrane zzso showed that the anchor sequence formed a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso in the 3A protein but adopted only the zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso Studies of the function of zzso inserted into model membrane zzso showed that zzso zzso is highly efficient in stimulating the activity of zzso in zzso while zzso 3A totally lacks this zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso reactions showed that zzso zzso is not a zzso for zzso but free zzso released by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso could be zzso
