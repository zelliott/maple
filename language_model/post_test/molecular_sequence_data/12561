zzso zzso protein zzso binds to 5 S zzso and can be released from 60 S zzso zzso as an intact zzso zzso To identify zzso important for binding of zzso zzso zzso to 5 S zzso and assembly into functional zzso we have isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene by zzso and random zzso The zzso zzso were zzso for association of zzso with 5 S zzso in zzso and in zzso and assembly of zzso into functional 60 S zzso zzso zzso with previous data implicating the importance of the zzso 47 zzso acids of zzso for binding to 5 S zzso in zzso we find that deletion of the zzso 8, 25, or 44 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso elsewhere in zzso also affect its function, indicating that multiple regions of zzso are important for its association with 5 S zzso and assembly into zzso
