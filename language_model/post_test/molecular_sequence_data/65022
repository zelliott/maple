Three populations from northern Pakistan, the zzso zzso and zzso claim descent from soldiers left behind by Alexander the Great after his invasion of the zzso zzso In order to investigate their genetic zzso we analyzed nine zzso zzso zzso and 113 zzso zzso in the extant Pakistani and Greek zzso Principal zzso zzso and structure analyses show that the zzso are genetically zzso and that the zzso and zzso populations are genetically close to each other and the Greek zzso zzso estimates suggest a small Greek contribution to the genetic pool of the zzso and zzso and demonstrate that these two northern Pakistani populations share a common zzso gene pool that probably predates Alexander's zzso The genetically isolated zzso population may represent the genetic pool of ancestral zzso populations of Central Asia or early zzso zzso zzso tribes that became zzso in the valleys of the Hindu zzso zzso
