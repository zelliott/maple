zzso to zzso zzso zzso is positively linked to expression of zzso and zzso molecules and zzso linked to expression of the zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis of this association, we have induced experimental zzso zzso zzso in mice transgenic for zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso transgenic mice, by zzso with human zzso zzso zzso in zzso Mice expressing zzso for one or both of the zzso class II molecules positively associated with zzso zzso and zzso developed zzso T cells from zzso transgenic mice responded well to three zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which the response to zzso was the most zzso zzso transgenic mice also responded to this sequence very zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses were restricted by zzso class II zzso Disease resistance in zzso transgenic mice was associated with reduced synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and reduced zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso zzso to zzso and responsiveness to an zzso within the sequence zzso as a dominant zzso
