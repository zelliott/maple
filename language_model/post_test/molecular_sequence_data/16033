zzso of calf zzso zzso with synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave three major zzso zzso zzso After release of the zzso zzso by mild acid zzso the corresponding zzso were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso degradation by zzso D and zzso by jack bean zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and binding to zzso zzso From the results it could be zzso that the following reaction took place in calf zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso gave zzso + zzso zzso zzso The next products to be formed were zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso incorporation was enhanced by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso and it occurred in the presence of either zzso or zzso It is likely that the zzso donor was zzso since, under the conditions used, the formation of zzso zzso zzso was negligible and the zzso zzso zzso zzso
