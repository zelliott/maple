The zzso is responsible for most zzso protein degradation and is essential for cell zzso Previous research has shown that the zzso can be inhibited by a number of zzso including zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso rapidly zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso containing zzso were identified following zzso gel zzso Western zzso and analysis by zzso zzso At a time when only the zzso activity was zzso the alpha zzso zzso was uniquely zzso These results provide important molecular details regarding the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso
