The zzso zzso I and zzso III are two of a series of peptides zzso to be biologically active within a membrane zzso In the preceding paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso the zzso preferences of these peptides in the presence of zzso zzso zzso a zzso for biological zzso were zzso During these studies the zzso of these peptides were investigated in zzso solutions by circular zzso and nuclear magnetic zzso A large difference was observed for the two zzso zzso I lacks any zzso secondary structure in zzso solution, independent of temperature, zzso and zzso In striking contrast, zzso III adopts a zzso zzso at zzso greater than zzso zzso This is indeed surprising given the great similarity of the two zzso The zzso of zzso III is pH dependent, with a great decrease in the observed secondary structure at pH values below zzso This observation could only be due to the zzso of the zzso zzso at the fifth zzso These findings suggest that the secondary structure arises from molecular zzso of zzso III through the formation of a salt bridge involving the zzso side zzso The zzso observed at zzso concentration zzso than zzso zzso has been characterized by CD and by the zzso measured throughout a majority of the zzso The zzso determined structure has been energy refined with restrained molecular zzso The zzso results from this study are then compared with the zzso found in the presence of zzso zzso
