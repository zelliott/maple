Despite a zzso sequence zzso the zzso of human and mouse zzso is remarkably different, as the human form is slower than the mouse form in forming zzso but is associated with Parkinson's disease in both humans and transgenic zzso Here, the zzso acid code underlying these differences is investigated by comparing the lag times, growth rates, and secondary structure zzso of a systematic series of eight zzso zzso Fluorescence analysis of these zzso shows that the zzso substitution dominates the growth zzso while the lag phase is affected by a combination of the zzso and zzso zzso The secondary structure zzso derived from an zzso chemical shift analysis of the zzso forms of the zzso zzso enable us to establish a link between the changes in the zzso properties in the region of position 53 upon zzso and the corresponding changes in growth zzso These results suggest that the presence of an zzso zzso at position 53 may be an evolutionary adaptation to minimize Parkinson's disease in humans and indicates that effective drug development efforts may be directed to target this zzso region of the zzso
