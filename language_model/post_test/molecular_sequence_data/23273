zzso zzso segments that change their zzso due to external stimuli have often been employed in zzso molecular devices and zzso Using zzso containing a pair of the zzso acid derivatives of zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is a promising approach to functional zzso especially for zzso that are zzso zzso By i and i + 2 positioning of the Ida zzso in a zzso model zzso a significant decrease in the zzso content was observed by the addition of zzso whereas zzso had no influence on the stability of the zzso The possibility of zzso control of the zzso structure was exemplified by the reduction of zzso to zzso using zzso followed by the subsequent zzso Mutual recognition of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso segment with the zzso zzso segment containing Ida zzso was also modulated in the presence of zzso
