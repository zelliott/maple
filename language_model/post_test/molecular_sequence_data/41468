The zzso zzso zzso is a globally distributed marine zzso and has been used as a model species for zzso ecology and zzso zzso Its life cycle consists of seven zzso zzso stages followed by a zzso zzso zzso The transitional processes between zzso stages and juveniles are crucial for zzso development and zzso Although some studies have been conducted on the zzso and zzso substances of the zzso a comprehensive understanding of zzso and zzso hormones remains zzso To better characterize zzso zzso and its potential roles in zzso settlement, an in zzso identification of putative transcripts zzso zzso hormones was performed, based on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that has been recently zzso Potential zzso sites zzso of mature peptides were predicted through zzso search of known zzso zzso In total, 16 zzso zzso were predicted from the zzso zzso and 14 of them were confirmed as genuine zzso by Rapid zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso precursor structures and mature sequences showed that some zzso of zzso zzso are novel zzso and shared similar characteristics with their zzso from zzso The expression profiling of predicted zzso genes revealed that zzso zzso hormone, zzso zzso and zzso zzso had the highest expression level in zzso stage, while zzso zzso was down regulated in both zzso and zzso Furthermore, an inhibitor of zzso zzso related to zzso maturation effectively delayed zzso zzso Combination of real-time zzso results and zzso indicated that certain zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso Overall, new insight into zzso hormones characterized in this study shall provide a platform for unraveling zzso control of zzso zzso behavior and settlement zzso
