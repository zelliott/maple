zzso zzso zzso 15 contains a quantitative trait zzso zzso for meat zzso as well as several breaks in zzso with human zzso zzso zzso Both linkage and radiation hybrid zzso maps of zzso 15 are available, but the linkage map lacks zzso markers needed to identify genes underlying the zzso and the zzso zzso map lacks associations with marker zzso needed to define the zzso zzso the maps will provide information to further explore the zzso as well as refine the comparative map between zzso 15 and zzso zzso A recently developed approach to zzso linkage and zzso maps uses both linkage and zzso data to resolve a consensus marker order, rather than aligning independently constructed zzso zzso map construction procedures employing this zzso approach were developed to integrate zzso zzso and linkage data, and establish comparative positions of zzso 15 markers with zzso 11 zzso 

The integrated zzso 15 map represents 145 zzso 42 shared by both data sets, 36 unique to the linkage data and 67 unique to zzso zzso zzso alignment yielded comparative positions for 77 bovine markers with zzso on zzso zzso The map covers approximately zzso of zzso 11 sequence in five segments of zzso zzso another zzso of zzso 11 is shared with zzso zzso zzso and human order are consistent in portions of the zzso zzso but some zzso is zzso Comparative positions of gene markers near the meat tenderness zzso indicate the region includes separate segments of zzso zzso The two zzso markers zzso the zzso peak are between defined zzso zzso 

Combining data to construct an integrated map not only zzso information from different sources onto a single map, but information contributed from each data set increases the accuracy of the zzso zzso of bovine maps with well zzso human sequence can provide useful information about genes near mapped bovine zzso but bovine gene order may be different than zzso zzso to connect genetic and physical mapping data, build integrated maps for livestock species, and connect those maps to more fully zzso sequence can be zzso zzso the maintenance of up-to-date zzso and providing a valuable tool to further explore genetic variation in zzso
