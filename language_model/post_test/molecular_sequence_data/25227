A degenerative zzso probe deduced from the first 19 zzso acids of the mature alkaline zzso IV zzso zzso protein was used to clone a DNA zzso internal to the coding region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso An zzso zzso was constructed in the zzso locus using the zzso zzso zzso containing the cloned DNA zzso The strain with the interrupted zzso gene showed no zzso zzso IV product on zzso zzso The impact of the zzso interruption on total zzso production in zzso zzso zzso was analyzed under both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso reduced total zzso activity by zzso in zzso cells, and resulted in the elimination of a zzso membrane zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of this membrane zzso indicated that it is a zzso gene product which is localized within the membrane fraction of the zzso cell and not zzso There was no effect on the production of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was mapped and determined to be located at zzso 73 degrees on the zzso zzso 360 degrees zzso
