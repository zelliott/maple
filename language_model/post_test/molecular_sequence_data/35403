Species identification is one of the most basic yet crucial issues in biology with potentially far-reaching implications for fields such as zzso population zzso and zzso The widely distributed but threatened zzso zzso zzso has been speculated to represent a complex of multiple zzso In this study, 254 individuals representing species of the zzso zzso were investigated along the entire range of zzso zzso 196 specimens of zzso zzso 8 specimens of zzso zzso 5 specimens of zzso zzso 20 specimens of zzso zzso and 25 specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence data zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso analyses were conducted using maximum zzso maximum likelihood and zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate divergence dates of major zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso can be divided into three distinct major zzso Each major lineage totally zzso to geographical regions, revealing the presence of three candidate cryptic zzso Isolation and differentiation among lineages are further supported by the great genetic distances between the zzso The zzso zzso pattern also suggests an zzso zzso trend during historic cryptic zzso Dating analysis estimates that zzso zzso from Western China split from the remaining zzso zzso populations in the zzso and that zzso zzso from Eastern China zzso from Central China in the zzso We also found that zzso zzso from Mainland China and Hong Kong might have a complex of multiple zzso After identifying cryptic zzso we then determine the zzso between the zzso and the zzso in several zzso This zzso may have been caused by zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
