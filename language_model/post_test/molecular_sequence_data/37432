Atomic force zzso zzso has developed into a powerful tool to investigate membrane protein surfaces in a zzso zzso Here we report on the surface topography of zzso zzso light harvesting complex 2 zzso zzso into two-dimensional zzso These zzso zzso proteins formed zzso zzso complexes, which inserted zzso into the zzso zzso This peculiar packing of an integral membrane protein allowed us to determine zzso and tilt of the zzso complexes, but also zzso height and intrinsic flexibility of their individual zzso zzso the surface zzso reliability and limits of the atomic force zzso could be zzso The two-dimensional zzso examined had sizes of up to 5 zzso and, as revealed by a 10 A zzso electron zzso projection map, zzso crystal zzso The unit cell had dimensions of a zzso b zzso 150 A and gamma zzso 90 degrees, and housed four zzso complexes, two pointing up and two pointing zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso had a lateral resolution of 10 zzso Further, the high vertical resolution of approximately 1 A, allowed the zzso height of the zzso zzso complexes over the membrane to be zzso This was zzso zzso A on one side and zzso A on the zzso Interestingly, the zzso height varied across the zzso complexes, showing the complexes to be inserted with a zzso degree tilt with respect to the membrane zzso A detailed analysis of the individual zzso showed the intrinsic flexibility of the membrane protruding zzso stretches to be equal and independent of their zzso zzso Furthermore, our analysis of membrane proteins within this peculiar packing confirmed the high vertical resolution of the atomic force zzso on biological samples, and led us to conclude that the image acquisition function was equally accurate for zzso zzso with heights up to approximately 15 zzso
