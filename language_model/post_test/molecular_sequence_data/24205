The zzso of root cap cells from the root tip is important because it assists the growing root in penetrating the zzso Using a zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we identified an zzso zzso of zzso zzso that is expressed exclusively in root cap cells of both primary and secondary zzso zzso is inhibited by high zzso of zzso both zzso and zzso as well as by zzso zzso expression begins once the mature tissue pattern is established and continues for 3 zzso zzso zzso is observed in both root cap cells that are still attached and cells that have already been zzso Using zzso as a marker, we observed that the root cap cells begin to separate at the sides of the tip while the cells of the central region of the tip separate zzso zzso involves sequential tiers of intact cells that separate from the periphery of the root zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso that does not express zzso forms the root cap and sheds root cap cells but zzso is less efficient compared to wild zzso The reduction in zzso in the zzso does not affect the overall growth performance of the plant in loose zzso The modest effect of abolishing zzso expression suggests that there are multiple redundant genes regulating the process of zzso of the root cap, including zzso the zzso of the zzso gene that is also expressed in the root cap zzso Thus, these two zzso may have a role in the zzso of border cells from the root zzso We propose that zzso provides a new molecular marker to further analyze the process of root cap cell separation and a root cap specific promoter for targeting to the environment genes with beneficial properties for plant zzso
