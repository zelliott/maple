zzso family zzso zzso zzso are key zzso zzso that control processes that range from T and B cell development to reorganization of the zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso have been resistant to zzso This lack of structural data and the paucity of in zzso zzso data for this zzso family leave a void in our understanding of zzso zzso zzso In this report we have used zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system to gain insight into the regulatory apparatus of the zzso zzso Use of a quantitative in zzso zzso zzso has uncovered an essential role for the short zzso region flanked by the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in positively regulating zzso zzso zzso The precise zzso that zzso regulate zzso are zzso among zzso zzso pointing to the zzso nature of this regulatory mechanism within the zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso are not regulated in the same manner as the zzso zzso but rather share some of the regulatory features of zzso zzso
