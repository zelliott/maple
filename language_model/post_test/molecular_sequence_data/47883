The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso which zzso the first step in the zzso zzso leading to the synthesis of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso of the carbon flow into this zzso takes place mainly by feedback zzso of this zzso by zzso We have isolated and characterized three zzso zzso that show growth zzso by zzso due to a zzso zzso reduction of the carbon flow into the zzso pathway, leading to zzso zzso One of the zzso has an zzso zzso which is zzso more strongly inhibited by zzso than the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid substitution in this zzso zzso is located in a region associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso The other two zzso carry an zzso zzso with reduced affinity for its zzso zzso and zzso The corresponding zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso affect zzso located in the vicinity of a highly zzso zzso zzso stretch present in the zzso part of the zzso zzso to which no function has so far been zzso We suggest that this region is involved in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso region zzso in the zzso triplets generated zzso that determine zzso sensitivity or zzso for zzso and zzso but not a zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso indicating that this region is not involved in the zzso response of the zzso
