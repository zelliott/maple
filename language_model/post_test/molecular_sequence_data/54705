Our objectives were to investigate the presence of zzso zzso infection in red zzso wild zzso and zzso zzso removed from deer surveyed in La zzso as well as to analyze the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso from different Spanish zzso zzso A total of 21 deer and 13 wild zzso blood samples as well as 295 zzso zzso removed from zzso zzso or zzso people were tested by zzso chain reaction targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso heat shock zzso Twelve deer blood samples were found to be infected with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso No wild zzso blood samples gave positive zzso chain reaction zzso Further, zzso zzso was detected in 12 out of 89 zzso zzso removed from deer and in 18 out of zzso zzso zzso collected over vegetation in the North of zzso zzso zzso was not detected in any of the 38 zzso zzso removed from zzso zzso sequences for zzso zzso gene showed zzso zzso The zzso agent of human zzso was found in two deer blood samples, an adult tick from zzso and a zzso from zzso The zzso zzso sequences for 12 out of 35 samples matched the sequence of the zzso 1 strain previously described in the United States, and the remaining 19 positive samples zzso blood and zzso zzso showed variations with unknown zzso Although the zzso DNA sequences varied among analyzed zzso the deduced zzso acid sequences did not change for any of zzso This study suggests that deer population from La zzso harbors strains of zzso zzso similar to that pathogen for humans and other of unknown zzso Further, it seems that the zzso 1 is circulating among zzso zzso ticks from the North of Spain more frequently than the zzso zzso strain associated to human zzso
