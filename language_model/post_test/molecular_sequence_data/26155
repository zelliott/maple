The zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear proteins zzso and zzso zzso that function zzso as a zzso protein complex in the regulation of gene zzso These proteins zzso via a structural motif known as the zzso zzso and bind to zzso zzso sites via a zzso domain that is rich in basic zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that while zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso they exhibit only a low level of zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso dramatically by a ubiquitous nuclear zzso This protein does not appear to participate in the zzso complex, and it does not affect the specificity of the interaction with zzso These results suggest that a nuclear protein regulates the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso
