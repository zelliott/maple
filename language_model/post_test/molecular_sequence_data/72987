We investigated the expression and zzso pattern of zzso zzso throughout the zzso plant zzso Two forms of zzso zzso and zzso have been identified as zzso proteins of 100 zzso zzso zzso and 90 zzso zzso zzso which accumulate in dry zzso and in various zzso of zzso zzso In young zzso only the zzso form was detected and zzso of zzso zzso decreased during zzso zzso Identification of zzso from in zzso and in zzso zzso proteins indicates that similar levels of both zzso and zzso forms accumulated during treatment with zzso acid, zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso However, differences in the activity of both zzso were zzso By using an zzso directed against zzso zzso we isolated and characterized a partial zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso a zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso shares zzso identity with the rice zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso from the zzso plants soybean and zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated that zzso contains a family of zzso genes which are presently being zzso
