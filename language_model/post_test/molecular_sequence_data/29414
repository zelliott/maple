Three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso are zzso distributed along the thick ascending limb of the zzso zzso To test whether zzso zzso zzso differ in zzso transport characteristics we expressed zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso A, and B in zzso zzso and determined the zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso The three zzso zzso of zzso showed dramatic differences in their kinetic zzso The zzso zzso F exhibited zzso lower affinity than zzso A and B for zzso and zzso zzso affinities also markedly distinguish the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso zzso are consistent with the spatial distribution of the zzso along the thick ascending limb as they are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a progressively diluted fluid in the zzso zzso zzso B also showed an anomalous zzso of zzso influx at high zzso zzso zzso possibly important in its highly specialized role in the zzso zzso The adaptation of the kinetic characteristics of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso represents an excellent example of functional specialization and diversity that can be achieved through alternative zzso zzso
