A new virus was isolated from the pea zzso zzso zzso and tentatively named zzso zzso virus zzso The zzso virus particles were approximately 31 zzso in diameter and contained a zzso zzso zzso of approximately 10 zzso Four structural proteins were observed with molecular masses of approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was the most abundant product in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed no significant zzso between an internal sequence of 37 zzso acids of the zzso protein of zzso and other zzso of viral zzso zzso was not zzso related to other zzso viruses from zzso insects, such as zzso lethal paralysis virus, zzso zzso virus, and zzso zzso virus type zzso zzso on zzso sections of zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was predominantly present in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso particles were also observed associated with the zzso of the zzso Occasionally, muscle cells and zzso cells were found zzso zzso zzso fed to zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the growth of the zzso and increased the time needed to reach zzso
