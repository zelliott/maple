zzso of zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which one or two zzso bridges or additional salt bridges were introduced at the zzso zzso zzso These showed no change in zzso activity or stability compared with the zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso in which a zzso bridge was introduced at the zzso zzso interface showed reduced zzso that was identical in both oxidized and reduced forms, and also reduced stability in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso form of oxidized zzso (the zzso zzso showed a changed zzso of zzso and also alternative zzso for zzso which is a zzso to the zzso metal zzso With zzso zzso has a similar zzso to that of the zzso and its zzso is also similar below pH zzso but declined zzso In the presence of zzso zzso has lower activity than zzso at all pH values, but its activity also declines at alkaline zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso from the new position of zzso causes zzso to move when zzso is zzso thereby preventing zzso binding at Site zzso These results also suggest that zzso zzso does not lie on the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso but that movements of zzso groups are a trigger for zzso changes that initiate the unfolding zzso
