Genes for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of higher zzso derive from ancient gene zzso which occurred in zzso zzso both were transferred to the nucleus during the course of zzso We have cloned zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and have determined the structure of its nuclear gene for zzso zzso The gene contains four zzso which possess unusual secondary structures, do not obey the zzso rule, and are flanked by zzso to zzso direct zzso A gene zzso for these sequences in the context of zzso zzso indicates that zzso like higher zzso have obtained their zzso genes from zzso via zzso zzso gene zzso The data further suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lack zzso portions of the zzso lineage have acquired zzso genes from zzso donors which did not ultimately give rise to contemporary zzso zzso Evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso during evolution may have entailed successful gene transfer is preserved in zzso nuclear gene zzso
