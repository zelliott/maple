zzso disease zzso is a common zzso zzso (1 in 5,000 live zzso due to the absence of zzso zzso in the terminal zzso and resulting in zzso obstruction in zzso Recently, a dominant gene for familial zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso and the disease has been ascribed to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso gene mapping to this region, the zzso zzso zzso the 20 zzso of the zzso gene by a combination of zzso zzso gel zzso and single strand zzso zzso in a large series of zzso patients zzso sporadic cases and 35 familial zzso we found zzso of the zzso gene in 50% of familial zzso regardless of the length of the zzso zzso The mean zzso of the zzso zzso in familial zzso was significantly higher in males zzso than in females zzso Most interestingly, zzso at the zzso locus accounted for at least 1/3 of sporadic zzso in our zzso These zzso were scattered along the length of the zzso Finally, among the zzso identified in sporadic cases zzso seven proved to be de zzso zzso suggesting that new zzso at the zzso locus significantly contribute to sporadic zzso Taken together, the low zzso of the zzso zzso the lack of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso and the variable clinical expression of the disease support the existence of one or more modifier genes in familial zzso
