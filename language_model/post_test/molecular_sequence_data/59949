Two major zzso peptides were isolated and zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Acid zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used for zzso of zzso These peptides had similar molecular mass and zzso acid zzso Moreover, 21 of the first 23 N terminal zzso were zzso The peptides were highly zzso with zzso D in size and primary zzso and named zzso zzso D1 and zzso The molecular masses of zzso zzso D1 and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso D showed potent zzso activities against a panel of Gram positive and negative bacteria without zzso activity against human red blood zzso zzso our zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso D possessed stronger or at least equivalent activities against zzso zzso than zzso zzso It suggests that zzso zzso D, which has an alternative structure from zzso D, could be the model for the development of zzso zzso zzso
