The zzso system was employed to investigate the relative affinities of zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso spread at the zzso interface was determined by monitoring the surface pressure of the mixed zzso and the surface concentration of the zzso zzso has a higher affinity than zzso for zzso zzso for a given initial surface pressure, zzso zzso more than zzso to zzso of egg zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso of the molecular packing of zzso zzso and zzso suggests that zzso adopts a more condensed zzso at the zzso interface compared to zzso The ability of zzso to zzso zzso from egg PC and zzso surface zzso zzso was studied by following the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso two molecules of zzso absorbed for each zzso of zzso zzso This displacement was accompanied by an increase in surface zzso An identical zzso for the displacement of zzso from HDL particles by zzso has been reported by zzso At low zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was not fully compressed and could accommodate the zzso zzso molecules without displacement of zzso zzso zzso molecules were unable to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The average zzso zzso of zzso is higher than that of zzso this may contribute to the higher affinity of zzso for lipids compared to zzso The probable zzso regions in zzso zzso and zzso were located using a secondary structure prediction zzso The analysis suggests that the zzso properties of the zzso regions of zzso and zzso are probably not significantly zzso Further understanding of the differences in surface activity of these zzso will require more knowledge of their secondary and zzso zzso
