We report the identification of the zzso gene of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows similarity with zzso zzso zzso and is most closely related to a zzso of zzso that are capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence suggests that the protein consists of an active zzso domain, an inactive zzso domain, and an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the active zzso domain reduced the in zzso activity of the zzso protein to less than zzso of wild type activity, while zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso of the inactive zzso domain had no effect on in zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli, and the protein was shown to catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in synthetic zzso peptides and to zzso the human zzso zzso zzso transcript abundance is zzso with that of the zzso transcribed zzso zzso which codes for a zzso of DNA zzso II, with both transcripts showing peak abundance in S zzso zzso zzso strains did not differ from zzso strains under any of the conditions tested, but zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso led to zzso growth arrest and to zzso DNA zzso A screen for zzso of this growth arrest identified the zzso gene as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The arrest was not suppressed by the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso genes or by the presence of 5 zzso zzso in the growth zzso suggesting that zzso functions in a zzso involving zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso
