The effect of a zzso zzso on the formation of a second zzso upon subsequent exposure to a second zzso was studied using zzso a modified zzso chemical sequencing reaction and zzso a DNA synthesis termination zzso A DNA zzso of known sequence was reacted with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or in successive double zzso zzso zzso were sensitive to the zzso sequencing reaction for zzso these zzso significantly blocked the formation of zzso zzso Treatment of DNA with zzso however, did not inhibit subsequent formation of zzso zzso DNA synthesis termination analysis suggested that zzso of zzso altered subsequent zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and that combined treatment inhibited zzso an effect not seen after zzso treatment zzso zzso mechanisms for the zzso of zzso binding are zzso It is concluded that not only is DNA damage by zzso zzso dependent upon both the chemical nature of the zzso and the nearest neighbors to target zzso zzso but that the effect of subsequent zzso to zzso is not always zzso
