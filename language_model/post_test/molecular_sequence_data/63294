zzso is a major problem in zzso zzso yet despite this no data are available regarding the prevalence of different zzso zzso in this zzso To address this question, a molecular analysis of zzso zzso from humans and dogs living in the same area in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso from 119 zzso patients and 8 dogs were successfully zzso using single and/or zzso zzso zzso with subsequent restriction length zzso zzso zzso zzso The analyses of human samples yielded 94 zzso zzso B zzso and 25 zzso zzso A zzso Only the zzso zzso C and D were found in the dog zzso Sixteen zzso with zzso A pattern, 26 zzso with zzso B pattern and all dog zzso were further characterized by sequencing the zzso zzso zzso product and by molecular analyses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the study area the zzso A zzso were highly genetically zzso showing only zzso zzso zzso or A3 zzso at the zzso locus and zzso only at the zzso locus while zzso B showed a high genetic zzso at both zzso Seven different zzso were identified within 13 of the zzso zzso B zzso zzso The remaining 13 zzso zzso zzso appeared to contain several different zzso of the zzso gene since the zzso displayed one to seven double zzso The zzso sequences showed an even higher zzso since only 2 of 26 zzso B zzso were without double zzso Two mixed infections between zzso A and B were found when the zzso gene was zzso zzso were also observed in the zzso zzso C and D, but to a lesser extent than in zzso zzso
