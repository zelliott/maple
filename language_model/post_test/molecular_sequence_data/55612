The putative zzso domain was deleted from the zzso zzso gene of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso to produce a zzso delta zzso zzso coli expression cassette and a delta zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso delta zzso zzso yielded a properly processed and zzso active reverse zzso as determined by zzso analysis and DNA zzso activity zzso zzso of delta zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells resulted in production of virus that zzso to zzso levels in both zzso cells and fetal zzso kidney zzso In contrast, the delta zzso virus zzso poorly (less than zzso of zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso cultures, as measured by reverse zzso zzso zzso of delta zzso virus contained negligible zzso activity, which confirms that zzso zzso is zzso in the pol gene region between the zzso H domain and zzso as has been demonstrated previously for zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lerner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hunter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Phillips, zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is zzso for virus replication in dividing cells in zzso but may be required for efficient replication of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the natural host cells for this zzso
