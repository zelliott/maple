Two types of zzso zzso of the double bond of zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso precursors with zzso proportions of zzso and an excess of zzso in a neutral zzso zzso zzso system, gave nearly quantitative yields of the zzso zzso acid, zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, if the reaction medium was made zzso the zzso function of the zzso as a whole, was oxidized and the zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, was obtained in good zzso This represents a new type of zzso zzso zzso conditions gave zzso zzso or zzso acids with greater than zzso selectivity and in good yields zzso zzso of zzso gave zzso and zzso zzso devoid of hydrocarbon zzso An intriguing zzso species containing zzso zzso zzso was identified via zzso zzso We propose that further zzso of this intermediate is zzso and will be oxidized to either zzso or zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis of specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso two types of zzso zzso zzso patterns have been zzso These zzso patterns were then used in the identification of zzso and zzso acids zzso from natural zzso zzso Also, on a qualitative basis, this zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso provides a novel method for characterizing the zzso composition zzso chain zzso zzso position, zzso content, zzso of natural zzso A novel class of zzso zzso were zzso by zzso the acids to rigid hydrocarbon frames such as zzso zzso studies with zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with the expected specificity but with affinities much greater than that of the natural zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso were better zzso than zzso acid zzso
