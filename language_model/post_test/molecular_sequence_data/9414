zzso is a marine compound isolated from the sponge zzso zzso showing zzso properties via an undefined mode of zzso We analyzed the effects of zzso treatment on the proliferation and protein expression of the zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso on zzso cell cycle distribution, and induction of zzso were zzso At lower zzso including the zzso of 50 zzso zzso treatment resulted in a zzso phase cell cycle arrest, whereas at higher zzso induction of zzso was zzso zzso expressed proteins were assessed by zzso and mass zzso followed by zzso and analysis of protein modifications of the most significantly zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment at the zzso for 48 h resulted in zzso of 10 zzso of which five each showed zzso and zzso Changes in the zzso map were frequently noticed as a result of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso modification of the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso such as increased expression of zzso and zzso of zzso have previously been identified during differentiation of zzso zzso For the first time, we describe changes in protein expression caused by zzso providing valuable information regarding the mode of action of this zzso
