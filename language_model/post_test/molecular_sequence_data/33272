zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso disease pathology as it zzso zzso and zzso of specific zzso peptides and converts them into potent zzso recognized by zzso zzso We investigated whether synthetic peptides with high affinity to zzso could alter zzso activity on zzso and whole zzso zzso The immobilized zzso were incubated with synthetic peptides identified by the zzso display technique and a control zzso with no affinity to zzso zzso activity was measured with time resolved zzso The mean zzso activity, compared to that of the control without the zzso was reduced by 31, 33, and zzso for three selected zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso pool zzso zzso or zzso zzso when zzso was the zzso Finally, zzso specificity experiments suggested that zzso was processed in a manner similar that used for zzso during in zzso zzso with zzso The results showed that the blocking peptides efficiently reduced zzso processing of zzso in zzso and this strategy will be further investigated as an alternative therapy for zzso zzso
