The complete gene coding for human zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The synthetic gene was then zzso in zzso coli under the zzso control of the zzso tandem zzso As determined by zzso and zzso the zzso protein comprised up to zzso and zzso of the total soluble protein in zzso coli cells grown in shake zzso and in batch zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then zzso to zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso and zzso exchange zzso The zzso protein appeared as a single band on the zzso gel and possessed potent zzso activity in the concentration of zzso 10 zzso as zzso by the zzso plate zzso An early skin zzso was also observed when the pure zzso was injected zzso into the zzso The zzso 36 zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was determined using the zzso method and was shown to be identical to that of the native zzso
