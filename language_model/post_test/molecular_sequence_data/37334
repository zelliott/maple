zzso zzso zzso uses an zzso double displacement mechanism to catalyze three distinct zzso zzso To investigate these reactions as zzso by the zzso from zzso zzso the zzso was zzso (8 zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso analysis revealed that the three reactions proceed via different kinetic zzso The zzso reaction zzso formation from zzso is a zzso reaction, whereas the other two zzso reactions are zzso zzso which obey zzso zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso or zzso complex mechanism zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the effects of zzso and zzso on the zzso reaction revealed that zzso are competitive zzso whereas zzso is a mixed type of zzso Our results show that one zzso of zzso binds either in the active site of the free zzso or at a secondary site of the zzso zzso The mixed zzso thus indicates the existence of a secondary sugar binding site near the active site of zzso zzso zzso
