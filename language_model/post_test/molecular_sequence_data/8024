To clarify the molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in the zzso mice of zzso we cloned zzso red blood zzso zzso zzso zzso of those zzso The zzso sequence spans zzso zzso including an open reading frame that can zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the coding sequences between zzso and human zzso was zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso sequence of the zzso causing a single zzso acid substitution at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Six zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso 8 of both human and rat L zzso genes and were zzso zzso in zzso from bacteria through zzso zzso was reported to be important for zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso acid change would impair zzso affinity of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso at the zzso domain has been identified in a human zzso zzso zzso Hong Kong zzso 314 zzso Although both zzso and zzso gave rise to an zzso acid change adjacent to the active site and may interfere with zzso binding to the zzso the degree of anemia was much more severe in the human zzso The zzso cell number increased in the zzso of zzso mice to a level approximately 66 times higher than that in normal zzso mice, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso mice, but not in the human zzso might account for the observed difference in the zzso
