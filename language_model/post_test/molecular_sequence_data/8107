The zzso linkage group zzso of zzso zzso contains many genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that the corresponding zzso zzso is located in close proximity to the zzso body zzso In the course of studies into its molecular organization, we have found a cluster of four zzso genes on the zzso The genes are arranged as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing reveals that these genes lack zzso and contain characteristic 3' zzso similar to those of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences are highly zzso across species, with greatest similarities to the zzso genes of zzso Southern analysis shows that each zzso gene is present in zzso copies in zzso and suggests a dispersed zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso cells shows that, like the zzso zzso of higher zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed during zzso Using a zzso probe on Northern zzso we provide evidence that the zzso zzso gene is regulated in the same manner as other zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso protection experiments show that the zzso zzso itself associates with zzso proteins and displays a conventional zzso zzso zzso
