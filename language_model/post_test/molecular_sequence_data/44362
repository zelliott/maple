Each strain of zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso with the zzso expressed by different strains zzso two general classes, zzso and zzso In the outer zzso each zzso zzso folds into 16 zzso zzso joined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have similar zzso regions, but the eight zzso top zzso (I to zzso differ in length and zzso To determine whether zzso and especially their top loop zzso contribute to bacterial cell surface charge, strain zzso zzso that were identical except for expressing a zzso zzso zzso or mosaic zzso zzso were compared by zzso zzso These zzso zzso displayed different zzso zzso that correlated with the net numbers of charged zzso acids within zzso zzso of their respective zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso correlated roughly with zzso surface zzso those zzso zzso with diminished surface zzso showed increased sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso in zzso contribute to the surface charge of zzso and they suggest that the zzso interactions with large zzso compounds are thereby zzso
