The zzso zzso include zzso zzso and zzso zzso is composed of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of a new zzso zzso data set indicates that zzso are composed of two major zzso zzso and zzso + zzso This analysis strongly supports the zzso of each of the four major zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso include two distinct classes, the zzso worms and the colonial zzso Most previous hypotheses of zzso origins have assumed that the zzso of extant colonial zzso resembles the ancestral zzso We present a molecular zzso analysis of zzso that challenges this long-held zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso evolutionary relationships of the zzso classes zzso and zzso Our data show that zzso may be derived within zzso worms rather than being a sister zzso to the zzso The zzso of the zzso within the zzso dramatically alters our view of the evolution of the zzso body plan and suggests that the ancestral zzso more closely resembled a mobile zzso zzso than a zzso colonial zzso
