Several starter cultures used in the production of fermented beverages were screened for zzso acid bacteria that produced zzso zzso from zzso The strain producing the greatest amount was identified as zzso zzso by its zzso zzso sequence and was deposited in the zzso culture collection as zzso zzso This strain produced at least two zzso from zzso One was a zzso zzso consisting of predominantly zzso zzso units, and the other was a zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The culture fluid was found to contain zzso responsible for the two zzso and no significant level of zzso was zzso zzso activity was not present in the culture fluid when the bacteria were grown on zzso zzso or zzso as the carbon zzso Although the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and by cell suspensions were essentially zzso the same was not true for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced by zzso culture fluid contained a higher proportion of zzso zzso units than the zzso zzso produced by cell zzso
