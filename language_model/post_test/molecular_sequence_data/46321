Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso and zzso into zzso deposits that may be found in pancreatic zzso of patients affected by type 2 zzso Recent studies have shown that the highly zzso zzso zzso corresponding the zzso zzso region of zzso does not induce membrane zzso Here we assess the role played by the aromatic zzso zzso in driving both zzso formation and membrane interaction of zzso To this aim, a set of zzso zzso in which the aromatic zzso zzso has been zzso with a zzso and Ala is zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso substitution noticeably affects the zzso changes in the zzso properties of the zzso zzso but not its membrane damaging zzso Atomic force zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso red zzso zzso evidenced that the zzso zzso is not required for zzso but it can influence the zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations have paralleled the outcome of the experimental trials also providing zzso details about the structure of the different zzso zzso These results support a general theory suggesting that aromatic zzso although capable of affecting the zzso zzso of small peptides and zzso zzso are not essential either for zzso formation or membrane zzso and indicate that other factors such as zzso zzso size and zzso of the side chain act zzso to determine zzso zzso
