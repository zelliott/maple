The origin of zzso DNA replication in zzso zzso has five 19 zzso sites that bind the zzso zzso zzso Here we show, using a DNA band zzso zzso that zzso can bend DNA that carries one or more of the zzso binding zzso zzso binding to zzso DNA carrying the five sites, directly repeated and phased two turns of zzso apart, absorbs about one positive zzso turn of DNA as determined by two-dimensional gel zzso This indicates that the DNA is wrapped around zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso at the individual binding zzso The zzso complexes did not show elevated sensitivity to zzso a zzso specific for zzso bases zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The wrapping of the DNA around zzso therefore, does not lead to significant unwinding of the double zzso zzso zzso suitable for the initiation of DNA zzso most likely requires participation of factors other than zzso We also noted that the zzso bases of the sequence zzso of which there are 20 in the origin, all reacted to zzso strongly whether or not zzso was zzso The preferential zzso of zzso sequences was specific to the origin region, as zzso zzso including those in the zzso sequences did not display elevated sensitivity to zzso in a DNA zzso from zzso On one of two strands of the origin the selective zzso at the zzso sequences was zzso zzso These results indicate that the origin includes zzso DNA zzso the significance of which remains to be zzso
