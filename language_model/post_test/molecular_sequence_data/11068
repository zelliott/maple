Distribution of the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the plasma zzso of bovine kidney zzso was zzso zzso of the plasma zzso by zzso on a zzso density zzso resulted in clear separation of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso M as their respective marker zzso Under these conditions, a 110 zzso protein zzso with an zzso zzso was detected exclusively in the zzso zzso while a 90 zzso protein zzso with an zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso A conventional zzso method for obtaining the zzso which is adequate with rabbit kidney as a starting material, turned out to be inadequate with bovine kidney cortex, since a considerable amount of the zzso zzso protein was detected in the bovine kidney zzso fraction prepared by this zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso is thus strongly recommended for the zzso of zzso and zzso of bovine kidney zzso The bovine zzso zzso was shown to be unique in that it is far less sensitive to the zzso by zzso than that of other zzso
