In zzso coli, only one essential zzso zzso can degrade zzso of five zzso and shorter in length zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso which do not show any sequence similarity to zzso have been identified as functional zzso of zzso zzso comparisons did not identify zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso and zzso family zzso zzso a zzso library from zzso zzso a member of the zzso for genes that can complement a conditional zzso zzso in zzso coli, we identified zzso zzso as a functional analogue of zzso zzso is highly zzso (more than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso characterization showed that this protein exhibits zzso zzso degradation activity zzso zzso Like zzso from zzso coli, zzso is inhibited by zzso amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are widely present in zzso of zzso zzso down of zzso decreases the growth ability of zzso zzso demonstrating the importance of zzso activity in this zzso
