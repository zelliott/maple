The zzso of zzso zzso mustard at 50 zzso zzso the bovine heart zzso zzso with a zzso order rate constant of zzso zzso at pH zzso and 23 degrees zzso An apparent zzso of 27 zzso for the zzso complex was estimated from the dependence of the rate of zzso on the concentration of zzso zzso The pH zzso profile revealed that zzso of a group with a zzso of about zzso is necessary for zzso The amount of zzso incorporated into the protein increased zzso with the extent of zzso Complete zzso was estimated to occur when 3 zzso of zzso were zzso of zzso zzso in which steady state zzso was zzso by zzso by zzso mustard, zzso zzso zzso with zero order zzso suggesting that residual activity is zzso by F1 in which at least one beta zzso is zzso By exploiting the zzso of the zzso of zzso attached zzso with zzso zzso sites modified by zzso mustard were labeled with zzso Isolation of radioactive zzso zzso peptides derived from F1 zzso with the zzso in the presence of zzso which were identified by sequence analysis and sequence analyses of radioactive zzso fragments arising from them have revealed the zzso About two thirds of the zzso incorporated into the zzso during zzso is apparently zzso to one or more of the zzso acid side chains in a zzso zzso of the beta zzso with the zzso zzso The remainder of the zzso is associated with at least two sites within the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of the beta zzso From these results it is concluded that zzso of F1 by the zzso of zzso mustard is due, at least in part, to modification of one or more of the zzso acid side chains in the zzso segment of the beta zzso and possibly also to modification of unspecified zzso acid side chains between zzso zzso of the beta zzso
