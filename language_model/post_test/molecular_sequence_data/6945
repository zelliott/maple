The plant toxin zzso is an extremely potent inhibitor of protein zzso similar in action to zzso The mature protein primary sequence was obtained using conventional sequencing zzso zzso was found to be composed of 258 zzso acids and contains 21 zzso zzso This toxin shares approximately zzso sequence zzso with zzso and zzso A zzso A zzso zzso synthetic gene zzso zzso was zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso expression was monitored and demonstrated by western zzso zzso and functional activity studies demonstrated that this protein behaves zzso to that of the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso thus joins a growing list of zzso toxins currently available for use in the construction of zzso zzso composed of zzso fused to binding zzso of zzso growth factors, or other zzso
