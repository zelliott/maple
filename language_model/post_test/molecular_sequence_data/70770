The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was described initially as a short zzso of DNA causing (when cloned in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in bacteria harboring zzso zzso zzso We have performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and found that a potential zzso zzso shows similarity to the zzso family of zzso zzso of gene zzso The predicted protein has a molecular weight of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso is adjacent and upstream of zzso a potential zzso related to the zzso family of proteins which zzso bacterial zzso expression zzso and zzso and zzso transfer zzso in response to environmental zzso
