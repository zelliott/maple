zzso acid, a zzso of zzso activates the zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso We performed functional studies on the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene linked to a zzso reporter gene to identify the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the full-length zzso promoter in the zzso zzso cell line zzso was activated by the synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso promoter region from zzso to zzso containing a sequence zzso to a zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity by more than zzso zzso studies using a zzso zzso reporter gene zzso demonstrated that the zzso was sufficient to zzso zzso by zzso acid but not by zzso or zzso zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed that zzso acid alone induced a specific binding activity to the zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso activity was zzso by zzso and that zzso in combination with zzso activated the zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data establish that the zzso is a novel regulatory element of the zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso and provide the first evidence that zzso is a zzso zzso
