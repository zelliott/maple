The coat protein gene of potato virus X is known to affect the outcome of interactions between different strains of the virus and potato plants carrying the zzso resistance zzso To analyze the role of the coat protein in interactions with zzso zzso we used the potato virus X strain zzso which zzso a hypersensitive response on potato zzso carrying the zzso resistance gene and the strain zzso which was originally derived from zzso and which overcomes zzso zzso zzso of cloned coat protein genes representing the strains zzso and zzso showed that they differed at a single zzso This change results in the substitution of zzso in the zzso coat protein for zzso in zzso We constructed hybrid viral zzso by replacing the coat protein gene of a full-length clone of isolate zzso with the corresponding sequence from either zzso or zzso zzso virus, derived from in zzso transcripts of these hybrid zzso showed that the single zzso difference between the coat protein genes of zzso zzso and zzso was sufficient to alter the outcome of the interaction between the virus and potato plants carrying the resistance gene zzso Additional coat protein zzso generated in zzso from zzso zzso induced an intermediate host response on zzso potato zzso which is influenced by the presence of a second, zzso resistance gene in the host plant zzso
