The sensitivity to zzso agents of zzso of zzso cells during cancer chemotherapy is an open zzso The performance of natural killer zzso cells, possibly assisting the elimination of zzso cells under drug treatment might be of particular zzso We examined the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso enriched from the peripheral blood or the zzso zzso blood from healthy donors by indirect zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso chain reaction zzso approach with zzso specific for the human zzso zzso As the zzso zzso apparently zzso with the human zzso gene product whose functions are as yet unclear we also checked expression of this gene by zzso using zzso specific zzso zzso but rather zzso zzso expression was found in zzso enriched from the peripheral zzso zzso enriched from the zzso zzso blood showed quite strong zzso expression levels zzso exceeding the values found in the moderately zzso cell line zzso VCR 100 which is permanently cultivated in the presence of 100 zzso zzso zzso expression was mirrored by lowered sensitivities of the cultivated zzso towards zzso D or zzso The drug sensitivity could be modulated by treatment of the cells with the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was low or absent in all zzso samples examined so zzso
