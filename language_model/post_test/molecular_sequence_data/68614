Several zzso zzso and zzso of microbial origin were studied with special regard to zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso and of zzso II from zzso coli were zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli, their active site structures being zzso by chemical modification as well as by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that there is a zzso zzso family as a new family of zzso zzso In addition, zzso properties and the primary structures of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso from zzso coli were zzso zzso acid sequences deduced from the zzso sequences of their genes indicated that the former zzso should be classified into a zzso zzso alcohol zzso family, and the latter belongs to a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
