zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso gene are sensitive to the zzso effect of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso expression of this conditional toxin have been used to create animals with temporally controlled zzso zzso In these animal models, which allow the study of the zzso importance of a cell type, males are zzso In this study, we showed that this phenomenon is due to zzso high-level expression of short zzso transcripts initiated mainly upstream of the second internal zzso of the zzso zzso This expression is DNA zzso zzso To obtain a suicide gene that does not cause male infertility, we generated and analyzed the properties of a truncated zzso zzso zzso lacking the sequences upstream of the second zzso We showed that when expressed at sufficient levels, the functional properties of delta zzso are similar to those of zzso in terms of zzso or zzso zzso This translated into a similar zzso toxicity for delta zzso or zzso cells, both in zzso and in transgenic zzso However, delta zzso behaved differently from zzso in two zzso First, it did not cause zzso in delta zzso transgenic zzso Second, low-level delta zzso zzso expression did not zzso sensitivity to zzso The uses of delta zzso in zzso zzso in transgenic mice and in gene therapy are zzso
