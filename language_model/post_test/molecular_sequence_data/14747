To detect the frequency and expression of eight ALS zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso in a group of zzso zzso strains isolated from Mexican women suffering from zzso zzso A group of 264 women (age zzso with zzso infections were zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso amplification of the zzso internal transcribed zzso regions zzso and zzso The ALS and zzso genes were identified by conventional zzso and their expression levels were determined by real-time zzso after growing zzso zzso strains in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in 50 women zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most frequently expressed genes in the strains zzso all of the genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per cent of the zzso infections were caused by zzso zzso and a high proportion of the strains carried genes zzso proteins involved in zzso to zzso The ALS and zzso genes were expressed in zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso proteins play an important role in the zzso of the zzso
