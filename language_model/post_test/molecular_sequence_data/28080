A novel zzso zzso acid has been incorporated zzso into two model peptides and the zzso domain from zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso of each zzso with zzso have been prepared and zzso by chemical and/or zzso methods to determine the site of label zzso Depending on the position of the zzso in the zzso zzso either zzso or zzso is zzso These results are discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of zzso obtained zzso and the known solution properties of zzso
