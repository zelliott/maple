We previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso seeds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the two zzso A- and zzso of which the zzso are composed, were zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides from the two zzso revealed seven zzso acid zzso Among them, zzso to which the zzso chain is linked in the zzso is replaced by zzso in the zzso causing the zzso to lack one zzso zzso The zzso zzso of these zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso were first liberated by zzso After zzso the reducing ends of the zzso were coupled with zzso and then the zzso zzso derivatives were zzso by gel zzso and zzso on an zzso zzso One major sugar chain, accounting for more than zzso of the total, was zzso from both zzso The structure of this major sugar chain was established to be Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso This finding that there is no structural difference of the sugar chains linked to the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso together with the results of zzso acid sequence zzso indicates that the difference in molecular mass of these two zzso results almost wholly from the difference in the number of zzso linked to zzso
