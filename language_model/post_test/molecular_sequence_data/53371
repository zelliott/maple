The retinal zzso B zzso protein family is characterized by an zzso zzso transfer protein zzso domain, several zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacks the zzso zzso domain, while retaining over zzso zzso acid identity with the two mouse zzso proteins zzso and zzso Unlike the widespread retinal expression observed for other zzso zzso zzso zzso is restricted in the zzso to the cone cell inner zzso The zzso protein is also expressed in the brain, although its distribution is different than the other zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso protein is extracted from a retinal zzso by zzso and not by zzso zzso Thus, zzso and likely all the identified zzso zzso are not integral membrane zzso but may associate with the membrane through zzso zzso While expression of either zzso zzso zzso restored the defective light response and prevented retinal zzso in zzso zzso flies, expressing zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso slowed retinal zzso without restoring the zzso light zzso Thus, zzso may define a previously zzso protein family, which includes the other zzso zzso that act through a protein complex to maintain zzso zzso
