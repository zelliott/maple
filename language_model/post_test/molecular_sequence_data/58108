zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta all belong to the newly recognized zzso zzso of structurally zzso zzso zzso with inflammatory and growth regulatory zzso We report the isolation and sequencing of zzso clones for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and analyze their regulatory sequences in comparison with each other and with several other members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso clone displays the zzso four zzso zzso structure typical of other genes in the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso regulatory elements in the zzso promoter region were highly zzso between zzso and its three most closely related human zzso human zzso zzso and zzso A mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso was zzso with a growth hormone reporter construct driven by a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, and zzso deletion zzso analysis localized the zzso responsive element to a region that contains a zzso zzso zzso B consensus motif and lies 51 to 70 zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso In contrast to that of zzso the zzso beta zzso clone exhibited the three zzso zzso structure characteristic of the zzso beta family members zzso zzso A comparison of the promoters for zzso beta and zzso alpha reveals a zzso zzso element, but transient expression studies in zzso zzso zzso with zzso fragments of either the zzso beta or the zzso alpha zzso promoter fused to a human growth hormone reporter gene link zzso in both to promoter segments near to, but not identical with, the consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter fragments cloned from both the zzso alpha and zzso beta genes unexpectedly zzso zzso expression on the fused reporter gene sequences in zzso cells, but initial zzso deletion analysis did not link this responsiveness to known sequence zzso The zzso beta promoter, but not the zzso alpha promoter, was zzso active in zzso mouse melanoma cells, and both promoters were active in the zzso cell line zzso zzso the zzso alpha promoter being three times zzso
