Our laboratory has described a method for introducing zzso zzso into the zzso of the coronavirus mouse zzso virus zzso by zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso By using a zzso N protein zzso of zzso as the recipient virus and synthetic zzso (the zzso for the zzso protein N) as the zzso engineered zzso viruses were selected as zzso progeny resulting from zzso We have recently reported an zzso of the efficiency of targeted zzso in this process by using a synthetic defective interfering zzso zzso in place of zzso The frequency of zzso is sufficiently high that zzso can often be directly identified without employing a zzso zzso We present here a progress report on our use of this system to map zzso zzso and to construct N gene zzso which include zzso a zzso in which the internal open reading frame within the N gene (the I zzso has been zzso and zzso a series of zzso in which portions of the zzso N gene have been replaced by the zzso regions from the N gene of bovine zzso We also report on some zzso we have not been able to zzso
