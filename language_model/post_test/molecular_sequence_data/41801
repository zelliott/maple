The realization that soluble zzso of immune function, termed zzso can interact with zzso cells has led to new insights into the role of the immune system in regulating cell growth and differentiation of other organ zzso The additional finding that zzso of these interactions can lead to a variety of clinical disorders has opened the possibility of new forms of zzso A recent example of this aspect of zzso biology comes from studies of a protein designated early zzso zzso zzso which may play an essential role in immune resistance to certain bacterial and viral zzso Analysis of the structure of this protein has revealed that it is almost identical to several proteins associated with zzso and bone zzso The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of our current knowledge regarding the structure and function of zzso and the potential relationship of this gene to several clinical zzso
