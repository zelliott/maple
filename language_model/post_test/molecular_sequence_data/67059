zzso possess a unique salvage mechanism for rescuing zzso stalled on zzso zzso A complex of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso this salvage zzso The specific and direct binding of zzso zzso recognition and delivery of zzso zzso to stalled zzso The zzso protein is zzso throughout the bacterial kingdom and contains several zzso zzso acid sequence zzso We present evidence to demonstrate that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are highly zzso and clustered along an exposed surface of the zzso play a crucial role in the zzso zzso tagging zzso Our analysis suggests that the zzso zzso exhibited by these zzso zzso is due to their inability to facilitate the delivery of zzso zzso to stalled zzso Moreover, we present evidence to demonstrate that the zzso association zzso of these zzso is due to their reduced zzso binding zzso zzso with these findings, we present zzso evidence to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for the zzso binding activity of zzso zzso Furthermore, we have investigated the interactions of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our investigations demonstrate an analogous role for the equivalent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso hence further zzso our findings for the zzso coli zzso zzso These results demonstrate the functional significance of this cluster of zzso zzso in zzso binding to zzso zzso suggesting they might represent a core contact surface for recognition of zzso zzso
