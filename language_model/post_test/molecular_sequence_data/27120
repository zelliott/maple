zzso nitrate reduction zzso is a zzso wherein zzso is reduced to zzso an N species that can be incorporated into the zzso There is little information about the zzso genes in zzso and most of the known information has been obtained from zzso zzso In this study, the diversity of the zzso zzso zzso community was studied in an extreme saline alkaline soil of the former lake zzso zzso Genes coding for the zzso nitrate zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as functional zzso zzso to amplify and detect partial zzso and zzso were zzso The analysis of these zzso by cloning and sequencing showed that the deduced protein fragments shared zzso identity with other zzso and zzso proteins from zzso and zzso identity with other nitrate zzso from zzso and zzso Furthermore, these clone sequences were clustered within the class zzso with strong support values in both constructed zzso confirming that desired zzso products were zzso The zzso capacity to zzso nitrate by these zzso seems to be important given that at pH 10 and higher, zzso is mostly converted to toxic and volatile zzso and zzso becomes the preferable N zzso
