The zzso protein of zzso coli is a special zzso factor required for the zzso incorporation of the uncommon zzso acid zzso into proteins such as zzso zzso To do this, zzso binds simultaneously to zzso and to an zzso hairpin structure in the zzso of zzso zzso located directly 3' of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein is also thought to contain binding sites allowing its interaction with zzso proteins and/or zzso zzso thus includes specific binding sites for a variety of different zzso zzso We used an in zzso selection approach with a pool completely zzso at 40 zzso to isolate new zzso zzso zzso zzso Our main objective was to investigate which of the various zzso zzso in zzso would turn out to be prime targets for zzso zzso The resulting sequences were compared with those from a previous zzso experiment using a zzso pool of the zzso zzso zzso H zzso hairpin sequence zzso zzso et zzso 1997, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso In four selection cycles an enriched pool of tight zzso zzso was zzso sequencing revealed that all zzso were different in their primary sequence and most bore no recognizable consensus to known zzso zzso zzso mapping for zzso zzso showed that despite the different zzso sites in the zzso the vast majority of zzso bound to the ultimate zzso of zzso the domain responsible for zzso hairpin zzso
