A bacterial strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, was isolated from a marine solar zzso of the Yellow Sea in Korea and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso the strain resembled members of the zzso zzso It grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C and in the presence of 8 % zzso zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso exhibiting sequence similarity values of zzso % with respect to the type strains of recognized zzso species (with the exception of zzso zzso Low zzso zzso values and differential zzso properties, together with its zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
