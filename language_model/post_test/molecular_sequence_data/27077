The response of resistant zzso zzso zzso line zzso and its susceptible parent, zzso zzso zzso to zzso Spanish population of zzso zzso was studied to determine the changes in zzso gene expression during incompatible and compatible zzso zzso Twenty zzso genes were characterized from both 211 expressed sequence tags and 259 zzso DNA zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences and zzso zzso with zzso from other plant species showed that these zzso fall into seven different groups zzso zzso to zzso which represent zzso zzso to the zzso by a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were induced by zzso infection in both zzso but with differing magnitude and zzso zzso and zzso groups increased more in resistant than in susceptible infected zzso In addition, in zzso zzso analyses of genes belonging to zzso zzso and zzso groups revealed a more intense signal in cells close to the vascular cylinder and zzso vascular cells of resistant than susceptible wheat when challenged by zzso These data seem to suggest that wheat zzso zzso because of their different expression in quantity and timing, play different roles in the plant response to zzso zzso
