The zzso surface zzso zzso is the most abundant, zzso protein on the zzso form of the zzso It is the product of a zzso family that, in some zzso species, shows marked zzso among its zzso The differential expression of structurally distinct zzso genes shows circumstantial correlation with the differential processing and zzso of the protein in the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso The recent cloning and sequencing of a zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a reference sequence for comparison with ten zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso The zzso terminal and the zzso terminal regions of the protein sequences suggest different evolutionary histories within some of the zzso The evolutionary significance of the structure, organization, and regulation of the zzso genes from different zzso species is described and speculated zzso
