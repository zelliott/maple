zzso scanning zzso has been used to identify specific side chains of insulin which strongly influence binding to the insulin zzso A total of 21 new insulin analog zzso were made, and in addition 7 high pressure liquid zzso zzso were tested, covering zzso zzso in positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A9, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data on the zzso revealed that the zzso zzso that were most disruptive for binding were at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in decreases in affinity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, relative to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso resulted in an increase in affinity for the insulin zzso The most striking finding is that zzso insulin retains high affinity binding to the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso from different species, and in the structure of the zzso it appears to be essential for the shift from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, replacing zzso with zzso most likely zzso the structure of the zzso in this region, but this structural change appears to enhance binding to the insulin zzso
