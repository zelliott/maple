Among the recently discovered zzso zzso immune evasion zzso zzso is unique in its ability to interact with components of both the zzso and innate immune systems of the zzso zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso bind zzso zzso domain IV zzso zzso binds the central complement protein zzso When linked to zzso zzso zzso a futile consumption of complement via alternative zzso zzso whereas isolated zzso specifically zzso the alternative zzso without complement zzso Here we have determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso by zzso zzso showing that zzso adopts a zzso bundle fold similar to those of the zzso zzso complement zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso spectrum of zzso indicates that this domain, essential for futile complement consumption, is zzso zzso at least when isolated from the rest of zzso zzso and zzso both bind zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite low overall sequence identity, zzso possesses the same zzso as zzso at two positions essential for zzso binding to zzso zzso to zzso of either of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso binding to zzso and zzso alternative zzso zzso The almost complete conservation of zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences across more than 30 strains isolated from human and animal hosts indicates that the unique mechanism of zzso in complement system zzso is a feature of infections of both humans and economically important zzso
