Here we describe the identification of a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the open reading frame of zzso consists of 600 bases zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso was constructed consisting of zzso green fluorescent protein zzso and cloned into a zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis indicated a high-level expression of soluble zzso protein in zzso coli zzso zzso Observation by zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso could successfully bind to the surface receptors of zzso zzso In zzso survival analysis revealed that zzso zzso was able to promote the survival of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The biological role of zzso does not seem to be restricted to proliferation zzso zzso may could served as a model zzso for further study of zzso
