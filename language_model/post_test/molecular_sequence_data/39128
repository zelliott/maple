zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, is abundant in zzso and differentiated cells where it plays an important role in the suppression of zzso zzso The zzso gene spans 6 zzso and has 10 zzso It contains a zzso zzso repeat tract in zzso 7, which is unstable in gastrointestinal zzso To further investigate a possible role of this gene in zzso we performed zzso analysis and expression studies in different zzso zzso human tumor tissue of the stomach, zzso breast and lung zzso zzso tumors of the colon zzso and small cell lung tumor cell lines zzso were screened for zzso zzso in the coding region of zzso No zzso was zzso zzso instability of the zzso zzso however, was documented in primary stomach and colon zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso transcript levels in tumor cell zzso Our data suggest that a direct involvement of zzso in zzso is unlikely, although increased zzso expression may be associated with human zzso
