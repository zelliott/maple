The transgenic zzso cell line zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso was treated with restriction zzso to assess zzso from defined DNA zzso zzso zzso in zzso were measured under two conditions: a stringent condition where selection ensured that the zzso zzso gene was retained functionally intact, or a relaxed condition without the requirement for zzso gene zzso Despite testing 18 different restriction zzso with various numbers of potential zzso within the zzso zzso were only found under relaxed selection zzso These zzso commonly led to complete loss of the zzso suggesting that large deletions predominate when selection is zzso It is argued, in comparison to zzso data for other zzso sites in zzso cells, that variations in the zzso target zzso for zzso may explain the response of the zzso under different zzso
