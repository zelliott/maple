zzso zzso zzso contributes significantly to the proteins of bovine seminal zzso The following proteins from bull seminal zzso were isolated and zzso major protein zzso zzso the basic proteins zzso II, zzso zzso protein zzso and seminal zzso protein zzso Using zzso against the proteins zzso II, zzso zzso zzso and major zzso the seminal zzso zzso was identified as the source of the respective zzso The zzso of bovine seminal zzso zzso proteins was studied by cell free translation of zzso zzso from seminal zzso and the respective zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso clones zzso of a zzso library of bull seminal zzso zzso zzso + zzso were screened by colony zzso using zzso zzso synthetic zzso The respective clone containing the longest zzso insert was zzso In case of major protein the Mr of the zzso zzso acid zzso precursor zzso was zzso as deduced from direct zzso zzso The precursor sequence of 25 zzso acid zzso has a zzso character and very likely constitutes a signal zzso directing the protein towards the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained no consensus sequence indicative of zzso
