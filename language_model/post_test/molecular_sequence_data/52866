We report the characterization of two members of a gene family from zzso that zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins in zzso coli confirmed that each had zzso zzso activity with a synthetic zzso zzso zzso or a biological zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was imported into intact zzso in zzso with zzso zzso of its approximately zzso zzso signal zzso The two zzso zzso exhibited divergent pH zzso tissue zzso and responses to zzso and environmental zzso Analysis of the zzso database indicated that there are probably at least two zzso genes and three zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes and their protein products was restricted to zzso zzso and was strongly induced following zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso genes were expressed at moderate levels in all zzso and were only zzso affected by zzso Exposure to a variety of zzso and zzso stresses showed relatively little effect on zzso gene zzso with the exception of leaves subjected to a long-term exposure to the cauliflower mosaic zzso These leaves showed a strong induction of the zzso gene after 2 to 3 weeks of chronic pathogen zzso These data suggest novel roles for zzso in zzso zzso and in pathogen defense responses in zzso
