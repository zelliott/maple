zzso is an zzso zzso that belongs to the earliest zzso branch of the zzso lineage of zzso zzso zzso adaptation for survival outside the zzso zzso by zzso into zzso zzso zzso involves the synthesis and transport of zzso wall constituents to the plasma membrane for release and zzso zzso Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular events related to zzso wall zzso in zzso Among the components of the zzso wall there are two proteins that we have previously identified and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins is zzso zzso and both concentrated within zzso zzso zzso before their zzso zzso Although highly similar to each other at the zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso zzso acid zzso Here, we show that this extension, rich in basic zzso is zzso from zzso before zzso wall formation by an zzso zzso zzso activity, which is induced during zzso like zzso zzso zzso prevent release of zzso wall materials, abolishing zzso wall zzso We also report the zzso zzso and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso responsible for the zzso processing of zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses unique characteristics compared with zzso from higher zzso such as a zzso domain and a short zzso zzso These features make this zzso the most divergent zzso C identified to date and provide new insights regarding zzso wall formation in zzso
