It is known from DNA zzso and other studies that zzso plasmids are widely distributed across species of this zzso However few comparisons have been performed of the structure of apparently identical plasmids in widely differing geographical and biological zzso We compare pairs of circular and linear zzso plasmids from distant geographical zzso The circular plasmids zzso and zzso were from different zzso of zzso zzso and the linear plasmids zzso and zzso were from different species zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structures are highly similar at the sequence level showing that they are closely zzso Most of the differences are outside the zzso genes zzso for zzso Furthermore, most of the proposed functional motifs have been zzso zzso divergence is compatible with a distribution model by vertical descent from a common zzso but horizontal transmission cannot be ruled zzso
