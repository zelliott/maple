Clinical zzso often display suitable sensitivity but some lack of specificity or vice zzso As a zzso between specificity improvement and sensitivity loss, zzso were designed to perform indirect zzso with zzso detection using zzso zzso receptors to react with the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso were designed to favor their oriented zzso zzso This allows the zzso to properly expose their zzso to efficiently capture the zzso and to withstand severe chemical treatment to zzso the zzso By further binding the secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the soluble zzso and the zzso zzso a current that increased with the zzso concentration was zzso zzso using the zzso constructions showed zzso specificity with samples that had revealed zzso results when using other zzso A protein bearing a zzso chain and zzso as directing elements displayed the highest zzso ratio zzso The limit of detection was 62 zzso zzso which is eight times lower than that obtained with a currently used commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso The signal was approximately zzso of the original one after performing 10 consecutive zzso
