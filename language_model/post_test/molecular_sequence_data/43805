zzso zzso is believed to be required for proper zzso in zzso zzso zzso As was previously reported, the expression of zzso zzso gene increased during the transition of zzso zzso zzso cells from growth to zzso We have casually cloned an interesting zzso zzso by the differential plaque zzso zzso had no coding region, and was expressed more predominantly in the growth phase than in the differentiation zzso zzso this gene was found to zzso the complementary sequence of zzso zzso zzso it is most likely that the zzso zzso may regulate the zzso zzso synthesis by the natural zzso transcript via an zzso zzso interaction, thus resulting in striking increase of zzso zzso production in the zzso of cells from growth to zzso Since zzso zzso is known to be coded for by a single gene in zzso the zzso zzso seemed to be zzso in the same genetic locus as the zzso zzso zzso
