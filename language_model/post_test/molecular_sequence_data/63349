zzso challenge in zzso is frequently accompanied by zzso of the zzso a reaction triggered by the zzso of zzso zzso Because their immature stages are spent inside the zzso of insect larvae, zzso have evolved strategies to escape or counter zzso zzso Very little molecular information is available on these zzso zzso We have sought to shed light on the zzso of zzso in the spruce zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by cloning two host zzso zzso and studying their zzso regulation after zzso The two zzso are zzso by transcripts of approximately zzso zzso (for zzso and zzso zzso (for zzso and possess structural features typical of other insect zzso While there appears to be a single zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso we detected three zzso zzso zzso displaying zzso in the 3' untranslated region, suggesting that there may be more than one zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed at high levels in zzso zzso 6th zzso and zzso by zzso zzso had no apparent impact on the level of their zzso zzso of a large dose zzso zzso of zzso zzso fluid extracted from zzso zzso which is known to inhibit zzso in zzso zzso only caused a transient decrease in zzso and zzso transcript zzso at 2-3 d post zzso It thus appears that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso plays a minor role in the zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
