Elm zzso group zzso zzso which are associated with devastating diseases in zzso zzso zzso cherry, zzso and several other plant species in America, Europe and Asia, represent one of the most diverse zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso form a discrete zzso within the zzso zzso Three zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso have been evaluated for their usefulness in zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences differentiated the zzso zzso group zzso into five zzso Twelve zzso zzso were differentiated on the basis of zzso protein and 13 were differentiated using zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein genes and zzso gene alone or in combination indicated that the zzso constitute 12 genetically distinct zzso each of which appears to have evolved under different ecological constraints such as specific zzso or plant zzso On the basis of unique DNA and biological properties, it is proposed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso
