zzso von zzso disease designated as type I New York or type zzso is characterized by enhanced zzso zzso zzso with normal von zzso factor zzso distribution in zzso We have studied four such patients belonging to three unrelated families and found in all of them a unique zzso transition changing the zzso for zzso zzso to zzso zzso In three patients the zzso zzso also had a silent zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso Both zzso changes are present in the von zzso factor zzso however, the characterization of distinctive markers where the gene and zzso zzso as well as the examination of amplified zzso derived from zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso occurs in the von zzso factor gene of the zzso Moreover, zzso expression of the isolated zzso zzso domain of von zzso factor provided direct evidence that the zzso zzso is responsible for enhanced zzso zzso to lower zzso zzso These results define a new structural element affecting the affinity of von zzso factor for zzso zzso and establish the molecular basis of a zzso form of von zzso zzso
