Here, we describe for the first time the zzso zzso repression zzso protein from the soil zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso varied according to the growth zzso A strain with a disrupted zzso gene showed the same growth as the wild type on a number of carbon zzso zzso zzso repression by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso breakdown, was strongly reduced in the zzso strain, whereas in the zzso strain it underwent strong zzso zzso This strong effect was not based on zzso regulation because the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not reflect the zzso in the absence of zzso zzso transcript abundance was slightly increased in the zzso zzso Lack of zzso dramatically increased the zzso stability of the zzso transcript (up to zzso whereas two other transcripts zzso and zzso remained zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso by zzso was not significantly different in the absence of zzso as zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso zzso is involved in the determination of the transcript stability of the zzso zzso and thereby effects zzso zzso
