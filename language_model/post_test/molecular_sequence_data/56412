The rate of association of three zzso zzso peptides with zzso zzso was examined to provide more detailed information on the relationship between zzso length and the zzso of zzso zzso When added to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso from a zzso solution, a ten zzso zzso rapidly decreased the zzso of the zzso However, a related zzso zzso had only a minimal effect on zzso zzso A zzso zzso was intermediate in zzso Similarly, when zzso were added to peptides dissolved in an zzso zzso the ten zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso cleared the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was intermediate in zzso The rate of binding to the zzso was compared with the three peptides by zzso of the zzso of energy transfer from the single zzso zzso of the peptides to a fluorescent probe in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the ten zzso zzso effectively transferred energy to the probe, while that of the zzso zzso was less zzso Little or no energy transfer was observed with the zzso zzso The binding of the 10 zzso zzso was rapid and complete within zzso 100 zzso The zzso zzso bound more slowly, but still within zzso The time frames for binding are an order of magnitude shorter than those observed for zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso zzso clearing and zzso binding zzso is discussed in terms of a possible competing zzso interaction in the zzso phase and a slow zzso of the zzso zzso
