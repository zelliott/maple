zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso are found in a human zzso zzso encephalitis zzso and were hypothesized as the major cause for the zzso loss, chronic inflammatory changes and zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso To establish the zzso potential and mechanism of action of such zzso we raised zzso zzso against specific peptides of the zzso protein and studied their ability to zzso zzso and kill zzso Mice were zzso with two zzso specific zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso and with a scrambled zzso zzso for zzso High levels of zzso to each of these peptides were zzso with no cross zzso between zzso zzso to the zzso zzso were found to bind to cultured zzso evoke zzso zzso channel activity, and kill zzso In contrast, zzso against zzso zzso bound to zzso but failed to activate the zzso or kill zzso zzso zzso had no zzso Both the zzso of the zzso and the zzso death induced by zzso zzso were blocked by zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso killing was independent of zzso This indicates a mechanism of zzso death due to zzso of the zzso a phenomenon known to be caused by excess of zzso zzso zzso zzso retained the zzso killing capacity, and killing was completely and specifically blocked by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso death induced by zzso zzso took place primarily via zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso to a specific zzso of the zzso can kill zzso by an zzso zzso thus mimicking the effects of excess of zzso This is the first example that zzso can lead to zzso death in a zzso zzso manner, via zzso of a zzso neurotransmitter zzso
