The zzso zzso virus zzso an aquatic zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is processed through the zzso activity of its own zzso zzso to liberate itself and the viral proteins zzso X and zzso The protein zzso is further processed by zzso to give rise to the zzso protein zzso and four structural zzso We report here the crystal structure of a zzso zzso from zzso which displays a zzso zzso zzso in its active zzso This is the first crystal structure of a zzso zzso and the first crystal structure of a viral zzso that zzso a zzso general base in its zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso binding site is consistent with the zzso zzso specificity and a zzso attack from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Despite low levels of sequence identity, zzso shows similarities in its active site to other characterized zzso zzso such as signal zzso zzso zzso and Lon zzso Together, the structure of zzso provides insights into the mechanism of a recently characterized clan of zzso zzso that zzso a zzso general base and reveals the structure of potential targets for zzso therapy, especially for other related and economically important zzso such as infectious zzso disease virus in poultry and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in zzso
