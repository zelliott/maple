The association of zzso with marine sponges was first described 15 years ago and their role in the zzso process in Mediterranean and tropical sponges has been zzso Here we explore the occurrence and abundance of potential zzso zzso zzso in four zzso different zzso sponges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso and upper zzso zone zzso added on 30 December 2011, after first online publication on 19 December zzso The term zzso zzso has been zzso of the Norwegian coast, and relate them to zzso rates determined in laboratory zzso Net zzso rates, calculated from the sum of zzso and nitrate release during 24 zzso were up to 1880 zzso N zzso zzso zzso comparable with those measured in Mediterranean zzso Furthermore, a high abundance of zzso cells was determined by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso targeting zzso zzso genes zzso the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes as well as zzso transcripts were either exclusively zzso from zzso or were orders of zzso higher in abundance than their bacterial zzso zzso analyses of zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of specific populations of zzso zzso in the sponge zzso which either were affiliated with groups detected earlier in marine sponges or were typical inhabitants of zzso and deep-water zzso zzso zzso zzso rates for zzso were zzso to 6 zzso N zzso zzso zzso thus comparable with zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as the major drivers of zzso in four zzso zzso and indicate that these zzso may be considered as a relevant factor in nitrogen cycling in ocean regions with high sponge zzso
