Based on the character of strong promoter of the zzso gene and high level zzso of zzso of zzso zzso we amplified the promoter of heavy chain gene zzso and its downstream signal zzso sequence zzso by zzso After that, we cloned the zzso product in zzso SK zzso to form the zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso The sequence identity was zzso comparable to that of the reported sequence by zzso on zzso Then we zzso zzso with Sal zzso I to get zzso DNA zzso and zzso it into zzso zzso to generate a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso After identified the zzso zzso by restriction zzso zzso we zzso zzso into zzso cells by zzso From the cells zzso with the zzso zzso what the red zzso could be detected verified that the zzso zzso could express zzso in zzso cells zzso Furthermore, when zzso had been injected with the zzso zzso zzso red zzso could be observed in the zzso of silk zzso of zzso The result indicated that zzso expressed zzso and was zzso into zzso of the silk zzso zzso we supposed that the cloned sequence zzso possessed signal zzso zzso Moreover, this study would lay a foundation for the research on zzso expression of zzso gene by silk zzso zzso
