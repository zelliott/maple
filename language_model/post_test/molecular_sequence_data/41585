Living stock cultures with constant zzso and zzso are required for a wide range of research and industrial zzso however, zzso stable preservation of fastidious zzso strains has been zzso In this study, we systematically evaluated different zzso treatments to identify and clarify zzso zzso and other conditions appropriate for long-term zzso zzso preservation conditions were largely zzso with robust strains remaining fully viable and the fastidious yielding lower recovery under all test zzso Nevertheless, several procedures were shown to be generally zzso for effective zzso of most zzso zzso zzso strains retained higher viability following the zzso freezing protocol (Mr zzso than either of two widely used programmed freezing zzso Revival was higher when frozen zzso plugs were thawed at zzso for zzso or zzso for zzso while lower viability was apparent for fastidious strains thawed at zzso for zzso Among 15 zzso solutions zzso zzso zzso zzso produced the highest viability for all fastidious zzso The effect of zzso and zzso treatments on revival was mild, if any, and zzso This study has generated reliable, practical, long-term preservation solutions zzso to a majority of zzso zzso It also has revealed a need for in-depth zzso and zzso investigations to further enhance the preservation methods for fastidious zzso
