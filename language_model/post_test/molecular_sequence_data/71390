The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso in which zzso resistance to the zzso zzso A, is necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report the molecular cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso A single point zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso a high level of resistance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was used to identify its zzso in other zzso species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of an zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso showed zzso identity to that of zzso zzso The zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso shared common characteristics in primary structure, including zzso zzso profile, and zzso sites, with their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso resistance gene is zzso zzso in various zzso
