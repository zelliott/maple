The animal pathogen zzso zzso contains a gene zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso development zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains recovered the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor induction in zzso zzso and zzso occupancy in zzso zzso all traits strictly associated with the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sequencing revealed that zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame coding for a predicted membrane protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso that is zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso motifs and the ABC signature domain features of a typical ABC zzso zzso of zzso was carried out by the construction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso do not transport zzso zzso to the zzso as shown by the absence of zzso zzso zzso and they display reduced zzso in mice and defective zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso must be transported into the zzso space to exert its action as a zzso zzso
