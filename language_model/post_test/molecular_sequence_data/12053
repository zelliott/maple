zzso are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory zzso However, a small proportion of patients is resistant to the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso and zzso binding studies suggest that the molecular zzso in steroid resistance lies zzso to nuclear zzso We have previously reported that there is a decreased ability of zzso receptors zzso to bind to the zzso site in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso after zzso zzso This reduced DNA binding was due to a decrease in the number of receptors available rather than an zzso in affinity for zzso To study this reduced DNA zzso we examined the ability of the nuclear zzso zzso factors zzso protein 1 zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso to bind to their zzso sites and to interact with zzso in zzso from patients with zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant reduction in the interaction between zzso and zzso in these zzso patients, although interaction with other zzso factors activated in inflammation zzso B and zzso was zzso An increase in the zzso levels of zzso DNA binding was also detected in the zzso from zzso zzso zzso There were no differences in the amount of zzso zzso detected for the components of zzso zzso and zzso nor in the sequences of these zzso zzso These results suggest either that the ability of the zzso to bind to zzso response elements and zzso is altered in zzso patients or that increased levels of zzso prevent zzso DNA zzso and that this may be the molecular basis of resistance to the zzso effect of steroids in these zzso
