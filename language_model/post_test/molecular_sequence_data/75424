zzso zzso duplex zzso having different average numbers of zzso tracts zzso per zzso turn were zzso into zzso and analyzed by zzso on zzso zzso The magnitude of the anomaly in gel mobility is found to be a zzso function of the zzso of the DNA zzso zzso that describe intrinsic DNA bending, expressed as the tilt and roll components of the zzso zzso at the junctions between the zzso tract and adjacent zzso were adjusted to fit the measured relative zzso of regularly repeated DNA zzso sequences known from other studies and zzso for this zzso The model developed here retains the predominance of zzso in the direction of tilt at the junctions but incorporates an appreciable roll component at the zzso end of an zzso zzso opening the minor groove zzso This feature is consistent with chemical zzso experiments on molecules containing zzso zzso The overall direction of zzso is effectively toward the minor groove, viewed from the center of an A5 or A6 zzso A possible underlying structure, which can also be described by a wedge zzso model, is that derived from fiber zzso studies of zzso However, alternative models for the zzso zzso such as zzso twisted DNA, cannot be zzso although they do not lead to the correct direction of zzso The results permit calculation of the zzso trajectory of natural DNA molecules containing zzso zzso
