zzso zzso directed by specific A zzso zzso proteins zzso is a mechanism for zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Using a zzso screen, a novel zzso was zzso Because it interacts with both the type I and type II regulatory zzso it was defined as a dual specific zzso or zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of another novel zzso isolated from that zzso This new member of the zzso family, zzso also binds both types of regulatory zzso A message of 5 zzso pairs was detected for zzso in all embryonic stages and in all adult zzso zzso In brain, skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso a zzso zzso was zzso In zzso several small zzso were zzso zzso zzso represents a novel family of zzso zzso cloning from a mouse zzso library identified the full length zzso It is composed of zzso zzso acids which includes the R binding fragment, zzso zzso at its zzso Based on zzso zzso the R binding domain interacts with the zzso zzso domain of zzso and zzso A putative zzso domain was identified near the zzso region of zzso The presence of this domain raises the intriguing possibility that zzso may interact with a zzso protein thus providing a link between the signaling machinery at the plasma membrane and the downstream zzso
