Wilson disease zzso in the zzso population has an approximate zzso of zzso live zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene in this population reported in our previous articles led us to the characterization of two common zzso and a group of 13 rare zzso accounting for the molecular zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso However, molecular analysis of the zzso zzso containing the most common zzso which accounts for zzso of the zzso zzso failed to define the zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the promoter and the zzso zzso of the zzso gene sequence and carried out a zzso analysis in this DNA region from patients with the most common zzso The promoter is contained in a zzso island and shows a zzso and a zzso consensus sequence as well as potential binding sites for zzso factors and metal response zzso In all the analyzed 92 zzso with this zzso we detected a single zzso consisting of a zzso deletion from position zzso to position zzso relative to the translation start zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso reduction in the zzso activity of the zzso sequence compared to the normal zzso By adding this zzso to those that have been already zzso we have now defined the molecular zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso The high frequency, the expected prevention by zzso diagnosis and early treatment of the devastating effect of zzso on the nervous system and liver zzso and the feasibility to detect most of molecular defects by DNA analysis indicate that zzso in the zzso population should be added to the list of diseases currently detected by newborn zzso
