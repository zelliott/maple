One of the critical zzso involved in vitamin E zzso in plants is zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the full-length DNA of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from cultivated peanuts zzso zzso The full-length DNA of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was isolated from the wild zzso species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso was zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and zzso both have a DNA sequence that is zzso zzso long and encodes zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the 2 zzso acid sequences was zzso The zzso of cultivated zzso 2 peanut samples was zzso zzso long, with 3 zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso 2 zzso was zzso zzso long, with 3 zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso across 13 cultivated peanut samples was zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were from A- and zzso respectively, with zzso zzso between the 2 zzso The present study demonstrated that abundant zzso were present in the zzso genes from different zzso Additionally, zzso were observed in the zzso zzso of the 13 zzso and wild zzso zzso species but not in the zzso zzso of the 13 zzso and wild zzso zzso zzso
