zzso production has always been considered a zzso characteristic of zzso in the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso production can be lost by an zzso species during routine culture zzso This is the first report of any marine zzso zzso ever to have completely lost the ability to produce zzso A zzso toxic isolate of zzso zzso from zzso has been maintained in culture since zzso In 1992, a subculture was established and sent to a different zzso Recent comparisons of the parental strain and the subculture revealed that the former had lost its zzso whereas the latter still produces zzso This loss of toxicity was confirmed by three independent toxin detection zzso mouse zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of different zzso zzso demonstrated that the toxic and zzso cultures are genetically identical for those zzso zzso analysis showed that both cultures have the same plate zzso and are zzso zzso These results strongly argue that the loss of toxicity is not a result of a zzso artifact or mistake, such as zzso or zzso The zzso cultures also show a significant difference in zzso zzso explanations for the change include genetic zzso or the effects of prolonged treatment of the zzso culture with zzso
