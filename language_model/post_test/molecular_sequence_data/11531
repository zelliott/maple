zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease zzso by progressive zzso zzso instability and an increased risk of zzso The zzso zzso zzso Group C zzso gene is zzso in patients of zzso group zzso Several different forms of zzso zzso that share the same coding region have been zzso At least two species result from the use of alternative zzso at the zzso end and three result from the use of distinct zzso zzso As a first step toward the characterization of this gene we have isolated the zzso clones corresponding to the zzso region, including a putative promoter and two alternate zzso zzso These zzso named zzso and zzso were found to be separated by a small zzso with zzso zzso located zzso to zzso zzso Further, these zzso are flanked by consensus sequences of donor sites at the zzso ends of zzso An zzso zzso site was not evident zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not spliced onto zzso zzso The sequences upstream of zzso zzso and zzso have no obvious zzso or zzso boxes but include zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sequence upstream of the putative zzso start site of both alternative zzso indicates that the region upstream zzso zzso is sufficient to drive the expression of the zzso reporter gene in zzso cells and that the zzso regulation of this gene is zzso
