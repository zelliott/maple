zzso is a zzso family of zzso related cell surface zzso and zzso implicated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell migration, and tumor zzso zzso exists as a standard form and as multiple zzso each generated by alternative zzso of up to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parts of the zzso zzso Using zzso reverse zzso and Southern zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso was examined in 10 zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso 9 zzso 2 cases of zzso and 3 zzso normal zzso zzso The amount of input zzso for the zzso zzso was standardized against an internal control gene zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso showed significant zzso of zzso transcripts zzso between 750 and 1000 zzso These cases demonstrated reduced levels of the zzso standard zzso zzso In six zzso zzso we found a prominent zzso zzso at 750 zzso that was present in only trace amounts in normal zzso zzso It is of interest that similar findings were seen in the majority of the zzso and zzso but not in the cases of zzso These results show that deregulation of alternative zzso zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso zzso cell growth, both in zzso and zzso zzso The data imply an important role for zzso including zzso in the zzso of various zzso zzso
