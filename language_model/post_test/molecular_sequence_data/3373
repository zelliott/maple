Genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a nitrate zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso An incomplete zzso motif reminiscent of that for a zzso cluster binding was found in the zzso zzso and complete zzso arrangements for binding one zzso cluster and three zzso clusters were found in the zzso zzso In conjunction with chemical, electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we firmly establish that the zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso member of the known zzso nitrate zzso whose zzso are found in the bacterial zzso
