This study describes a modified zzso zzso for zzso activity in flexible zzso zzso plates using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The utility of this zzso was demonstrated in a screen for zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by a modified staggered extension process zzso zzso An zzso coli library of zzso zzso zzso clones was screened yielding two identical active zzso zzso zzso Two motifs zzso in zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was found to exhibit high zzso activity zzso zzso Finally, the modified zzso method is much more efficient than the conventional ones and greatly reduces zzso time from 4 days to less than 20 zzso
