zzso zzso or zzso of zzso factors is an important mechanism of zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso This paper describes a combination of techniques that can be used to study the effect of this zzso protein modification on the zzso activity of zzso zzso The protein of interest is genetically zzso with zzso to allow rapid zzso on zzso columns after being zzso zzso in zzso tissue culture zzso zzso zzso activity is determined in a zzso zzso including an in zzso zzso zzso Studies on the zzso zzso factor zzso employing this zzso revealed a zzso protein zzso event that strongly increases the zzso potential of the zzso Our data confirm the results published recently by others and provide a zzso efficient, sensitive, and zzso experimental system to analyze the zzso zzso in the zzso activity of zzso zzso
