zzso c zzso zzso II zzso of zzso zzso is zzso within zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso acid leader zzso is processed after export to the zzso zzso Leader peptides are relatively unusual in zzso coded zzso indeed zzso zzso lacks a leader zzso We generated two deletions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso removing either the leader zzso zzso or the leader zzso and processing site zzso without altering either the promoter or the zzso zzso zzso zzso When inserted into zzso both deletions substantially reduced the zzso levels of zzso and caused a tight zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso for the original zzso zzso and a p- zzso whose deletion fused the first 251 zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso b to the zzso zzso The resulting fusion protein was processed to yield functional zzso Thus, the presence of zzso zzso b sequence zzso the need for the zzso leader zzso We propose that the zzso leader zzso contains a targeting signal necessary for membrane zzso without which it remains in the zzso and is rapidly zzso
