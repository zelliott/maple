zzso of the bacterial cell wall zzso zzso by addition of an zzso group to the zzso zzso group of zzso zzso is known to inhibit the activity of zzso zzso of innate immune zzso The zzso of zzso also zzso the action of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso that require a free zzso zzso group to generate their zzso zzso This class of zzso is ubiquitous in zzso bacteria as they are responsible for zzso of pores and zzso spore formation, and the general metabolism of zzso We recently discovered a cluster of genes in the zzso zzso zzso that are proposed to participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pfeffer, zzso zzso and Clarke, zzso zzso (2005) zzso zzso 5, zzso In the current study, we demonstrate that one of these zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned and zzso in zzso coli as a fusion protein with a zzso zzso The expressed protein was zzso to apparent zzso and zzso for activity as an zzso using three different zzso involving zzso liquid zzso and zzso detection methods which measured the release of zzso zzso from a variety of zzso and soluble zzso These zzso demonstrated that zzso has a higher specific activity on zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the first zzso characterized as an zzso zzso The zzso and kinetic parameters of zzso were determined using soluble zzso zzso for zzso Thus, its pH zzso for stability and activity were observed to be zzso and zzso respectively, while its optimum temperature for activity was 55 degrees zzso Two forms of truncated zzso are generated in zzso coli, one lacked the complete predicted zzso signal zzso while the second involved a zzso zzso within this signal zzso The smaller truncated form was localized predominantly to the zzso whereas the larger form was mainly associated with the outer zzso and to a lesser extent, the zzso zzso sites expected for the maintenance of zzso
