Despite their high sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso selectively block zzso and zzso calcium channels, zzso To study the recognition mechanism of calcium channel zzso two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by exchanging their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso calcium channels showed that zzso acid zzso restricted to the zzso half are important for the recognition of zzso channels, whereas essential zzso for zzso channel recognition are widely spread over the whole zzso zzso
