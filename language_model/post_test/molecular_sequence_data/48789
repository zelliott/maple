To study the zzso spectrum of hand, foot and mouth disease zzso and the molecular zzso of human zzso 71 zzso isolated from the clinical specimens of zzso patients in Inner Mongolia in zzso A total of 921 clinical specimens including stools and throat zzso were collected from zzso patients in zzso service in Inner Mongolia and then viral isolation was performed, the positive viral zzso were identified by using the real-time zzso method zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a single zzso and zzso and zzso coding region amplification and sequencing was performed with the viral zzso that were identified as zzso zzso zzso A total of 153 viruses were isolated form 921 clinical zzso the positive rate was zzso of which 61 zzso were zzso 82 zzso were zzso 7 zzso were other zzso were zzso and 1 was polio vaccine virus type zzso and 3 zzso were zzso Nine viruses were isolated from severe cases, of which 6 were zzso and 3 were zzso Thirty two zzso zzso were selected from the patients presenting mild symptoms and the patients presenting severe symptoms randomly, and the zzso coding regions of represented zzso zzso were amplified and zzso Finally the zzso tree was constructed among the zzso coding regions of the different zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso acid and zzso acid of 32 represented zzso strains in Inner Mongolia were closed to zzso strains isolated from mainland China since 2007, especially from Beijing in 2008, and it showed that all zzso strains clustered within the zzso evolution branch of C4 zzso There was slight difference in the zzso and the zzso acid sequence in zzso region among the 32 Inner Mongolia zzso zzso the identity were zzso and zzso respectively, and there was a little difference in the zzso acid sequence between the zzso strains from Inner Mongolia in 2010 and in 2007, the identity was from zzso to zzso Thirty two zzso strains were in different lineages in the zzso tree, and it indicated that these strains belonged to many different viral transmission zzso zzso and zzso were the main pathogens of zzso in Inner Mongolia in 2010 and most severe cases were caused by zzso All the zzso strains circulated in Inner Mongolia belonged to zzso evolution branch within C4 zzso zzso analysis revealed that 2010 Inner Mongolia zzso strains were located in different zzso and had more zzso identity with 2008 Beijing zzso strains than with 2007 Inner Mongolia zzso zzso This indicated that Inner Mongolia zzso strains had not evolved zzso but zzso with the zzso strains in other provinces in mainland zzso
