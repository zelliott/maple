The systematic relationships of the freshwater shrimp family, zzso were examined using zzso and nuclear DNA zzso Combined nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses placed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a strongly supported zzso within the zzso in a close relationship with the zzso zzso zzso of the Australian zzso was strongly supported by the molecular zzso zzso net divergence times between zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso equate to a late zzso zzso Within zzso each locality was distinct for zzso zzso zzso suggesting long-term isolation or recent genetic zzso a lack of contemporary gene flow amongst sites and a small zzso zzso groupings within zzso were largely zzso with several previously zzso zzso zzso net divergence times between zzso zzso and the new zzso zzso equate to a split in the late zzso zzso The hypothesis that the zzso is comprised of zzso species in zzso ecological niches is not supported by the molecular data, which instead suggest a relatively recent origin for the group in northern Australia, sometime in the late zzso or zzso
