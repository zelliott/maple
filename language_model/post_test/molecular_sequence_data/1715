zzso zzso zzso possesses two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso which have the potential to zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso acid sequences zzso by both genes show similarity to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso In order to study the significance of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso infection, we generated two different virus strains in which the zzso open reading frame is zzso zzso of these zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso was evaluated in zzso and in zzso Both strains were found to replicate with a similar efficiency as zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, in contrast to zzso virus, neither zzso nor zzso established a zzso infection in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, in a local, rat zzso infection model, both zzso viruses induced a significantly lower amount of paw swelling than did zzso zzso Also, a higher number of zzso zzso was observed in zzso infected with zzso zzso than in those infected with the zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso promotes inflammation at initial sites of zzso and, zzso efficient virus dissemination to or infection of the zzso zzso and zzso might be involved in the persistence of virus infection, at least in the zzso In addition, our data indicate that zzso represents the functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
