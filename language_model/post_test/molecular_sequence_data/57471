zzso necrosis factor zzso can promote zzso cell transcription, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and influencing cellular zzso In this report, the role of the protein zzso C zzso zzso in zzso zzso induction of zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso medium obtained from zzso zzso cultures by zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso zzso zzso indicate that the decrease in zzso activity observed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was a direct result of decreased zzso zzso zzso and not a consequence of increased zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso was specific for zzso increased zzso expression because zzso induction of zzso was not influenced by these zzso Northern zzso analyses also showed that zzso inhibitor treatment of zzso cells resulted in a decreased zzso level of zzso zzso with no measurable change in zzso zzso in cultures incubated with zzso zzso of cellular zzso by 18 hours of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell cultures abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was specific for zzso because zzso zzso zzso of cells, which does not stimulate zzso was ineffective in altering zzso induction of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso directly with zzso zzso and zzso V increased zzso cell levels of zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, this increase in zzso cell zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso could be inhibited with zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso acquire the ability to invade zzso zzso and reorganize into zzso structures when grown on zzso culture dishes, a behavior blocked by zzso but not by zzso zzso In zzso these data zzso a role for the zzso zzso in the zzso induction of zzso zzso subsequent zzso zzso and the formation of zzso structures, a process important in zzso wound healing, and zzso zzso
