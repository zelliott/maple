zzso is reaching epidemic proportions in developed countries and represents a significant risk factor for hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and zzso zzso zzso constitute at least zzso of zzso zzso thus implicating zzso that affect zzso as likely candidates for disease zzso A recent study suggested that genes associated with obesity were significantly enriched for rare zzso zzso Here, we examined these zzso and revealed that they are located near zzso junctions and tend to affect zzso zzso regulatory zzso We also show that the majority of the zzso that harbor these zzso are zzso zzso yet they exhibit weak zzso sites, typical to alternatively spliced zzso and are hence zzso for recognition by the zzso machinery and prone to become alternatively zzso Using ex zzso zzso we tested a few representative zzso and show that they indeed affect zzso by causing a shift from a zzso to an alternative pattern, suggesting a possible link between extreme body mass index and abnormal zzso zzso
