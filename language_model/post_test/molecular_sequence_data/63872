We report the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and the zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso is a zzso of 140 zzso that recognizes zzso and zzso as zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso The alignment of the zzso acid sequences of zzso with zzso zzso whose zzso structures have been solved indicates that the zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso and zzso sites are zzso zzso is highly zzso with an optimum temperature of 100 degrees C and is characterized by extreme zzso stability zzso zzso 106 degrees zzso and kinetic stability zzso residual activity after 1 h incubation at 90 degrees zzso Limited zzso indicated that the only zzso zzso site is localized in the zzso region and that the zzso zzso is necessary for the integrity of the active zzso The structure of the zzso determined by zzso modeling provides insight into the zzso analyses as well as into mechanisms of zzso zzso This is the first zzso zzso from zzso
