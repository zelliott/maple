The zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso has been attributed mainly to the host zzso activity of the viral zzso zzso zzso which zzso both nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso thereby effectively suppressing the synthesis of type I zzso zzso The M protein from persistently zzso cells was shown to zzso characteristic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso implicated in zzso zzso This study demonstrates that infection of human zzso with zzso zzso containing the zzso substitution resulted in zzso zzso whereas neither the zzso nor the zzso substitution zzso an zzso zzso Only when zzso was combined with zzso were the host zzso activity of the M protein abolished and zzso zzso independently of zzso The zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso zzso did not affect host zzso zzso zzso zzso containing all four zzso acid zzso retained zzso properties in both zzso cells and zzso primary zzso zzso death was associated with the formation of giant zzso cells, suggesting that the fusion activity of the zzso G protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso G protein or with a deletion of the G gene showed significantly reduced zzso properties and caused long-lasting infections in zzso cells and mouse zzso slice zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso expressing zzso M protein remained zzso These findings indicate that the host zzso activity of the M protein dominates zzso zzso whilst the zzso G protein is mainly responsible for the zzso remaining with zzso zzso
