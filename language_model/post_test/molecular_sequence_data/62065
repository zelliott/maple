Several families of zzso zzso zzso are expressed in zzso zzso zzso and are implicated in aspects of zzso development and zzso We characterized the structure of abundant zzso transcripts in mouse zzso In addition to the 7 zzso full-length type I and 5 zzso type I deleted zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified and cloned an abundant 2 zzso transcript zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso gene family, which contains an zzso long terminal repeat zzso in the 3' untranslated region zzso The zzso signal for the transcript is provided by the inserted zzso zzso This sequence is zzso to zzso and is therefore zzso as zzso The transcript encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids and has a domain zzso similar to previously described zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso produced a structure in good agreement with an existing zzso structure for mouse zzso The zzso zzso is widely distributed among zzso mouse strains but is not found in zzso zzso or in wild zzso Cloning of the zzso region downstream of the zzso zzso site from the zzso strain indicates that the zzso consists of a solo zzso without additional zzso zzso and identified the original zzso zzso signal sequence downstream of the zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso 7 using the European collaborative zzso mouse zzso zzso panel, and to zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso which contains other members of the zzso gene family, by zzso chain reaction zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from adult and fetal mouse zzso and in zzso zzso to zzso mouse zzso indicated that zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso zzso We detected a small, but statistically zzso bias in zzso of transmission of zzso to the offspring of zzso zzso However, a larger study would be required to determine whether this zzso is selectively advantageous to the developing zzso
