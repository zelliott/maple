zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that remains an important constraint for the development of cattle industries zzso The existence of different strains and zzso has long been described in this zzso However, few molecular markers have been reported for strain zzso and zzso zzso sequences show high levels of variation and therefore provide excellent tools for both the zzso and population genetic zzso In this work we report a set of five molecular markers containing zzso that showed a variable degree of zzso in several American zzso We have used a zzso approach to search for marker sequences contained in open reading zzso Five genes were chosen and zzso were designed in zzso regions zzso the repeat zzso Two of the genes were the previously described zzso and zzso The other three genes were named zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso by zzso sequencing and comparative analysis of 11 strains from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico and USA determined that the tandem repeats varied in number and sequence among the zzso Genome analysis of the five markers revealed that they were single copy and distributed across the four zzso zzso zzso When the new markers were analyzed in an experimental infection, absolute sequence conservation was found, indicating the stability of these markers during the course of zzso These markers were also stable during three syringe passages through zzso The application of this panel of molecular markers could provide new molecular tools for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and analysis of changes in zzso populations following zzso
