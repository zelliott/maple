Two major issues severely limit the studies of human zzso zzso factors in nonhuman zzso First, zzso and zzso specific for the detection and zzso of human zzso do not all function when zzso to zzso the nonhuman zzso zzso Second, although most of the human zzso appear to induce similar, if not zzso zzso function when used with cells from nonhuman primates in zzso or in zzso they invariably induce zzso responses in zzso zzso their repeated and/or continued use in zzso Our laboratory has thus initiated studies to zzso zzso and prepare zzso zzso from nonhuman primates and to define zzso and zzso for their detection and zzso at the zzso acid and protein zzso The data that were derived from such studies show that the nonhuman zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share 93 to zzso zzso at the zzso acid and protein level with the human zzso The most prominent differences between human and nonhuman zzso zzso sequences were noted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The aligned sequences of zzso for human and several nonhuman zzso species are provided zzso and a zzso analysis of the published sequences of select zzso from other species, along with those of the nonhuman zzso are zzso In addition, comparative analysis of the relative zzso of our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with commercially available human zzso zzso is described zzso
