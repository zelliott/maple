We investigated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with 62 new zzso sequences from single cells of 32 marine and freshwater species in 20 zzso including the first zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 23 ITS sequences of 17 species in 15 zzso zzso zzso suggested a zzso position for zzso distant to other zzso We propose zzso zzso zzso for this divergent zzso keeping the family zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso species zzso in at least two separate groups and, unexpectedly, zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not belong to the family zzso which is restricted to zzso zzso and also zzso (formerly in the family zzso The oceanic zzso zzso zzso close to an zzso freshwater zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed a well supported zzso with several zzso species at a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and ITS sequences were identical or almost zzso zzso we propose zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso use of zzso isolation and sequencing revealed unexpected complexity in the evolutionary history of these relatively well-studied zzso zzso the diversity of freshwater forms suggests multiple zzso zzso
