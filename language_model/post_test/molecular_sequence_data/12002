The induction of the gene zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso Gene induction was monitored by measuring zzso zzso Various drugs that cause DNA damage effectively induced zzso zzso zzso agents zzso zzso C and zzso a radical producer zzso and an zzso zzso zzso induced zzso When zzso expressing rat zzso was exposed to zzso a zzso induction of zzso was zzso zzso B1 also induced the expression of zzso in the same zzso strain zzso with zzso of cell zzso In control zzso no induction of zzso was observed upon exposure to zzso or zzso zzso Exposure to zzso or zzso did not lead to induction of zzso in zzso expressing zzso These results indicate that DNA damage by chemicals related to zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of these zzso was required for DNA zzso induction of zzso
