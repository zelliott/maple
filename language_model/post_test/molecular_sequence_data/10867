zzso toxin zzso binds to the zzso growth factor zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso does not bind to mouse zzso because of zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso We made 10 independent zzso replacing a single zzso acid within the zzso domain of human zzso with the corresponding zzso acid zzso in mouse zzso The zzso proteins were zzso expressed in mouse L cells either expressing or not expressing zzso and zzso binding was zzso zzso binding activity of zzso fusion proteins containing the zzso zzso domain was also determined by a zzso binding zzso The largest effect was seen with zzso and second largest effects were seen with zzso and zzso in all of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are critical zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso A computer model of the zzso structure of the zzso domain of human zzso was zzso The model predicts that three zzso acid zzso critical for zzso binding activity, zzso zzso and zzso are all located on the same face of the zzso domain, suggesting that this face of zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso
