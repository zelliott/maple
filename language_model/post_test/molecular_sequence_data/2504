A zzso that encodes a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso core was isolated from a zzso library prepared from zzso mouse bone zzso mast cells zzso using as a probe a zzso zzso of a rat zzso that encodes the zzso zzso core of rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso Based on the consensus zzso sequence and deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso the mouse zzso zzso zzso core is zzso zzso and contains a zzso acid zzso attachment region consisting of alternating zzso and zzso zzso When the predicted zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso zzso zzso core was compared with the predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso molecules expressed in zzso cells and in human zzso leukemia zzso cells, the zzso sequence was more closely zzso to the rat sequence than the human sequence except for the length of the zzso repeat zzso The N zzso was found to be a highly zzso region of the zzso in the three species, suggesting that this region is important for the structure, function, and/or metabolism of this family of zzso zzso sequences within the zzso and 3' untranslated regions of the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso were zzso That similar sequences were also present in the corresponding regions of a zzso that encodes a rat mast cell zzso suggests that particular zzso sequences may be important for regulation of expression of those proteins that are destined to reside in zzso zzso
