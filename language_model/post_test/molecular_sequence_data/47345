The bovine zzso zzso zzso exhibit unique features of the zzso regions zzso which separate them from the other zzso Their most remarkable property is an additional zzso region of 110 zzso located between the zzso and the internal zzso entry site zzso This zzso region has the potential to form an additional zzso structure zzso zzso separated from the zzso zzso I) by a small zzso zzso zzso Other characteristics involve the putative zzso zzso III and zzso In order to investigate the features of the zzso several full-length zzso B3 zzso zzso plasmids with hybrid zzso were zzso After exchange of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso region representing both zzso a viable virus zzso was zzso zzso of domain zzso within the exchanged region also yielded viable virus albeit with reduced growth zzso zzso of sequences zzso either the first or the second zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso plasmids with exchanges of the zzso sequence or the complete zzso were zzso zzso experiments with zzso transcripts containing zzso fused to the zzso message indicated that zzso translation is enhanced by the presence of the zzso zzso and both zzso zzso structures, zzso zzso of either the first or the second zzso zzso domain reduced but did not abolish enhanced zzso zzso These results suggest that the substitution of two putative zzso zzso structures for the putative zzso zzso yields viable virus, while zzso sequences zzso the zzso fail to functionally replace zzso zzso zzso
