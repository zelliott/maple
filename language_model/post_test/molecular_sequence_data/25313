In order to develop specific zzso against human heart zzso fatty zzso protein zzso four zzso of zzso zzso each and corresponding with different zzso parts of the human zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso against these synthetic peptides were raised in mice zzso and rabbits zzso zzso When tested in zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against three of the four peptides showed a high zzso with the synthetic zzso selected for zzso as well as with the native human zzso Some zzso with the other synthetic peptides was observed for the rabbit zzso but not for those from zzso zzso zzso against synthetic peptides can be applied for the specific detection of the native protein in biological preparations containing proteins that show a high degree of zzso with the protein to be zzso
