The expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was investigated during the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso under different zzso zzso Three transcripts of the whole gene amplified from the total zzso were found with lengths of 400, 323 and 272 zzso The zzso transcript was slowly converted to the shorter forms in the zzso zzso dramatically increased the rate of conversion, and a permanent zzso of zzso was most efficient in this zzso The sequencing of transcripts revealed that the 400 zzso transcript contains two zzso whereas the intermediate one contains only one zzso located zzso from the zzso The shortest transcript was without zzso The sum of all transcripts remained almost unchanged in the dark and increased upon the light pulse but decreased during development under permanent zzso The appearance of zzso coincided with the complete conversion of the zzso The results showed that the zzso of the two zzso was not random but zzso and that it did not follow the zzso zzso Furthermore, they suggested that zzso processing could represent another regulation level of gene expression by light during the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
