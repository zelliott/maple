Using differential zzso library screening techniques based on zzso and zzso rat zzso zzso cell lines, we previously cloned and zzso the zzso gene zzso Using zzso to the rat zzso zzso we cloned the human zzso gene and found it to be zzso in a variety of human cell lines zzso zzso zzso gastric and zzso cancer but not melanoma or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric and pancreatic zzso We found a close similarity between the human zzso and rat zzso genes zzso and zzso identities of the zzso and predicted zzso acid zzso zzso Both genes zzso novel proteins that contain a zzso rich region zzso zzso a putative zinc finger zzso a zzso zzso motif and 5 copies of the zzso motif found in gene regulatory zzso Using Southern zzso analysis the zzso gene was highly zzso and using Northern zzso analysis zzso transcripts were found in virtually all human cell lines zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso cells and normal breast zzso zzso However, the expression level of the zzso gene in normal breast zzso cells was approximately 50% of that found in rapidly growing zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Experimental zzso of zzso protein expression using zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of growth and invasion of human zzso breast cancer cells with relatively high zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein was localized in the zzso of cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso containing a full-length zzso zzso Although some zzso protein was found in the zzso the vast majority of zzso protein was localized in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and related zzso proteins suggests that zzso protein is a zzso zzso It also appears to behave like a zzso zzso factor, since zzso of a zzso reporter into zzso cells resulted in zzso increase in reporter expression over poorly zzso zzso Since it was reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso contains zzso protein and a zzso protein zzso we examined zzso complexes for the presence of zzso protein and found an association of this protein with zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso protein may serve multiple functions in cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso processes that are important in the zzso invasion and growth of zzso zzso zzso
