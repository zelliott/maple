The zzso and zzso proteins form a zzso that zzso short peptides from the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rat TAP zzso has been shown to affect the repertoire of peptides presented by zzso class I zzso zzso zzso in the human TAP genes is much more limited and has not been observed to have functional zzso We have examined the zzso in mouse zzso and zzso in zzso zzso While the number of zzso positions in these molecules is more similar to that in human than to that in the zzso all strains examined have a structurally unique TAP zzso suggesting the possibility of functional zzso Furthermore, zzso variations in the mouse zzso are predominantly located in or adjacent to zzso zzso although no significant bias in the ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso is zzso We also report that mouse zzso begins zzso zzso acids upstream of the previously published start site and report the zzso organization of mouse zzso and zzso
