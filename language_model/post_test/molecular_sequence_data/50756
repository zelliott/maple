The zzso activities of zzso and other zzso against and apparent zzso of zzso and other zzso by outer membrane zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso was nearly equal to that of zzso or lower than those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were twofold more susceptible to zzso and zzso but two- to fourfold less susceptible to other zzso than their parent zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the differences in zzso to zzso were similar to those to zzso and zzso zzso The apparent zzso of zzso by intact cells was increased in zzso zzso compared with that by their parent zzso These results suggest that the zzso route of zzso across the outer membrane is different from that of other zzso and that zzso may zzso mainly through the zzso pathway, presumably zzso zzso However, this characteristic is independent of the zzso of the zzso
