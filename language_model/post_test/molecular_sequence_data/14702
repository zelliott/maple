zzso display screening allows the study of functional zzso interactions at the cell surface, but investigating zzso zzso remains a zzso Here we introduce zzso libraries to identify clones that enter zzso cells through a zzso mechanism and zzso zzso as a tool to select zzso peptides and identify their zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso an zzso zzso can be displayed on the zzso envelope and mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso We also show that an zzso construct displaying an established zzso zzso signal targets zzso and that an zzso random zzso library selects for zzso motifs that zzso to different zzso zzso As a zzso we demonstrate that one such zzso if chemically fused to zzso is zzso zzso zzso to zzso and promotes cell zzso This zzso platform technology has potential applications in cell biology and drug zzso
