zzso stimulation of the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to an zzso and degradation of the zzso This zzso of the beta zzso number contributes to the zzso of the zzso zzso activity induced by chronic exposure to zzso It was proposed that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso tail of the beta zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso In addition to zzso of the zzso the substitution of these zzso for zzso also led to a functional zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso To further characterize the relative contribution of zzso and zzso to the zzso interaction with zzso and zzso zzso both zzso were individually replaced by zzso and zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso We show here that zzso of zzso but not that of zzso significantly decreased the ability of the beta zzso to be functionally coupled to zzso and thereby to stimulate the zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to the double zzso zzso neither of the zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the presence of either zzso or zzso is sufficient to maintain normal zzso zzso whereas the integrity of zzso is required for an appropriate zzso to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
