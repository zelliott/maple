zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the hot spring and zzso at zzso Naples, Italy, and from the hot spring at zzso Pedro do zzso in central zzso while strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the hot springs at zzso Pedro do zzso zzso zzso and zzso in central zzso The strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso produce zzso colonies and have an optimum growth temperature of about 45 to 50 degrees zzso The type strains of the two new species are extremely gamma radiation zzso The fatty acids of these new species are primarily zzso fatty zzso The two new species can be distinguished from each other by the lower pH range of zzso zzso than of zzso zzso by their fatty acid compositions, and by several zzso zzso including the ability of zzso zzso to grow in minimal medium without zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing also showed that the zzso constitute two species and that these species are distinct from the other species of the zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
