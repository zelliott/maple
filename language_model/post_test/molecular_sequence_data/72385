The formation and stability of structural elements in two zzso zzso molecules from wheat germ zzso and zzso seeds zzso as a function of zzso concentration in solution was determined using the zzso differential scanning zzso zzso The zzso determined zzso parameters are compared with calculations using zzso databases used for prediction of zzso zzso The zzso zzso molecules which show minor differences in the zzso sequence display very different zzso unfolding profiles zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso profiles provided information about structural transformations that take place in both zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis of zzso data and the theoretical zzso models of the structure was used to establish a relationship between the zzso transitions found in the melting profiles and the unfolding of structural zzso of the zzso zzso and stability of its particular zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso additional internal interactions zzso zzso zzso structures found at low zzso zzso zzso zzso transitions suggest a structural model in which the extension of zzso region E dominates over the zzso zzso interaction between hairpin zzso We propose that zzso E is zzso by a sequence of zzso pairings extending this zzso by the formation of zzso loop e and an almost total reduction of loop d between zzso E and zzso Two hairpin structures in both zzso zzso zzso the extended zzso and the extended zzso zzso appear as the most stable elements of the zzso The zzso of the unfolding of zzso in these zzso zzso molecules changes already at 2 zzso zzso
