zzso of the zzso zzso coli gene zzso have been implicated in the occurrence of sporadic colon zzso Various zzso knockout strains of mice have been created to better understand the function of this zzso In the present study, using gene zzso we disrupted the mouse zzso gene at the end of zzso 10 to compare its effect with the effects of other types of zzso gene zzso all of which are on zzso zzso The mice expressed a zzso form of zzso that zzso zzso zzso acids instead of zzso zzso acids due to zzso zzso In addition, these zzso knockout mice developed zzso and zzso zzso Since the most severe cases of familial zzso zzso are associated with zzso on zzso 15, our zzso at zzso 10 was expected to result in a mild zzso However, the number of zzso that our mice developed was similar to that of other zzso knockout mice such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso a novel zzso zzso showed a significantly reduced number of zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso zzso can be used as new preventive zzso against zzso zzso
