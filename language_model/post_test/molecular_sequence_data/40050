The automated parallel zzso synthesis of a zzso library of zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso group is zzso The peptides were zzso in good yield and the identity and quality of each product were performed by mass zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso as fluorescent reporter, each compound was screened, both attached to the zzso and zzso off, for their sensing behavior towards metal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso Several of these zzso synthetic peptides showed surprisingly low detection limits for zzso and zzso The zzso potential of these zzso zzso as metal zzso recognition materials for sensor development is zzso Finally, the sensing response zzso based on an energy transfer process and a metal zzso zzso interaction, is zzso
