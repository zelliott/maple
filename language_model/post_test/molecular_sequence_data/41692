zzso of the zzso zzso B of the avian zzso virus zzso zzso zzso network is well recognized as an zzso driver in zzso zzso Several targeted drugs have been developed, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso each of them characterized by distinct patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso the precise pharmacological properties of these compounds is important for optimal use in clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso zzso It was designed to zzso bind and zzso block zzso active zzso zzso family zzso Here, we show by X-ray zzso the zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and by mass zzso the zzso interaction with zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and the proliferation of cancer cell lines driven by multiple zzso zzso aberrations at zzso below 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso a close analog of zzso lacking the zzso group and thus incapable of zzso bond formation, had similar potency on cells driven by zzso or zzso but less or no zzso activity on cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso These results stress the importance of the zzso group and show that zzso differs from approved zzso targeting agents by zzso zzso the zzso activity of all zzso family zzso They provide a zzso rationale for the distinct pharmacological features of this compound and explain the clinical activity seen in some patients who are resistant to zzso or zzso inhibitor therapy because of secondary zzso or zzso zzso zzso
