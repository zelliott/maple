The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso 4 has been isolated using the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso The gene contains a zzso zzso open reading frame capable of zzso a protein of 687 zzso acids zzso zzso No zzso was observed in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso indicating that zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso under the regulation of the zzso promoter enhanced zzso zzso 3 activity in zzso zzso 7- to zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly defective in zzso white zzso and their zzso content was zzso of that of the parental zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso identity in the zzso half of the proteins and that region of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of a zzso of zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso it appears that zzso is involved in zzso zzso 3 activity by combining with zzso to interact zzso in zzso zzso
