Transfer of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso donor strains is induced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso by recipient zzso zzso transfer requires expression of an zzso protein zzso zzso by the zzso gene and positively regulated by genes in a region 3-5 zzso upstream, containing zzso zzso fusion data reported here support the results of recent molecular analysis of the zzso ends of zzso transcripts which indicated that zzso zzso occurs by zzso from the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to interact with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that this zzso may also directly interact with zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso translating the zzso message, and zzso zzso may affect the association of this zzso with translation zzso zzso suggest that the positive regulatory molecules act zzso on the zzso message and modify a zzso population to enhance zzso translation of zzso
