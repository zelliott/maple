The zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with zzso affinity zzso approximately zzso zzso suggesting high zzso However, zzso also zzso with similar affinity with a zzso of structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and various zzso complexes are zzso and belong to the zzso space group, zzso with unit cell dimensions of a zzso b zzso 135 A, c zzso 124 zzso zzso of free and zzso zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A resolution using molecular replacement zzso zzso is bound in a zzso pocket formed mainly by the interaction of three zzso determining regions zzso zzso and zzso The orientation of the zzso in the binding site was aided by both zzso and zzso analyses of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso has two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of the zzso combining zzso The zzso zzso thus appears to be acting as an zzso surrogate zzso for its own zzso binding zzso These structures provide the first atomic view of how a steroid interacts with a protein and offer a structural explanation for the restriction of the zzso response to the zzso family of zzso zzso
