We have tested the zzso properties of zzso and zzso spike zzso protein of zzso coronavirus zzso zzso zzso zzso by expressing the S protein by zzso zzso viruses zzso The zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso site of zzso S zzso zzso was replaced by zzso by in zzso zzso of zzso S zzso The zzso having zzso S gene zzso zzso or zzso zzso S gene zzso zzso were tested for their ability to induce fusion as well as zzso in zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso onto zzso cells, the fusion formation was first observed at 8 h zzso zzso and spread throughout the whole culture by 24 zzso In cells infected with zzso zzso fusion appeared by 2 h and most of cells were fused by 30 h zzso The S protein and its zzso products were detected in zzso cells expressing wild type S zzso However, no zzso products of the S protein were detected in zzso zzso infected cells producing zzso S zzso even though fusion was clearly zzso These results suggest that the zzso event of zzso protein of zzso is not a prerequisite for fusion formation, but that it enhances zzso
