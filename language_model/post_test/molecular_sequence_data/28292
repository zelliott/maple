zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso found in the pancreatic zzso deposits of type II zzso diabetic patients and zzso We previously reported the zzso sequence of a human zzso which indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso derived by zzso processing of an zzso acid zzso We now report the isolation of zzso clones coding for cat, zzso zzso and guinea pig zzso zzso obtained using the combination of zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso The predicted structure of zzso precursors from these four zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of each is derived from an zzso to zzso acid precursor by zzso processing and is likely to be zzso at the C zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence identities between the zzso zzso of these four zzso and human zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences are very highly zzso among the zzso as is also the case with a structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso interact with similar though not identical zzso By contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso precursor show very little sequence zzso which suggests that these regions do not represent additional biologically active zzso zzso variations in the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso of zzso may account for the presence of zzso deposits in the zzso of humans and cats and their absence in rats and zzso
