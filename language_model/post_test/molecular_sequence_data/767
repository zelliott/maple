zzso zzso of zzso and zzso promoters requires efficient interactions between zzso proteins zzso and promoter bound zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved by DNA looping, which is usually facilitated by the integration host factor zzso Since the lengths of the intervening region supporting zzso formation are similar among zzso and zzso zzso the precise zzso why zzso is selectively important for the frequency of zzso initiation remain zzso Here, using kinetic zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we show that, in the absence of zzso zzso the DNA fragments containing an zzso site have much less zzso ability than those that lack an zzso zzso Furthermore, when an zzso zzso site was introduced into the intervening region between promoter and zzso of the target DNA fragments, loop formation and zzso zzso zzso are significantly reduced in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The binding of zzso to its consensus site in the target promoters clearly restored efficient DNA looping formation and zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that one function for the zzso protein is to release a communication block set by intrinsic properties of the zzso zzso zzso
