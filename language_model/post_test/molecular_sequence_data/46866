zzso cone snails zzso zzso comprise what is arguably the largest living zzso of marine animals zzso zzso All zzso use complex zzso to capture prey and for other biological zzso Most biologically active components of these zzso are small zzso zzso generally zzso zzso acids in zzso There are probably of the order of 100 different peptides expressed in the zzso of each of the 500 zzso species zzso zzso sequences diverge rapidly between zzso species, resulting in a distinct zzso complement for each zzso Thus, the zzso as a whole has probably generated approximately 50 zzso different zzso which can be organized into families and zzso with shared sequence elements zzso In this zzso we provide a brief overview of the zzso molecular and zzso aspects of the zzso zzso However, the major focus of the review will be the remarkable array of zzso modifications found in these zzso
