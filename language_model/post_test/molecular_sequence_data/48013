We have screened a zzso zzso display library to examine if zzso zzso zzso could be isolated from the library and thereby predict the zzso zzso of the zzso from the isolated zzso The library was screened for zzso binding to zzso zzso by an affinity zzso technique called zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed selective binding of zzso After two rounds of the zzso twelve clones of zzso zzso were chosen and their zzso were zzso zzso sequence comparison of the 12 clones showed that there were 5 different species, with two species containing four members, zzso that they were predominantly selected by the zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso of the 12 clones were compared with that of the human zzso protein in order to find the putative zzso of the human zzso protein for zzso The zzso region of the human zzso protein shows significant zzso with the zzso sequences of the selected zzso zzso These results show that this zzso zzso display library can be useful in defining the zzso of some zzso zzso
