All zzso zzso including the zzso agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that harbors two independent zzso binding zzso of known structure, but poorly characterized zzso binding zzso We show here that the zzso domain zzso of N protein from mouse zzso virus zzso a virus most closely related to zzso employs aromatic zzso zzso stacking interactions with a triple zzso motif to mediate zzso binding to zzso zzso containing the zzso regulatory sequence zzso or its complement zzso zzso zzso fully zzso a zzso duplex that mimics a zzso formed zzso intermediate in viral zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso positioned on the zzso surface of our zzso A structure, binds the zzso far less tightly and is severely crippled in its zzso unwinding zzso In contrast, the zzso domain zzso exhibits no zzso unwinding zzso zzso harboring zzso N zzso are strongly selected against and zzso N does not support an accessory function in zzso zzso We propose that the zzso melting activity of the coronavirus N protein zzso plays a critical accessory role in zzso zzso synthesis and other processes requiring zzso zzso
