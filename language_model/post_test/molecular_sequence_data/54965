zzso comprise a large group of zzso zzso that use diverse zzso zzso Each scaffold is determined by an zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso Although many zzso relationship studies confirm the functional and structural importance of zzso zzso there is growing evidence that not all zzso bridges are critical in maintaining activities of zzso To answer the fundamental biological question of what the role of zzso zzso bridges is, we investigated function and folding of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that belongs to an zzso zzso knot motif family and blocks zzso calcium zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso bridge in zzso or its zzso analog had, as predicted, rather minimal effects on the zzso activity on calcium channels, as well as on in zzso activity following zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso exhibited significantly lower folding yields for forming the remaining two native zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso analog also folded with significantly lower yields, suggesting that the functionally zzso zzso pair plays an important cooperative role in forming the native zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that distinct zzso bridges may be zzso preserved by the zzso folding zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso
