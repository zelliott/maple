In the preceding two reports, we presented evidence for the structure and functional characteristics of two different, yet related zzso of the sheep zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso To shed further light on the structural basis of the formation of such zzso forms with different motifs and the eventual understanding of gene regulation, we initiated studies to clone the zzso An 8 zzso zzso I zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso sequence was cloned and characterized from among the 14 clones that were isolated from the zzso zzso Although not all other clones were fully zzso we believe that the entire gene of zzso zzso has been secured as we adopted a successive screening strategy to accommodate currently known alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso in this zzso This has led us to propose a revised model that includes an 11th zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The 11th zzso that lies beyond the currently zzso 10th zzso contributes important DNA sequence that results in two different zzso zzso One creates a dominant negative zzso and the other leads to the formation of a growth factor type I zzso for the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso region, there are a number of potentially interesting regulatory elements that resemble sites for zzso response element zzso zzso and orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors among zzso Other interesting features include the presence of potential germ cell specific and zzso zzso By performing primer extension with zzso zzso we could identify a single major zzso start site at zzso relative to zzso The availability of the structure of zzso gene in this domestically important seasonal breeder could spur investigations into the control of zzso gene zzso
