zzso zzso a zzso zzso widely used by the dairy industry, is subject to infection by a diverse population of virulent zzso predominantly by those of the zzso group, including the zzso zzso zzso Confronted with the negative impact of zzso infection on milk zzso the study of the biology of zzso provides insight from applied and fundamental zzso We decided to characterize the product of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso which was considered as a candidate zzso DNA binding protein zzso due to its zzso downstream of a gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that zzso is expressed in large amounts during the early zzso of zzso infection, suggesting an important role in this zzso zzso zzso surface zzso resonance and atomic force zzso demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso DNA with zzso zzso We also determined the crystal structure of zzso and showed that it bears a variation of the typical zzso zzso of zzso Finally, we found that zzso is able to stimulate zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The specific structural and zzso properties that distinguish zzso from other zzso proteins are zzso
