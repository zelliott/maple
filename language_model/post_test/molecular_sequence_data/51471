In the pond snail zzso zzso the growth regulating system consists of zzso about 200 neuroendocrine light green cells, located in four clusters in the cerebral zzso and zzso the paired canopy cells, located in the lateral zzso These cells express genes zzso the zzso zzso peptides zzso Six zzso genes have previously been zzso Four of these zzso II, III and zzso are expressed in the light green cells and the canopy zzso The zzso gene is a zzso In the present in zzso zzso study, using zzso zzso specific to the transcripts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso no signal was obtained with the zzso probe, indicating that gene IV is also a zzso With the other four zzso two types of light green cells were zzso zzso cells express all four zzso zzso whereas zzso cells do not (or only zzso express the zzso zzso Gene III is relatively strongly expressed in zzso zzso Genes II and V are moderately expressed in both cell zzso zzso cells are mainly located in the periphery of the zzso whereas zzso cells are present in the zzso The canopy cell resembles zzso light green zzso The expression levels of the zzso and zzso genes are low in the canopy zzso The expression pattern of the zzso genes zzso with the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso which has been raised to a synthetic zzso shared by zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells stain more intensely with the zzso than zzso zzso
