The genetic organization and sequence zzso of the zzso locus of zzso zzso was zzso and the existence of two distinct gene families, zzso and zzso at this locus was zzso zzso has significant sequence zzso to zzso zzso an zzso in zzso zzso but the similarity at the protein level is zzso due to zzso zzso of zzso in most zzso zzso zzso In only five of the 19 zzso strains zzso a full-length open reading frame zzso capable of zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso was zzso The region upstream of zzso is highly variable in zzso containing up to 15 copies of zzso tandem zzso zzso can zzso proteins of 24, 59, 94, or 129 zzso zzso consisting of 14 and zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso 0, 1, 2, or 3 copies of a zzso zzso This zzso cassette consists of zzso of 13, 16 and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso but the zzso domain exists in two zzso In total, five distinct zzso zzso were zzso Database searches did not reveal any zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli, confirming the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso permitted zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a worldwide collection of 321 zzso zzso zzso The zzso sizes of the amplification products confirmed the worldwide distribution of discrete zzso of zzso and zzso
