zzso N zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that is attached to cell zzso by a zzso zzso stalk in zzso or a zzso zzso anchor in zzso In this study, we report the zzso zzso and characterization of an zzso N from zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso N zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence differs by 8 zzso acids from zzso zzso zzso These different zzso acids do not modify any putative zzso or zzso anchor zzso The full-length zzso was cloned into an expression zzso zzso and zzso expressed in an insect cell line derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso showed that zzso expressed in zzso cells is the same size zzso zzso as zzso found in zzso brush border zzso After treatment with zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso products recognized the expressed zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso has an intact zzso zzso These results are evidence that zzso cells zzso few, if any, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the expressed zzso was located on the surface of zzso zzso
