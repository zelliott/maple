Early growth response factor zzso may play an important role in the development of zzso by inducing the expression of several relevant genes which contribute to the complex zzso of vascular structure and function, leading to vascular zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of molecular zzso in the human zzso gene for the predisposition to zzso or coronary heart disease we screened the zzso and zzso zzso regions and the entire coding sequence for zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso Male patients zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso male control subjects of the Etude zzso de zzso du zzso were zzso for two newly identified zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso gene using zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not significantly differ between patients with zzso zzso and control subjects without coronary heart zzso In controls not taking zzso drugs there was a significant association of the zzso zzso with lower plasma levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso B zzso and a higher ratio of zzso to zzso zzso zzso than with the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene may contribute to modifications of the zzso zzso Our findings need to be zzso in independent studies, and in zzso promoter studies should evaluate the functional consequence of the zzso zzso which zzso a consensus core sequence for the ubiquitous zzso factor zzso protein zzso
