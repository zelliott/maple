The full-length zzso of four zzso zzso were cloned and zzso from susceptible and resistant zzso zzso zzso Four sequences were identified as zzso because they shared the common structural features with zzso from zzso including the signal zzso zzso anchor zzso the zinc zzso motif zzso and the zzso zzso motif zzso Compared with zzso sequences from the susceptible strain, there were 9, 5, 10 and 12 zzso acid variations in the deduced protein sequences from the resistant zzso There were also differences in zzso expression of the four zzso genes between resistant and susceptible zzso zzso zzso
