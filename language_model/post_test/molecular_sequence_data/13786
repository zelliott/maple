We expressed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which was expected to show a zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso the zzso alpha zzso for its zzso The rate of zzso of zzso from zzso zzso was 3- to zzso faster than that from wild type zzso but their zzso values for zzso zzso were almost the zzso The affinities of the two zzso proteins for the beta gamma zzso of G proteins to form alpha beta gamma timers, which served as zzso for zzso zzso zzso were the zzso In marked contrast, zzso zzso was unable to form a tight complex with a zzso zzso analog zzso of zzso bound zzso was readily released from the zzso zzso even in the presence of a high concentration of zzso Its zzso to zzso zzso also revealed that zzso zzso zzso formed a zzso apparently different from that of the zzso form of zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso proteins were capable of zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulting in the formation of zzso protein complexes with high affinity for zzso However, zzso zzso from zzso receptors was markedly attenuated in the case of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso had a unique property in terms of zzso to membrane zzso in addition to the previously expected zzso in the active zzso of the zzso form of zzso
