The background frequency of zzso in human zzso is an important issue in cancer zzso and zzso exposure zzso Here we report the detection of rare zzso zzso containing zzso base zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes by the zzso zzso zzso with a sensitivity of one cell in a zzso Altogether, we detected and identified 17 independent zzso of 66 separate base site analyses of peripheral blood specimens obtained from 19 apparently normal zzso Two individuals zzso a substantially increased frequency of zzso cells, representing 9 of the 17 independent zzso zzso These results suggest that up to 1 in 10 normal individuals may harbor a significant frequency of zzso zzso in circulating zzso
