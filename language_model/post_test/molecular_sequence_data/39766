zzso zzso are constantly exposed to the immune zzso mechanisms of their zzso One strategy of the worms to cope with these zzso reactions is the zzso of zzso proteins that zzso zzso immune zzso We zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells of mice infected with zzso zzso and showed that cellular proliferation was strongly suppressed in the chronic phase of zzso To identify proteins of zzso zzso that are involved in zzso zzso zzso extract and culture zzso of adult zzso zzso were zzso by gel zzso and activity of each fraction was zzso One of the zzso zzso 9) of zzso extract as well as zzso zzso products inhibited the zzso cellular proliferation by about zzso This reduced cellular zzso coincided with a zzso of zzso zzso oxide production of mouse zzso by zzso Furthermore, fraction 9 contained zzso that were recognized by zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice and induced zzso of an zzso zzso cell zzso Single proteins of fraction 9 were zzso by mass zzso These data suggest that zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso might play an important role in zzso exerted by zzso zzso
