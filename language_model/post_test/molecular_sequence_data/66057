zzso spectrum conditions zzso are zzso conditions characterized by impaired zzso social zzso deficits in language zzso and repetitive and restricted behaviors and zzso In addition to more complex genetic zzso even zzso of a single gene can lead to zzso Several such zzso zzso zzso forms are caused by zzso zzso in genes zzso regulators of zzso function in zzso including zzso We report that mice with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the synaptic cell zzso protein zzso exhibit highly selective deficits in zzso social interactions and communication that are reminiscent of zzso in zzso Our findings indicate that a protein network that regulates the maturation and function of zzso in the brain is at the core of a major zzso zzso pathway, and establish zzso mice as genetic models for the exploration of the complex zzso disorders in zzso
