The zzso zzso is the zzso complex responsible for the processing of zzso bound by major zzso complex class I zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this process is, however, still zzso We have studied the effects of zzso zzso incorporation on the quality of peptides processed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through dual zzso by zzso zzso The incorporation of a single zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso alters its zzso site preference and in consequence, the quality of the generated zzso When the several zzso activities are tested with short zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso or both values of zzso zzso are altered, depending on the combination of zzso There exists, however, no obvious correlation between the observed changes in zzso activities against short zzso peptides and the changes in dual zzso site usage within the zzso zzso zzso As judged from the calculated Hill zzso the presence of both zzso zzso zzso a drastic increase in positive zzso between the zzso zzso
