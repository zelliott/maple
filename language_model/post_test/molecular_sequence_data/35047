zzso group box 2 zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso regulation and zzso innate immune responses in zzso However, the function of zzso zzso in innate immune responses is still zzso In the present study, two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso were identified and characterized in grass carp zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso genes zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso sharing zzso identities and containing two basic zzso boxes and an zzso zzso The deduced protein sequences showed the most identities to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in all the 15 tested zzso Post grass carp zzso zzso infection, zzso levels of zzso and zzso were strongly zzso in zzso and head kidney and mildly modulated in zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso expressions of zzso and zzso were significantly regulated by viral pathogen associated molecular patterns zzso zzso zzso salt zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso challenge in zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso cells, expressions of zzso and zzso facilitated each zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were remarkably zzso whereas zzso was zzso compared with those in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso after zzso challenge, all those tested genes were zzso with divergent expression zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso were zzso by the delayed appearance of zzso effect zzso and zzso of zzso zzso All those results demonstrate that zzso and zzso not only mediate zzso immune responses but also involve in responding to zzso zzso challenge, which provides novel insights into the essential role of zzso in innate zzso
