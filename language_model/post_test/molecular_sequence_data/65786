zzso is the major mechanism used by zzso cells to degrade and zzso proteins and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of all components of the zzso zzso system, whereas zzso zzso and zzso as the major components of the zzso zzso could not be zzso The two zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso were found to correctly process the two zzso zzso after the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that both zzso zzso but only one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso During zzso of the zzso zzso but not zzso was found by zzso to be located in zzso zzso This confirms its function as an zzso zzso and its potential to be used as an zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso is involved in differentiation between zzso stages of zzso zzso a process that is essential for zzso maintenance and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso could represent a target for a novel zzso strategy against zzso zzso
