A zzso zzso designated zzso was obtained from a library of zzso zzso strain zzso constructed in zzso zzso It had an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 245 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had high zzso with bacterial zzso particularly in the central regions and toward the zzso halves of bacterial zzso zzso had no zzso with plant zzso The zzso DNA region coding for zzso was devoid of zzso More than zzso of the zzso zzso produced in zzso coli cells was found in the culture medium and zzso zzso A zzso signal zzso of 29 zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso from zzso whereas 21 zzso acid zzso of the signal zzso were removed when the zzso was produced by zzso zzso The zzso produced by zzso coli was zzso from the culture zzso It had a molecular mass of 27 zzso on sodium zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso values with zzso as the zzso at pH zzso and 40 degrees C were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With barley zzso as the zzso the corresponding values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The main products of zzso and barley zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso represented the first zzso reported from zzso The results presented suggest that zzso of zzso had a bacterial zzso
