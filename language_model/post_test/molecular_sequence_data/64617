We zzso a previously established zzso system for the identification of zzso zzso promoters that are recognized by the alternative zzso factor zzso The method allowed the identification of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 of which are reported here for the first time to be zzso zzso mapping of the respective zzso start points revealed that all the promoters contained sequences exhibiting high similarity to the consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoters governed expression of genes zzso proteins proposed to be involved in various cellular functions, including the stress response genes and zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences upstream of the identified zzso start points identified a zzso consensus promoter zzso that is highly zzso to that of zzso of zzso zzso
