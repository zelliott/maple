zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in general, are generated and continue to evolve in size during serial zzso passages of zzso This evolution was thought to occur by independent generation of zzso zzso during virus passages and subsequent selection of new zzso zzso under new cellular zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso between the old zzso zzso and the helper viral zzso can be one of the mechanisms for natural zzso zzso zzso A mouse zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed in zzso and zzso into a mouse cell line infected with a different zzso strain zzso which is distinguishable from the original natural helper zzso zzso During subsequent serial zzso passages of the harvested virus, several novel zzso zzso species were generated, while the original zzso zzso disappeared by passage zzso zzso cloning and sequence analysis of one of these novel zzso zzso designated zzso revealed that it is composed of four zzso regions of the zzso sequence and is different from the structure of the original zzso zzso zzso comparison among zzso zzso and helper zzso zzso showed that zzso sequence is similar to zzso in the first and second regions, but similar to the helper zzso virus in the third and last zzso Thus, this zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso between the original zzso zzso and the helper viral zzso These results indicate that zzso between zzso zzso and helper virus zzso can be involved in the natural evolution of zzso zzso
