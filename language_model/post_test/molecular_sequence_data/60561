The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids carrying an zzso domain, a SAM domain, and a zzso zzso Gene disruption and construction of a zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is essential for cell zzso Loss of its function leads to quick zzso of cellular zzso zzso is zzso to two functionally redundant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are necessary for cell growth and relevant to bud zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell growth, causing the host cells to become round and zzso In growing cells, zzso locates at cell tips during zzso and zzso near the division plane at zzso Thus, this protein exhibits zzso dynamics similar to zzso zzso However, zzso constitutes a layer, rather than patches, at growing cell zzso It generates two split discs zzso the zzso at zzso The zzso cells no longer zzso but swell gradually at the middle, eventually assuming a zzso zzso Analysis using the zzso zzso revealed that zzso is also essential for cell zzso We speculate that zzso is located on growing plasma zzso possibly through the function of zzso patches, and may recruit proteins required for the synthesis of cell zzso
