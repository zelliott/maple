A bacterial strain zzso capable of utilizing zzso zzso acid zzso as the sole carbon and energy source for growth was isolated by continuous enrichment zzso in minimal salt medium zzso from a long term zzso exposed zzso This bacterial strain was identified as zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso tests, as well as zzso zzso sequence zzso Its ability to degrade zzso was determined using high performance liquid zzso The strain zzso can tolerate unusually high zzso zzso zzso The influences of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the bacterial growth and zzso degradation were zzso The results showed that the optimal zzso degradation occurred at an zzso concentration of zzso zzso and pH zzso Under these conditions, zzso percent of zzso in zzso was zzso by zzso and the zzso reached zzso after zzso for zzso The degradation of zzso could be enhanced by addition of both carbon and nitrogen zzso At an initial zzso concentration of zzso when zzso zzso and zzso zzso extract were added into the zzso media, the zzso degradation was significantly increased to zzso percent, and zzso was increased to zzso after incubation at zzso and pH zzso for zzso This is the first study showing that an zzso zzso strain is capable of degrading zzso which might provide a new approach for the zzso of zzso contaminated soil and contribute to the limited knowledge about the function of zzso zzso
