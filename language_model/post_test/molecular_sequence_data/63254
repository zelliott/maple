The zzso protein 2 zzso serves both organizational and zzso functions in the nucleus, with two zzso zzso zzso related to these zzso The recognition of zzso zzso zzso is accomplished by the zzso domain zzso and the zzso repression domain zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso For each known function of zzso zzso binding is a crucial zzso Here, we apply zzso strategies within the nucleus using zzso zzso proteins as well as naturally occurring point zzso identified in individuals with the zzso disorder zzso syndrome zzso These studies reveal that zzso is zzso associated with zzso in zzso and confirm a central role for the zzso in directing the protein to zzso In addition, we report for the first time that the small region between the zzso and the zzso known as the zzso region zzso zzso zzso binding by zzso independently of the zzso The zzso of zzso also contributes towards zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso do zzso Some common zzso zzso and nonsense zzso significantly affect binding zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso binding can result in protein dysfunction and hence a disease zzso
