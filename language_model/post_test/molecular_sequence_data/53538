The fastidious nature of the zzso zzso their lack of a classic bacterial cell wall, and their very small zzso make zzso zzso of new species in this enlarging group of zzso an important and valuable aid in their zzso In this report we have determined the zzso of the zzso zzso cluster of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences from several previously described zzso species were determined and ten species were found to belong to the zzso zzso zzso With almost complete sequences available, the zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso cluster currently comprises 19 species, forming a distinct zzso as judged from branch zzso zzso percentage values, zzso signature analysis, and structural elements in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of species in the zzso zzso cluster were found to be zzso or zzso zzso similar and the range within which similarities can be used in the zzso of new species is zzso Members of the zzso zzso cluster all share a major zzso property of zzso zzso in that they zzso zzso and are incapable of zzso zzso This consistency in zzso pattern has not been found in any of the other zzso clusters of the zzso zzso Two species, the zzso agent of Grey Lung disease in zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso and the avian species zzso zzso strain zzso were regarded as close relatives to the zzso zzso zzso but are clearly separated from the species of this zzso Both species formed early branches of the zzso zzso cluster and should be regarded as individual lines containing one zzso
