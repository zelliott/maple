We have isolated and characterized a canine class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence shares only zzso identity with a previously published canine class I zzso designated zzso and exhibits zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso -C zzso The zzso region of zzso is zzso Three of four highly zzso zzso zzso zzso 59, zzso and zzso proposed to interact with the N zzso of zzso are zzso Additionally, the long zzso lining the zzso region in the alpha 1 domain contains one more zzso acid zzso than that observed in typical class zzso Together, these features suggest that zzso binds a distinct subset of peptides or other zzso This gene has been expressed in a class I zzso human zzso cell line, and the zzso heavy chain associated with beta zzso and was transported to the cell zzso zzso protection analysis detected low levels of zzso zzso in a broad variety of dog zzso The highest levels were found in skeletal muscle, a tissue expressing relatively low levels of classical class I zzso These data suggest that zzso is functional and plays a specialized role in the immune zzso zzso sequence analysis of second zzso sequences zzso the alpha 1 zzso identified only two zzso in five dogs of different zzso a third zzso was found in a zzso The divergent structure, relatively low zzso zzso and limited zzso of this gene suggest that zzso is not a classical or class zzso zzso but rather, an analogue of the zzso class zzso genes of humans and zzso
