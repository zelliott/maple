zzso f of zzso photosynthesis has an unprecedented structure, including the zzso being a zzso zzso The adjacent zzso zzso domain is enriched in aromatic zzso zzso The atomic structures of the zzso and zzso zzso f were compared to explain spectral and zzso differences between zzso The zzso aromatic side chain in the zzso zzso zzso at position 4, zzso and zzso in plants and algae, respectively, and zzso in zzso is in contact with the zzso zzso of zzso f from the zzso green zzso zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso zzso substitution in the zzso domain was unique in causing a red shift of 1 and 2 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and Q zzso visible zzso bands, zzso The resulting alpha band peak at 556 zzso is characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the expressed zzso from the zzso zzso zzso caused a blue shift to the zzso zzso alpha band peak diagnostic of the zzso zzso zzso 4 was found to be the sole zzso of this 60 zzso spectral shift, and of approximately one-half of the 70 zzso zzso potential difference between zzso f of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 297 and 370 zzso zzso The proximity of zzso to the zzso implies that the spectral and zzso potential shifts arise through differential interaction of its zzso or zzso potential with the zzso ring and of the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The dependence of the visible spectrum and zzso potential of zzso f on the identity of aromatic zzso 4 provides an example of the use of the relatively sharp zzso spectrum as a zzso zzso and of the novel structural connection between the zzso and a single zzso zzso
