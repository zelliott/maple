Identification of species zzso zzso zzso complex represents a certain problem as two parental species zzso zzso and zzso zzso form their hybrid zzso zzso while external signs and sizes of the members of this complex are zzso However the composition of skin zzso consisting mainly of peptides is different for the species of the zzso zzso is an ideal zzso tool for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these zzso The results covering zzso composition of these zzso their levels in the zzso as well as their belonging to a certain family of peptides may be zzso by means of zzso mass zzso The proposed approach proved itself to be a perspective tool for the reliable identification of all 3 species zzso zzso zzso zzso Easy distinguishing between the species may be achieved using zzso maps as zzso Besides this approach may be used to study zzso and mechanisms of zzso transfer of genetic information, when rapid and reliable identification of species involved in the process is zzso
