zzso beta is a zzso protein that is found in large amounts in zzso and a number of other zzso In the developing nervous system, zzso beta is zzso from zzso zzso during the time of zzso outgrowth from cortical zzso The zzso form has zzso activity on primary zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity is sensitive to reduction of zzso bonds, and appears to be a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso beta in mature zzso cells is associated with zzso zzso The zzso and expression of zzso for zzso beta in zzso cells zzso zzso activity on extracts of these zzso Based on our observations of a zzso activity for zzso zzso the occurrence of the gene for zzso beta on human zzso 21 zzso et zzso 1988) and the elevated levels of zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso brains zzso et zzso zzso we suggest that zzso beta plays a role in the abnormal development of the nervous system in zzso and the zzso of central zzso in zzso It is essential at the present stage to demonstrate the action of zzso beta in zzso and to construct animal models, such as transgenic mice, that zzso zzso zzso Such models will allow the dissection of the role of zzso beta in the developing and zzso central nervous zzso
