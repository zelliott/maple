The molecular basis of zzso is predominantly point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso position zzso zzso zzso nonsense zzso 17 zzso zzso box position zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso account for more than zzso of zzso zzso in the population of South zzso We have developed a zzso chain reaction zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso method for the identification of these zzso In this method, artificial zzso bases in zzso products were created to distinguish normal from zzso zzso on the basis of zzso The size of the five zzso DNA fragments that may potentially contain the above five types of zzso is 93 or 89 zzso zzso zzso 221 zzso zzso zzso zzso 110 zzso zzso 17), 123 zzso zzso box zzso zzso and 97 or 98 zzso zzso zzso After these fragments were zzso with zzso II, Mae III, zzso I, zzso I, and zzso I, respectively, the zzso zzso produced were analyzed by gel zzso DNA samples of 24 patients with the above five types of zzso were investigated with the present method and zzso zzso zzso probing zzso We used this method in the prenatal diagnosis of 14 Chinese families for zzso The results obtained by the present method zzso well with those by the zzso probe zzso
