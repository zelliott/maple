We investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and in human zzso arteries to test the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso In Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso expression was not observed in zzso cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso but its expression was clearly observed by exposure to zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso for 2-6 zzso zzso protein zzso activity in zzso incubated in zzso culture medium was increased by exposure to zzso fetal bovine serum, while the effect was significantly suppressed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso We then evaluated zzso zzso expression in zzso arteries obtained from 12 patients undergoing bypass zzso through reverse zzso chain reaction analysis and observed zzso zzso expression in all zzso arteries zzso These results support the premise that zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso plaques as well as by zzso cells and zzso and contributes to the zzso of zzso
