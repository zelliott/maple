The zzso corresponding to zzso 2-4 of the processed human zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso has been zzso expressed in zzso coli as a zzso protein zzso containing a zzso tag, and zzso to the native structure that contains two internal zzso zzso zzso expression of the two zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B, that potentially zzso zzso zzso having extensive similarity to the zzso has been zzso Using zzso zzso with liver zzso as template, we demonstrate that zzso A encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B have been found to be transcribed in the liver and yield virtually identical zzso Neither of the zzso are expressed in a variety of other normal zzso as determined by Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso yields zzso products which indicates that the expressed zzso domain of zzso is endowed with a flexible zzso zzso zzso B protein zzso zzso fused to a zzso tag was zzso and analyzed for structural zzso zzso zzso zzso data for zzso and zzso B indicate relatively fast zzso zzso exchange in zzso and close zzso characteristics for the two zzso zzso Far zzso zzso for zzso and zzso B at pH zzso indicate similar defined secondary structure content for both zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fact that two zzso active genes zzso almost identical zzso supports the hypothesis that the zzso zzso together with the putative zzso zzso by the zzso may serve an important function, such as controlling the zzso of zzso and thus its zzso to tissue zzso
