Four zzso of zzso zzso and one zzso of zzso are defined from 78 zzso and their folding nucleus is identified with a method based on zzso zzso and native structural contacts between pairs of zzso zzso One large cluster of 19 zzso zzso is found which is mostly zzso zzso and zzso It can be subdivided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso in four zzso zzso zzso zzso that stabilize the zzso between the alpha and the beta zzso and zzso a zzso sitting in the middle of a bowl of zzso zzso It is proposed that this folding nucleus zzso four zzso A, B, C, and D, three beta zzso and the zzso which zzso closely to the nucleation of the so-called fast folding track zzso As the secondary structures zzso zzso zzso and functionally zzso zzso would form additional zzso The zzso zzso are selected with a zzso scheme in which single members of zzso are zzso zzso are then equally weighted to obtain the consensus zzso
