zzso DNA elements were identified in the zzso region of the chicken zzso gene by in reporter gene zzso in a chicken zzso cell line zzso male zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso sequence zzso unit zzso responded to zzso and a variety of zzso zzso Analysis of putative zzso factor binding sites within the zzso element revealed a nuclear zzso zzso repeat zzso neighboring a putative nuclear zzso zzso This motif resembles zzso response elements in the zzso regions of three zzso zzso rat zzso mouse zzso and human zzso zzso of the zzso element was eliminated after zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Evidence for evolutionary conservation of this recognition site was indicated by zzso in zzso cells of a mouse zzso zzso zzso by the same spectrum of zzso that activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso acid may explain the reported zzso effects on induction of zzso and zzso by this zzso zzso We show that this zzso occurs directly on the zzso zzso whereas the zzso promoter of zzso is induced by zzso acid in reporter gene zzso These experiments exploit the unique zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso
