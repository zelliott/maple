The stable signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus surface zzso precursor has several unique zzso The zzso is unusually long, at 58 zzso zzso and contains two zzso zzso and its sequence is highly zzso among both Old and New World zzso To better understand the functions of the zzso a panel of point and deletion zzso was created by in zzso zzso to target the highly zzso elements within the zzso We were also able to confirm critical zzso required for separate zzso functions by zzso Using these approaches, it was possible to resolve functional zzso of the zzso In characterizing our zzso zzso we discovered that the zzso is involved in several distinct functions within the viral life cycle, beyond zzso of the viral surface zzso precursor into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso zzso maturation zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso transport to the cell surface plasma zzso formation of infectious virus zzso and acid zzso zzso cell zzso
