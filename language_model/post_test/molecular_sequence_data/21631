The expression of the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is routinely used to assess the zzso status of human embryonic stem cells zzso and induced zzso stem zzso zzso Although it is known that the zzso recognized by zzso and zzso are zzso the exact molecular identity of these zzso has been zzso zzso array analysis with more than 500 zzso structures revealed specific binding of zzso and zzso to two molecules containing terminal type 1 zzso zzso and zzso The type 1 zzso in itself was not sufficient for zzso indicating that the complete zzso requires an extended zzso structure where the type 1 zzso is zzso to type 2 zzso Our mass zzso analysis zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated the presence of the extended zzso zzso on an zzso with the likely structure zzso Thus, the present data indicate that the zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso recognize the minimal zzso zzso which is present in zzso as a part of a zzso zzso zzso The exact molecular identity of zzso and zzso is important for the development of improved tools to characterize the zzso zzso
