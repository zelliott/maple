The zzso gene from zzso zzso type G was cloned as a series of overlapping DNA fragments generated using zzso chain reaction zzso technology and zzso designed to zzso regions of published zzso toxin zzso zzso The zzso of the gene was obtained using a primer based on a zzso region of the zzso gene lying upstream of the toxin zzso zzso of the zzso sequence derived from the cloned zzso fragments demonstrated that the gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative alignment of the determined zzso sequence with those of other zzso zzso revealed highest sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso and other zzso types revealed lower levels of zzso with zzso zzso range zzso zzso acid zzso
