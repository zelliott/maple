A 246 zzso zzso clone representing the zzso region of the donkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso The transcript contained the 3' untranslated region and zzso of the zzso zzso coding region zzso acid zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso of the deduced donkey zzso acid sequence with the published horse zzso zzso protein sequence (where they zzso revealed an overall zzso of zzso However, most of the differences were in the zzso extension, which is thought not to be important for zzso activity, and appeared to be due to two zzso insertions in the donkey sequence zzso with a deduced horse zzso zzso leading to a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso region was zzso Some of the differences in this region were in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and these are interpreted in relation to the observed biological activities of horse and donkey zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the donkey zzso indicated that it was larger than the majority of zzso zzso due to a zzso zzso zzso and horse zzso (and horse zzso beta zzso have analogous zzso zzso The extension in the donkey zzso is 25 zzso acid zzso in zzso compared with 28 in the horse and 24 in zzso Comparisons with other available zzso DNA sequences indicated that, like the human zzso zzso the donkey gene probably evolved from an ancestral zzso beta zzso following zzso deletions that allowed zzso into previously untranslated zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
