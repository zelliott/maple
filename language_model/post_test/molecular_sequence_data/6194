zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso makes use of zzso folding of zzso DNA zzso which alters the zzso mobility of the fragments, to detect sequence differences between closely related zzso In this study zzso were zzso by depletion of the complementary strand and zzso zzso on magnetic zzso zzso It was found that zzso profiles created by zzso zzso differ from the profiles created by more usual zzso zzso Under some conditions, zzso profiles using whole zzso reaction products may result from the interaction between residual zzso zzso and zzso We observed that the ratio of zzso revealed by band position and band intensity may vary between the zzso techniques and zzso of sequence zzso may zzso Another observation of this study was the formation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso by eliminating the zzso treatment used in conventional zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso represents a novel and sensitive system for detection of sequence variation between closely related zzso The technique used here for the preparation of the zzso zzso is potentially useful for automated zzso analysis using zzso zzso or other zzso
