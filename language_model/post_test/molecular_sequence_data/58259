zzso are structural lens proteins with a zzso zzso structure and variable zzso and zzso zzso These extensions are assumed to be involved in zzso interactions within the zzso zzso or with other lens zzso zzso the production of beta zzso and beta zzso from the single beta zzso zzso by dual translation initiation is of zzso These zzso are zzso except that beta A1 has a much shorter zzso extension that beta zzso This rare mechanism has been zzso for over 250 million years during the evolution of the beta zzso zzso suggesting that the generation of different zzso extensions zzso a selective zzso We therefore compared the stability and association zzso of zzso beta zzso and beta zzso Both proteins are equally stable in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso established that beta A3 and beta A1 both form zzso In the zzso proteins of bovine zzso beta A3 and beta A1 are present in the same molecular weight zzso indicating that they zzso equally with other zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso extension of beta A3 have great flexibility and are zzso exposed, excluding them from protein interactions in the zzso These results indicate that the different zzso extensions of beta A3 and beta A1 do not affect their zzso or zzso zzso
