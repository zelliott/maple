It is well-established that atmospheric deposition zzso mercury from lower latitudes to the zzso The role of bacteria in the dynamics of the deposited mercury, however, is zzso We characterized zzso bacteria from High Arctic snow, freshwater and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso brine and snow, zzso zzso zzso was observed in snow zzso followed by freshwater zzso and brine zzso In snow, the zzso bacteria accounted for up to zzso of the zzso bacteria, but zzso in freshwater and zzso The resistant bacteria belonged to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Resistance levels of most zzso were not temperature zzso Of the resistant zzso zzso reduced zzso to zzso No relation between resistance level, ability to reduce zzso and zzso group was zzso An zzso of the potential bacterial reduction of zzso in snow suggested that it was important in the deeper snow layers where light zzso inhibited zzso Thus, by reducing zzso to zzso zzso bacteria may limit the supply of zzso for zzso processes and, zzso contribute to lowering the risk that zzso is being incorporated into the Arctic food zzso
