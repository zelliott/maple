We analyze the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the induction of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis shows that zzso increases the zzso of zzso zzso To identify potential zzso response elements in the zzso zzso we produced stable zzso containing zzso zzso or hybrid zzso in which most of the zzso zzso region zzso or the zzso boxes alone zzso were placed in a downstream position from the zzso coding zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso activity in zzso cells and a zzso and zzso increase in zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso D chase experiments in zzso cells demonstrate that zzso increases the zzso of zzso zzso from 15 zzso to 3 h in zzso cells and more than 3 h in zzso cells, suggesting that the effect of zzso is zzso predominantly by the zzso boxes with a smaller contribution from upstream zzso To map these upstream regions, we zzso cells with zzso containing zzso of the zzso zzso With two of these zzso corresponding to a region located about 160 bases upstream of the zzso boxes, zzso activity was induced only zzso compared to zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate that two regions within the zzso zzso region interact to zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso
