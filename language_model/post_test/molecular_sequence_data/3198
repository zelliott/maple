The zzso is a highly specialized zzso complex of zzso muscles that serves as the interface of the zzso and the zzso In addition to its role in muscle contraction, its juxtaposition to the plasma membrane suggests additional functions of the zzso in sensing and zzso external and internal zzso Recently, we described two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that bind zzso on the zzso and serve as zzso binding proteins for zzso a zzso zzso shown to be integral in cardiac zzso as well as skeletal muscle differentiation and zzso zzso Here, we describe an additional member of the zzso family, zzso which is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle and is enriched in zzso muscle zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso interacts with zzso and the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso interact with the zzso domain protein zzso which also zzso to the zzso zzso represent a novel family of zzso proteins that serve as focal points for the interactions of an array of proteins involved in zzso structure and signal zzso in zzso zzso
