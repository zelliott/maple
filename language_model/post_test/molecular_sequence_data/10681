We have characterized four novel zzso zzso genes that, together with the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, form a distinct and unusual cluster within the zzso A gene zzso Three of these genes zzso zzso zzso include complete open reading zzso zzso zzso with eight zzso and appropriately spaced zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso that are characteristic of this enlarging protein family; the fourth sequence encodes a zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequence similarities among these zzso zzso varies from 60 to zzso they form a unique zzso as each sequence is found to be more closely related to another of this group than to either zzso zzso or to zzso pancreatic zzso Interestingly, the relationship between the six genes in this zzso zzso and the defined lineages of the zzso A gene family could not be determined by zzso acid sequence zzso suggesting the possibility that there are one or more additional zzso lineages that have yet to be zzso Although the nature of the evolutionary constraints promoting this unusual expansion and diversification remain zzso the implications with respect to function are zzso
