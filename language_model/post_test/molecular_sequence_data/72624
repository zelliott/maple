The zzso zzso plays an important role in cardiac zzso by moving zzso across the plasma membrane during zzso zzso A 20 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to mimic a region of the zzso zzso exchange zzso We identify here zzso acid zzso important for zzso zzso zzso of modified peptides on zzso exchange activity were zzso Exchange activity was assessed as zzso zzso into zzso cardiac zzso zzso We find that the entire length of zzso is important for zzso zzso though the major zzso components are between zzso 5 and zzso Basic and aromatic zzso are most important for the zzso function of zzso zzso of zzso 12 and zzso 14 with zzso or zzso dramatically decrease the potency of zzso suggesting that these zzso play a key role in possible zzso zzso zzso of other basic zzso with zzso or zzso had less effect on the potency of zzso All aromatic zzso participate in binding with the zzso probably via zzso interactions as indicated by zzso zzso A zzso is required at position 6 for zzso zzso and zzso 5 and zzso 8 can only be replaced by other aromatic zzso zzso 10 and zzso 13 can be replaced with other bulky zzso A specific zzso of zzso with structural zzso provided by all parts of the zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso
