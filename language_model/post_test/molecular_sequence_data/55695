The message for the zinc finger gene zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and embryonic stem zzso zzso of zzso is reduced at the zzso level when zzso cells are induced by the addition of zzso acid zzso to zzso We have isolated zzso DNA for the zzso gene zzso characterized the zzso structure, and mapped the gene to mouse zzso zzso zzso elements contributing to the regulation of the zzso promoter in zzso cells have been zzso A region required for zzso promoter activity in zzso stem cells contains an zzso motif zzso which is a binding site for zzso zzso factor members of the zzso domain family of zzso zzso zzso reporter plasmids including this zzso site also exhibited reduced expression in zzso cells treated with zzso Thus, the zzso motif is a regulatory element required for the activity of the zzso promoter in zzso stem cells, and this motif contributes to the negative regulation by zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso As an initial confirmation of the in zzso relevance of the isolated fragment, a larger zzso promoter fragment, also containing the zzso site, was able to promote expression of the bacterial zzso gene in mouse zzso at the zzso zzso
