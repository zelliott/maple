In a recent paper zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) we reported that the positions of the two zzso regulatory zzso identified in a zzso zzso zzso from potato zzso zzso zzso differ substantially from those zzso in zzso zzso zzso To investigate the origin of zzso regulation in zzso zzso from zzso organisms, we isolated and characterized several zzso zzso sequences from higher plants and from a green and a red zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the zzso zzso cluster in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and are zzso at three out of six zzso zzso of the mature proteins and the signal peptides revealed that two different zzso zzso classes zzso and zzso evolved from a common ancestral zzso The two zzso sequences branch off prior to this class separation in higher plants, sharing about similar zzso acid identity with either of the two zzso zzso zzso The genes for zzso plant zzso clearly share a common zzso with animal and zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso branch within the zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso regulation arose independently in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
