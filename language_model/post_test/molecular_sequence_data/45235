The genes zzso several synaptic zzso including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are expressed selectively by a small number of zzso zzso positioned near the synaptic zzso zzso analysis of zzso mice suggests that additional zzso expressed selectively by synaptic zzso might zzso zzso retrograde signals that regulate the differentiation of motor zzso zzso To identify candidate retrograde signals, we used a zzso screen to identify genes that are zzso expressed in the synaptic region of muscle, and we analyzed one such zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso which encodes a small, zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso by zzso synaptic zzso in embryonic and adult muscle, and that zzso expression is restricted to the central region of muscle independent of zzso Moreover, we show that zzso has a role in zzso zzso because synaptic transmission is depressed and fails entirely, in a cyclical manner, after repetitive stimulation of motor zzso in zzso zzso zzso These deficits in synaptic transmission, which are accompanied by zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso indicate that zzso is required for normal zzso maturation and zzso Because zzso is also expressed in some zzso additional experiments will be required to determine whether zzso or zzso zzso mediates these effects on zzso development and zzso
