zzso DNA coding for the zzso zzso of a large zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso was cloned from bovine zzso smooth muscle zzso This cloned zzso zzso channel zzso and its zzso from zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso human embryonic kidney cell zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso channels were sensitive to zzso by the internally applied zzso zzso zzso bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso zzso The approximately zzso zzso zzso of these proteins have a different zzso structure except in the region of a loop formed by approximately 6 zzso in which the zzso backbone adopts a similar zzso complementary to the active site zzso of many zzso zzso At the single-channel level, zzso and zzso were found to inhibit zzso channels by a similar mechanism involving the production of discrete zzso zzso These two zzso also exhibited competitive behavior, suggesting that they bind to an overlapping zzso zzso characterization revealed that the zzso rate of zzso from the bovine zzso channel is fast zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas that from the zzso zzso channel is slow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and indicative of a strong molecular zzso The stable complex of zzso and zzso was inactive as a zzso channel zzso further supporting the idea that the zzso zzso loop of zzso recognizes a specific site on the channel zzso These results lead to the conclusion that the zzso of zzso zzso channels contains a zzso zzso inhibitor binding zzso We zzso that this site zzso to a zzso domain of the channel protein that structurally resembles zzso zzso
