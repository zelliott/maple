Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso integration was investigated in mice zzso with zzso cells, a zzso producing human zzso zzso From zzso DNA derived from a zzso zzso zzso we cloned a zzso integration site by zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed that zzso zzso was integrated into an zzso of the mouse transforming growth zzso gene in the reverse zzso This result provides for the first time molecular evidence that mice can be infected with zzso
