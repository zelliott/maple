Using a variety of techniques, including sequence zzso secondary structure zzso molecular mechanics and molecular zzso we have constructed a model for the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso based on that of zzso the only zzso zzso zzso for which the crystal structure is zzso The predicted structure is found to be in good agreement with current experimental zzso both zzso from zzso zzso studies, and zzso from the consideration of the structures and activities of known zzso and zzso
