zzso are a diverse group of biologically active natural products that accumulate in soybean seeds during zzso The majority of zzso are accumulated in the form of their zzso and zzso in soybean zzso The zzso step zzso stability and zzso to zzso zzso enabling their zzso to zzso or transport to the site of zzso A functional zzso approach was used to identify zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso from soybean zzso zzso zzso An expressed sequence tag database for soybean was searched by key words to make a list of candidate zzso The full-length zzso for candidate zzso and zzso were obtained and cloned into an expression zzso for the production of zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activity zzso were conducted for zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as donors with zzso zzso Among several zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity towards all three soybean zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso activity towards zzso zzso The zzso zzso study revealed both zzso and zzso to be in the zzso The transcripts and protein zzso patterns for zzso and zzso genes have provided further support for their in zzso zzso
