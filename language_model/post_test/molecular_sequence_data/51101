zzso zzso a representative of a new family of zzso zzso is remarkably sensitive to zzso strength and has two zzso active forms, which zzso with changing pH zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To reveal whether zzso changes are associated with these effects, zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso gel zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso of the zzso native protein generated two fragments, one having a molecular mass of 51 zzso and the other of 26 zzso The zzso was markedly dependent on the zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso proceeded more rapidly in zzso M zzso buffer than in zzso M zzso buffer containing zzso M zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso formed at low zzso strength was not stable but zzso and zzso during an extended zzso The zzso experiments suggested that zzso in the zzso strength elicits zzso changes in native zzso zzso and this may account for the enhanced zzso activity observed at higher zzso zzso The two fragments of the zzso zzso zzso did not separate during zzso zzso under zzso conditions on a zzso 12 column and zzso in place of the native zzso indicating that they were strongly zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was labeled with zzso zzso zzso and the fragments were separated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
