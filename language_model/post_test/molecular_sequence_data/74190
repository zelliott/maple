A zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso that protects zzso cells in zzso and in zzso from Alzheimer's zzso zzso We have shown before that the structures of zzso and a zzso more active zzso zzso with a zzso zzso are largely zzso During additional zzso analysis, a shorter zzso acid form, zzso was accidentally discovered to have a zzso higher activity than zzso Here we have characterized the structural properties of the zzso analog by circular zzso zzso and zzso equilibrium zzso First, the structure in water was zzso since these peptides have been dissolved in water prior to biological zzso The zzso zzso exhibited extensive zzso structure in water, completely different from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure was converted to a zzso structure upon dilution into zzso saline (PBS) at low zzso concentration zzso below zzso which was similar to the structure of zzso and zzso observed under similar zzso zzso equilibrium analysis showed that the zzso analog was essentially zzso in zzso while zzso showed extensive zzso Such zzso of zzso was observed when the zzso was added to the zzso cell culture zzso Thus, the zzso introduced into the zzso analog generated a zzso different from the parent zzso and zzso peptides in the zzso properties and hence the zzso which most likely contributed to the increased biological activity of the zzso zzso
