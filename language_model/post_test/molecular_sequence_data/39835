Human zzso gene is a typical zzso zzso zinc finger gene whose zzso has been found only in higher zzso and not in lower zzso such as zzso Its expression profiles have suggested that it plays a role in the differentiation of blood cells during early human embryonic development and the zzso of zzso To gain additional insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the zzso gene and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of zzso we have mapped the zzso of the human zzso zzso by reverse zzso and primer extension zzso We then cloned the zzso zzso DNA containing the putative zzso gene promoter and analyzed its function in several different human and mouse tissue culture cell zzso Interestingly, our studies show that the zzso gene lacks a typical zzso promoter that is present upstream of the zzso start site and directs a zzso level of zzso Instead, the functional promoter requires an essential element that is located within the first zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis reveals the requirement for a zzso zzso protein zzso site within this element for promoter zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso confirm that zzso binds to the site in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso enhances the promoter zzso These results demonstrate that the human zzso gene promoter is zzso and requires an zzso element located within the first zzso that mediates the effect of zzso for its zzso
