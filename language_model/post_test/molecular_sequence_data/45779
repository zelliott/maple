An zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso from zzso zzso zzso cultures by ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso The native zzso is zzso and zzso with a molecular mass of approximately zzso At its optimal pH of zzso the zzso shows highest activity among zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 192 zzso zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned by a zzso strategy using zzso DNA as zzso This zzso gene predicts an zzso that encodes a primary translation product of zzso zzso zzso We believe that this zzso is processed zzso by signal zzso and a zzso zzso to yield a mature protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares zzso zzso acid identity with other zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso Family zzso It also possesses the eight zzso zzso and signature pattern zzso shown by all Family 5 zzso zzso of the cloned zzso gene in zzso cells, followed by zzso HC zzso zzso yielded zzso quantities of homogeneous zzso zzso in active form for further characterization zzso
