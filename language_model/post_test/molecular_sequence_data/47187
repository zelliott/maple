We have examined zzso of zzso zzso cells by focusing on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness was determined by examining the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso reporter activity in rat zzso cells zzso with an zzso zzso The results demonstrate an zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso reporter activity, indicating that zzso cells contain functional zzso response element zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso in combination with zzso zzso show that zzso is the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso Western zzso results show that zzso cells contain zzso zzso zzso at a size substantially larger than the zzso protein generated from the originally proposed zzso zzso acid zzso zzso This size zzso is not due to zzso cell expression of zzso zzso with insertions within the coding region because zzso zzso revealed products with sizes expected for zzso zzso and zzso zzso This size zzso appears to be due to usage of a zzso upstream zzso translation initiation zzso zzso leading to a zzso zzso acid open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization using zzso amplification of complementary DNA ends zzso show the presence of two different zzso and zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso The generation of the zzso zzso is likely due to initiation of zzso from an alternative zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in zzso cells, and they are rapidly zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso in cultured zzso zzso Taken together, our results show that rat zzso cells produce two different zzso zzso zzso species and that these zzso species are capable of zzso the full-length zzso zzso
