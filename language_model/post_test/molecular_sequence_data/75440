The zzso zzso zzso DNA binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso It is thought to consist of two zzso the zzso domain involved in zzso determination and the zzso domain functioning in DNA replication and DNA zzso We have determined the zzso sequences of the zzso genes of zzso and zzso two human zzso zzso that differ significantly from other zzso zzso of structural and functional importance in the corresponding proteins could be identified by comparison of the zzso acid sequences with those of other known zzso In addition, the zzso sequences of the zzso early zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and of parts of the zzso and zzso protein genes have been zzso It can be deduced from the zzso zzso that the zzso and zzso zzso are relatively small zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso respectively, versus 529 zzso for the zzso zzso This is caused by the presence of very small zzso zzso of 119 zzso zzso and 120 zzso zzso as compared to 173 zzso for the corresponding zzso zzso Only a few zzso acids in this domain have been zzso in all known zzso The zzso zzso show a higher degree of sequence zzso In this domain, four strongly zzso regions can be identified, one of which might form a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso show a strong zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso with the exception of the zzso end of the zzso The zzso zzso gene of zzso has an open reading frame that extends beyond the zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso gene that ends well in front of the zzso
