To study the expression of late zzso abundant gene in seeds, the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso a late zzso abundant gene of zzso zzso zzso Coker zzso was cloned by zzso The similarity compared with the sequence of Lea protein gene family published was zzso There are three putative zzso and one zzso which riches zzso in the zzso The promoter was fused to the zzso gene to form zzso zzso Via a particle zzso zzso II was introduced into zzso zzso of cotton and seeds of zzso zzso which were all treated with zzso acid for zzso before zzso also into roots, stems and zzso of zzso zzso expression was measured zzso as spot number 24 h after zzso zzso zzso was observed in the seeds of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of cotton, but not found in roots and leaves of zzso Those results indicated that the expression of zzso gene promoter was zzso zzso
