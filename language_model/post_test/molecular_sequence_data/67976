zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso or infected with zzso zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso or a zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and the peak fraction of the protein zzso which was zzso only in the extract of zzso zzso cells was subjected to successive zzso The zzso was zzso more than zzso from the zzso zzso and the final preparation contained one major protein of apparent molecular weight 66 zzso zzso which was zzso in the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso to an synthetic zzso corresponding to the 15 zzso acids of the predicted zzso zzso protein sequence strongly reacted with a 66 K protein in the zzso zzso On zzso 12 zzso zzso the protein zzso activity was zzso as a single major peak at a position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 zzso These results suggest that the 66 K protein is the protein zzso zzso by the zzso gene of zzso and that it acts as a zzso The zzso protein zzso was relatively resistant to high zzso of salt, but zzso above 400 zzso exerted a significant zzso zzso When the zzso specificity was investigated using synthetic zzso the peptides containing zzso zzso on the zzso side of the target zzso zzso were found to be the best zzso for the protein zzso However, the replacement of the zzso zzso to zzso markedly reduced the rate of zzso by this zzso suggesting that zzso is a poor zzso zzso of the protein zzso The zzso was resistant to zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso II, but was moderately sensitive to zzso zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso a zzso also inhibited the protein zzso and the zzso effect was competitive towards zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso The results indicate that the zzso properties of the zzso zzso protein zzso are very similar to those of the zzso counterpart and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso but are different from those in several zzso
