We evaluated the genetic structure of birds from four closely spaced zzso in a peripheral population of lesser zzso zzso zzso zzso of molecular zzso revealed significant genetic structuring among birds from different zzso for six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but we found no genetic differentiation at the zzso control zzso zzso zzso from zzso revealed an excess of zzso zzso within each of the zzso studied zzso zzso zzso indicative of increased zzso Estimates of zzso using zzso data suggest that the genetic structuring among lesser zzso zzso occurs in part because of a zzso mating system in which males at some zzso are zzso zzso may also be caused by zzso effects associated with a historical decline in population size leading to small, zzso zzso and high site zzso by zzso zzso zzso from this study suggest that zzso genetic structuring may occur in zzso bird species with low levels of zzso
