The cloning and expression of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso O zzso in a zzso host have been described previously zzso zzso Manning, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reeves, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was thus assumed that all the genes required for zzso expression were located on a zzso zzso restriction zzso We present evidence for a number of other as yet zzso genes that are essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that these genes are somehow zzso in zzso coli zzso The two genes termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed in the opposite orientation from the rest of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso respectively, are transcribed in the same zzso The evidence presented here, using zzso zzso zzso clearly shows that the three genes now designated zzso zzso and zzso appear to be accessory zzso genes and are essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso but that zzso is zzso
