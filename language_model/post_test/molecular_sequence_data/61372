zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetically zzso group of inherited neurodegenerative zzso Recently, an zzso zzso form of zzso was mapped to zzso and subsequently the defective gene associated to zzso was identified and designated zzso The zzso gene product was predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso and is called zzso zzso is highly zzso to a class of well studied zzso zzso zinc zzso which show zzso zzso and zzso identity, respectively, to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso in zzso results in zzso effects with regard to growth, zzso and, particularly, in the assembly and/or degradation of more than one zzso protein zzso Taking into account the zzso of zzso to these zzso zzso zinc zzso and what is known about their function, allows us to speculate as to what function zzso plays in normal zzso
