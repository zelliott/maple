A total of 34 tissue zzso were collected from zzso zzso zzso patients and 5 controls with zzso zzso DNA from tissue zzso were analyzed for presence of specific gene sequences to zzso type A and type B, and zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso The different sequences of zzso type A and B were parts from the highly divergent forms of the zzso nuclear zzso 2 zzso zzso The zzso amplified products for zzso 2A and zzso zzso were 115 and 119 base pairs respectively whereas that of zzso DNA was zzso base zzso The results demonstrated that zzso DNA was detected in 32 of 34 cases zzso 28 zzso with type A, 2 zzso with type B, and 2 zzso with both zzso zzso DNA of type A could be detected 1 zzso of 5 zzso zzso DNA was in 5 of 34 samples zzso whereas zzso DNA was not zzso in biopsy zzso from zzso The results show that in the zzso patient group, A type of zzso is zzso zzso of zzso DNA in patients group only might be resulted from zzso of a zzso infection or association with zzso of zzso
