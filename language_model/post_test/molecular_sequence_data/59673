The primary and atomic structures of the zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were determined several years ago by zzso sequencing and X-ray zzso In this work the gene zzso this zzso (named zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes 320 zzso zzso mature protein of 300 zzso zzso mass 31 zzso zzso and a zzso of 20 zzso zzso Our deduced zzso sequence was directly confirmed by zzso the zzso protein from the same bacterial strain and sequencing the zzso zzso as well as several peptides derived from zzso zzso However, comparison of this deduced zzso sequence with the published primary structure of this zzso zzso from the same strain (but cultivated for zzso 30 years in a different zzso reveals seven differences in the zzso sequence at the following positions in the mature protein zzso 59 zzso 123 zzso 135 zzso 189 zzso 196 zzso 231 zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, analysis of the positioning of these zzso revealed that they are located exclusively on zzso zzso with two of them deeply buried within the zzso These zzso may in fact have only marginal influence on zzso structure and zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso encodes an zzso transcript of zzso zzso No differential response in the abundance or size of this zzso was seen upon growth under zzso zzso zzso conditions, under high or low zzso zzso zzso extension experiments revealed a zzso start site 73 bases upstream from the zzso translation start, juxtaposed to the identified putative promoter zzso Fusion of zzso with this putative promoter region zzso a zzso upstream zzso revealed similar promoter activity in zzso zzso under both zzso conditions tested, again suggesting that this gene is zzso zzso The molecular genetic characterization described in this work opens the way for zzso studies by zzso zzso
