We have investigated the zzso zzso of several DNA zzso containing sequences related to zzso in neutral pH and low pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso and zzso exhibit new sets of zzso at low pH zzso zzso when compared to those from the neutral pH zzso The low pH form and the neutral pH form are in slow zzso zzso of the data suggest that these sequences under low pH conditions adopt structures distinct from zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso data from the DNA zzso zzso of the neutral and low pH samples were used to analyze their respective structures in zzso An zzso zzso zzso refinement zzso zzso zzso zzso & Wang, zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso was used to show that the neutral pH structure is close to zzso zzso In contrast, analysis of the low pH form using the zzso zzso data suggests that its structure is consistent with a right-handed zzso zzso double zzso with symmetrical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso base zzso Supporting evidence for the zzso zzso includes the zzso zzso relaxation times associated with the two ends of the zzso The structure is favored by the zzso sequence in which the zzso provide the zzso pairing for the nucleation step and the zzso step is significantly stabilized by the zzso zzso stacking zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
