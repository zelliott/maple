zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso T is activated by a variety of stress conditions: it is zzso by nitrogen zzso and induced by heat zzso Furthermore, it is activated by zzso and zzso zzso This study shows that a zzso upstream region previously found to be involved in zzso zzso and heat control zzso pairs zzso to zzso contains a zzso element zzso zzso to zzso which is sufficient for the zzso of a reporter gene by all types of stress acting on zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated the existence of a factor specifically binding to zzso but to a lesser extent to zzso elements having partly or entirely lost the ability to mediate stress zzso Heat zzso of zzso but not of a zzso heat shock element, is enhanced by a zzso zzso zzso which enhances zzso and is dramatically reduced by a zzso disruption zzso which decreases zzso It can be hypothesized, therefore, that the novel stress control element is important for the establishment of induced stress zzso
