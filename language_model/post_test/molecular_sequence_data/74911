We present in this paper the zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso has zzso zzso it consists of many zzso stretches, only the zzso and zzso ends of the protein (about 100 and 50 zzso acids zzso being mostly zzso No zzso zzso signal zzso is present, although it is shown in this work that the zzso of the zzso zzso goes through the zzso zzso Using the results of three different methods, allowing the prediction of zzso alpha zzso in zzso zzso we drew a model of folding of the zzso in the zzso
