The development of in zzso zzso technologies have provided many powerful tools for the molecular zzso research zzso In this chapter we describe some of these tools with a focus on the zzso zzso zzso zzso technologies are particularly useful because the zzso zzso system has simple requirements, is efficient, random in target recognition, and zzso In particular we will describe the use of in zzso zzso zzso in zzso tagging and in the generation of zzso zzso We will also describe a unique in zzso zzso technology in which zzso zzso can be generated in a wide spectrum of bacterial species through the zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso
