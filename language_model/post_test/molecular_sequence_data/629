Human zzso zzso are common pathogens which cause a broad spectrum of illnesses ranging from zzso infection to acute zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso determination is zzso and zzso There is a need for a methodology that is more rapid and widely zzso 

Our goals were to develop an zzso to type zzso which combines both zzso zzso based on indirect zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by DNA sequence analysis and to assess the correlation of both zzso and zzso to traditional viral zzso by zzso zzso 

Clinical specimens initially determined to be zzso positive by zzso acid detection were grown in cell culture and typed using zzso zzso that could not be typed by zzso were subject to molecular zzso zzso was performed by a combination of either a primary or zzso zzso for a region within zzso and followed by direct DNA sequencing of zzso zzso Database zzso comparisons and zzso analysis were performed based on a defined region zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso specimens into culture and 115 zzso of these zzso were successfully typed by this zzso We have demonstrated a strong correlation between zzso by viral zzso to both zzso by zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of human zzso can be effectively performed using an integration of zzso and molecular zzso
