An open reading frame with the characteristics of a zzso sequence was identified by zzso sequencing of human zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence was zzso with zzso H of zzso zzso virus type 1 and the zzso protein of zzso virus zzso gene zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso zzso viruses that expressed this gene were zzso A zzso of approximately 86 zzso was zzso from cells infected with the zzso viruses and from zzso cells with a zzso zzso that efficiently neutralized zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, this zzso was present on nuclear and zzso zzso but in zzso zzso zzso cells it accumulated predominantly on the nuclear zzso
