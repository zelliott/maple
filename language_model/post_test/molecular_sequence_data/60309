The zzso proteins are zzso adapter proteins with a common arrangement of zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the zzso sequencing, and expression of zzso 2, a novel member of the zzso protein family and accordingly zzso the original zzso to zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso and human zzso reveal an open reading frame zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso Despite its high sequence similarity to zzso 1, zzso 2 is zzso by distinct transcripts in human and zzso in particular displaying a ubiquitous expression zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal a zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso another zzso protein derived from chicken brain, zzso 2 could not be detected at focal zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso 2 is a novel zzso zzso with similar domain and motif arrangement, but an unrestricted expression pattern, which may participate in the organization of the zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso
