zzso zzso is considered to be a zzso pathogen with increasing medical zzso The putative zzso factor, zzso zzso a putative zzso is enriched among the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene is described to be part of a zzso island and was recently identified to be zzso Here, we present a description of the structure, zzso and distribution of the putative zzso factor zzso and its putative island among 39 clinical zzso and zzso the composition and host range of zzso a zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso The zzso gene was located within a zzso element highly similar to the putative zzso island zzso structure that had been previously zzso This zzso region was zzso among 39 zzso strains with variation in a specific region downstream of zzso in 18 zzso The putative zzso was located on large plasmids zzso in 37 zzso zzso could be zzso transferred into four different zzso zzso recipient strains zzso but not into zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resolved putative zzso zzso zzso and maintenance zzso as well as a zzso gene zzso carbon zzso and zzso zzso heavy metal and zzso resistance zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso bears additional putative zzso factors and zzso resistance zzso These findings suggest horizontal gene transfer of zzso factors and zzso resistance gene clusters by a single genetic event zzso zzso which might be triggered by heavy zzso use common in health care units where zzso zzso is increasingly zzso
