zzso mediates zzso immunity by recognizing zzso viruses and triggers potent zzso and zzso zzso In this study, approximately zzso zzso sequence data of zzso zzso gene were generated from one sample each of twelve different Indian goat breeds belonging to different geographical zzso Cloning and characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso from goat zzso revealed zzso zzso to be of zzso zzso long coding for zzso zzso acids similar to other zzso species, that is zzso buffalo and zzso The sequence analysis at zzso level revealed goat zzso to be closer to buffalo sharing zzso zzso followed by cattle and zzso zzso Modular Architecture Research zzso zzso used for the structural analysis of goat zzso showed the presence of 16 zzso repeats zzso along with single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain when compared with other livestock species was found to be zzso in zzso species zzso zzso cattle and zzso The zzso analysis also revealed grouping of all zzso species together, goat being closer to buffalo followed by cattle and zzso Total 4 zzso sites were observed in zzso gene of one zzso goat representing each of 12 different breeds zzso all of which were synonymous and present within the coding zzso Of these 4 zzso two were in zzso one in zzso domain and one was found to be present in zzso zzso zzso zzso of two of the zzso indicated variations in zzso zzso among different goat zzso The expression profiling in 13 zzso of goat showed maximum expression of zzso gene in kidney followed by zzso lung and zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate conservation of zzso gene among the zzso species and low variation within Indian goat zzso
