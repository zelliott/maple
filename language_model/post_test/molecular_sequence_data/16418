We needed to sort expressed sequence tags zzso from human cardiac expression zzso 

We zzso DNA sequence text files of zzso cardiac zzso using our search and zzso tool called zzso We generated lists of the most prevalent zzso in each library, and using a novel zzso zzso we grouped zzso that were common to all or exclusive to particular zzso 

zzso protein zzso was expressed 120 times among zzso zzso from an adult cardiac library zzso compared only once among zzso zzso from fetal cardiac libraries zzso zzso zzso this was confirmed using Northern zzso We collated zzso features of zzso and determined DNA zzso zzso We also used the zzso tool to specify genes that were uniquely expressed in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and sorting them using zzso analysis can help specify new candidate disease genes from the current lists of zzso zzso
