The zzso sequences of the first internal transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene cluster have been determined for 11 species of closely related endemic zzso zzso of the Lake Victoria region zzso and 6 related East African zzso The zzso sequences confirmed independently derived zzso zzso but provide limited insight within this species zzso The line leading to zzso zzso arose early, close to the divergence event that separated the zzso and zzso tribes of the zzso zzso of the family zzso In this zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are sister zzso which together are a sister group to a zzso zzso including both Lake Victoria and Lake Edward zzso The zzso data support the zzso of zzso zzso across zzso Since Lake Victoria is believed to have been dry between 14, 500 and zzso zzso the modern zzso must have been derived from zzso by the products of earlier zzso zzso Thus, although the regional zzso is zzso the zzso of Lake Victoria itself did not evolve in zzso from a single zzso
