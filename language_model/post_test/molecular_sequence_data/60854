zzso zzso forms of the zzso inhibitor and potential zzso drug zzso were isolated from human blood zzso zzso zzso was identified by a zzso rabbit zzso raised against an zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso by consecutive zzso steps and zzso zzso and zzso sequence analyses of the isolated molecules revealed different forms of zzso starting with zzso lacking the last and final three zzso of the zzso domain 1 zzso of collagen zzso zzso These zzso are found to be zzso at zzso zzso 9) with a zzso structure of the zzso type consisting of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso analyses were performed via the zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso technique after zzso zzso zzso zzso are present as zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso Da zzso zzso and zzso structures (21 zzso and 21 zzso Da zzso zzso while the two completely zzso forms are obtained only after zzso zzso The described zzso zzso may represent zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of collagen zzso resulting in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso fragments of human collagen zzso are found in the zzso These zzso exhibit the zzso sequences zzso and zzso of the collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses reveal three zzso zzso with a molecular mass ranging from 16 to 21 zzso Due to the high degree of zzso between collagen zzso and collagen zzso as well as their zzso zzso processing, functional similarities of collagen zzso and zzso fragments should be revealed in future zzso
