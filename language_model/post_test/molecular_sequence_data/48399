zzso is a major cause of acute zzso in infants and young children, while its role as a pathogen in adults has long been zzso In order to describe the zzso patterns and genetic characteristics of zzso causing sporadic acute zzso in adults, zzso surveillance of zzso infections was conducted in Shanghai, China, between June 2010 and May zzso zzso specimens were collected from zzso with acute zzso admitted to three local zzso zzso was detected using a zzso gold test zzso G and P zzso were performed by multiplex zzso zzso and the zzso gene of zzso strains were zzso for further genetic zzso Of zzso adult zzso stool samples examined during the zzso surveillance period, 138 zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso appeared to be the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a shift from zzso zzso to zzso in the study population in zzso Meanwhile, a high frequency of zzso zzso zzso was also observed, and zzso was also zzso zzso in the small number of children zzso involved in the present zzso Other zzso detected in adults were zzso zzso and zzso zzso For P zzso only two types, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was dominant in both children and zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that these strains could be divided into two different groups, with zzso within zzso lineage 3 and the zzso of Japanese and Chinese zzso zzso zzso In comparison to the previous data, zzso strains established themselves in a short time span as an important zzso in Shanghai, zzso
