Short peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso of several zzso proteins are able to bind to their specific zzso sites with high affinities and zzso In the case of the zzso zzso response element zzso complex, the zzso forms a single zzso that binds deeply in a zzso distorted zzso major groove and makes a substantial set of zzso and backbone zzso Using a reporter system based on zzso by the zzso zzso N zzso it has been possible to identify novel zzso peptides from zzso libraries that recognize the zzso with affinities and zzso similar to Rev but that appear to bind in zzso zzso Here we have used zzso zzso to evolve one of these zzso zzso into an even tighter zzso After two rounds of evolution, zzso bound the zzso with zzso higher affinity and zzso higher specificity than the zzso Rev zzso and in zzso competition experiments show that zzso completely zzso the intact Rev protein from the zzso at low zzso zzso By fusing zzso peptides to the zzso domain of zzso zzso we show that the peptides can deliver zzso to the zzso site and activate zzso in zzso cells, and more importantly, that the fusion proteins can inhibit the activity of Rev in zzso zzso reporter zzso The evolved peptides contain zzso and zzso acid zzso near the middle of their sequences and, despite the presence of a zzso show partial zzso formation in the absence of zzso These directed evolution experiments illustrate how readily complex zzso structures can be evolved within the context of an zzso zzso perhaps reflecting how early protein structures evolved in an zzso zzso
