We have identified an zzso zzso zzso gene which, unlike the putative zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene in zzso zzso and genetic studies suggest a role in zzso pole body zzso zzso studies link zzso function to membrane trafficking and signal zzso We have described the zzso expression pattern in a zzso zzso the zones of cell division, expansion and differentiation are physically separated in higher plants, thus allowing the analysis of in zzso expression patterns with respect to the state of cell zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso shoot, zzso floral zzso and flowers, and in rapidly growing zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein are zzso in the developing zzso and zzso zzso expression is zzso in most differentiated cell zzso zzso was primarily localized to the nucleus and, during zzso to the zzso a site where membrane zzso are targeted in the deposition of new cell wall zzso This study shows that the essential cell division function of zzso has been zzso by, at least, some zzso zzso and suggests that in higher plants, zzso functions in cell division and growth zzso
