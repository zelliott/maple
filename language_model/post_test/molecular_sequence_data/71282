zzso monkey kidney zzso cells are a polarized zzso with some unusual zzso including a resistance to zzso although their zzso has normal affinity with this zzso This work suggests that zzso cells have high expression of functionally zzso in their zzso This was established using four complementary methods to investigate the expression and function of zzso in these zzso zzso cells were strongly resistant to zzso which could be reversed by three known zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso In addition, zzso cells accumulate little zzso zzso and the incubation with zzso increased this zzso The zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction and a zzso zzso product was zzso Its zzso sequence was compared with the related region of human zzso showing a high identity zzso between the two zzso The expression of zzso in the cell membrane was observed by Western zzso and zzso The results taken together suggest that zzso cells zzso have a high expression of functionally zzso in their zzso
