The zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso X zzso caused partial conversion of zzso Y zzso zzso 3, 4) to X zzso zzso 7, 8) when introduced into a candidate vaccine strain of zzso zzso zzso Y zzso The zzso gene caused conversion of zzso but did not eliminate the zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso The hybrid strain expressing both group zzso 7, 8 and 3, 4 showed zzso protection when zzso guinea pigs were challenged with a zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso No protection was observed against zzso Y challenge, although group zzso 3, 4 was detected in the zzso of the hybrid zzso This suggests the importance of zzso immunity in the host defense against zzso
