zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso components of the zzso protein zzso complex, which is critical for the stability of the zzso muscle cell zzso zzso was found as a zzso of zzso but unlike other zzso members, it is zzso expressed in various zzso as well as in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso indicating the importance of zzso for the function in the central nervous zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso its expression and zzso distribution in mouse zzso and especially in the mouse brain were zzso Analysis by reverse zzso chain reaction showed four zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in the mouse brain, two of which are major transcript zzso One is a conventional form including zzso 8 zzso and the other is a novel form excluding zzso 8 but including a previously unknown zzso 11b zzso zzso analysis using various mouse zzso indicated a broad expression pattern for zzso but zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso both zzso zzso coexist in various regions of the zzso Furthermore, these zzso were found in zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso of brain zzso however, indicated that zzso and zzso are relatively enriched in zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso These results suggest that the two zzso zzso might play different roles in synaptic functions of the central nervous zzso
