An animal model was used to assess whether resistance to zzso by human zzso virus zzso can exist in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously infected with zzso were first challenged with zzso virus zzso or zzso and later with zzso virus zzso After both virus zzso either resistance to viral infection or a transient zzso was zzso The original virus was recovered in 3 zzso suggesting that zzso of a zzso infection occurred on zzso challenge and that zzso zzso is blocked by processes established during prior zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso and virus zzso remained at low zzso However, suppression of zzso replication was observed with zzso T cells and filtered cell culture zzso The soluble factor involved was not a zzso This resistance to zzso zzso appears to be zzso at least in part by zzso T cells that suppress virus zzso
