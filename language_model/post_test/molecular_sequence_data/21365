zzso zzso is a zzso zzso fungus of worldwide zzso It grows in the zzso form with zzso regularly zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and as the zzso or zzso form at zzso Previously, we characterized a zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of this zzso were observed to inhibit the zzso cell cycle in zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso interference zzso mechanism in this fungus was confirmed by the identification of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso technology was used to corroborate the role of zzso zzso I in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were transformed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the coding region of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso were selected at zzso using resistance to zzso Following transfer to liquid medium at zzso zzso zzso developed as abnormal zzso zzso and not as zzso cells as would be zzso The level of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso at zzso was less than that of cells transformed with the empty zzso at this same zzso zzso zzso analysis of proteins that interact with zzso identified a zzso of heat shock protein 90 zzso as interacting with this zzso Growth of the fungus similar to that of the zzso zzso was observed in medium with zzso zzso 10 zzso an inhibitor of zzso 

Using the zzso technology we silenced the expression of zzso gene in this zzso zzso zzso were unable to grow as zzso cells at zzso showing decreased tolerance to this zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso observed using the zzso zzso zzso suggests that this zzso is involved in zzso through its interaction with zzso zzso zzso with the C terminal domain of zzso where zzso proteins and zzso zzso These results confirmed zzso as an important zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso necessary for the development of the zzso phase of this zzso Also this study constitutes the first report of the transformation of zzso zzso and the use of zzso to study gene function in this zzso
