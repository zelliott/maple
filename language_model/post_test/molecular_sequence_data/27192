zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to have clinical relevance in various zzso We have recently identified zzso as an asthma zzso gene and there is evidence to suggest that zzso may be zzso in lung diseases such as COPD and zzso zzso is a key zzso involved in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso by interacting with zzso and has been implicated in many zzso processes including proliferation and zzso The current aim was to determine key regulatory regions and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso its expression in primary human zzso and cells (including zzso zzso zzso zzso airway smooth muscle zzso and peripheral zzso 

Using Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso start site zzso to zzso relative to zzso was identified and multiple zzso factor binding sites zzso Seven major zzso zzso were identified zzso total zzso including multiple zzso deletions and an alternative zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso with a high proportion of zzso usage in lung tissue and structural cells zzso of zzso whereas classical zzso 7 zzso the zzso zzso was zzso expressed in peripheral cells zzso zzso of zzso often with zzso 6 or zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed expression of zzso zzso in zzso as well as airway and peripheral cell types with zzso fold greater expression in peripheral cells versus airway cells and confirmed zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed expression of multiple different forms of zzso in the same cells as well as expression of soluble zzso in cell zzso The pattern of expression did not directly reflect that seen at the zzso level, indicating that zzso mechanisms of regulation may also play an important zzso 

We have identified multiple zzso zzso in the lung and immune cells and shown that expression is cell zzso These data provide a novel mechanism for zzso regulation, as different zzso zzso may determine zzso function zzso alternative zzso results in a soluble zzso due to the loss of the zzso anchor and zzso deletions may affect zzso zzso and/or zzso binding and therefore influence downstream zzso zzso of different zzso within the lung should be taken into consideration in studies of zzso in respiratory zzso
