The plasma zzso zzso transfer protein zzso plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport zzso by zzso the transfer of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso We describe a new zzso located at position zzso in the human zzso gene promoter, which zzso to a zzso substitution at a potential zzso restriction zzso The relationship between the zzso zzso plasma zzso parameters and plasma zzso concentration was evaluated in the Etude zzso de zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and revealed that the zzso zzso (A zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with both plasma zzso zzso cholesterol zzso levels and zzso concentration zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso displayed both low zzso levels and high plasma zzso zzso while zzso zzso subjects displayed the inverse zzso zzso of potential interactions between the zzso and the zzso or zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso interacts significantly with the functional zzso site and the zzso zzso with respect to plasma zzso levels zzso and zzso respectively), but does not affect plasma zzso zzso These results clearly suggest that the interaction between the zzso zzso and either the zzso or the zzso zzso on plasma zzso concentration is different than that implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells revealed that the zzso zzso did not zzso zzso activity of the human zzso gene zzso The zzso promoter zzso therefore constitutes a zzso zzso Furthermore, the observed effects of the zzso zzso on both plasma zzso concentration and zzso levels are due to functional zzso in linkage zzso with zzso Our findings strongly suggest the existence of as yet unidentified functional zzso in the zzso gene promoter that could explain the association between specific zzso of the zzso gene and both plasma zzso and zzso zzso
