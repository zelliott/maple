Human zzso zzso protein is recently reported to be required for zzso or efficient zzso of late viral zzso during viral zzso An absolute nuclear distribution of zzso proteins has been observed with zzso zzso both during the infection of zzso zzso zzso virus and in the zzso expressing zzso zzso with or without virus zzso However, little is known about the nuclear import mechanism of zzso zzso Here, by utilizing living cells fluorescent zzso a zzso nuclear zzso of zzso protein in living cells was zzso Furthermore, the nuclear import of zzso protein was demonstrated to be dependent on the zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso signal zzso was delineated between the zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso we provide evidence that a zzso zzso described in viral zzso is responsible for the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso
