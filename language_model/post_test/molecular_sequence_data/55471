We report a new approach for the fast zzso zzso of proteins zzso zzso zzso species are used as the zzso zzso We generate the zzso by zzso of zzso acid at 248 zzso the putative zzso radical then rapidly zzso the target zzso This zzso labeling is sensitive, zzso and zzso zzso only zzso and zzso zzso in contrast to OH zzso that modify 14 zzso side zzso We zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in their native states and analyzed the outcome by both zzso and bottom-up zzso zzso zzso sequencing selects a certain level zzso of one I, two zzso of modification and determines the major components produced in the modification reaction, whereas bottom-up reveals details for each modification zzso zzso is found to be modified for zzso but less so for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are at least 10 times more modified for zzso than for zzso in agreement with zzso zzso For zzso zzso and its zzso form, there are no significant differences of the modification zzso indicating their similarity in zzso and providing a control for this zzso For zzso insulin, zzso and insulin zzso with zzso zzso yields are sensitive to differences in insulin zzso zzso The zzso radical labeling is a promising addition to protein zzso methods, offering higher specificity and lower zzso than zzso and zzso two other zzso already employed in zzso
