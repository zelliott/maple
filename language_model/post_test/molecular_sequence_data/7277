zzso is initiated by the zzso binding of zzso to the zzso coat of the zzso One zzso zzso for the mouse egg is zzso zzso which binds zzso zzso on the egg coat zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso surface zzso bound to and activated a zzso G protein complex that contained the zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso from transgenic mice that zzso zzso had higher rates of G protein zzso than did zzso zzso which rendered transgenic zzso hypersensitive to their zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain of cell surface zzso appears to enable it to function as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
