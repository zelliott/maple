Several recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of various zzso of the beta 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, specific zzso acids have been shown to be important in zzso zzso zzso and others have been implicated by zzso zzso to play an intimate role in zzso zzso zzso to these data are previous observations that a group of zzso zzso beta 1 zzso mapped within the first 160 zzso acid zzso of the zzso These observations suggested that this region plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso In order to further define the domain in which the zzso for these zzso are zzso a series of zzso zzso beta 1 zzso were examined for their zzso with each of these zzso Most of the zzso recognize a region between zzso 124 to 160 of the chicken beta 1 zzso Computer modeling predicted a possible zzso zzso zzso for the region between zzso 141 to zzso zzso with this zzso circular zzso and zzso analysis revealed a tendency for a synthetic zzso containing these zzso to form an zzso The significance of this structural characteristic was demonstrated by a zzso at zzso 149 that disrupted the zzso formation and resulted in a loss of the ability to form zzso with alpha zzso zzso to focal zzso or be transported to the cell zzso The direct involvement of zzso 141 to 160 in zzso binding was supported by the ability of a zzso with this sequence to zzso zzso from a zzso affinity zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso 141 to 160 of the zzso beta 1 zzso when arranged in an zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso
