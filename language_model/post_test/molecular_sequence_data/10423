We have cloned the rat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso familial Alzheimer's zzso zzso analysis predicted that the rat zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and there was a very high degree of zzso acid identity between rat and human zzso zzso All the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso or zzso familial Alzheimer's disease patients were zzso in rat zzso The expression of zzso was weaker than that of zzso The alternatively spliced short form of zzso zzso which was detected in human zzso was not detected in various rat zzso During brain development, the expression level of both zzso and zzso increased but decreased in the zzso No remarkable change was observed in neural differentiation of zzso zzso
