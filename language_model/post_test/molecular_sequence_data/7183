The binding of zzso protein zzso to the zzso element is the first step in the initiation of zzso zzso II zzso from many promoters in zzso It has been proposed that upstream zzso proteins stimulate zzso by recruiting zzso to the promoter, thus zzso the assembly of a zzso zzso However, the role of zzso proteins acting at this step to stimulate zzso in zzso remains largely zzso To test whether recruitment of zzso to the promoter is sufficient for zzso zzso in zzso we constructed a hybrid protein containing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso domain of zzso Our results show that zzso recruited by the zzso zzso domain to promoters bearing a zzso site can interact with the zzso element and direct high levels of zzso This finding indicates that binding of zzso to promoters in zzso zzso is a major zzso step accelerated by upstream zzso zzso
