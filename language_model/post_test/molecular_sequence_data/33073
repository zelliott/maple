The zzso (a zzso and zzso domain with zzso zzso family includes 19 zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a recently cloned gene expressed at high levels in fetal lung and kidney and adult brain and zzso The zzso protein currently has no known zzso zzso is also expressed in human cartilage and zzso where its expression is increased in zzso from zzso patients compared to normal zzso In this study, we zzso that the full length zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and cloned the appropriate zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to a decrease in cell proliferation and migration, though not zzso as well as a decrease in the expression of zzso zzso zzso The zzso start point of the human zzso gene was zzso identified as 138 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso and the zzso promoter was mapped out to zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso promoter zzso of zzso or longer whilst zzso induced all zzso promoter zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso cell zzso
