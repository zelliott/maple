We compared the effect of the rice storage protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the modified house dust zzso zzso zzso f 2 driven by the zzso zzso promoter in transgenic zzso zzso of zzso f 2 in transgenic seed and leaf using the zzso zzso was greater than when using the Nos zzso zzso The zzso f 2 zzso containing the zzso zzso was processed and zzso at the same sites as the native zzso zzso in the seeds but zzso in leaves of the transgenic zzso In contrast, the zzso sites of zzso f 2 containing Nos zzso were more divergent in both seed and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso functions as a faithful zzso and that termination at the specific sites may play an important role in zzso stability and/or zzso resulting in higher levels of protein zzso
