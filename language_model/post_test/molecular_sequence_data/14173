Marine zzso zzso are a diverse suite of zzso microbes found in marine zzso Several zzso lineages are thought to contain zzso zzso However, zzso remain zzso and data on zzso and zzso modes are zzso We investigated zzso in provinces on the west and east sides of the North Pacific zzso zzso specifically the East China Sea zzso and the California Current system zzso For each province, DNA was sampled from three zzso zzso zzso zzso and more zzso zzso zzso Along with zzso zzso and other zzso sequences were recovered from nine zzso lineages in the six zzso and four zzso zzso zzso gene clone zzso All but one of these libraries were from surface zzso zzso clusters 1, 3, 7, 8, and 11 were identified in both provinces, with zzso cluster 3 zzso being found the most zzso Additionally, zzso was detected in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso zzso analysis indicated that some zzso within these lineages differ along zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso size and abundance estimates obtained using zzso in zzso zzso on 79 spring and summer zzso samples showed a negative correlation between size of zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso was rarely zzso but zzso and zzso and zzso were abundant in summer and zzso and zzso were more so at the coast, with maximum zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and experimental work showed that zzso zzso zzso Together with previous studies, this study helps refine hypotheses on distribution and zzso modes of zzso zzso
