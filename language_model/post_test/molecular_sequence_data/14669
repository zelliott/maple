To identify the underlying genetic cause in a two generation German family diagnosed with isolated zzso 

All patients underwent full zzso zzso zzso screening of the paired box gene 6 zzso was performed by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was applied to analyze transcript processing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We identified a zzso sequence zzso at the zzso donor site zzso of zzso zzso This zzso has been described before in another family with zzso but has not been characterized at the transcript zzso We could demonstrate that the zzso zzso causes the skipping of zzso 12 during transcript zzso The zzso is predicted to result in a zzso zzso translation past the normal zzso stop zzso 

A zzso site zzso resulting in zzso skipping was found in a family with zzso dominant zzso The zzso is predicted to result in an enlarged protein with an extra zzso zzso This very likely affects the zzso properties of the zzso zzso
