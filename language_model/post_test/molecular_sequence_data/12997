The zzso zzso a wheat zzso zzso zzso transfer protein of 9 zzso was inserted into an zzso coli expression zzso zzso and expressed in the bacteria as a fusion with the zzso binding zzso The fusion protein was then zzso to zzso and subjected to factor zzso zzso Although complete zzso of the fusion protein was zzso the expected zzso transfer protein was not zzso it appears to be zzso during zzso zzso However, a fluorescent zzso transfer zzso demonstrated that the fusion protein has an activity identical to that of the zzso zzso transfer zzso Thus, this expression system should allow further understanding of the zzso relationships of wheat zzso transfer zzso
