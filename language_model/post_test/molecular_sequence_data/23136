zzso A is a new zzso zzso recently isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso biological activity zzso demonstrated that this novel compound has zzso strong zzso zzso This study is aimed to determine the effects of zzso A on breast cancer cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated cell zzso zzso showed that cell growth zzso and zzso phase arrest of cell cycle were caused by zzso zzso The zzso resulting in total and 50% growth zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A for 12 zzso the zzso phase cell percent increased from zzso zzso treatment to zzso zzso with zzso arrest and cell growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso zzso expression in the cell was zzso with drug zzso Then, few zzso cells were zzso and most other cells underwent zzso which is characterized by specific changes in cell zzso lots of zzso zzso zzso and increasing expression of zzso zzso zzso The result first demonstrates that zzso A zzso zzso the proliferation of breast cancer cell zzso via the zzso phase cell cycle arrest and differentiation zzso and as such, may be considered as candidate zzso and/or zzso agent for breast zzso
