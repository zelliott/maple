When treated with zzso bacterial cells, zzso cells in culture respond by zzso several zzso Among these is a zzso protein zzso that is zzso from cells derived from both Aedes aegypti and Aedes zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and gave a virtually identical pattern of zzso products for each zzso zzso The sequence of one zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined and found to have similarity to insect zzso By using zzso regions of insect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and used to isolate a zzso clone zzso an zzso aegypti zzso The zzso protein contained a signal sequence that, when zzso would yield a mature protein of 68 zzso It contained the zzso acid zzso and the 3' end exactly matched a zzso zzso a zzso that is zzso when zzso aegypti encapsulates zzso worms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Christensen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 79, zzso This zzso like those of two other insect species, has zzso zzso zzso in the zzso lobe but not in the zzso zzso which also has large deletions in the zzso chain, compared with zzso with functional zzso zzso The hypothesis is developed that this zzso plays a role similar to zzso zzso in zzso iron from invading organisms and that degradation of the structure of the zzso lobe might be a mechanism for evading pathogens that elaborate zzso receptors to tap zzso zzso
