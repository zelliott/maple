The starch zzso of zzso wheat zzso zzso contain a group of three proteins known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which have apparent molecular masses of 100, zzso and 115 zzso The nature and role of these proteins has not been defined zzso We demonstrate that these zzso are starch zzso that are present in both the starch zzso and the soluble fraction at the early stages of wheat zzso development, but that are exclusively zzso bound at mid and late zzso zzso A partial zzso clone zzso a zzso of the zzso protein was obtained by screening a wheat zzso zzso expression library using zzso zzso Three classes of zzso were subsequently isolated from a wheat zzso zzso library by zzso acid zzso and were shown to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequences are highly zzso to class II starch zzso and have the highest zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso proteins was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of wheat and is highly expressed in the leaf and in the grain during the early to mid stages of zzso We discuss the roles of the zzso proteins in starch zzso in zzso
