zzso and zzso are closely related zzso zzso that belong to the transforming growth factor beta zzso Although zzso has been extensively studied in zzso the information about its existence and function in lower zzso is very zzso Using zzso as a model, the present study demonstrated that the zzso alpha zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the zzso and no transcript could be detected in other zzso including the zzso and zzso In the zzso the expression of zzso was restricted to the zzso zzso cells surrounding the zzso together with the beta zzso zzso and zzso This was further supported by the absence of its expression in the zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso expression in the zzso slightly but steadily increased from primary growth to the zzso zzso however, its expression surged dramatically at the zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression level of zzso decreased significantly in the zzso whose zzso were undergoing spontaneous maturation or zzso zzso zzso When tested on cultured zzso fragments, both goldfish zzso extract and zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso Further experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso significantly increased zzso expression in the same zzso zzso When tested in zzso human zzso A exhibited a slight but significant zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso maturation after 4 h zzso The stimulation of zzso expression by zzso and the potential zzso of zzso by zzso suggest a possible existence of a negative feedback loop between the zzso and zzso in the zzso
