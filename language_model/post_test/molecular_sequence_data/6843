Patients with clinical features of zzso syndrome may have a zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso zzso It is estimated that zzso females or zzso with a Y zzso and zzso zzso have a zzso risk of developing zzso so it is crucial to know whether zzso syndrome patients have a Y zzso We studied the zzso zzso of four patients with zzso syndrome using the zzso chain reaction zzso Nine zzso zzso including four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the short arm, one zzso zzso on the zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the long arm were amplified to determine the origin of marker zzso Three patients were identified as having Y zzso zzso Patient 1 contained the presumed zzso locus zzso and a zzso zzso was carried zzso DNA extracted from zzso zzso did not show Y zzso zzso A zzso highly sensitive and zzso method for detection of abnormal Y zzso in zzso syndrome patients has been zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis is required to confirm the zzso results, to provide further evidence for molecular organization of these marker zzso
