zzso is a widely distributed zzso protein that acts a marker of self through interactions of zzso and neural zzso We describe the high-resolution X-ray zzso structures of the zzso zzso domain of zzso alone and in complex with the zzso zzso domain of signal regulatory protein alpha zzso The unusual and convoluted interacting face of zzso zzso the N zzso and zzso at the end of the domain, zzso with the corresponding regions in zzso We have also determined structures of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins that are closely related to zzso but bind zzso with negligible or reduced zzso These results explain the specificity of zzso for the zzso family of paired receptors in atomic zzso Analysis of zzso zzso suggests that these, as well as the zzso zzso may have evolved to counteract pathogen binding to the zzso zzso zzso
