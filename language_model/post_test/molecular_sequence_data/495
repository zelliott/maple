zzso whose zzso are responsible for zzso syndrome and zzso disease, and zzso are two similar proteins zzso a central zzso zzso domain followed by an zzso and a zzso zzso Their divergent zzso portions remain zzso We show that the zzso region of zzso but not of zzso binds zzso heavy zzso zzso which in contrast to zzso visits late stage zzso zzso pits, was earlier shown to contain another binding site for zzso in its zzso zzso zzso structure determination further reveals that despite their primary sequence zzso the zzso portions of both zzso and zzso contain a zzso zzso The novel zzso site in zzso maps to an unusual zzso motif located in a loop of the zzso domain, whose zzso reduce recruitment efficiency of zzso to coated zzso These findings suggest an evolutionary pressure for a specialized function of zzso in bridging zzso metabolism to zzso membrane zzso
