Classic zzso anatomy is based on the characteristic array of zzso and zzso However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that more fundamental architecture is built around zzso of zzso zzso which zzso both the zzso and zzso of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso Recent reports have indicated that zzso zzso and zzso play a role in cell survival, growth, and differentiation in several cell types, including zzso In this study, we examined the zzso of zzso in the mouse zzso by using zzso zzso zzso appeared in the zzso molecular layer and the PC zzso The zzso pattern is zzso In the molecular layer, the zzso pattern probably reflects zzso spines and zzso By electron zzso zzso reaction product was deposited within zzso especially along the plasma zzso near zzso Seen at higher zzso the zzso was in and near the zzso zzso By double zzso the striped pattern of zzso expression was shown to be identical to that revealed by zzso II, although the zzso distribution within PC's is zzso This is the first demonstration of the zzso zzso of an zzso related to zzso zzso and as such, it provides an insight into the roles of zzso and formation of zzso The selective expression of zzso in the zzso zzso PCs may explain their resistance to cell death when zzso metabolism is zzso as in the acid zzso knockout model of zzso type zzso zzso
