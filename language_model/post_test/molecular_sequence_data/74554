The European zzso lobster zzso zzso is a suitable model zzso to study the effects of past history and current zzso processes on the genetic diversity and population structure of marine species with a zzso zzso zzso A portion of the zzso gene was zzso in 227 individuals from 11 zzso covering most of the present distribution of the zzso zzso was found between Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, which could be explained by restricted gene flow between zzso Moreover, a principal component analysis detected differences within zzso The existence of genetic differentiation between Brittany and zzso populations could be accounted for by the large effect of the Gulf zzso while zzso processes suffered by the incoming Atlantic waters could be responsible of genetic differentiation within the zzso Furthermore, historical processes could be responsible for a reduction on the overall genetic zzso of zzso zzso The zzso distribution found in zzso zzso with the presence of one abundant zzso and a large number of closely related zzso is typical of species experiencing reduction in zzso and subsequent zzso zzso fluctuations related to glacial cycles could explain the present level of zzso and zzso diversity zzso Interestingly, these glacial events do not seem to have the same impact in other species of the same zzso Our results indicate that recent glacial events could have had a lower impact on zzso zzso a zzso species that presents an overlapping distribution area but is found in cooler waters than zzso zzso
