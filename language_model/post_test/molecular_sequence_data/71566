We isolated a novel gene for zzso zzso first identified as an zzso target of the zzso zzso A and also known to have zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, named zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with 201 zzso acids with a putative zzso signal sequence at its zzso but without the typical zzso signal in its zzso In addition, zzso protein contained a seven zzso long sequence which has been found previously only in zzso zzso from zzso The synthetic zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso was fused to the zzso part of zzso and expressed in tobacco zzso zzso The zzso derived from the fusion protein was detected mainly around the nucleus, indicating zzso into zzso zzso was expressed mainly in young stems especially in the zzso region and zzso in leaves and zzso
