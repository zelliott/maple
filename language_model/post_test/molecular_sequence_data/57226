A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were linked to zzso acid zzso the resulting zzso modified zzso were used for the resolution of zzso by gas zzso zzso recognition proved most effective for zzso zzso 1 zzso as zzso as judged from the resolution factors zzso and the zzso parameters delta delta zzso delta delta S and zzso zzso delta delta zzso zzso where delta zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso zzso in carbon zzso solution revealed a maximum chemical shift zzso of the zzso zzso signal of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso on addition of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso From circular zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, 4 and 6) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is concluded that the zzso zzso of the stationary phase mostly adopts the zzso random zzso zzso whereas the zzso structure was only partially found and only for zzso zzso or zzso zzso
