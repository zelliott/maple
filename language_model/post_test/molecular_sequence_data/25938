We have studied the zzso properties of two major zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using specific zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that these two zzso were present in very low levels in control zzso zzso and were greatly induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso different from zzso zzso rat zzso and zzso and rabbit zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso was not present in the control or the zzso rat liver zzso whereas it was present in two human liver zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was zzso related to rat zzso and rabbit zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso was present in the human and zzso rat liver zzso We also isolated full-length zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso liver zzso zzso The full-length zzso clones of zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained 1771 and 1868 base pairs, which zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso bases in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso level by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso level by zzso in the zzso zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequences with other zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was most similar to the mouse zzso alpha with zzso sequence identity, whereas zzso zzso shared zzso identity with the rat zzso or mouse zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso was a unique member zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was the zzso zzso
