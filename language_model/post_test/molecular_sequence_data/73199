zzso zzso in the last zzso of the zzso gene in zzso rat zzso zzso results in the enhanced expression of a zzso truncated zzso zzso Here we show that the truncated protein exhibits an approximately zzso higher zzso activity and is two- to zzso more efficient in zzso the zzso and zzso pathways relative to the zzso zzso The truncated zzso protein and a zzso fusion of the zzso zzso tail interact when zzso in zzso zzso Their interaction zzso the zzso activity of the truncated protein suggesting that zzso zzso interactions regulate the zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice expressing the zzso protein from the zzso zzso promoter fail to show a biological zzso whereas mice expressing the truncated protein develop zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results show that zzso is an zzso zzso that is activated by zzso zzso
