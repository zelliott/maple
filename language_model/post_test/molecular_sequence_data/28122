A rabbit zzso was raised against envelope material from zzso human zzso strain zzso The serum recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso 75, 58, and 45 zzso in zzso It was used to screen a zzso library constructed from zzso zzso from human zzso cells in the expression zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso expressing zzso sequences was identified, and the corresponding gene was mapped to the zzso R zzso The gene is transcribed into a late zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the coding region was zzso Computer analysis of the gene product revealed a zzso containing multiple potential zzso zzso representing a type of protein not identified in the envelope of zzso zzso The protein shows zzso on the zzso acid level to hypothetical proteins from reading frames zzso of zzso virus, zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1, and zzso of zzso zzso By using an zzso raised against zzso parts of the zzso membrane zzso a zzso structural component of the virus was identified as the gene zzso
