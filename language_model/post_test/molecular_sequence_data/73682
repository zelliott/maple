The zzso genetic diversity of zzso zzso the key zzso in the zzso zzso of wine, has been evaluated by random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso content, and sequencing of zzso markers with widespread distribution among the zzso Collection strains representing the diversity of this species have been studied together with some new zzso many of which were obtained from wines produced by spontaneous zzso zzso The zzso profiles were strain specific and discerned two main groups of strains zzso with clusters obtained by zzso typing in a previous zzso zzso and the conservation of zzso markers indicates that zzso zzso is a relatively homogeneous zzso Furthermore, identical DNA sequences of some zzso markers among strains representative of the most divergent zzso clusters indicates that zzso zzso is indeed a zzso tight group, probably corresponding to a single zzso or zzso line of zzso specialized to grow in the wine environment and universally zzso
