zzso domain proteins in zzso contain a highly zzso domain which is related to the zzso coli zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of a zzso domain protein from zzso zzso Using the combination of zzso techniques with zzso zzso zzso and zzso the full length zzso of a zzso domain protein in the zzso zzso was successfully cloned without constructing and screening a zzso Determined from the deduced zzso acid zzso this protein is most similar to zzso zzso and this newly cloned zzso gene was therefore designated as zzso
