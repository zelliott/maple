zzso zzso coli zzso infections are a leading cause of infantile zzso in developing zzso zzso sequence typing zzso characterizes bacterial strains based on the sequences of internal fragments in zzso zzso Little is known about strains of zzso analyzed by zzso from zzso In this study, a diverse collection of 29 zzso strains isolated from patients with zzso admitted to the University Hospital of zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso analysis demonstrated 22 different sequence types zzso of which almost half zzso were new, indicating a high zzso zzso The 22 zzso were divided by zzso into 12 zzso zzso It was not possible to correlate typical and zzso zzso with other strains in the zzso zzso This is the first study that analyzed zzso strains from South America that are included in the zzso coli zzso zzso Nine zzso out of 29 strains are part of the zzso zzso complex, the major zzso complex in the database, which comprises 174 strains and 86 different zzso suggesting that these strains might be the most important zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso relationships between typical and zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso coli strains were not established by zzso
