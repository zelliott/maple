A new high-yield zzso zzso system has been adapted for the plant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso fruit, is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso The gene was cloned into a zzso zzso expression zzso downstream of the zzso alpha mating factor zzso zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso is controlled by the zzso alcohol zzso zzso II promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a so-called zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso into the culture zzso where it accumulates to approximately zzso zzso The zzso contains three consensus zzso zzso sites, whereas there are only two such sites in previously reported zzso zzso zzso of this third zzso zzso site results in a drastic reduction in the level of zzso activity present in the culture zzso Two different types of affinity zzso were used to purify either zzso or zzso The zzso precursor is zzso activated to mature zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso using conditions reported zzso The kinetic parameters obtained agree well with the literature zzso The yields of active zzso are zzso higher than those previously reported for zzso in other zzso or bacterial expression zzso This, together with the ease with which zzso proteins can be made, makes this zzso advantageous for a zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and possibly for other related zzso zzso as zzso
