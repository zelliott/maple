In the framework of the European zzso project for sequencing the zzso zzso zzso we have determined the zzso sequence of the left part of the zzso clone 232 and the zzso clone 233 provided by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We present here zzso base pairs of sequence derived from the left arm of zzso X of strain zzso This sequence reveals 17 open reading frames zzso with more than 299 base pairs, including the published sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two other zzso showed similarity with zzso zzso zzso one with the zzso gene coding for an zzso zzso and one with genes zzso the family of zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso cluster domain like that found in zzso or zzso Both putative proteins contain a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso has 12 putative zzso zzso and a putative alpha zzso 2 binding zzso In a zzso disruption zzso of zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso no colonies appeared before 10 days after transformation and then grew zzso In contrast, zzso disruption zzso showed a growth zzso like zzso zzso One zzso showed weak similarity to the zzso gene product of zzso zzso and is essential for zzso zzso Five zzso showed similarity to putative genes on the right arm of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two of them have similarity to each other and belong to a family of zzso proteins that groups zzso zzso insects zzso plants zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
