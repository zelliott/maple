The periodic expression of cell cycle proteins is important for the regulation of cell cycle zzso The amount of zzso zzso zzso one such zzso seems to be regulated by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso toward zzso is thought to be zzso The activity of zzso was increased by the addition of zzso protein to the zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso seemed to be dependent on the zzso of zzso of zzso because the zzso zzso was not zzso at all in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso is modified by zzso protein zzso The modification site of zzso was shown to be zzso because the zzso zzso was not zzso When the effect of the zzso modification on the zzso activity toward zzso was investigated, the activity was markedly decreased by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the modification may play an important role on the zzso activity toward zzso
