zzso from an zzso male with zzso zzso zzso was used to identify a novel human zzso zzso by screening of a zzso expression zzso The zzso initially designated zzso zzso symbol zzso was found to zzso a sequence highly enriched in zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the full-length zzso revealed striking zzso to the product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein localized to the central pair of the zzso zzso The human gene encodes zzso and zzso zzso highly expressed in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso heart, brain, zzso liver, muscle, zzso and zzso The gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso sequences localized the protein to the tails of zzso human zzso Both the zzso protein and zzso contain eight zzso zzso repeats, which place them in a family of proteins known to mediate zzso zzso The cloning of the human zzso of the zzso zzso locus provides a new avenue to explore the role of the zzso central pair in human zzso zzso
