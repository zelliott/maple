Using the suppression zzso zzso technique, we isolated a novel zzso zzso whose message is drastically induced by zzso zzso in the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso The predicted protein contains the zzso domain in its zzso which shares zzso identity to that of zzso or zzso The zzso portion contains a zzso zzso and a potential zzso domain, as in the case of zzso and zzso zzso is expressed mainly in immune cells, and is induced in response to zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and significantly zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which may play a special role in the immune zzso
