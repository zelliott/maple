zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso strain, zzso zzso 47, by cloning the gene into an expression zzso zzso which has been developed to express a foreign gene utilizing a promoter and a signal sequence of an outer cell wall protein zzso From 1 liter of culture, about 10 zzso of protein was zzso to zzso by two steps of column zzso this is almost 500 times higher production compared to the conventional preparation from the original strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was identical to that of the authentic zzso indicating that the signal sequence for zzso of zzso zzso was processed properly in zzso zzso zzso
