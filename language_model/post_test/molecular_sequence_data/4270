zzso interactions are principally zzso by specific membrane receptors of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is one of zzso Its expression in the zzso has not yet been investigated although it appears to be a key element in muscle cell zzso In this study, the expression of its three known zzso has been analyzed in developing and adult small zzso and in zzso cell zzso 

The expression of the zzso zzso was analyzed by indirect zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso 

The zzso zzso but not the zzso and C zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso In zzso the presence of the zzso zzso was closely paralleled with zzso acquisition of differentiation characteristics during development and along the zzso axis in the adult small zzso and zzso loss of zzso functions in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the expression of zzso was also shown to correlate with the acquisition of zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso was found zzso zzso at the onset of zzso zzso 

Taken together, these results suggest that zzso expression is correlated with human zzso cell zzso
