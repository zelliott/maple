zzso factors of the zzso family bind to their target genes via the paired domain which is known to be composed of two zzso each recognizing distinct zzso in adjacent major grooves of the DNA zzso We now demonstrate that the zzso zzso gene gives rise, by alternative zzso zzso to a protein zzso containing an extra zzso zzso in the recognition zzso 3 of the paired zzso This zzso protein does not interact with zzso paired zzso sites, indicating that zzso of the zzso zzso motif severely restricts the sequence specificity of the paired zzso However, the zzso protein binds in zzso and in zzso to the zzso sequence which was previously identified as a zzso binding site for the zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso in the paired zzso The zzso sequence is shown to consist of four zzso zzso zzso of the zzso consensus sequence and is thus bound by four zzso molecules via the intact zzso zzso motif of the paired zzso Together these data suggest that zzso of the zzso region of the paired domain by alternative zzso is used in zzso to selectively target zzso zzso factors to gene regulatory regions containing highly specialized zzso zzso
