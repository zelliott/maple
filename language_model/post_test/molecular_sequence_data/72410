Seven peptides from zzso 9 zzso of the human zzso zzso were zzso and this information was used to clone a zzso zzso that encodes the 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made against a zzso fusion protein containing 12 zzso acids from zzso and against a full-length zzso expressed in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso and its regulatory complex separated on zzso zzso In zzso samples of the two complexes, the zzso zzso bound a single 46 zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso has been isolated, zzso and zzso
