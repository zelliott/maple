zzso zzso from zzso zzso was shown to be an efficient catalyst for the resolution of zzso acid zzso an important class of chemical zzso in the pharmaceutical zzso zzso of this zzso was improved by zzso zzso targeted to the zzso binding zzso To guide zzso experiments, the three-dimensional model of this zzso was built by zzso zzso techniques by using the structures of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso On the basis of this structural model, five zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that form the zzso zzso binding site of the zzso were selected for zzso zzso zzso 232 was identified as crucial for the discrimination between zzso zzso zzso displayed an zzso enhanced by one order of zzso whereas zzso zzso exhibited a selectivity zzso To further explore the diversity, position 232 was systematically replaced by the 19 possible zzso zzso zzso of this library led to the identification of the zzso zzso which has a tremendously increased E value compared to the parental zzso for the resolution of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In addition to the gain in zzso a remarkable increase in zzso was observed zzso zzso for both zzso
