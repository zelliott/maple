The zzso zzso zzso has been well studied throughout the Caribbean region from a zzso zzso However, data concerning the population zzso and long-term demography of this bird species are zzso In this study, we focused on three populations within the Lesser zzso and one on Puerto Rico and assessed genetic and demographic zzso using five nuclear and two zzso zzso We found that genetic diversity of zzso on Puerto Rico exceeds that on the smaller islands zzso zzso and zzso this might reflect either successive founder events from Puerto Rico to zzso or more rapid drift in smaller populations subsequent to zzso zzso growth rate estimates showed no evidence of rapid expansion and migration was indicated only between populations from the closest islands of zzso and zzso Overall, our results suggest that a zzso zzso model, considering only zzso and zzso but without migration, can be applied to these zzso populations in the West zzso
