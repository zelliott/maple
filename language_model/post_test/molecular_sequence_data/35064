zzso are indispensable players in the regulation of a broad range of biological zzso Here, we report the first deep sequencing of the zzso bamboo shark zzso zzso zzso We mapped 91 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that have previously been described in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Homo zzso and zzso zzso In addition, 156 new putative candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso From these 247 zzso 39 zzso clusters were identified, and the expression of these clustered zzso was observed to vary zzso A total of 7 candidate zzso were selected for expression confirmation by zzso zzso This study resulted in the addition of a significant number of novel zzso sequences to zzso and laid the foundation for further understanding of the function of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso liver zzso
