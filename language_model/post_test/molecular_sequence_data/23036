This study describes the three-dimensional crystal structure of a zzso zzso transport protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso from species other than zzso such as nuts, zzso zzso oranges and vegetables are also responsible for plant food zzso this is less frequent compared with zzso from zzso in the Mediterranean zzso In this zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso a zzso is present inside the central cavity of the zzso presumably a fatty acid that was present or produced in the culture medium of the expression zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the two molecules of zzso present in the zzso unit bind this zzso in a different way, suggesting a significant degree of plasticity for the zzso zzso binding zzso despite the presence of four zzso zzso Two molecules are present in the zzso unit: zzso A is a fully zzso zzso while zzso B apparently represents a partially zzso zzso Also, molecular dynamics zzso along with other evidence, suggests that these two molecular zzso represent different states in zzso zzso of the zzso models of different zzso justifies the evidence of a high degree of conservation of the putative zzso binding zzso among proteins of the zzso family and the presence of significant zzso acid replacements in correspondence of the same regions in zzso of zzso species unrelated to zzso
