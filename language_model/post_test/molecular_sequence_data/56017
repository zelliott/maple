A new type of full-length zzso clone zzso human zzso zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso designated as zzso has a zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the translated region and the zzso region of the insert of zzso are exactly identical with those of the zzso clone characterized zzso However, the sequence of the zzso region of the insert has characteristic feature, zzso an extra sequence of 109 zzso is present at a junction between zzso 1 and zzso 2 on the processed human zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso clones containing the region between zzso 1 and zzso 2 of the human zzso zzso gene reveals that the zzso zzso segment, zzso the same sequence as the extra sequence observed in zzso is located approximately zzso downstream of zzso 1 and that the zzso sequences of the zzso and the zzso regions of the segment conform to the zzso rule for zzso zzso By means of reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction, relative amounts of the zzso zzso are estimated to be approximately zzso and zzso of the processed zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and human zzso zzso cells, zzso These results indicate that the segment of 109 zzso between zzso 1 and zzso 2 is a new zzso zzso unidentified and that zzso observed in the zzso sequence of human zzso zzso zzso is, at least in part, caused by alternative zzso of this new zzso
