zzso translation in crude extracts from the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the cap structure and the zzso tail through the binding of the zzso protein zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso These proteins also bind to the translation initiation factor zzso and thereby link the zzso to the general zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso is translated poorly in zzso zzso in part because of the absence of zzso and zzso binding sites on the zzso Here, we report that zzso translation is also zzso in zzso extracts due to the binding of zzso to zzso Specifically, we find that zzso which weaken the zzso binding site on the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso lead to zzso growth in zzso and the stimulation of zzso translation in zzso A zzso in zzso which zzso its ability to interact with zzso also leads to a stimulation of zzso translation in zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in zzso or the addition of excess zzso in zzso reverses these effects of the zzso These data support the hypothesis that the zzso protein can efficiently stimulate translation of zzso zzso zzso in extracts but is prevented from doing so as a result of its association with zzso They also suggest that some zzso may be zzso regulated in zzso in response to the amount of free zzso in the zzso
