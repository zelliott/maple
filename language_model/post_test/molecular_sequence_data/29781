We identified a zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso that dramatically decreases spontaneous muscle zzso and, zzso named the zzso zzso zzso This gene consisted of 4 zzso and was zzso localized to zzso zzso of a predicted 122 zzso acid precursor would release zzso that differs from zzso zzso zzso zzso by one zzso acid, zzso zzso does not act as an zzso In zzso tissue zzso further suggests zzso is a novel zzso zzso and specifically, the measured activity indicates that it is a potent zzso Despite its profound zzso effect, zzso injected with zzso zzso
