The zzso zzso genes play key roles in plant development of zzso To investigate the functions of zzso in zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso genes was isolated from wheat shoot zzso and designated as zzso The transcripts of zzso were primarily localized in the zzso zzso particularly, in shoot zzso zzso and leaf zzso of wheat zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso affected plant zzso and retarded plant zzso Further examination showed that the promotion of cell division and the zzso of cell differentiation occurred in both transgenic plants and zzso In zzso experiments indicated that zzso had functional roles in responding to zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the transcript levels of several cell zzso zzso particularly zzso were increased in the zzso plants with the expressing zzso The results in this study provide new information on zzso zzso in zzso
