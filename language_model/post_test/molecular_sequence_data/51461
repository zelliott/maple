zzso A zzso and B (25) have been prepared through zzso zzso of the zzso (8 and zzso derived from zzso A and B with zzso zzso in zzso The mechanism of zzso formation of the zzso (9 and zzso over the zzso derivatives was zzso In the synthesis of 25, the unusual zzso (23) was the main product along with the zzso zzso The mechanism of this reaction is also zzso Both 17 and 25 were active against resistant bacteria producing zzso zzso for zzso
