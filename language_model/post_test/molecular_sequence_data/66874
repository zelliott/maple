The zzso role of the zzso cycle in the wheat pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated by reverse zzso and zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned by zzso zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso strains lacked all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso strains were unaffected for zzso production but, surprisingly, were still able to zzso zzso as a sole carbon source, suggesting a zzso unknown mechanism for zzso zzso The zzso strains were not compromised in their ability to cause disease or zzso To further our understanding of zzso zzso a previously developed zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption construct zzso Tan and Oliver (2005) zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso was introduced into the zzso zzso background, resulting in a strain lacking both zzso zzso The zzso strains were unable to grow on zzso and produced only trace levels of zzso The zzso strains were unable to zzso in zzso when grown on minimal medium for extended zzso zzso in zzso was correlated with the depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be restored with the addition of zzso zzso of the double zzso was not compromised, although, like the previously characterized zzso zzso the strains were unable to zzso in zzso These findings not only question the currently hypothesized pathways of zzso zzso but also identify for the first time that zzso is required for zzso of a zzso zzso
