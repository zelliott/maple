Six zzso zzso designed to act as zzso templates in the zzso zzso assembled synthetic zzso approach in protein de zzso design, were investigated employing a zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso zzso The peptides are composed of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso connected at its zzso and zzso end by a zzso motif and a zzso bridge zzso two zzso units zzso zzso derivatives zzso and zzso derivatives of different zzso zzso The molecular dynamics zzso search established that template I had zzso like zzso zzso zzso showed different preferential zzso among them, zzso distinct preferences for type V turns in zzso containing peptides and close spatial arrangement of zzso zzso zzso The orientation of the zzso side chains within preferential zzso of the individual templates is analyzed and a tentative evaluation for their potential to stabilize zzso molecules of zzso bundle zzso is zzso
