The core zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso was expressed in primary zzso zzso using a zzso zzso These cells were used as zzso zzso cells zzso for the in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso from zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso from 4 cats chronically infected with the zzso strain of zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso targets in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso of more than zzso of the induced zzso cells zzso for cells from one zzso was consistent with zzso class zzso zzso In addition, it was possible to detect low levels of core zzso zzso from zzso cells of two of the zzso zzso When observed, the level of zzso measured as a percentage of specific zzso release, was lower for the transgenic zzso targets than for zzso zzso The difference in killing may reflect the low level of core zzso were not detected in either zzso zzso with cells zzso by a zzso zzso without the zzso gag sequence or zzso from an zzso cat zzso with zzso transgenic zzso The detection of zzso zzso from infected cats following stimulation with transgenic zzso suggests a role for zzso zzso in determining zzso specific for individual zzso proteins in protective zzso
