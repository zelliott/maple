A slightly zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso water of a solar zzso located in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed an affiliation with the zzso zzso zzso similarities between zzso and type strains of members of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso with one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso grew on solid media as circular red zzso It was able to grow in zzso % sea zzso however, no growth occurred in media containing zzso as the only zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso degrees C and pH zzso The major fatty acids were 18 : zzso zzso zzso and 18 : 0 zzso zzso Three fatty zzso zzso 14 : zzso 16 : 1 zzso zzso 18 : zzso zzso zzso and zzso 19 : 0 zzso zzso found in minor quantities in zzso are unique among zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was 63 zzso According to zzso data, fatty acid composition and zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso was assigned to the zzso zzso but could be distinguished from recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
