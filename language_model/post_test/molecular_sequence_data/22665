Sex differences in transport of the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been recognized for some zzso In the rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which correlate with similar changes in zzso and protein expression for the zzso zzso membrane zzso organic zzso zzso zzso 1 and organic zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these sex differences are not readily demonstrated in other zzso The present study characterizes the zzso of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso suspensions isolated from female and male rabbits to compare functional expression of transport with zzso and protein expression for zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso expression exhibited zzso differences, no sex differences in zzso levels were zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in zzso suspensions also was similar between adult female and male zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso levels did not show zzso differences, but zzso zzso expression was greater in adult male than female zzso However, the sex difference in zzso zzso level did not translate to zzso protein zzso zzso functional expression of zzso zzso and zzso transport as measured by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was similar between adult male and female zzso and correlated with zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Thus, unlike zzso rabbit zzso zzso and OC transport does not exhibit sex differences, pointing to the need for caution in zzso zzso sex differences between zzso
