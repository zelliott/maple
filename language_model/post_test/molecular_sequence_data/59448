The structural properties of three zzso light zzso zzso zzso responsible for light chain deposition disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso k zzso responsible for light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and circular zzso Comparative evaluation of the data shows that zzso and zzso have similar stability under different conditions, while the zzso k zzso behaves as a very unstable zzso As calculated from the zzso curves, the zzso of unfolding transition was zzso M for zzso zzso M for zzso and zzso M for zzso Analysis of CD zzso zzso that the three proteins conserve their zzso in the range of pH zzso Change in temperature at pH zzso produces the premature transition of zzso zzso 40 degrees zzso with respect to zzso and zzso zzso 50 degrees zzso At this pH both the pathological zzso and zzso light chains zzso at a temperature of 20 degrees C lower than the normal zzso The specific kidney deposition of zzso zzso has been evidenced after injection of the zzso zzso light chain into zzso No deposition was zzso in the case of zzso and zzso
