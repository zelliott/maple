zzso is an intermediate zzso protein that is involved in zzso of zzso filaments in fully zzso cells of the zzso zzso and is an important marker for zzso zzso In this report, the sequence of a rat zzso clone coding for a portion of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long with zzso zzso of coding region ending with an zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso gene consists of 20 zzso 2 repeats of zzso zzso of sequence coding for zzso zzso zzso making the zzso at least zzso zzso in zzso Each repeat consists of a zzso domain and a zzso sequence with an estimated size of 380 and 26 zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso are found only in zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso sequence with that of mouse and human zzso and with the sequence of zzso peptides from mouse zzso indicates that the proteins share extensive zzso acid sequence similarities, especially in the two zzso zzso zzso processing sites are also quite similar in rat and zzso The three species show blocks of sequence that are similar in length and composition which alternate with sequences that are variable in zzso This analysis suggests that the evolution of the zzso zzso has been constrained by maintenance of zzso sites and overall zzso acid zzso The zzso for the zzso are similar in structure, reflecting genes that have simple repeating structures and lack zzso within their coding zzso Mouse and rat zzso terminate with a zzso sequence zzso of the rest of the coding region, and have similar 3' zzso zzso To explain these zzso a novel evolutionary model is zzso
