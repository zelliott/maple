zzso can be found in the natural environment as zzso products of natural and synthetic zzso zzso They can also be generated by zzso of water and have been shown to be zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso zzso We have recently identified a novel zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative analyses suggested that zzso is a member of the Major zzso zzso zzso which includes thousands of membrane zzso zzso Members of the MFS usually possess twelve putative zzso segments zzso zzso was predicted to have twelve zzso In this study we characterized the zzso of zzso with a zzso dual reporters zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso activities were determined in these zzso zzso zzso were calculated to determine the locations of the zzso The results mainly agree with the predicted zzso However, two of the zzso were not zzso This lack of confirmation of the zzso using a reporter, has been reported zzso Further comparative analysis of zzso has assigned it to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family with twelve zzso zzso exhibits many common features of the zzso family zzso zzso is apparently a member of the MFS but with some zzso zzso 

The zzso reporter system is convenient for analysis of the zzso of membrane zzso However, due to the limitation of the biological system, zzso of some of the zzso of the protein was not zzso The present study also makes use of zzso analysis to verify that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a MFS protein but with zzso zzso
