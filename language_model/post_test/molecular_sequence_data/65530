zzso zzso becomes resistant to zzso by acquiring a zzso island, known as zzso zzso cassette zzso zzso which contains the zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso is zzso integrated into the zzso zzso at a locus known as the zzso attachment site zzso In an effort to gain a better understanding of the potential that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have for acquiring zzso the zzso sequences of zzso and surrounding DNA regions were examined in a diverse collection of 42 zzso zzso The zzso region surrounding zzso varied among the zzso studied and appears to be a common zzso point for acquired foreign zzso zzso of up to zzso zzso were found containing open reading frames with zzso to zzso zzso zzso systems, zzso and several sequences that have not been previously described in zzso Two groups, containing eight and four zzso had sequences found in known zzso zzso suggesting zzso elements may have evolved through repeated DNA insertions at this zzso In addition, the zzso sequences of the majority of zzso zzso in this collection differ from the zzso sequences of strains for which zzso zzso zzso or zzso has been demonstrated, suggesting that some zzso zzso zzso may lack the ability to zzso integrate zzso into their zzso
