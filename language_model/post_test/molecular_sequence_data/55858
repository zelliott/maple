To determine whether the zzso cell death induced by zzso agents could be inhibited by zzso we established a zzso human small cell lung cancer cell line, zzso zzso showed higher resistance to zzso zzso and zzso compared with the parental line zzso with relative resistance values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, there was no difference in sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso showed typical DNA fragmentation of zzso following treatment with zzso or zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, the same concentration of the drugs did not induce DNA fragmentation in zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in the same degree of DNA fragmentation in zzso and zzso These studies indicate that zzso can zzso the zzso of some zzso agents by zzso the process of zzso
