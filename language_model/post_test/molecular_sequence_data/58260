Using the techniques of genetic engineering and the principles of protein de zzso design, we have developed a unique affinity zzso protein tag system as a zzso convenient and sensitive method to zzso purify and characterize newly expressed zzso peptides or proteins from cell zzso The method zzso two de zzso linear zzso sequences that can selectively zzso to form the stable protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso In this method, a zzso bacterial expression zzso zzso has been engineered so that one of the zzso strands zzso is expressed as a zzso fusion tag on newly expressed peptides or zzso while the other zzso is either zzso for detection in a Western zzso format or immobilized on an zzso zzso support for selective zzso affinity zzso zzso expressed peptides from zzso coli containing the zzso tag have been produced, detected and zzso using this zzso The zzso peptides were easily and clearly identified using the zzso zzso while the zzso affinity zzso results indicated the purity of the affinity zzso expressed peptides to be zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso The stability of the zzso domain also allows for the zzso zzso to be left attached to the zzso thus creating a new zzso column that can be used to study zzso or zzso zzso Therefore this system offers a new alternative to existing zzso or protein fusion tags and demonstrates the utility of a de zzso zzso
