zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat liver, an alpha beta zzso is a component of the zzso of the zzso acid cycle and functions within the zzso zzso We have isolated and determined the sequence of a zzso clone containing the coding sequence of the zzso precursor to the alpha zzso of this zzso together with stretches of zzso sequence at the zzso and 3' zzso The translated zzso acid sequence indicates the presence of a zzso zzso signal sequence for zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mature alpha zzso shows an extraordinary degree of zzso to the alpha zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso with greater than zzso of the zzso zzso This suggests that the fundamental differences in the zzso structures and zzso functions of the zzso and bacterial zzso must be attributable to differences in the beta zzso zzso that zzso to the cloned DNA is approximately equal to zzso zzso zzso in zzso confirming that each of the two zzso is zzso separately and does not arise by zzso of a primary gene product containing both zzso of the mature zzso
