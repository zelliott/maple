zzso E virus zzso causes an important public health disease in many developing countries and is also endemic in some zzso zzso In addition to humans, strains of zzso have been genetically identified from zzso chicken, zzso zzso zzso rabbit and zzso While the zzso 1 and 2 zzso are restricted to humans, the zzso 3 and 4 zzso are zzso and zzso humans and other animal zzso As a part of our ongoing efforts to search for potential animal reservoirs for zzso we tested zzso from Virginia for evidence of zzso infection and showed that zzso zzso of goat zzso from Virginia zzso were positive for zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso to zzso were present in selected zzso zzso positive goat zzso zzso in an attempt to genetically identify the zzso agent from zzso we conducted a prospective study in a closed goat zzso with known zzso zzso and monitored a total of 11 kids from the time of birth until 14 weeks of age for evidence of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was detected in seven of the 11 kids, although repeated attempts to detect zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and serum samples of the zzso that had zzso were zzso In addition, we also attempted to zzso zzso laboratory zzso with three zzso zzso strains of zzso but with no zzso The results indicate that a zzso agent is circulating and maintained in the goat population in Virginia and that the goat zzso is likely genetically very divergent from the known zzso zzso
