zzso zzso adapts to copper zzso by degrading zzso and inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To identify other components in this pathway, colonies resulting from zzso zzso were screened for zzso conditional zzso Twelve zzso zzso response zzso strains were zzso In zzso conditions, the zzso strains fail to accumulate zzso I and zzso complex I, and they contain reduced amounts of zzso complex zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso remain copper zzso The zzso zzso is rescued by a similar amount of copper as is required for repression of zzso and zzso and for maintenance of zzso at its usual zzso suggesting that the affected gene is a target of the same signal zzso zzso The zzso strains represent zzso at a single zzso zzso which encodes a 47 zzso zzso protein with a consensus zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression is activated in zzso or zzso cells, and zzso function is required for adaptation to these zzso
