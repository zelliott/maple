Previously, we demonstrated that a putative zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso collecting duct principal cells and is localized to the zzso plasma zzso suggesting a role in targeting zzso zzso to the zzso plasma zzso To investigate whether other zzso zzso are present in the zzso collecting zzso we determined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso experiments using total zzso extracted from kidney and various zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso are expressed in kidney zzso and zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso and vascular structures from the kidney revealed that zzso zzso but not zzso is expressed in collecting duct zzso zzso zzso was also relatively abundant in the thick ascending limb of zzso loop and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was found chiefly in zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was raised in zzso In zzso experiments, this zzso labeled a zzso protein in inner zzso that was most abundant in plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of thin zzso combined with zzso electron zzso showed that, in contrast to the labeling seen for zzso zzso labeling in zzso collecting duct was predominantly in the zzso plasma membrane of zzso zzso These results suggest the possibility that zzso may be involved in selective targeting of zzso zzso and/or in zzso membrane zzso in response to systemic zzso zzso
