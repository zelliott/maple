zzso zzso is related to the model plant pathogen zzso zzso yet is not a zzso but rather a zzso agent of powdery zzso this relationship makes it unique for the study of the evolution of plant zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso includes zzso predicted protein coding zzso Genome features, including hallmarks of zzso are very similar in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso a strict zzso revealed zzso and seemingly intact zzso and zzso zzso typical of zzso By contrast, we observed the loss of a specific subset of candidate zzso zzso proteins reported to influence zzso in zzso zzso as the singular divergence that could explain its zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could have once been a virulent zzso fungus that lost the specific zzso necessary for host zzso Interestingly, the zzso agent appears to have acquired genes zzso zzso proteins not found in the compared zzso including zzso and zzso containing proteins believed to have direct relevance to its zzso The zzso sequence should contribute to new insights into the subtle genetic differences that can lead to drastic changes in zzso pathogen zzso
