zzso from diverse organisms are capable of transporting large amounts of zzso via a zzso zzso mechanism called the zzso Although the zzso zzso properties have been studied zzso its molecular composition remains zzso We recently used comparative zzso to identify zzso (also known as zzso an zzso protein that serves as a putative regulator of the zzso Here, we use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso protein zzso analysis to predict proteins functionally related to zzso All three methods zzso on a novel predicted zzso zzso zzso that we now call zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso forms zzso in the zzso inner zzso physically interacts with zzso and resides within a large molecular weight zzso zzso zzso in cultured cells or in zzso in mouse liver severely abrogates zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and membrane potential remain fully zzso zzso has two predicted zzso zzso which are separated by a highly zzso zzso facing the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso are required for its full zzso However, an zzso point zzso retains function but zzso resistance to zzso the most potent inhibitor of the zzso Our zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological data firmly establish zzso as an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso
