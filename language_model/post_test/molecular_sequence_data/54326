zzso II zzso is a member of the zzso family of proteins found in neuroendocrine and zzso zzso The expression and storage of zzso in the zzso zzso of Old World primates and zzso have been linked with those of zzso hormone zzso However, New World primates including zzso monkeys do not express zzso in the zzso zzso but rather zzso is zzso If zzso takes on the zzso role of zzso in New World zzso zzso may be associated with the expression and storage of zzso in the zzso zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate the regulation and distribution of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso A DNA zzso containing approximately 750 zzso of zzso monkey zzso promoter was isolated from zzso DNA and found to contain a zzso response element that is also present in the human zzso promoter and important for zzso zzso The zzso monkey and human zzso promoters were similarly activated by zzso in zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso Double zzso zzso demonstrated close association of zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso monkey zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso have a similar zzso distribution and are zzso in zzso monkey zzso zzso
