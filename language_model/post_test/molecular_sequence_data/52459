The T cell zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein occurring as a zzso linked zzso zzso associated with zzso on the surface of T zzso zzso to the zzso have been shown to be effective for treating zzso disorders in zzso We describe here a method for producing zzso to cell surface zzso of the human zzso using a soluble form of the zzso as zzso zzso V alpha zzso V beta zzso V beta 11 zzso chains are expressed from a construct in which the zzso zzso of the zzso are fused to the mouse gamma zzso heavy chain constant region lacking the zzso zzso These zzso molecules contain both zzso and zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of a zzso V beta zzso zzso indicates that the zzso leader zzso is correctly processed from the soluble zzso zzso raised against the soluble human V beta zzso zzso recognize the native zzso on zzso cells, and on natural T cells derived from resting human peripheral blood zzso zzso mapping studies using competitive binding zzso suggest that the zzso beta 8 zzso produced using soluble zzso recognize multiple overlapping zzso on the cell surface form of the zzso
