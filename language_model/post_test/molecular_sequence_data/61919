zzso et zzso have demonstrated previously that with a few zzso the fourth repeat of human zzso zzso zzso zzso can functionally replace the zzso module of zzso the cellular zzso for zzso A avian zzso and zzso virus zzso in viral entry zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Here we have shown that swapping the zzso zzso of zzso repeat 5 zzso with that of zzso in addition to the corresponding zzso made in human zzso was required to convert zzso into an efficient zzso zzso These results substantiated our previous findings regarding the role of the specific zzso in the viral interaction domain of zzso and demonstrated the critical role of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso module in zzso zzso Furthermore, we have shown that the zzso between zzso 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso module in a zzso zzso protein can be functionally replaced by the corresponding region of another zzso zzso human LDL zzso protein repeat 22 zzso to mediate efficient zzso zzso Since the only zzso feature between the zzso region of zzso and the zzso zzso module is that both contain nine zzso acids of which none are zzso we conclude that the spacing between C2 and zzso of the zzso module of zzso is an important zzso for zzso zzso Thus, the present study provides strong evidence to support our hypothesis that one role of the N zzso of the zzso module of zzso is to allow proper folding and zzso of the protein for optimal interaction with the viral zzso zzso in zzso zzso
