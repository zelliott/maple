zzso zzso virus proteins zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso 2 protein zzso share substantial zzso to the death zzso domain present in the zzso zzso zzso death domain protein zzso and the initiating death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in generating the death signal from both tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The flow of death signals from zzso occurs through the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso death domain protein zzso to zzso to zzso whereas for zzso the zzso directly communicates with zzso and then zzso zzso and zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso as well as killing zzso by zzso of the downstream zzso zzso and zzso Neither viral zzso however, inhibited zzso killing, consistent with an zzso action upstream of the active death zzso These data suggest the existence of a novel strategy employed by viruses to zzso host immune killing zzso Given that bovine zzso 4 protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso also possess significant zzso to the viral zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso it may be that this class of proteins is used zzso by viruses to evade host zzso
