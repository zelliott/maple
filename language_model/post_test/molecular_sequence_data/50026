zzso zzso was used to estimate the p K a values for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso class C zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to observe the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify the signal originating from zzso zzso experiments showed that the chemical shift of the zzso resonance in the zzso zzso is almost zzso in a range of zzso zzso up to pH 11 and showed that the p K zzso of this zzso is well above 11 in the zzso zzso According to zzso accessibility calculations on zzso structures, the zzso oxygen of zzso which is near the zzso groups of zzso and zzso appears to have low zzso zzso These results suggest that, in the native zzso zzso in class C zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso and that when zzso loses a zzso a zzso from zzso would replace zzso zzso zzso would be zzso during the entire zzso
