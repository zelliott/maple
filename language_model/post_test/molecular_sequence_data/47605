zzso zzso both dividing and zzso zzso In this study we characterized a zzso zzso system consisting of a packaging zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso derived from a zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso In zzso the long terminal repeats zzso the zzso untranslated leader and portions of the zzso and zzso genes were zzso The leader sequence of zzso was zzso with a modified zzso zzso virus zzso 59 zzso leader containing a zzso zzso gag zzso and a functional zzso zzso zzso The zzso construct was found to direct zzso synthesis as efficiently as zzso zzso The zzso construct contains sequences required for zzso packaging, reverse zzso and integration, but lacks viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso virus G zzso envelope zzso produced zzso at zzso of zzso zzso units per zzso in 48 zzso zzso virus zzso was not detected when deletions were made in the zzso gene in zzso The ability of this zzso system to zzso dividing and zzso cell in zzso and in zzso was also zzso Compared with a zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell lines and zzso primary zzso zzso cells more zzso Although the levels of the zzso zzso expression were high soon after zzso the expression tended to decrease with time due either to the loss of zzso DNA or to the zzso of promoter activity, which was found to be cell zzso zzso of zzso DNA showed that the zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso survived much longer than that of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso is capable of high efficiency zzso and that long-term expression of zzso zzso is dependent on target cell type, the internal promoter and the zzso itself in the zzso zzso
