zzso zzso zzso is essential in Gram negative zzso zzso the key zzso in zzso formation, zzso the limiting reaction and controls the ratio between zzso and zzso As overproduction of zzso is toxic, the cellular amount of zzso must be regulated zzso The zzso zzso zzso controls the level of zzso via zzso making zzso the only essential zzso of zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso However, degradation of zzso was zzso in contrast to turnover of the heat shock zzso factor zzso zzso The stability of zzso in a bacterial zzso system suggested that a zzso of zzso might be important for zzso Different zzso zzso and extensions were zzso zzso of at least five zzso acids from the zzso abolished degradation by zzso in zzso While addition of two zzso acids to zzso did not alter its zzso the exchange of the last two zzso against zzso acids resulted in zzso All stable zzso zzso were active in zzso as zzso by their high zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso of zzso contains a signal sequence necessary for zzso zzso
