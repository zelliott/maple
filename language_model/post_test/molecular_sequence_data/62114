zzso wing development is a useful model to study zzso which requires the input of zzso genes that specify the identity of various zzso fields zzso zzso zzso and Carroll, zzso zzso (1999) Cell 97, zzso and cell signaling zzso In order to understand how the integration of multiple signaling pathways and zzso proteins can be achieved during wing development, we studied the regulatory network that controls the expression of zzso zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which is essential for the development of the zzso wing, as well as zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso element located in the 3' region of the zzso gene can zzso the dynamic patterns of zzso zzso expression during wing zzso Using this zzso element, we demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso can zzso control wing development through direct regulation of zzso expression in early, mid and late third zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that later zzso expression in the zzso vein cells is controlled by the zzso zzso Thus, a zzso element is zzso regulated by multiple signaling pathways and a zzso protein during zzso wing zzso Such a mechanism is possibly zzso in the zzso outgrowth of other zzso and zzso
