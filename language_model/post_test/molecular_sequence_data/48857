A zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso soil by serial dilution in liquid zzso The cells were zzso stained zzso and grew as irregular zzso with a diameter of zzso zzso zzso growth was observed at 28 zzso pH zzso and zzso M zzso The strain grew on zzso methanol and zzso but not on zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Major membrane lipids of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence was closely related to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On basis of the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as of zzso and zzso differences, strain zzso was assigned to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
