The mechanism of iron transport in zzso is still a puzzle since none of the zzso zzso strains appears to zzso a zzso zzso the energy zzso of the zzso motive force necessary to act on the bacterial outer membrane zzso zzso to allow the zzso of zzso In this work we demonstrate using kinetic experiments of radioactive zzso zzso that iron zzso in zzso zzso although with no recognizable zzso zzso is indeed dependent on energy generated by the zzso motive zzso Moreover, zzso of a predicted outer membrane zzso still transport iron and are sensitive to the iron dependent zzso compound zzso Our studies suggest that alternative pathways to zzso iron might exist in zzso
