A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from seawater on the southern coast of zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 30 zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso formed a coherent cluster with members of the zzso zzso and zzso with which it exhibited sequence similarity values of zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso was zzso zzso consistent with data for the zzso zzso and zzso The cellular fatty acid profiles of strain zzso and the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were essentially similar in that the common zzso fatty acid was zzso Major polar lipids found in strain zzso and the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso From these data, it is proposed that zzso zzso be reclassified as a member of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and that strain zzso be classified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso properties and genetic distinctiveness of strain zzso demonstrated that this strain is distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
