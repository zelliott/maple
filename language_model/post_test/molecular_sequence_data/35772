Since the identification of beta 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso characterization of the different forms of beta zzso has been sought by several zzso New beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso deposits, and it has been suggested that they are of zzso zzso The finding of zzso zzso beta zzso in zzso deposits prompted the hypothesis that zzso would render beta zzso more zzso Finally, a zzso beta zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso acid replacement zzso by zzso at position 17) has been reported as possibly specific for patients with dialysis associated zzso and consequently proposed as 'the zzso zzso We zzso beta zzso from serum of a newly zzso patient and from urine of a transplanted patient in the early recovery zzso Both patients were clinically zzso zzso Three pure zzso were obtained from serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso and only two from urine zzso and zzso Further zzso of each zzso was obtained by zzso in a C4 zzso zzso analysis showed that all zzso had an intact zzso zzso zzso of the serum zzso was performed after zzso with zzso acid and the peptides were isolated by zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had identical zzso patterns with the appearance of an early peak missing in the zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso showed a replacement of the D 42 zzso zzso by N zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
