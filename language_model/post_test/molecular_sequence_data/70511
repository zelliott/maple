Two zzso zzso closely related proteins were isolated from a zzso nervous system zzso zzso library with a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins were expressed exclusively in zzso were highly enriched in zzso of the zzso and contained zzso zzso putative zzso zzso 3 zzso binding zzso In concert with other proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso binding proteins are thought to mediate zzso interactions in zzso signaling processes and with the zzso We have named these proteins zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso Except for these zzso binding regions, which are also found in zzso zzso were unlike any proteins in the zzso zzso were zzso expressed among zzso populations in zzso and were found in growing zzso and growth cones in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso recognized zzso proteins in rat and zzso suggesting that zzso may be zzso across zzso Although the cellular function of zzso is unclear at this time, they appear to be novel members of a zzso zzso binding protein family, which includes the zzso
