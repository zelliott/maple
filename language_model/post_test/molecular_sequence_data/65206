We have introduced a method to identify functional shifts in protein zzso Our method is based on the calculation of an zzso conservation ratio, which we call the zzso zzso For a structurally based alignment of a protein family, this ratio is the average sequence similarity of the zzso region compared to the full-length zzso The zzso region is defined as all the zzso within a certain radius of the known functionally important zzso Using our method, we have analyzed zzso of central metabolism from a large number of zzso zzso We found that for most of the zzso the zzso region is more highly zzso than the full-length zzso However, for three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso sequences are considerably more zzso zzso full-length zzso In particular, we were able to identify in six pathogens a novel zzso zzso that has very low sequence similarity around the active zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that while the zzso structure of zzso zzso is most likely similar between pathogens and zzso the unusual sequence divergence could result from an extra domain added at the zzso This domain has a zzso motif similar one in the zzso zzso zzso and may therefore zzso additional zzso zzso
