To study the genetic zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene in the complete zzso zzso syndrome zzso we amplified each of the eight zzso by zzso in zzso DNA extracted from the zzso blocks of the zzso zzso We analyzed using zzso and directly zzso the zzso shifted zzso zzso were found in 4 cases of zzso Patient 1 carried a point zzso a G to A transition in zzso 7 resulted in a change from zzso to zzso at zzso zzso Patient 2 carried a point zzso a C to T transition in zzso 7 resulted in a change from zzso to stop at zzso zzso Patient 3 carried a point zzso and deletion in zzso zzso A point zzso was an A to G transition that caused a zzso to be zzso for the zzso present at zzso zzso A deletion of a G at zzso 820 resulted in a zzso and consequently in the introduction of a premature stop at zzso zzso Patient 4 carried a zzso in zzso zzso donor site of zzso 7; a G to T transition might have caused an abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso All of the zzso were found in zzso zzso These zzso of zzso gene might be related to the zzso of zzso
