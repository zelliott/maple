The locations of the authentic viral zzso initiation sites zzso during the course of a zzso infection of primary human fetal zzso zzso cells have been identified using the zzso zzso and primer extension zzso Early viral zzso start sites were located 20 to 30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso downstream from the two zzso elements present within the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso element, as seen in the zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of the position and intensity of these zzso Several start sites were observed for late viral zzso two sites were located 25 and 35 zzso zzso zzso and zzso downstream from a potential surrogate zzso zzso To determine whether the presence of zzso expressed zzso large T protein would alter the pattern of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells was zzso Although the positions of the early and late viral zzso start sites were similar to those observed in zzso zzso cells, they were detected earlier in the course of the zzso
