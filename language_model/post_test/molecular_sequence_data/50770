We have isolated and characterized a second human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this gene indicates that it encodes the alpha class zzso zzso with a coding region of about 13 zzso Using reverse zzso zzso it could be shown that the zzso zzso gene is expressed in human liver and zzso zzso The zzso initiation site has been determined by primer extension zzso A zzso was found 26 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso A comparison of the structure of the zzso zzso gene with that of the A1 zzso gene shows significant sequence identity between the two zzso Southern zzso analysis of restriction zzso zzso of human DNA indicates that there may be several more human alpha class zzso zzso
