The zzso in zzso evaluation and zzso study of zzso and structurally related derivatives acting as zzso agents are zzso Among the compounds evaluated here, two zzso zzso derivatives zzso and zzso ) exhibited the strongest zzso effect in this zzso In order to better understand the zzso activity obtained for these zzso we performed an exhaustive zzso analysis using different zzso zzso dynamics simulations were performed using two different media zzso and zzso The results of these theoretical calculations were zzso using experimental CD zzso The electronic study for these peptides was carried out using molecular zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso showed strong zzso action against the zzso and zzso bacteria tested in this zzso
