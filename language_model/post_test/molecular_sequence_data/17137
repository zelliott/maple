We prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, a zzso acid zzso produced by zzso zzso bound with zzso or zzso at the fifth zzso zzso from the zzso by the chemical method of zzso zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso zzso factor was higher than that of native zzso zzso However, it was slightly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso This suggested that the zzso zzso might play some important role in the enhancement of the zzso of zzso zzso However, CD zzso analysis of zzso factor and its derivatives demonstrated that their structures were almost zzso On the other hand, we attached a zzso complex type zzso to zzso or its zzso zzso by means of the zzso activity of zzso from zzso zzso zzso The attachment of the zzso to both zzso factors reduced their zzso However, zzso trimming of the zzso complex type zzso recovered its zzso
