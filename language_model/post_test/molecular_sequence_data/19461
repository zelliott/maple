zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers are formed by selective amplification of DNA fragments from zzso total zzso zzso The technique is popular because it is a relatively inexpensive way to produce large numbers of zzso genetic zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso approach to modeling zzso marker evolution by zzso substitution and an zzso approach to estimate zzso from zzso marker zzso We demonstrate the method on species in zzso section zzso a group of zzso common in North zzso We compare the results of our analysis with a zzso method based on zzso and zzso zzso distance and a two-state zzso analysis using zzso
