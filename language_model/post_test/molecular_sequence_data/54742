In response to environmental conditions, NO zzso zzso zzso global changes in the cellular metabolism of zzso zzso which are strictly related to zzso In particular, at low oxygen tensions and in the presence of NO the zzso alternative zzso is activated by a key zzso zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrate zzso regulatory zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso These regulators are involved in many different pathways and distinct zzso mechanism seems to be operative in several zzso Recent results indicate that zzso is a zzso protein capable of discriminating between NO and CO zzso zzso On the basis of the available structural data, a suggested zzso mechanism is zzso
