Can one protein sequence zzso two zzso zzso folding of human zzso growth factor 1 zzso a zzso protein of 70 zzso is shown to yield two products of similar zzso zzso This observation is of particular interest in light of the recent demonstration that two of the three zzso bonds in native IGF-1 rearrange in the presence of zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso zzso of the IGF-1 folding zzso were monitored by zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso schemes of zzso and products were established by zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were obtained as zzso one with native zzso pairing zzso zzso zzso zzso native zzso zzso zzso and the other with alternative pairing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso early intermediate contains the single zzso zzso which is shared in common by the two zzso Relative yields of native IGF-1 and zzso are independent of protein concentration under dilute zzso In the absence of an added zzso zzso each zzso is stable indefinitely at neutral zzso in the presence of an added zzso zzso the two zzso zzso with an zzso zzso barrier of 12 zzso zzso does not require complete reduction and yields the same ratio of products as initial zzso demonstrating zzso zzso zzso studies using circular zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso dynamic nuclear polarization zzso suggest that IGF-1 and zzso adopt similar secondary structures but distinct zzso zzso zzso of these observations for understanding the zzso of zzso pathways are zzso
