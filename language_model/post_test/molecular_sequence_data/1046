zzso are regulatory proteins that interact with zzso zzso zzso to control progression through the cell zzso In zzso zzso 34 zzso genes have been zzso grouped into five different types zzso B, D, zzso and zzso A novel class of seven zzso was isolated and characterized in zzso designated zzso zzso zzso They all share a zzso central region of 100 zzso acids zzso zzso displaying zzso to the corresponding region of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was able to partially re-establish the zzso expression of the zzso gene in a zzso zzso strain of zzso The zzso interact zzso with zzso in zzso and in zzso as shown by zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso were mostly expressed in zzso cells, albeit also in zzso and mature zzso The possible role of zzso in linking cell division, cell zzso and the nutritional status of the cell is zzso
