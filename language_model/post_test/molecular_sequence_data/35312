zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso inhibitor in the zzso zzso zzso but its precise zzso significance remains zzso This work is part of a series of studies intended to investigate functional roles of zzso and explore the underlying molecular zzso First, we cloned and identified zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso protein essential for zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso is mainly expressed in the central nervous system zzso of zzso and embryonic depletion of zzso caused severe zzso zzso In addition, changes of neural zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the presence of zzso abnormalities in the relevant regions of zzso zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that members of the zzso pathway, especially zzso and zzso which mediate lateral zzso in zzso development, were also zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were able to partially rescue the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso markers while zzso of zzso zzso providing evidence that the zzso zzso is probably involved in zzso zzso zzso
