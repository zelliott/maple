The specific zzso modifications of the zzso proteins are associated with specific zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso To investigate the biological zzso of zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso we created a novel panel of zzso that specifically detected zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We report that the different zzso forms of zzso zzso are zzso within visually zzso zzso silent regions in the zzso zzso Interestingly, direct comparison of zzso zzso zzso with the different zzso states of zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both selectively enriched within zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together and the zzso forms zzso together within the zzso zzso however, the zzso and zzso modifications were virtually zzso These findings strongly suggest that the zzso presence or absence of the different zzso states of zzso zzso and zzso zzso define particular types of silent zzso zzso with this, detailed analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that both were zzso and selectively enriched within the same zzso particle in zzso zzso these findings define a novel zzso zzso code involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that act zzso to mark distinct regions of silent zzso within the zzso zzso
