The zzso zzso zzso is zzso exclusively in late zzso primary zzso during zzso The mechanisms involved in zzso repression of the zzso gene during development before the zzso stage and in later stages of zzso cell maturation and in zzso zzso zzso are zzso To assess the contribution of the upstream DNA sequence to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, a set of zzso zzso reporter zzso was zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells with these reporter zzso allowed us to identify a zzso zzso located between zzso base pairs zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased zzso when the region between zzso zzso and 875 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation site was zzso zzso of a zzso rat zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso containing the zzso portion of the zzso zzso to a site immediately upstream from the zzso zzso zzso promoter led to significantly reduced zzso expression upon transient zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso Nuclear proteins were found to bind to DNA within the zzso zzso region when zzso by in zzso zzso zzso I zzso Thus, our data suggest that an active zzso zzso mechanism involving a specific and autonomous zzso promoter element zzso zzso may be operative to minimize expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
