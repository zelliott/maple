The zzso zzso zzso marker has been converted from a DNA zzso zzso to a more sensitive and rapid zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso amplification of a tandem repeat at zzso revealed 7 zzso fragments, ranging in size from approximately 610 to zzso zzso differing in their apparent copy number of a approximately 55 zzso core zzso This repeat unit differs zzso in sequence from the repeat units of other zzso markers from zzso region zzso zzso arguing that the zzso zzso Number of zzso zzso zzso clustered in this region did not arise from a common ancestral zzso The zzso marker can be zzso simultaneously with zzso products from zzso zzso and zzso on a single zzso zzso providing a rapid scan for successful amplification of these zzso zzso and for inheritance of the entire candidate zzso disease zzso This approach should help to increase the speed, zzso and accuracy of zzso and prenatal linkage testing in this devastating zzso
