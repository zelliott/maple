The zzso family of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso bonds of a wide variety of zzso Nine human zzso proteins and their genes have been identified, many of which are associated with genetic disorders leading to reduction or loss of function of the corresponding zzso A zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso is modified zzso into a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by a water zzso forming the activated zzso (a zzso zzso or a zzso is a necessary step for zzso activity of the zzso Crystal structures of three human zzso zzso A and B zzso and zzso and C, also known as steroid zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In addition, the crystal structure of a zzso bacterial zzso from zzso zzso zzso is also zzso While zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso has a zzso domain and is presumed to be bound to the zzso zzso zzso This chapter compares and contrasts four zzso structures and zzso the proposed zzso mechanism in light of available structural and functional zzso zzso of the zzso active site reveals zzso interactions previously identified in another zzso zzso zzso influence of the zzso zzso in zzso capture and recognition by zzso is zzso Finally, mapping the genetic zzso into the zzso structure provides an explanation for the loss of zzso function in zzso zzso
