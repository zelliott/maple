zzso clones carrying the entire rat true tissue zzso gene have been isolated and zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed the presence of a unique gene for true tissue zzso in the rat zzso zzso The true tissue zzso gene was composed of 5 zzso and 4 zzso its length being about zzso zzso zzso We also isolated the rat zzso zzso zzso which was expressed in the zzso The zzso sequences of the gene were identical with the corresponding sequences of the zzso zzso The rat true tissue zzso gene was distinct from two rat zzso genes expressed in the kidney zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that two identical zzso sites were used in both the kidney and zzso zzso although expression of the true tissue zzso in the zzso zzso was much higher than that in the zzso The zzso region of this gene contained the zzso zzso zzso observed in the rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso region was zzso up to about 800 base pairs, upstream of the cap zzso zzso zzso and zzso boxes were found as common signals required for zzso gene expression within about 100 base zzso of the cap zzso
