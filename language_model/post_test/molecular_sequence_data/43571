zzso and translation zzso have been used to investigate the role of zzso stability in the zzso expression of the zzso controlled low temperature responsive barley gene family, zzso zzso clones zzso zzso representing additional members of the zzso gene family have been isolated and zzso Gene specific zzso have been used to zzso the spatial expression of each individual member of the zzso gene zzso zzso indicate that all of the genes are responsive to low temperature, but the organ distribution is different for each zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso protein zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso mechanisms are important in the zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso
