The distribution of zzso damage to bases such as zzso zzso was determined at the zzso level of resolution using the zzso zzso zzso Administration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to induce zzso stress and subsequent formation of zzso in the zzso Whole zzso DNA was isolated from the rat kidney with or without zzso treatment and then zzso with zzso zzso zzso As a target, we focused on the gene of a DNA repair zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals were found in zzso 1 and zzso 3, but not zzso zzso zzso in these regions, enriched in damaged zzso were highly accessible to zzso zzso especially in the zzso Taking into account the function of the protein segment zzso by these regions, we discussed the molecular mechanism of the restricted formation of the damaged zzso
