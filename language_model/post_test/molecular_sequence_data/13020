Regulatory light chain zzso zzso is necessary to activate smooth muscle myosin, unlike zzso active zzso muscle zzso Here we show that an zzso surface loop located at the zzso junction contributes to this fundamental difference between zzso zzso of the native zzso loop of smooth muscle heavy zzso zzso with that from either skeletal or zzso zzso caused the zzso zzso to become zzso like the zzso from which the loop was zzso zzso zzso zzso gained the ability to move zzso in a zzso zzso and had zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso showed that the affinity of zzso for zzso in the presence of zzso was unaffected by loop zzso thus the rate of a step other than binding is zzso zzso of the zzso did not lead to a higher zzso than obtained for zzso zzso In the absence of zzso a foreign loop did not affect zzso zzso Native regulated molecules have thus evolved a loop sequence which prevents rapid product release by zzso when the zzso is zzso thereby allowing activity to be controlled by zzso zzso
