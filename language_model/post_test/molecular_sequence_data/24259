zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso proteins closely related to zzso zzso and many other zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with the zzso portion of zzso membrane zzso zzso and stimulate its activity by promoting tight zzso of the zzso zzso At low free zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso associates into a zzso which zzso when zzso binds zzso and becomes inhibitor of the zzso zzso is known to have three active zzso and one additional zzso structure, zzso that deviates form the zzso consensus zzso We have found that various point zzso within the zzso domain can specifically affect the ability of zzso to interact with the target zzso but do not hamper the ability of zzso to undergo zzso zzso zzso Point zzso within the zzso region can interfere with both the zzso of the zzso by the zzso form of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso activity by the zzso zzso Our results strongly indicate that evolutionary zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso within the zzso can create a contact surface for binding zzso to the zzso Apparently, in the course of evolution zzso exchanged the ability of its first zzso motif to bind zzso for the ability to interact with the target zzso
