Since zzso zzso must penetrate through zzso layers of the host cell wall, zzso zzso are thought to be important for zzso zzso prepared against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso produced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mating type zzso was previously found to protect the host from zzso The gene zzso and its zzso were cloned and zzso Here we report the isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso as the zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing zzso and its zzso regions was zzso The coding region of zzso was amplified by reverse zzso zzso using total zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso culture grown in the presence of zzso as the sole carbon zzso The predicted open reading frame of zzso would zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids which has zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but no significant zzso with other zzso zzso The first 16 zzso acid zzso at the N zzso appeared to be a signal zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso yielding a zzso zzso B zzso which was found to be a zzso of 29 zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by using a zzso procedure involving ammonium zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso showed optimal zzso activity at pH zzso A rapid drop in the zzso of the zzso and zzso Q zzso zzso of the products generated by the zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso chains in an zzso zzso Western zzso zzso with zzso raised against zzso showed that zzso and zzso are zzso related to each zzso The zzso zzso regions of both zzso and zzso were zzso fused to the zzso gene and introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso were zzso zzso of the marker gene by the zzso showed that zzso expression is induced by zzso and zzso by zzso whereas expression of zzso is zzso and is not subject to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso are expressed when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pea zzso
