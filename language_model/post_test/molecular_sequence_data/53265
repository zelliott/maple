We have made a rat zzso library using zzso zzso zzso Using this library, we performed zzso tag analysis coupled with in zzso zzso to identify genes whose expression is altered in response to nerve zzso In this gene zzso a member of zzso family zzso zzso which had not yet been characterized in zzso cells, was zzso zzso zzso expression was very low in normal motor zzso however, zzso induced its expression zzso Other family members such as zzso zzso and zzso were moderately expressed in normal motor zzso and showed slight zzso after zzso The expression level of zzso zzso was low in the embryonic brain and gradually increased with zzso However, the expression of zzso zzso in the adult brain was lower and more restricted than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso root zzso exhibited dramatic zzso extension secondary to zzso expression of zzso It can be concluded that although zzso expression is lower in developing and mature motor zzso compared with other zzso family members, zzso expression is induced by nerve injury to play a crucial role in nerve zzso particularly zzso zzso in cooperation with other family zzso
