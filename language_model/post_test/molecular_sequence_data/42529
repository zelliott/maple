The isolation of a zzso corresponding to a portion zzso acid zzso to zzso of the zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso surrounding the auto zzso sites was obtained by using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso and zzso zzso to corresponding regions in the human and the chicken zzso zzso This zzso was used to develop a sensitive zzso protection zzso to investigate zzso zzso zzso expression in mouse zzso zzso derived cell lines with increased zzso properties which display a progressive decrease of zzso binding and zzso The results show that increased zzso was not accompanied by a change in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they indicate that the zzso protection zzso developed using the probe described here is a sensitive approach to investigate zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso
