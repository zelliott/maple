The synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso acid sequence in position zzso of human zzso zzso possesses the zzso but not the zzso activity of the mature zzso beta zzso in zzso To assess the relevance of this domain of zzso beta for its zzso activities, a zzso was raised against the synthetic zzso zzso The zzso zzso could effectively recognize human zzso beta in zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso was able to selectively inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso but it could not affect the zzso capacity of zzso zzso It is proposed that functional zzso could be identified in the human zzso beta protein and that the zzso in position zzso is of major importance for the zzso capacity of the entire zzso but irrelevant to its zzso zzso
