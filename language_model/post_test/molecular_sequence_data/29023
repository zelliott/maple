zzso chips are an emerging technology that could replace many of the zzso methods currently used in drug discovery, zzso and cell zzso Despite the promise of these chips, their development for quantitative zzso has been limited by several factors, including a lack of zzso surface zzso to zzso zzso the zzso presentation of immobilized zzso and zzso zzso of protein to the zzso This paper describes a zzso chip that overcomes these limitations, and demonstrates its utility in activity zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The chip was prepared by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso of the immobilized peptides was characterized by surface zzso zzso fluorescence, and zzso Three zzso of the zzso were zzso evaluated in an array format on a single, homogeneous zzso
