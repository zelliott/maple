In this paper the zzso zzso zzso complex is defined as containing all species of the actual zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex are the zzso agents of localized human zzso and zzso zzso in South America, much of Central America and some zzso of North zzso In our search for better species and subspecies diagnostic zzso we focused our research on repetitive DNA, since it provides a greater number of target sites for zzso In this work we report the isolation and sequencing of a zzso zzso DNA region, zzso which is probably zzso repeated or dispersed at least 4 times along one zzso and is naturally present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This region contains zzso and simple repeat DNA sequences and was isolated by screening a zzso DNA zzso library with zzso and zzso zzso No zzso was found with other zzso zzso or repetitive zzso The utility of this repetitive sequence and zzso derived from it in the identification of zzso zzso zzso is zzso As far as we are aware, this is the first report of sequence characterized repetitive zzso and zzso rich simple repeat DNA from the nuclear zzso of New World zzso
