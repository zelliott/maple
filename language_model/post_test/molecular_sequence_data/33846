Whether the concentration zzso behavior of a protein solution is similar to that of neutral zzso solutions, zzso solutions, or neither still remains zzso In this paper, the structure and zzso properties of zzso in zzso acid solutions have been investigated by zzso X-ray scattering zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso Through the investigation of the zzso of zzso the secondary structure, and the solution zzso of zzso in zzso acid solutions as a function of zzso zzso we observed two distinct zzso regions with an identical zzso This critical concentration is close to the bulk density of the zzso in very dilute zzso The zzso relationships are close to the theoretical predictions for zzso solutions, but obvious discrepancies still zzso The phenomena presented here may be widely present in other protein solutions, which can stimulate more attentions on the understanding of the zzso behaviors of protein zzso
