African zzso fever virus zzso is a large zzso DNA virus that replicates in discrete areas in the zzso of infected cells called viral zzso Recent studies have shown that assembling zzso acquire their internal envelopes through zzso by zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that zzso the formation of viral factories and zzso viral zzso are as yet zzso Analysis of the published zzso of the virus revealed a zzso zzso family that encodes proteins with zzso signal zzso indicating possible zzso into the zzso zzso zzso two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso retention zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso gene product by zzso and zzso techniques showed that the proteins were localized to zzso compartments and that the zzso motif at the C zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the absence of other zzso zzso had a dramatic effect on the contents of the zzso that was dependent precisely on the zzso sequence zzso The normal zzso distribution of a number of proteins resident to this important, cellular zzso was drastically altered in cells expressing zzso zzso gene zzso zzso formed unusual zzso structures that contained resident zzso zzso as well as proteins of the zzso intermediate zzso The data presented here hint at a role for zzso gene product in preparing the zzso for its role in viral zzso this and other potential functions are zzso
