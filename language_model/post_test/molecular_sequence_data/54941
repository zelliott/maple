zzso alpha and beta toxins interact with zzso sodium channels zzso at two zzso distinct zzso Alpha toxins bind at zzso zzso and inhibit channel zzso whereas beta toxins bind at zzso zzso and shift the zzso zzso toward more zzso zzso The two toxin classes are subdivided to distinct pharmacological groups according to their binding preferences and ability to compete for the zzso sites at zzso zzso To zzso the zzso surface of interaction at both zzso sites and clarify the molecular basis of varying toxin preferences, an efficient bacterial system for their expression in zzso form was zzso zzso accompanied by zzso binding and zzso zzso in parallel to determination of the three-dimensional structure using zzso and X-ray zzso uncovered a zzso zzso surface in toxin representatives of all pharmacological zzso Exchange of external zzso between the zzso brain channel zzso and the insect channel zzso highlighted channel regions involved in the varying sensitivity to assorted zzso In zzso thorough zzso of channel external zzso illuminated points of putative interaction with the zzso zzso acid zzso at external zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso sensor module in domain II of zzso had prominent impact on the activity of the zzso zzso (from zzso zzso zzso and zzso at external zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso sensor module in domain IV affected the activity of the zzso zzso (from zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso interaction using the zzso sensor module of the zzso channel as template raises zzso in the way alpha and beta toxins interact with the zzso zzso interacts with zzso at a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso segments in domain II, while zzso interacts with zzso at a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso segments in domain zzso zzso cycle analysis and zzso zzso employing a battery of zzso zzso against zzso zzso identified the zzso orientation of alpha toxins at the channel external surface of the zzso in domain zzso The other point of interaction between the toxin and the channel has not yet been defined and may involve channel zzso of either the zzso or the zzso
