Complete zzso sequence was obtained for a gene found to be expressed at a high level during fracture healing in the zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence zzso from the zzso zzso with known sequences showed zzso identity with mouse zzso zzso Zipper zzso zzso and zzso identity with human Zipper zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso by zzso indicates abundant expression of this gene in cultured zzso growth plate and brain zzso Further, regulated expression of this gene has been observed during fracture healing in rat zzso fracture zzso maximum gene expression in this model appears to coincide with zzso and bone zzso Since zzso has been shown to function in the zzso activated signaling zzso pathway, these results provide the first evidence for the involvement of this signaling zzso in fracture zzso
