The hypothetical protein zzso has been implicated as a cancer marker with a potential role in cell zzso We have identified zzso as zzso zzso zzso that zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and potentially plays a significant role in zzso zzso In the present study we have identified the first zzso clones zzso a zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on zzso zzso and consists of four zzso that span 8 zzso The primary sequence is 188 zzso acids in length and is unlike any protein of known zzso We zzso functional zzso zzso zzso and determined its structure at zzso A zzso The zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is unrelated to other zzso associated with zzso zzso The fold was originally classified as zzso a small family that only includes structures of hypothetical proteins from zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since this is the first member of this family with a defined function, we propose to refer to this structure as the zzso zzso zzso We have identified a potential active site pocket that contains a highly zzso zzso acid zzso and propose that it acts as a general zzso in the reaction zzso zzso of zzso to Ala or zzso completely zzso the zzso without altering the overall zzso
