zzso salt bridges are common in zzso zzso and are thought to stabilize the coiled zzso zzso Here we present a detailed zzso investigation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose high-resolution zzso structure shows six zzso zzso pairs between zzso positions g of one zzso and zzso of the other zzso but no zzso pairing within single zzso The average zzso value of the zzso side chain zzso groups of zzso is slightly higher than the zzso of a freely accessible zzso in an unfolded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 39, zzso This indicates that the salt bridges are zzso a prediction we now have confirmed by determining the pH zzso stability profile of zzso zzso zzso unfolding by zzso and by heating and differential scanning zzso show that the coiled zzso zzso is approximately 5 zzso more stable when salt bridges are broken by zzso of the zzso side zzso Using zzso zzso as the zzso the increase in the free energy of unfolding on zzso of the zzso side chains is larger, approximately 17 zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso zzso unfolding can be ascribed to the zzso nature of zzso zzso which screens zzso zzso This work demonstrates the difficulty of predicting the energetic contribution of salt bridges from structural data alone even in a case where the zzso pairs are seen in high-resolution zzso zzso The reason is that the contribution to stability results from a fine balance between energetically favorable zzso attractions and zzso zzso of charges and zzso constraints of the zzso involved in zzso zzso The apparent zzso between the results presented here and zzso studies indicating stabilization by salt bridges is discussed and zzso An explanation is proposed for why zzso salt bridges are frequently found in natural coiled coils despite evidence that they do not directly contribute to zzso
