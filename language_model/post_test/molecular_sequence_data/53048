With the rapidly increasing pace of zzso sequencing projects and the resulting flood of predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso protein sequence analysis, and in particular, protein structure prediction is quickly gaining in zzso zzso zzso can be used for preliminary zzso of newly zzso proteins and, at least in some cases, provide insights into their function and specific mode of zzso Such zzso for several microbial zzso were performed by several groups and placed in public domain for zzso An example presented in this work comes from a related project of structural and functional predictions for proteins involved in the process of controlled cell death zzso The zzso protein belongs to an important class of regulators of zzso identified by short sequence zzso Here, several fold prediction methods are used to build a series of three-dimensional zzso zzso analysis of the models with reference to the biological data available allows selection of the most appropriate zzso It is found that the most likely structural model of zzso is built on the structure of zzso The model is discussed in terms of experimental data on specific zzso zzso of zzso and its effect on zzso interactions with other proteins and zzso
