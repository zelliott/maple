We have investigated the sequence zzso DNA binding site zzso zzso zzso ability and zzso of four zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso minor zzso zzso ammonium zzso The compounds studied include two full zzso that differ in zzso power, a half mustard and a zzso zzso zzso We have also compared their zzso with their precursor zzso and their toxicity and zzso ability with the classical zzso agents zzso and zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the major groove and that they bind strongly to zzso sequences in the minor groove, where they zzso both zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The most preferred sites are classical minor groove zzso zzso to which all four zzso bind equally zzso The remaining sites are zzso but include zzso base pairs, to which the zzso bind with preferences depending on their zzso The full zzso zzso at the 3' ends of the binding site in an orientation that depends on the spatial disposition of the zzso within the two zzso Generally speaking zzso are found to be much less zzso than zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso agents that are zzso to zzso more effective than zzso with the zzso compound being the most zzso However, the type of binding site at which the zzso occur is not clear, since zzso challenge fails to antagonize them zzso The full zzso are zzso to zzso more zzso than their zzso zzso are more zzso than the half mustard and are zzso to zzso more active than zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is the most zzso Given the evidence to hand, it appears that zzso activity zzso with capacity to cause zzso zzso at classical or zzso zzso groove zzso sites, rather than with ability to discriminate between the zzso of potential zzso zzso mustard binding zzso
