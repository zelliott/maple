The availability of the rice zzso sequence enabled the global characterization of zzso site zzso repeat zzso zzso the largest class of plant disease resistance zzso The rice zzso carries approximately 500 zzso genes that are very similar to the zzso zzso zzso region zzso class zzso 2) genes of zzso but none that are zzso to the zzso class zzso Over 100 of these genes were predicted to be zzso in the rice zzso zzso but some of these are functional in other rice zzso Over 80 other zzso genes were identified that belonged to four different classes, only two of which are present in zzso plant sequences present in zzso zzso positions of the identified genes show that these genes occur in zzso many of which included members from zzso related zzso Members of zzso zzso of the class 2 zzso genes mapped to as many as ten different zzso The patterns of zzso of the zzso genes indicate that they were duplicated by many independent genetic events that have occurred continuously through the expansion of the zzso zzso and the evolution of the modern rice zzso zzso events, such as zzso that inhibit the ability of recently duplicated genes to recombine promote the divergence of their sequences by zzso concerted zzso
