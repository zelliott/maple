The zzso zzso amplification zzso method was developed to distinguish between the zzso virus zzso vaccine zzso strain and zzso zzso Two single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso located in the open reading frame 62 gene were selected as zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA demonstrated a typical zzso zzso however, no zzso product was detected in reactions performed with zzso from other human zzso by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso This result was confirmed by a zzso zzso The sensitivities of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso determined by either the zzso zzso or zzso gel zzso were 100 copies per zzso To discriminate the zzso strain from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were zzso with the appropriate restriction zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso products were clearly different in the zzso strain and zzso zzso To evaluate the utility of the zzso methods for rapid zzso viral DNA (without DNA zzso in zzso samples was directly zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in 20 zzso samples by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the expected zzso in the zzso products amplified from the zzso strain and the five zzso zzso
