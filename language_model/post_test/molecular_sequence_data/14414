zzso resistance is a key factor in the zzso of type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso 4 zzso which is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from its zzso compartment to the plasma membrane is regulated by small zzso zzso zzso zzso and is essential for the maintenance of normal zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso knockout mice show increased insulin sensitivity on normal zzso diet, independent of changes in body zzso zzso clamp studies demonstrate that deletion of the zzso gene increases the zzso zzso disposal rate and suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion or zzso zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso increases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso forms a complex with the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso that regulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso directly interact with zzso primarily via zzso 4 of the zzso death zzso zzso from zzso knockout mice show increased zzso and decreased zzso activities, and dominant negative zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso seen in zzso knockout zzso Our results identify zzso as a unique player in zzso metabolism and suggest that signaling from zzso to zzso family zzso may represent a unique therapeutic target for insulin resistance and zzso
