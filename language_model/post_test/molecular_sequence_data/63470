The zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of each protein are necessary and sufficient for the prion properties of these zzso forming in each case their zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso either prion domain, leaving zzso acid content zzso does not abrogate the ability of the proteins to become zzso The discovery that the zzso acid composition of a zzso not the specific sequence order, determines prion capability seems contrary to the standard folding paradigm that zzso acid sequence determines protein zzso The zzso of a prion domain further suggests that the zzso structure is of the parallel zzso type, and indeed, the normal zzso and zzso prion zzso have such a zzso We demonstrate that two shuffled zzso prion zzso capable of being zzso form parallel zzso zzso structures, and our data indicate the same conclusion for a single shuffled zzso prion zzso This result confirms our zzso that zzso indicates parallel zzso zzso
