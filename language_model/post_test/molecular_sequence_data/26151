zzso cell cultures generated from urinary zzso from a series of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Fischer 344 rats were examined for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our overall objective was to identify zzso zzso in this system and to determine what altered biological properties correlate with such genetic zzso The urinary zzso from the treated animals showed a spectrum of zzso from simple zzso to transitional cell zzso zzso Using restriction analysis, zzso zzso and DNA sequencing, we found that approximately zzso zzso of the zzso cell cultures had acquired zzso zzso zzso in zzso 61 of zzso genes zzso or zzso The donor zzso zzso for these three cultures, which also zzso the same zzso zzso were all classified as stage A or B zzso However, four other zzso also arising in this series were found to have normal zzso zzso Whereas approximately half of the zzso cultures derived from the zzso rats were zzso in zzso mice, the three cultures containing zzso zzso were all highly zzso zzso tumors within 5 zzso of injection into zzso zzso These cultures also displayed a high degree of zzso growth and zzso zzso activity in gene transfer zzso The zzso cultures were derived from zzso zzso that included three zzso and three stage A zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso were present in a zzso subset of zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso but most of the zzso in this system appeared to involve genetic zzso zzso Thus other zzso besides activated zzso may apparently be associated with the same zzso zzso and transformation zzso
