zzso zzso zzso is an invaluable tumor marker for the detection of early prostate cancer, and can be a target for active zzso of prostate zzso We wanted to assess the usefulness of the zzso monkey zzso zzso as a relevant animal model to evaluate zzso zzso 

zzso was isolated from the prostate of zzso zzso and zzso gene products were amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction using zzso from zzso regions of human and zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso These amplified products were then zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso and zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Like the human and zzso zzso zzso an zzso frame of 261 zzso acids was identified for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene appears to be restricted to the zzso as it is in zzso 

The high identity between human and zzso zzso sequences suggests that the zzso monkey should be studied further for its potential as a large animal model to evaluate zzso zzso
