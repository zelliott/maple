Although zzso are important in providing a structural framework for most zzso they also appear to be active participants in the inflammatory process via the production of specific zzso The production of inflammatory zzso by zzso is especially important in relation to their strategic location within zzso tissue as they may act as a cellular communication bridge between the zzso and zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso may participate in these inflammatory reactions by the production of a zzso zzso factor zzso with characteristics similar to a recently isolated and cloned zzso zzso Either tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso showed both a zzso and zzso increase in zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso failed to induce zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was first zzso by 30 zzso zzso whereas zzso activity was significantly observed zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso failed to induce zzso zzso zzso suggesting that only the active proteins are capable of inducing zzso zzso zzso analysis using high pressure liquid zzso indicated peak zzso activity with an approximate molecular mass of 8000 zzso This peak of zzso activity was found to be relatively stable to both heat and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity was demonstrated with zzso of zzso by the addition of zzso zzso directed against zzso human zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso zzso can zzso a potent zzso agent with molecular and zzso characteristics similar to zzso zzso and that this factor may contribute to zzso disease zzso
