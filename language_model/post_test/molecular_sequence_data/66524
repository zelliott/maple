zzso zzso act in the first step of the zzso capping process, removing the zzso group from the zzso end of nascent zzso A zzso zzso is found in the zzso from zzso and several other lower zzso This contrasts with the zzso activity of the corresponding zzso of zzso a difference that points to these zzso as potential targets for drug zzso This work describes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the role of zzso metal in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso the agent of zzso disease, and compares it with the previously characterized zzso from zzso zzso zzso similarity of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that a tunnel domain containing the zzso metal forms its active zzso Based on zzso zzso circular zzso and intrinsic zzso analysis, a kinetic mechanism for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso tunnel zzso is zzso A single metal is sufficient to interact with the zzso through the formation of a productive zzso complex, while free zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for the tunnel stability of the zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso remains stable in the absence of metal, as shown for other zzso These findings may be useful to devise specific zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
