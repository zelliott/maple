The spinach zzso zzso is used as a model system to study zzso regulation in higher plant zzso and zzso zzso We performed capping experiments to determine whether zzso PC, or zzso promoters are employed for zzso zzso start sites in zzso and root zzso By using a new method of analysis of capped zzso we demonstrate for the first time that 1) in both zzso the zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso manner by zzso with the preceding zzso zzso and 2) the PC zzso start site is used only in zzso and leaves, zzso we demonstrate the zzso usage of a zzso zzso Both start sites, PC and that of the zzso zzso lack zzso zzso consensus zzso The zzso is initiated zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor, zzso is not zzso in root zzso confirming its regulatory role in zzso zzso expression and the organ specificity of PC zzso Furthermore, our results show that zzso zzso expression patterns differ in spinach and tobacco indicating zzso zzso regulation of plant zzso gene zzso
