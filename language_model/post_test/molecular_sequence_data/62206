Bone zzso zzso zzso zzso play key roles in formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso conversion of precursor proteins into their mature functional zzso These zzso probably play a further role in formation of bone through zzso of transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deposited into the zzso during assembly and involved in initiating zzso of bones and teeth, is thought to undergo zzso in zzso to generate functional zzso fragments found in extracts of zzso zzso Here, we have generated zzso zzso and demonstrate that it is zzso to varying zzso by all four zzso zzso zzso to generate fragments similar in size to those previously isolated from zzso zzso with possible roles for the zzso zzso in the zzso processing of zzso zzso sequences of products generated by zzso zzso of zzso match those predicted from processing at the predicted zzso site that shows greatest zzso conservation of zzso Moreover, zzso derived from mouse zzso zzso zzso for genes zzso three of the four zzso zzso zzso appear to be deficient in processing of zzso Thus, a further role for zzso zzso in formation of zzso zzso is zzso via zzso processing of zzso
