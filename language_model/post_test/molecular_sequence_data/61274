Computer analysis using profiles generated by the zzso program identified a zzso of proteins zzso to zzso zzso The members of the new protein zzso are found in all zzso show a sporadic distribution among bacteria, and were detected also in zzso such as two zzso species and the zzso zzso zzso zzso conservation in this zzso primarily involves three motifs that center around zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that form the zzso zzso in the structurally characterized zzso the human blood zzso factor zzso On the basis of the zzso demonstrated activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that many, if not all, microbial zzso of the zzso are zzso and that the zzso zzso have evolved from an ancestral zzso
