zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso termed zzso was achieved using the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for a mature zzso of 320 zzso acids was zzso into the zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso with six zzso zzso at the zzso and further integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that the zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso by a simple, zzso zzso protocol using immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a single band on zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 30 zzso The zzso activity was optimal at pH zzso and zzso The specific activity measured for zzso zzso zzso was zzso U zzso The apparent The zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as measured on zzso zzso zzso This is the first report demonstrating the possibility of mass production of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso
