zzso between different species or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have not been found in zzso Here, it has been shown that viable hybrids between different zzso species can easily be generated in the laboratory by in zzso zzso zzso of species I zzso zzso located on a zzso and lacking part of its zzso untranslated leader zzso zzso was zzso with another zzso carrying the zzso half of the zzso of zzso a species I zzso or of zzso a species II representative with low sequence zzso When the two plasmids were present in the same cell there was spontaneous production of hybrid zzso Interestingly, these hybrids did not arise by a double or single crossover that would replace the missing zzso sequences with those of zzso or zzso Rather, hybrids arose by attaching the complete zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso of the defective zzso zzso Several elements of the zzso zzso then occurred twice, one from zzso (or zzso and the other from zzso These redundant elements are in most cases deleted upon evolution of the zzso As a result, the zzso zzso of zzso (or zzso then replaced that of zzso It was earlier shown that this zzso zzso could assume two alternating structures that facilitated transient translation of the zzso maturation zzso Apparently, this timer function of the zzso zzso was zzso and could function independently of the rest of the zzso When hybrids were zzso against zzso they were quickly zzso probably explaining their absence from natural zzso
