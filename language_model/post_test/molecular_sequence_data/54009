zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor gene family, is normally expressed at high levels during development in the neural tube and in skeletal muscle precursor zzso Interestingly, zzso expression was also identified in tumor cells developing from these cell zzso To date not much is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of zzso zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso part of the zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis identified putative binding sites for basic zzso zzso Analysis of a series of deletion zzso in different cell types suggested that a zzso region containing several zzso might be involved in zzso expression of zzso and that a distinct zzso region can enhance zzso zzso expression in tumor zzso
