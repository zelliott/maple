We report that zzso of the zzso type 5 zzso gene is activated substantially in zzso by sequences located between positions zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start zzso DNA fragments consisting of the zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso were inserted into a reporter zzso containing a minimal zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso joined to the zzso coli cat zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso cells was zzso about zzso by sequences from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and to a lesser extent by sequences from either zzso to zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso zzso were isolated lacking the X, Y, or zzso sequences and zzso cells were infected with one of the zzso as well as zzso virus to provide zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of both X and Y resulted in a zzso reduction in early zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in late zzso zzso of X or Y alone produced up to zzso reductions in early or late zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso interactions in the Y sequence were revealed by modification of the procedure used for previous detection of X region zzso These data indicate that X and Y zzso which include zzso protein coding and 3' untranslated DNA, also participate in zzso interactions necessary for high levels of zzso promoter zzso The presence of such overlapping genetic elements raises the interesting possibility that functional zzso and zzso zzso must be zzso from separate zzso
