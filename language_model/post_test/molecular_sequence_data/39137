The objective of this study was to identify zzso parameters that could distinguish among seemingly homogeneous zzso zzso viruses and that might provide a surrogate marker for clinical progression in pediatric human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso We undertook a pilot analysis of 15 independent zzso zzso collected zzso from two mothers and their four children who displayed a spectrum of disease stages ranging from zzso categories A1 to zzso zzso were evaluated for their ability to replicate in primary cells (including zzso zzso zzso and cell lines, for their zzso preference and for genetic features of the zzso zzso domain of zzso Virtually all zzso displayed zzso zzso that were restricted in their capacity to replicate in cell lines and displayed zzso zzso with zzso low net positive zzso zzso viruses from two symptomatic children and one mother were zzso whereas zzso zzso from two zzso children were unable to replicate in zzso and were designated primary zzso zzso Only one isolate was zzso zzso zzso in a variety of cell lines and in zzso used multiple zzso and was dual zzso rather than a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as assessed by genetic zzso zzso zzso among zzso viruses is revealed in the ability of zzso to replicate in zzso This characteristic is related to disease stage and provides a potentially new in zzso criterion to distinguish among zzso zzso that is zzso to other surrogate zzso
