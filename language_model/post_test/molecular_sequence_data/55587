The human zzso cell line zzso was used to demonstrate zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso receptors in a zzso zzso containing zzso derived preparation capable of zzso to zzso zzso exposure to zzso decreased the number but not the affinity of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso acid or with the zzso agent zzso zzso increased the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was observed in the absence of differentiation as well as after differentiation with zzso acid or zzso The decrease in the number of receptors was related to time of exposure, with a zzso disappearance time zzso of about 3 zzso during the initial zzso The zzso decrease was near maximum at 24 zzso with no further significant change up to 72 zzso The loss of zzso zzso zzso binding was also zzso with reductions occurring at zzso 1 and 10 zzso The loss of receptors was dependent on temperature, with reductions at 37 but not 23 degrees zzso The zzso was blocked by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was not affected by the zzso treatment, indicating that the zzso was zzso for zzso zzso In zzso cells, unlike other cell models, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors by more than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
