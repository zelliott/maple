A zzso cell line zzso that requires either zzso or zzso to survive and zzso was infected with zzso that expressed either zzso which encodes the zzso for zzso or zzso which is an zzso zzso of zzso The expression of zzso allowed zzso to grow in the absence of zzso or zzso provided that zzso was zzso The zzso did not, however, induce zzso zzso The expression of zzso allowed zzso to grow in the absence of any added zzso growth factors, including zzso although the addition of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso cell lines grew to a higher cell density in suspension and were zzso
