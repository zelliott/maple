The structure of zzso human serum zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso Complete zzso acid analysis was performed by the zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso The zzso terminal sequence was determined by the zzso zzso The zzso terminal zzso acid was determined by zzso with zzso and the zzso terminal zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso mass zzso The zzso fragments of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso mass zzso The complete zzso acid zzso the terminal sequences and the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso agreed with the primary structure deduced from its zzso The zzso pattern of reduced and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso pattern of intact zzso zzso with zzso were respectively similar to those of zzso human serum zzso zzso The pattern of CD spectrum of zzso was identical in both shape and magnitude to that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso oxide showed the same signal patterns in the observed region zzso zzso zzso Cross zzso assigned to the alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the delta zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the same cross peak patterns and chemical shifts in two-dimensional phase sensitive zzso filtered zzso correlation zzso of zzso and zzso
