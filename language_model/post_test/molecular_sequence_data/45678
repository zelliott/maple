zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an important component of host defense to virus zzso zzso of zzso to two zzso zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso its own zzso zzso How structural features of natural target zzso such as zzso and zzso have an effect on the binding to two zzso of zzso still remains zzso By using zzso and zzso we show here that both the zzso and loop of zzso zzso are necessary for the high affinity binding to zzso of zzso with zzso zzso The binding site for the zzso spans from upper zzso to lower stem of the zzso zzso based on chemical shift zzso The backbone zzso in the 40 zzso zzso were zzso zzso chemical shift zzso data suggest that the zzso loop of the zzso interacts with the zzso zzso whereas that of the zzso is less involved in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso also show large chemical zzso indicating that the zzso is involved in the recognition of zzso zzso The results presented here provide the zzso and zzso basis for high-resolution structural studies, and show how local zzso structural features zzso recognition by zzso
