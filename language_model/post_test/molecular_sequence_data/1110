The zzso links the insulin A and B chains in zzso providing thereby a means to promote their efficient folding and assembly in the zzso zzso during insulin zzso It then zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso processing of zzso into biologically active insulin in the maturing zzso zzso of the beta zzso These zzso functions impose significant constraints on the zzso structure that are zzso in zzso After zzso of zzso the intact zzso is stored with insulin in the soluble phase of the zzso zzso and is subsequently released in zzso amounts with insulin, providing a useful independent indicator of insulin zzso This brief review highlights many aspects of its roles in zzso as a prelude to consideration of its possible additional zzso as a zzso active zzso after its release with insulin into the circulation in zzso
