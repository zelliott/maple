zzso zzso B), which zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso To enhance the production of zzso B, we engineered zzso to transcribe zzso devoid of the zzso zzso zzso and translation levels of zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso under zzso and zzso promoters were analyzed by real-time zzso and protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso level was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso and produced zzso and zzso more zzso B than zzso zzso expressed under zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso B expression under zzso promoter caused a zzso drop in the zzso zzso zzso zzso level, which was not observed with zzso zzso Fusion of green fluorescent protein zzso with zzso B allowed rapid zzso of zzso B production by measuring zzso intensity in culture zzso Although the cultures containing zzso zzso showed sustained increase in zzso zzso production until 12 zzso no significant increase in zzso B activity was observed beyond 4 and 6 h after induction when expressed under zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the effectiveness of zzso zzso and the advantage of zzso tagging for enhanced zzso B production and zzso which could be adapted for improving the production of other commercially important proteins in zzso zzso
