During neural crest development in avian zzso zzso factor zzso is initially expressed in the entire cell zzso The expression is then turned off in the period following colonization in zzso and nerve zzso areas except for the cells undergoing zzso zzso This was also zzso in the culture of Japanese quail neural zzso and the cells expressing zzso eventually coincided with those expressing zzso These findings suggested that zzso is involved in regulation of zzso differentiation in the neural crest cell zzso In fact, transient zzso of zzso in the neural crest culture by zzso resulted in a remarkable promotion of zzso zzso An experimental procedure was developed to examine the effect of zzso zzso expression in the neural crest cells in zzso zzso crest cell clusters still attached to the neural tube were excised from Japanese quail zzso zzso and grafted into chicken host zzso Using this zzso technique, we were able to analyze the consequence of transient high zzso during the early phase of neural crest zzso Two effects were demonstrated in the zzso first, high zzso expression provoked massive zzso migration of the neural crest population and, second, those cells that migrated to the zzso areas underwent zzso differentiation with the cell type determined by the nature of the zzso Thus, zzso is involved in regulation of the neural crest fate in two different aspects: zzso migration and zzso zzso
