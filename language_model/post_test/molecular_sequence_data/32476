zzso regions zzso of white spot syndrome virus zzso might serve as origins of DNA replication or be involved in zzso zzso To characterize the interaction between zzso of zzso and the viral zzso in this investigation, zzso display technology was zzso zzso zzso DNA was sheared by zzso to generate fragments in lengths between zzso and zzso zzso Then these fragments were zzso with T4 DNA zzso and cloned into the zzso site of rebuilt zzso zzso 5 zzso to obtain zzso zzso zzso display zzso Using a 210 zzso DNA from the b zzso of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso display library for five rounds resulted in the isolation of a zzso zzso clone containing an zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso This DNA zzso was identified to be the zzso zzso of the zzso open reading frame in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene was transcribed at the early stage of zzso zzso The gene was expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that the zzso zzso protein zzso could bind specifically to the 210 zzso DNA from the b zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene might be a functional gene involved in zzso replication and zzso zzso
