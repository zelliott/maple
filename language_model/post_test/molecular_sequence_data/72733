zzso of the gene zzso for the nuclear zzso La resulted in three zzso zzso A promoter switching combined with an alternative zzso zzso replaced zzso 1 with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso donor zzso site was located 4 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso donor zzso zzso All three La zzso forms were expressed in all the zzso zzso including peripheral blood zzso liver, fetal zzso cultured primary zzso cells, and mouse zzso cell lines permanently zzso with the human La zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso had unusual zzso They contained zzso regions and an zzso of 23 zzso zzso Moreover, they zzso for three open reading frames upstream of the La protein reading zzso In spite of this unusual structure, when zzso zzso or zzso zzso La zzso were expressed in zzso mouse zzso cells, both La zzso were translated to nuclear La zzso indicating that all La zzso forms are functional zzso
