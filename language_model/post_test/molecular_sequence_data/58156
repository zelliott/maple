The zzso zzso in the molecular zzso zzso increases positive zzso in zzso zzso as reflected by a change in the Hill zzso from zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso This zzso acid replacement zzso the zzso structure of zzso It is shown that zzso zzso also have a specific zzso effect which is more pronounced in the case of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso blocks the zzso effect of zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso The results are interpreted using the zzso zzso model for zzso
