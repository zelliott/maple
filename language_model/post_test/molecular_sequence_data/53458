The zzso envelope zzso zzso interacts zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso to mediate the entry of certain zzso strains into target zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain zzso of zzso are crucial for viral fusion and zzso We tested the binding of a panel of zzso zzso peptides to different soluble zzso complexes and zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the peptides were zzso zzso or zzso None of the zzso complexes associated with peptides containing unmodified or zzso zzso The zzso complexes containing envelope zzso from zzso that use zzso as a zzso associated with zzso peptides containing zzso but not with peptides containing zzso in scrambled zzso zzso Finally, only peptides containing zzso inhibited the entry of an zzso zzso Our data show that proper zzso modification of the zzso zzso is required for zzso binding and viral zzso More importantly, the zzso domain determines the specificity of the interaction between zzso and zzso from zzso that use this zzso
