zzso zzso are zzso in biological zzso with zzso phase properties which are implicated in membrane traffic and zzso zzso We have used influenza virus zzso zzso as a model protein to zzso the interaction of zzso proteins with these zzso Here we demonstrate that raft association is an intrinsic property zzso in the zzso zzso zzso molecules with foreign zzso domain zzso sequences lose their ability to associate with the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso reveal a requirement for zzso zzso in contact with the zzso leaflet of the zzso We also provide experimental evidence that cholesterol is critically required for association of proteins with zzso zzso Our data suggest that the binding to specific membrane zzso can be zzso in zzso proteins and that this information will be used for polarized sorting and signal zzso zzso
