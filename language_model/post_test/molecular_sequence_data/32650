Active expression of putative zzso zzso gene zzso A zzso of marine group I zzso has been detected in the Black Sea water zzso It reached its zzso as zzso by zzso quantitative zzso exactly at the nitrate maximum or the zzso zone modeled in the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso expression could explain zzso of the zzso variations in the lower zzso zzso In comparison, zzso expression by zzso zzso bacteria zzso showed two distinct zzso one in the modeled zzso zone and one in the zzso zzso Neither the zzso expression by zzso nor that by zzso zzso was significantly elevated in this latter zzso zzso in the zzso zone, most likely zzso in nature, was verified by zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso with no measurable zzso It provided a direct local source of zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were important zzso in the Black Sea and were likely coupled to zzso in indirect and direct manners zzso Each process supplied about half of the zzso required by zzso based on zzso experiments and modeled zzso Because zzso is a major nitrogen loss in marine zzso waters, such zzso zzso potentially occurring also in oceanic oxygen minimum zones would act as a short circuit connecting zzso ammonium to direct nitrogen loss, thus reducing the presumed direct contribution from zzso zzso
