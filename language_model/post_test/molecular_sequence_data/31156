We have studied the effect of some regular sequences namely zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These sequences were inserted into the zzso site, located between two zzso upstream zzso sequences zzso A modified zzso gene cloned in zzso plasmids was used to transform the zzso zzso zzso strain and the level of acid zzso expression in various conditions was zzso We show that the zzso of zzso blocks, but not zzso or zzso leads to the dramatic decrease of zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibit the expression of zzso gene which was put under the control of zzso zzso
