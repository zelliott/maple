One critical component in determining the zzso zzso and efficiency of zzso zzso zzso is the presence of distinct zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso are found in a range of zzso including the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the sequences of these motifs zzso as does their targeting preferences by zzso with zzso being targeted by both the zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is targeted only by certain members of the zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the specificity zzso within these motifs and generated a model for how specificity is zzso We demonstrate that zzso throughout the zzso zzso play important roles in the recognition zzso However, zzso located at different positions are important for discriminating between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso can be further subdivided into zzso which are zzso required for zzso by zzso or zzso zzso We have used zzso and zzso zzso to identify zzso that discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso that act to promote zzso zzso and regions that are zzso required depending on the zzso zzso A model is proposed to explain how specificity is generated within these short zzso zzso
