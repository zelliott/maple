zzso are zzso zzso that are central to the quality control and regulated turnover of proteins in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso in zzso however, has been hampered by the lack of zzso that are easily detected in whole zzso In the present study, we developed a convenient reporter system by functional expression of a green fluorescent protein zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The levels of this reporter protein correlated with zzso zzso that was readily detected in zzso zzso of the reporter protein was dependent on the sequence of the zzso zzso acid fusion, as well as the presence of an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso This inhibitor was highly specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso with a Ki of approximately 40 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not influence the levels of fluorescent reporter protein or inhibit zzso zzso Together, these findings provide a powerful tool for the zzso of protein zzso recognition motifs and the identification of new genes which may be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso
