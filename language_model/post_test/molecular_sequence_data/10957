The active zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated with one- and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso In both complexes the coordination of a zzso zzso was zzso The unusual zzso interaction parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso constant, K zzso zzso zzso asymmetry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate a zzso type of nitrogen and are consistent with cyanide as zzso to the zzso The additional interactions measured on the zzso signal of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are consistent with an zzso interaction similar to that found in zzso zzso zzso Since a His zzso near the putative zzso binding motif of zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso His in zzso it is a likely candidate for the base that accepts the zzso in the zzso zzso of molecular zzso The zzso of the zzso is accompanied by direct binding of the zzso ring to the zzso
