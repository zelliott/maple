The zzso zzso are members of a zzso of membrane zzso called traffic zzso which includes the medically important zzso zzso resistance zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso Members of this zzso have extensive sequence and structural zzso in particular in an zzso zzso and are believed to use zzso to zzso zzso of zzso across biological zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso and serves as a convenient model zzso In this review, we highlight some of the zzso and molecular biological approaches used to study the functional and architectural organization of this zzso and relate the results of these approaches to what is known about other traffic zzso We have identified specific regions that we believe critical for the function of the zzso zzso and propose that the corresponding regions in the zzso traffic zzso are also important for their zzso In light of the fact that zzso (and possibly the zzso zzso is an zzso channel, we compare the properties of channels and zzso in addition, we discuss the possibility that other members of the traffic zzso may also have zzso zzso
