To investigate whether zzso causes zzso in the viral zzso DNA sequences in the zzso region of duck zzso B virus zzso DNA were analyzed in both ducks with zzso and without zzso Five zzso carrier ducks were injected with zzso particle proteins zzso from duck serum with zzso complete zzso zzso zzso from 14 day zzso for 9 weeks zzso zzso zzso was drawn at the end of the 1st and 4th week after the 1st injection of zzso particle protein and ducks were killed at the end of the 9th week to obtain the zzso Another five ducks without treatment were used as zzso All ducks of the zzso group showed moderate to severe zzso at the 9th zzso All ducks in the zzso group showed one zzso except one duck that showed two zzso only at the 9th zzso zzso were observed in the 5th, 13th, 21st, 22nd, and 28th zzso of the zzso zzso All of them were point zzso at the 3rd base in the zzso The frequency of zzso was different in each duck from zzso to zzso but not zzso There was no zzso in ducks in control zzso These results suggest that zzso causes zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of duck zzso B zzso
