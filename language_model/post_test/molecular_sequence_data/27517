zzso are incredibly abundant and diverse and are key to zzso zzso yet relatively little is known about the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape their zzso zzso viral zzso that lyse their bacterial zzso exert intense and zzso varying selection pressures on bacteria and vice zzso We measured local adaptation of bacteria and their associated zzso in a zzso soil zzso We first demonstrate that a large proportion of bacteria is sensitive to locally occurring zzso We then show that zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso soil samples as the zzso are more zzso than are zzso from samples some distance zzso This study demonstrates the importance of zzso interactions for the small-scale spatial structuring of microbial genetic diversity in zzso
