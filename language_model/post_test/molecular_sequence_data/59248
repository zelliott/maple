zzso zzso properties, including the charge zzso profile and zzso zzso of bovine zzso were determined in zzso The zzso was zzso through an improved zzso protocol that yielded zzso zzso of wet tissue with a specific activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso When stored in the presence of its zzso zzso the zzso binding activity remained stable in a zzso environment even at room zzso The optimal pH for binding to the zzso was zzso The overall zzso specificity of the bovine zzso isolated from zzso is similar to that of the zzso isolated from heart and to other zzso zzso that exhibit zzso zzso I) zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso but differs from those from zzso zzso and rat zzso domain zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso on binding to bovine zzso zzso zzso plots of data obtained at 5, 15, and 30 degrees C showed that the zzso has two sugar zzso binding sites with association zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Chemical modification studies indicated that zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso but not zzso or zzso are involved in the binding to the zzso zzso On zzso zzso the zzso zzso appeared as six zzso ranging from zzso with main components at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso isolated from heart yielded a zzso and zzso different profile with four zzso ranging from zzso zzso those with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso being common to the zzso zzso zzso degradation of selected peptides zzso from the zzso zzso digest revealed zzso acid sequences identical to those obtained for the heart zzso This suggests that although point zzso in the zzso primary structure may not be the likely source of zzso as observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso modifications may be the possible cause of the differences in the zzso zzso profile between bovine zzso and zzso
