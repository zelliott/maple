The expression system for human zzso zzso A has already been established to be a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso of the fused protein expressed in zzso coli, the zzso portion could be readily zzso The zzso activity of the obtained zzso zzso A zzso was found to be almost identical with that of the wild type, and thereafter a zzso was introduced into this zzso zzso zzso called the standard zzso To zzso the role of the zzso zzso which is completely zzso in all zzso species, this zzso was zzso with 17 other zzso acids by means of cassette zzso Thus 17 zzso zzso zzso obtained were examined as to their zzso activity towards zzso As the side chain of the zzso zzso acid zzso became more zzso the zzso activity of the zzso markedly zzso zzso whose side chains were zzso than a Val zzso showed almost no zzso effect towards zzso zzso it was deduced that the large side chain of a zzso zzso acid may cause zzso zzso which may be responsible for the decrease in zzso zzso Thus, we could conclude that the 4th zzso zzso on zzso A must be small, because zzso acids which existed on the zzso side of this zzso could interact with a zzso zzso
