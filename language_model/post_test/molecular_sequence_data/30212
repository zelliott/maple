A universally primed zzso chain reaction was developed to amplify DNA dissected from zzso human zzso The amplification products are cloned into zzso zzso which allow the rapid characterization of zzso zzso Starting from zzso zzso fragments, several thousand independent clones detecting zzso sequences can be zzso Although these libraries comprise only a few percent of the dissected DNA, they provide narrowly spaced anchor clones for the molecular characterization of zzso bands and the identification of gene zzso Here we describe the construction and characterization of DNA libraries for the zzso syndrome zzso region zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso region 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso and fragile X zzso region zzso zzso
