zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso The two zzso bridges zzso and zzso facilitate the folding of the zzso in a zzso structure, zzso on the zzso a high stability in human zzso We report zzso biological and structural features of new linear zzso zzso obtained by combining the removal of both zzso bridges and the incorporation of a zzso or zzso Regarding their biological properties, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are as potent as zzso against zzso zzso and only fourfold less against zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, at 100 zzso they are approximately zzso less zzso than zzso The best therapeutic zzso were found for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase of their activity against bacteria, and from zzso to zzso against zzso when compared with zzso Regarding the stability, zzso zzso appeared to be the most resistant in human serum, along with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When evaluating their zzso by CD zzso in sodium zzso zzso zzso most linear zzso display zzso zzso Moreover, considering its high therapeutic index and stability in serum, zzso zzso was further analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso presents a zzso very similar to that of zzso In our search for zzso zzso with enhanced potential for drug development, we demonstrated that designing zzso zzso can improve the therapeutic index of zzso zzso
