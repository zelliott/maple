In the zzso zzso zzso sex is determined by the ratio of X zzso to sets of zzso zzso animals zzso develop as zzso and zzso animals zzso develop as zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the terminal zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which specifies zzso fate by zzso zzso zzso Here we identify a consensus zzso binding site in the regulatory region of zzso the master switch gene controlling sex determination and dosage zzso zzso is normally expressed in zzso where it promotes male development and prevents dosage zzso We show that zzso binds to the consensus site in the zzso promoter in zzso and zzso the expression of zzso in zzso animals in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso in animals with elevated zzso zzso These data imply the existence of a regulatory feedback loop within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cascade that ensures the accurate dose of zzso genes in cells destined to adopt zzso zzso
