The zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has strong zzso activity toward zzso zzso When zzso is used in combination with zzso zzso zzso cellulose is completely zzso to zzso at high temperature, suggesting great potential for zzso in zzso industrial zzso The crystal structure of zzso shows a zzso zzso zzso zzso fold with an zzso zzso zzso at the opposite side of the active site and a very short zzso sequence outside of the barrel zzso We describe here the function of the peripheral sequences outside of the TIM barrel core zzso zzso deletions were performed from both N and C zzso The activity, zzso and pH stability of the expressed zzso were assessed and compared to the zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the TIM barrel core is essential for zzso activity and that the zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso analyses identified potential key zzso which may contribute to zzso zzso
