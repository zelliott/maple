The zzso dragon lineage of zzso is widely distributed in the zzso or zzso deserts of Australia but is noticeably absent from zzso areas of sand zzso Past fluctuations in the extent and zzso of sandy desert habitat barriers are likely to have been an import factor promoting genetic differentiation in this zzso We zzso a approximately zzso region of zzso DNA and a approximately zzso nuclear gene zzso to investigate zzso structuring of species of zzso zzso Our zzso indicates an early split in this lineage between eastern and western parts of the arid zone that probably dates to the zzso This split zzso directly with large zzso of contemporary sandy habitat in the form of Great Sandy and Great Victoria zzso Our data indicate that this zzso barrier established very early on in the development of the arid zone and has persisted to zzso Additional genetic structuring in the absence of recognized barriers suggests that an expanded view of potential habitat barriers in the arid zone is zzso
