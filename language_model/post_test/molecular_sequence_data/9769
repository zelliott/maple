zzso zzso A zzso zzso appear to compromise the ability of high density zzso to protect against zzso and it is of interest to determine whether zzso smooth muscle cells can contribute to local pools of zzso in the presence of zzso that are known to stimulate acute phase zzso zzso synthesis in the zzso In this study, the regulation of zzso synthesis was monitored in cultured zzso rabbit zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso gene expression was zzso and only zzso by amplification of the zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso gene expression and protein synthesis were zzso by zzso zzso as little as zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso an increase in steady state levels of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso (which is required in addition to zzso alpha for the optimal synthesis of zzso by human zzso zzso had little if any effect on zzso synthesis by the smooth muscle zzso In a time course, it was shown that the stimulation of zzso zzso levels was apparent by 1-2 h after the addition of zzso and that levels remained elevated in the presence of the zzso for at least 48 zzso zzso using an zzso directed against zzso revealed that zzso alpha zzso the synthesis and zzso of zzso protein in a manner that was consistent with zzso zzso zzso The implications of these findings in zzso are zzso
