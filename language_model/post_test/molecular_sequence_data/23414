zzso is a zzso zzso class zzso zzso primarily expressed in zzso cells, and is thought to play a key role in the induction of zzso tolerance during zzso In addition, the zzso gene provides a suitable leader sequence zzso capable of binding to zzso However, the existence of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso might not be essential for fetal zzso To investigate whether expression of the zzso zzso supports zzso cell surface zzso we zzso the zzso gene into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso cells express surface zzso to a similar extent as the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso cell surface expression was zzso Using the zzso cell line in a standard zzso release zzso the zzso molecules were found to inhibit natural killer zzso through a mechanism partially dependent on zzso zzso
