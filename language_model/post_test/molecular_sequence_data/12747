We describe a new method of zzso zzso and detection of zzso zzso The approach is based on a simple chemical zzso zzso zzso with zzso blue (a zzso are zzso on a membrane to immobilized DNA target zzso After zzso and stringency washing zzso zzso is added to the membrane and the membrane is zzso with a zzso lamp light source through a zzso zzso zzso stable zzso are amplified during zzso at the positions of the zzso zzso These amplified zzso are detected using chemically triggered zzso zzso zzso are recorded on commercial X-ray zzso zzso is possible immediately after the last washing step and a hard copy of the zzso is obtained within 1 zzso zzso on the level of the target zzso the sensitivity of the method allows detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in dot blots and 75 zzso in Southern zzso Additional zzso reaction steps and washing steps with blocking zzso and buffers are zzso Furthermore, expensive zzso and equipment for physical detection are not zzso The method might be particularly useful for fast routine analysis in forensic and medical zzso The synthesis of the zzso conditions of zzso and the protocol of detection are described in zzso
