The sequence of zzso II from the brown zzso zzso zzso was determined from a full length cloned zzso obtained from a tandem mass zzso zzso The clone encodes a protein composed of zzso zzso which provides a mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso sequence zzso with the previously characterized zzso I from zzso zzso a zzso structure was modeled for the zzso zzso The structural model was refined on the basis of results from gel zzso and zzso studies, showing that the zzso II is a zzso zzso which binds zzso zzso of zzso as zzso per zzso zzso for catalyzing zzso of zzso by hydrogen zzso in a zzso mechanism zzso zzso 153 zzso 22 zzso pH zzso zzso thereby is converted into a zzso of zzso similar to molecular zzso based on competition kinetic data on zzso zzso and correlation zzso zzso provided by the zzso II mimics zzso of zzso zzso a natural product isolated from the marine sponge zzso zzso
