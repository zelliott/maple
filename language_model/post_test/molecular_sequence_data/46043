Transformation with the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso produced novel zzso zzso plants with an extremely dense coverage of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and young zzso In contrast, zzso were strongly induced in zzso stems and moderately induced in leaves of a hairy, purple zzso transformed with a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso but only zzso induced by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso plants containing only the zzso zzso had a greater proportion of zzso on the zzso leaf surface, whereas all other plant types had a greater proportion on the zzso zzso zzso of crosses between zzso and zzso plants resulted in zzso zzso intermediate between a zzso zzso plant and a zzso zzso zzso None of the transformations zzso zzso on zzso zzso or on zzso zzso A small portion of zzso zzso zzso had a swollen terminal zzso The results suggest that zzso development in zzso zzso may be regulated differently from zzso They also imply that zzso of zzso into zzso species under a zzso promoter has strong potential for developing zzso crop zzso
