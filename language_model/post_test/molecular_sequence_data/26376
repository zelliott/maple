We have recently reported that the zzso to develop zzso disease zzso seems to be primarily associated to a particular combination of an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso a particular zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether certain zzso zzso might also contribute to the genetic zzso zzso and zzso genes of 94 CD patients and 132 healthy controls were examined by probing in zzso amplified DNA with zzso zzso zzso corresponding to all zzso known zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and of the zzso zzso were increased in CD patients compared to healthy controls zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso were in linkage zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the normal population, and the difference in frequency of these zzso zzso was no longer significant when CD patients and healthy controls carrying the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso individuals were overrepresented among zzso patients compared to zzso When zzso zzso patients and controls were zzso nearly identical zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso Thus, the observed increase of the zzso and zzso zzso among CD patients seems mainly to be caused by linkage zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
