To study the genes which may play a role in the development of the zzso central nervous system zzso using a zzso cloning approach, we previously identified a set of novel genes which are predominantly expressed in the mouse embryonic zzso and zzso during zzso One of these zzso zzso encodes a novel 41 zzso zzso protein zzso which is highly expressed in the embryonic zzso and shows remarkable evolutionary zzso To study the biological role of this protein during zzso embryonic development, we cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein zzso is more than zzso identical to the mouse zzso Analysis of zzso expression by Northern zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso revealed the presence of varying levels of transcript for this gene in zzso and adult zzso Among the three zzso species detected by Northern zzso two smaller ones show temporally regulated expression patterns during embryonic zzso
