The construction of a zzso expression zzso is zzso This zzso allows the integration of any zzso coding for its authentic zzso at the zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression cassette consists of the zzso gene and the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso sandwiched between the zzso and zzso of zzso This thereby allows zzso of in zzso constructed zzso zzso at the zzso locus of the zzso zzso The versatility of this expression system was tested by fusing three different zzso genes to the zzso promoter and following their expression by Western zzso zzso Whereas no increase in the amount of zzso protein could be detected under zzso conditions when compared to the zzso zzso strain, the three proteins were strongly induced after addition of zzso depending on the zzso To determine the tightness and the induction factor of the system more accurately, the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The background activity of beta Gal increased by a factor of at least 200 after addition of zzso The system is not subject to zzso but rather to zzso zzso
