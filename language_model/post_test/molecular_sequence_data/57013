zzso important traits of domestic animals have often been genetically linked to sex zzso such as the Z zzso of zzso Using a zzso mapping population between two zzso zzso lines and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso a genetic map of the chicken Z zzso has been zzso Thirteen zzso zzso markers were identified, zzso and linked to two zzso and one zzso zzso The protocol used also generated zzso markers for the W zzso The linkage distances obtained suggest that the zzso markers are widely distributed throughout the Z zzso and are likely to be linked to most or all traits of interest on this zzso The map provides a preliminary estimate of genetic to physical distance of about zzso zzso per zzso for the Z zzso in chickens zzso zzso A similar approach should be zzso to facilitate the mapping and analysis of zzso traits in other domestic zzso
