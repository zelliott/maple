zzso response regulators zzso of the zzso zzso alternate between inactive and active zzso states, with the latter having enhanced zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso in the receiver domain, usually via zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso the active zzso Many of the available structures of inactive zzso family proteins exhibit extensive zzso between the zzso receiver and zzso zzso zzso These zzso invariably involve the zzso face of the receiver domain, the locus of the largest differences between inactive and active zzso and the surface that mediates zzso of receiver zzso in the active zzso zzso of receiver domain zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have been determined, and zzso zzso were zzso Analysis of zzso from small zzso zzso has revealed large differences in zzso rates among zzso zzso zzso with substantial domain zzso exhibit slow rates of zzso Rates are greatly increased in isolated receiver domain zzso Such differences are not observed between zzso rates of full-length and isolated receiver zzso of a zzso that lacks zzso zzso and they are not observed in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that domain zzso restrict receiver domain zzso zzso stabilizing an inactive zzso that is zzso incompetent for zzso from small zzso zzso zzso of zzso by domain zzso provides an explanation for the observation that some zzso cannot be zzso by small zzso zzso in zzso and provides a potential mechanism for insulating some zzso from small zzso zzso in zzso
