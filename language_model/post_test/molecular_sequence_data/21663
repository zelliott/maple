zzso flower break virus zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains five zzso The two zzso zzso zzso the zzso two internal zzso zzso movement zzso and the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which plays a dual role as zzso protein and as zzso of zzso zzso Like other members of family zzso zzso express zzso that are not zzso from zzso zzso However, in one case, corresponding to zzso zzso zzso virus, it has been reported that the zzso gene can be translated from the zzso through an internal zzso entry site zzso Here we show that zzso also holds an zzso that mediates production of zzso from the zzso raising the question of whether this translation strategy may be zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso was functional both in zzso and in zzso and either in the viral context or when inserted into synthetic zzso zzso Through deletion and zzso studies we have found that the zzso is contained within a 80 zzso segment and have identified some structural traits that influence zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso that diminish zzso activity strongly reduced the zzso of the virus while the progress of the infection was zzso by zzso zzso such zzso These results support the biological significance of the zzso zzso translation and suggest that production of the zzso zzso from the zzso might allow the virus to early counteract the zzso response of the host, thus zzso pathogen zzso and zzso
