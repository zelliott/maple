The structure of truncated human zzso zzso zzso zzso the major protein component of high density zzso has been determined at zzso zzso The zzso comprise zzso zzso zzso 4) of zzso zzso a zzso that binds to zzso similarly to intact zzso zzso and that retains the zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso The zzso consists almost entirely of a zzso zzso zzso that is punctuated by zzso at regularly spaced zzso zzso it adopts a shape similar to a zzso of dimensions 125 zzso 80 zzso 40 zzso Four molecules in the zzso unit associate via their zzso faces to form an zzso zzso bundle with an elliptical ring zzso Based on this structure, we propose a model for the structure of zzso zzso bound to high density zzso
