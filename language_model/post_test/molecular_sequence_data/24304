zzso 58 zzso is the major zzso produced by the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso approximately 10 % of the total zzso protein in liquid culture on zzso The zzso is classified into family 7 of the zzso zzso together with zzso I zzso and zzso I zzso from zzso zzso Like those zzso it zzso cellulose zzso with net retention of the zzso carbon zzso The structure of the zzso module zzso zzso of zzso was determined at zzso A resolution using the structure of zzso from zzso zzso as a search model in molecular replacement, and ultimately refined at zzso A zzso The core structure is a zzso composed of two large and mainly zzso zzso packed onto each zzso A long zzso groove is formed by zzso on one face of the zzso The zzso zzso are zzso and the mechanism is expected to be the same as for other family zzso The zzso zzso binding site is more open than that of the zzso zzso zzso as a result of deletions and other changes in the loop regions, which may explain observed differences in zzso zzso The binding site is not, however, as open as the groove of the corresponding zzso A zzso zzso at the entrance of the tunnel may be part of an additional zzso not present in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure was used to model the products of the five other family 7 genes found in zzso zzso The results suggest that at least two of these will have differences in specificity and possibly zzso zzso thus offering some explanation for the presence of zzso zzso in this species, which are zzso expressed in response to various growth zzso
