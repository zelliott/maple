We have cloned a zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso and discovered that it is identical to the gene zzso zzso zzso cause zzso zzso and slow, delayed relaxations of zzso zzso The resting membrane potential of zzso zzso zzso is consistently zzso compared to zzso The action zzso are smaller, and the return to resting potential is zzso To explain these zzso we propose that a reduction of zzso activity in zzso zzso leads to a reduction of the zzso concentration zzso that power membrane potential zzso
