A number of recent investigations have proposed the existence of two zzso distinct delta zzso zzso zzso named delta 1 and delta zzso In the present study, we have investigated the involvement of the two delta receptors in the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity in rat zzso zzso In addition, we have conducted a similar investigation in rat zzso where delta zzso are known to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso a delta 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a delta 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in rat zzso bulb in a zzso manner, zzso being zzso more potent than zzso The selective delta 2 zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of both zzso with a potency about zzso higher than that of the selective delta 1 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso bulb zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso blocks the delta 2 zzso reduced the zzso effects of both zzso and zzso whereas zzso with zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso to delta 1 zzso failed to affect the response to the zzso Similar results were obtained in rat zzso These data indicate that delta zzso receptors coupled to either stimulation or zzso of zzso zzso in two different brain areas predominantly belong to the delta 2 zzso
