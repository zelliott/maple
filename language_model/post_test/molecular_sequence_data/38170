We have isolated the full-length coding sequence for mouse zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso a motor protein found in the zzso The complete sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso to a group of zzso motors, including zzso zzso human zzso and mouse zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are nearly identical except for the presence of two additional sequence blocks in the zzso of zzso and a number of single zzso differences in their motor zzso zzso chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the zzso of zzso identified 3 distinct zzso species in zzso and other zzso zzso comparison and genetic mapping confirmed the existence of a small zzso family in the mouse and suggest possible mechanisms of alternative zzso genetic duplication, and separate genetic zzso in the generation of these zzso In order to examine the possible role of these zzso in germ cells of the zzso an zzso to a shared zzso was used to zzso this group of proteins to different zzso cell zzso These experiments suggest that zzso motor proteins are associated with multiple zzso complexes in male germ cells, including the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso
