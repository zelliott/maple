zzso regulation of human zzso reverse zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso activity associated with zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of a zzso zzso within the zzso promoter region on the zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso length in normal zzso The promoter activity in the zzso was significantly higher than that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso carriers had significantly longer than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, there was no age-related zzso in zzso zzso length in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso whereas there was clear age-related zzso zzso in the zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the functional zzso zzso of zzso is associated with zzso zzso length in normal zzso
