In the presence of zzso zzso or zzso heads, zzso filaments tend to form zzso The biological meaning of the bundling of zzso filaments has been zzso In this study, we found that the cardiac zzso heads can form the zzso of zzso filaments more rapidly than can skeletal S1, as monitored by light scattering and electron zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso formed by cardiac zzso were found to be more stable against mechanical zzso The distance between zzso filaments in the zzso was approximately 20 zzso which is comparable to the length of a zzso head and two zzso zzso This suggests the direct binding of zzso tails to the adjacent zzso zzso The zzso light chain of cardiac zzso could be zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso When zzso zzso molecules were added to the zzso the zzso could be dispersed into individual zzso The three-dimensional structure of the dispersed zzso filaments was reconstructed from electron zzso images of the single zzso filaments dispersed by zzso zzso We were able to demonstrate that cardiac zzso heads bind to two zzso zzso one zzso zzso at the conventional zzso region and the other at the essential zzso zzso This capability of cardiac zzso heads to bind two zzso molecules is discussed in view of lower zzso activity and slower zzso zzso than those of skeletal zzso
