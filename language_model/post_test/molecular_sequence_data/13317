zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as the full length protein and as zzso and zzso truncated zzso The intact zzso and forms with deletions of 12, 27, 46, and 55 zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso All were active, having zzso of both zzso exchange activity and zzso zzso activity compared to wild type zzso Active site zzso indicated that this difference in activity was not the result of production of inactive zzso zzso and gel zzso experiments indicate that the zzso deleted forms and the wild type zzso were zzso zzso of 55 zzso zzso did not result in significant effects on the zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso while deletion of 108 zzso zzso and two internal zzso and zzso deletions generated inactive zzso Five forms with zzso deletions of 24, 37, 59, zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso were soluble and intact but lacked zzso zzso exchange activity or zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence may be required for zzso or to maintain a stable zzso Zone zzso demonstrated the wild type zzso bound both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 55 zzso zzso resulted in altered binding of zzso and eliminated binding of zzso The first 55 zzso zzso are not essential for zzso zzso or zzso binding in zzso but are required for zzso binding not associated with zzso
