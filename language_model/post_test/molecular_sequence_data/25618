zzso are generally considered to be the most primitive group of zzso They are therefore of considerable interest for comparative studies of zzso development and zzso The application of molecular techniques to zzso can provide important insights into zzso processes and zzso relationships both within the zzso zzso and among the zzso This paper reviews current knowledge of molecular and zzso biology of zzso with particular emphasis on tropical zzso zzso and soft zzso from the Great zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene cluster has unequivocally established that zzso are typical zzso zzso sequence analysis has been applied to the staghorn zzso and implies a major divergence within this group, which zzso with differences in zzso zzso Recent zzso studies of zzso have indicated that some species have an unusual method of germ layer zzso zzso events associated with this process, and with other important zzso zzso are currently under zzso Other areas of current research interest, including targets for zzso investigations into zzso zzso are zzso
