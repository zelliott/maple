zzso protein zzso zzso is considered a critical zzso in the repair and/or signal zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso activity has been mostly measured through zzso or zzso procedures using synthetic zzso as zzso followed by zzso analysis, zzso liquid zzso counting of zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso Considering that zzso zzso of other cellular proteins in zzso zzso count could interfere with the detection of specific zzso of zzso zzso we examined the specificity and characteristics of these zzso procedures by zzso zzso of the reaction zzso The zzso pattern showed zzso in wide range of zzso protein bands other than the specific zzso The very low zzso activity shown by zzso zzso or zzso cells was zzso zzso as the count in zzso zzso Even following zzso zzso which would separate zzso from most of other protein zzso substantial amount of zzso of other cellular proteins were still zzso Thus by selectively counting the particular bands, small amount of specific zzso of zzso zzso was reliably zzso These results indicated that the zzso activity through zzso analysis was, as suspected, contaminated by zzso zzso of other cellular proteins and also that the zzso analysis would improve zzso of specific zzso by zzso of synthetic zzso zzso and, therefore, would improve the zzso zzso in both sensitivity and zzso
