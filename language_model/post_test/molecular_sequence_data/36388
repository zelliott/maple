The zzso primer pair is useful for specifically amplifying a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso directly from zzso root zzso A procedure to zzso these obligatory zzso zzso based on competitive zzso was developed by constructing a suitable internal standard to be used with these zzso A zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso was produced by amplifying separately external portions of that fragment, followed by zzso and amplification using the original external zzso When this deleted zzso was added to zzso zzso zzso amplification using zzso zzso yielded the two expected products of 430 zzso and 550 zzso respectively, resolved by zzso zzso This zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso a zzso zzso (five copies per zzso and mixed with the roots to be zzso This provides for a rapid quantitative zzso because both zzso of DNA from zzso roots and zzso zzso taken into account by the same internal zzso Using this zzso a sample of zzso zzso roots zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to contain 5 zzso zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes per zzso of fresh zzso
