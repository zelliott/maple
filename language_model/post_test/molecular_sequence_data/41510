zzso zzso is a gastrointestinal zzso pathogen found worldwide and which especially affects infants and young zzso While different zzso have been associated with varying zzso research on zzso zzso is mainly conducted on the highly virulent zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate here that two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso display different zzso and fitness properties in a mouse zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed that strain zzso overcomes strain zzso in the colonization of zzso and zzso To trace the reasons of this zzso we present here the first high-quality sequence of the whole zzso of strain zzso and compare it to the published zzso of strain zzso 

zzso previously accepted as unique to strain zzso like the zzso and zzso zzso islands, are absent from strain zzso confirming their zzso On the other hand, some zzso and bacterial zzso features, such as a putative zzso cluster and a zzso zzso are unique to strain zzso Additional acquisitions of strain zzso are seven zzso zzso One of these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that may be used for zzso to and invasion of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a putative zzso and two type 1 zzso proteins of strain zzso show a sequence similarity zzso with the zzso proteins in strain zzso The dissimilar sequences of these proteins indicate possible different functions or interaction zzso reflecting the specific zzso properties of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso and thus the different efficiency of host zzso Further important differences were found in two zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso The impact of these differences on zzso is zzso 

Our study emphasizes that the zzso of pathogens can be increased, by acquiring new genes and/or improving the function of essential zzso zzso resulting in permanently zzso zzso This work also highlights the importance of addressing genetic and zzso variations among closely related bacterial zzso even those belonging to the same zzso
