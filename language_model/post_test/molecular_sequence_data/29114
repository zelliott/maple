zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso complexes are probably universally required for membrane zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which they interact has only been defined for synaptic zzso fusion where zzso binds to zzso in a closed zzso that is incompatible with zzso complex zzso We now show that zzso an zzso protein involved in zzso and zzso fusion, binds to a short, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso and of zzso 5 and 18 in zzso In these zzso the zzso binding zzso is upstream of a separate, autonomously folded zzso zzso These data suggest a potentially general mechanism by which zzso proteins could interact with peptides in target proteins independent of core complex assembly and suggest that zzso binding to zzso is an zzso
