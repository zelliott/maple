zzso proteins containing selected regions of the major surface zzso of the zzso and zzso stages of zzso zzso were expressed in insect cells using zzso zzso A zzso protein containing the signal zzso from the precursor to the major zzso surface zzso zzso fused to a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of the same gene was recognized by zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso within the zzso fragment, suggesting that correct zzso zzso of zzso zzso within this region had zzso zzso of 26 copies of the zzso repeat from the zzso protein zzso resulted in a protein recognized by zzso zzso as well as the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso of the zzso putative anchor sequence from both proteins resulted in zzso of protein in a fully soluble form zzso indistinguishable from the anchor containing zzso zzso zzso was not observed when the proteins were expressed as zzso zzso without the signal zzso These data indicate that the zzso signal zzso is recognized in insect cells and that correct assembly of zzso zzso is dependent upon targeting the protein to the zzso zzso
