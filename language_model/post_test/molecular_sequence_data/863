zzso small nuclear zzso zzso in zzso contain either the zzso zzso zzso ring zzso zzso spliced leader zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for specificity factors, we identified zzso and zzso proteins that are highly divergent from known zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso core assembly in zzso is zzso We demonstrate in zzso that zzso is sufficient to zzso specificity of zzso zzso core assembly and to discriminate against binding to zzso zzso and to U2 and zzso zzso zzso interacts zzso with the zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso remains associated throughout the assembly of the zzso zzso and zzso only when a functional zzso site is zzso These data establish a novel role of zzso zzso zzso specificity in zzso core zzso and yield new zzso insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
