We have previously developed a number of zzso zzso zzso that bind to zzso One of these zzso zzso binds to human zzso 1 but not to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso binds both zzso 1 and zzso zzso The zzso for these two zzso were observed to zzso and were localized to the zzso conservative zzso region of zzso zzso This assignment is based on zzso binding to zzso from different species in which the zzso sequence is known, as well as analysis of zzso binding to synthetic peptides and synthetic peptides with specific zzso acid zzso
