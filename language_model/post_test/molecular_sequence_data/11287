zzso are capable of zzso the fatty acids in their membrane lipids in response to decreases in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains four zzso which specifically zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso positions of fatty zzso The levels of the zzso transcribed from the genes that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased about zzso but at different rates, upon a decrease in temperature from 34 degrees C to 22 degrees C, whereas the level of the zzso for the zzso zzso remained zzso The increases in the levels of zzso were caused both by the enhanced zzso and by the increased stability of the zzso at the low zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased at different rates at the low temperature, while that of the zzso zzso remained zzso These observations indicate that the expression of the genes for the four zzso is regulated by temperature in different zzso
