zzso zzso systems, such as zzso and zzso carry out precise zzso reactions on their respective targets in plant zzso This has led to the development of two important applications in plant zzso zzso deletion and zzso gene zzso To draw benefits of both applications, it is necessary to implement them in a single transformation zzso In order to develop this new process, the present study evaluated the efficiency of zzso system for zzso marker gene from the zzso locus developed by zzso zzso zzso integration in zzso Two different zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were used for the zzso of marker gene flanked by zzso zzso targets zzso While marker zzso zzso by zzso was zzso use of zzso resulted in efficient marker zzso in a number of transgenic lines, with the relative efficiency reaching up to zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso in rice cells is critical for efficient zzso zzso and use of zzso offers practical solutions to zzso biotechnology applications in zzso
