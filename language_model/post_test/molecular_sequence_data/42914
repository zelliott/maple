Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that a zzso factor, which binds to a 106 zzso sequence in the mouse zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the relatively high level of zzso gene zzso in the zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we have now identified a 26 zzso sequence within the 106 zzso region, which interacts with a zzso factor in the liver nuclear zzso This zzso designated zzso is located between positions zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start site and comprises the metal regulatory element zzso and part of its zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that a protein of an apparent molecular mass of zzso specifically interacts with zzso zzso of the zzso region resulted in a zzso to zzso decrease in the zzso promoter activity, as measured by reduction in zzso zzso zzso A comparison of other regulatory zzso of the zzso gene and the potential factors interacting with these sequences indicates that zzso and probably the 33 zzso zzso are involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
