Previously, we have shown that the zzso gene is a major zzso of the difference in host range between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A new genetic test system for stringent functional analysis of zzso genes was zzso By testing zzso zzso genes constructed by the exchange of zzso chain reaction zzso restriction zzso we show that a central domain, containing only 44 zzso zzso acid zzso determines the host specificity of the zzso protein zzso zzso acid zzso Mass zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso produced by the new test strain containing the zzso zzso zzso gene shows that molecules containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso are produced, as is the case for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in our test strain, carry zzso and zzso fatty zzso chains containing two or three zzso trans double bonds, zzso zzso the main difference between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in this system is the presence or absence of one zzso double bond, resulting in the very different zzso of the zzso Using a newly developed spot application zzso we show that the zzso and zzso zzso are able to induce the formation of zzso zzso on roots of zzso zzso On the basis of these and other recent results, we propose that the host range of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is determined by the degree of zzso of the zzso fatty zzso zzso of their zzso which is zzso by the zzso central domain of the zzso zzso
