In this report we have characterized a novel, zzso expressed zzso zzso that is predominantly nuclear and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a highly specific association between zzso and zzso which was identified in 36 out of 37 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso to zzso stress fibers in zzso cells and associates with zzso via its zzso The association of zzso with zzso in turn, is zzso by the zzso part of zzso containing the zzso domain, and association was not noted with the closely related zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the association with zzso led to zzso of the otherwise nuclear zzso zzso to zzso stress zzso where it disrupted the periodic zzso pattern of zzso Taken together these results establish the zzso zzso protein as an zzso recruiting the zzso zzso to zzso stress fibers in zzso cells, and suggest that zzso represents a novel regulator of zzso stress zzso
