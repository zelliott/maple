Previous zzso studies of zzso zzso based on nuclear DNA have shown that the western New World zzso form a zzso group representing the majority of species in the zzso with evidence for high rates of recent diversification in South America following final zzso of the zzso 2-4 million years ago zzso For this study, three regions of rapidly evolving zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined to estimate the timing and rates of diversification in the western New World, and to zzso ancestral states for geographic range, life history, and maximum zzso The western New World species zzso zzso zzso comprise a zzso branching zzso of annual plants endemic to the lower zzso of western North America, from which two zzso zzso are recently zzso zzso the western North American zzso from the Rocky zzso Great Basin, and Pacific Slope zzso zzso zzso and zzso the predominantly perennial species from the zzso Mountains of South America and zzso of Mexico zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests for association between life history and maximum zzso demonstrate that zzso are positively correlated with higher zzso These results are consistent with a series of one or more recent zzso in the western New World, and indicate that rapid diversification of zzso zzso with the derived evolution of perennial life history, colonization of zzso zzso and range expansion from North America to South zzso
