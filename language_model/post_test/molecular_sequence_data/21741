Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell lines are the preferred host cells for the production of therapeutic zzso Here we present a draft zzso sequence of the zzso ancestral cell zzso The assembly comprises zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso predicted zzso We associate most of the assembled scaffolds with 21 zzso isolated by zzso to identify zzso locations of zzso Furthermore, we investigate genes involved in zzso which affect therapeutic protein quality, and viral zzso zzso which are relevant to cell engineering and regulatory zzso zzso of most human zzso genes are present in the zzso zzso although 141 of these zzso are not expressed under exponential growth zzso Many important viral entry genes are also present in the zzso but not zzso which may explain the unusual viral resistance property of zzso cell zzso We discuss how the availability of this zzso sequence may facilitate zzso science for the zzso of zzso protein zzso
