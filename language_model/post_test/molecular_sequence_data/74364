We have investigated the relative placement of zzso energy barriers and the role of productive or zzso zzso on the folding zzso of zzso zzso zzso ( zzso containing the zzso zzso To manipulate the folding zzso we have designed a family of zzso in which stabilizing zzso have been introduced zzso on the zzso surface of the main zzso zzso zzso which has a low intrinsic zzso propensity in the native zzso Although the U zzso I and I zzso N transitions are not clearly delineated in the zzso of zzso we show that an intermediate becomes highly populated and more clearly resolved as the predicted stability of the zzso zzso The observed acceleration in the rate of folding zzso with zzso stability and is consistent with the zzso representing a productive rather than zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the effects on zzso of changes in stability within the family of zzso zzso results in a zzso correlation in both the zzso and unfolding rates that suggest a shift from a zzso mechanism zzso stabilized zzso toward a zzso model zzso stabilized zzso Through the introduction of zzso zzso we are able to engineer a zzso zzso on the folding zzso of zzso which is likely to be structurally distinct from that which is only zzso populated on the folding zzso of zzso zzso
