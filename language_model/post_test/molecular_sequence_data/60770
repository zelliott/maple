The zzso is a zzso organ for the internal filter feeding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This organ is also considered to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are specifically expressed in the zzso zzso of higher zzso and they play an important role in zzso metabolism for the synthesis of zzso zzso Previous zzso observations showed that zzso and zzso activities were detected in zones 7, 8, and 9 of the zzso zzso suggesting that these zones contains cells that are equivalent to those in the zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular zzso mechanisms involved in the formation and function of the zzso with special reference to the evolution of the zzso zzso in the present study, we isolated and characterized zzso clones for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses revealed that the expression of the zzso zzso genes was restricted to zone 7, one of the elements equivalent to the zzso These results provide the first evidence at the gene expression level for shared function between a part of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso ) zzso zzso
