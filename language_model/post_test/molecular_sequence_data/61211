Association of the zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso factors is central to cell zzso gene expression and growth in animal zzso Whether zzso complexes are also involved in plant cell growth and differentiation is still unknown since zzso proteins have not yet been identified in zzso Here we report the isolation and zzso of a wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the overall domain zzso of plant zzso is related to the human zzso subset but its primary sequence is slightly more related to the zzso zzso zzso binding depends on zzso located at the zzso which are different from those of animal zzso However, the zzso or zzso nature of certain zzso is zzso strongly suggesting that they may have a crucial role in zzso zzso Plant zzso is expressed in zzso cultured cells and in differentiated zzso and is zzso early in S zzso Our studies reinforce the idea that zzso regulators in plants are unrelated to those of zzso cells but similar to those of animal cells and provide new tools to zzso the links between cell cycle regulators, plant growth and zzso zzso
