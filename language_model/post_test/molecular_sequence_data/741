The zzso zzso and 17th repeats of chicken brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are very similar in terms of structure and zzso However, zzso folds and unfolds 3 orders of magnitude faster than zzso and zzso This is zzso The zzso transition state for zzso folding is investigated using protein engineering methods zzso zzso and compared with previously completed analyses of zzso and zzso zzso of many zzso suggests that all three proteins have similar complexity in the folding zzso The early zzso transition states of the three zzso are similar in terms of overall structure, but there are significant differences in the patterns of zzso zzso apparently folds via a zzso zzso which involves zzso folding and packing of the A- and zzso establishing the correct zzso zzso and zzso fold via a more zzso zzso which may impede the search to find the correct packing of the zzso providing a possible explanation for the fast folding of zzso
