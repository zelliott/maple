In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play crucial roles in male sexual zzso Among these three zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso whose activity promotes the development of zzso Different from the zzso zzso zzso consists of an additional zzso domain zzso apart from its zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, genetic studies have indicated indispensable roles for both of these two zzso of zzso in promoting male development, but the underlying mechanism remains zzso In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of full-length zzso which revealed a novel structural fold formed by its zzso zzso and functional analyses demonstrated that the zzso did not directly regulate the in zzso zzso activity of zzso but instead functioned as a scaffold domain in the assembly of the zzso complex, the executioner in the final step of the sex determination zzso zzso studies further identified the regions in the zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso Our results not only identified a novel fold formed by the extra domain of a zzso zzso zzso but also provided important insights into the molecular mechanism of how the zzso works in zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso
