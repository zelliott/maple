The human zzso protein zzso features a high affinity zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso M at pH zzso and delivers copper to the zzso network zzso zzso may participate in the metabolism of the drug zzso zzso either as a component of its delivery to the nucleus or of its loss via transport to the zzso and zzso The species of zzso zzso was the sole zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso detected by mass zzso under zzso conditions from solutions containing zzso and zzso The zzso zzso + zzso + zzso - zzso zzso zzso 3 to 7) were observed and zzso to different zzso states of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were also detected but zzso zzso were not zzso The related complex zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved zzso zzso mass zzso experiments using zzso and bottom-up sequencing techniques were carried out, respectively, on the intact zzso protein and on zzso peptides formed from zzso by zzso A new software zzso zzso designed to zzso the complex high-resolution tandem mass zzso of zzso zzso derived from proteins containing transition metal zzso was applied to establish the binding zzso of the platinum zzso The analysis, based on the entire isotope patterns, is consistent with the zzso zzso in the zzso sequence zzso being the primary coordination zzso
