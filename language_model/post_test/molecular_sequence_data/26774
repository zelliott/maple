zzso zzso and zzso are zzso pattern recognition receptors detecting zzso or zzso zzso in zzso infected zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso stimulates the zzso of type I zzso that play key roles in zzso immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso zzso however, it is not clear how zzso binds zzso To understand the structural basis of zzso recognition by zzso we have determined the zzso resolution structure of the zzso domain of human zzso The structure revealed a highly zzso fold similar to the structures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso demonstrated that a positively charged surface is involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding studies showed that zzso interactions play primary roles in zzso recognition by zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with blunt ends, but does not associate with zzso with either zzso or 3' zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso complex suggests that zzso zzso may recognize the first turn of zzso zzso in a similar manner as zzso
