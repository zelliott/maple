Members of the zzso protein zzso family are zzso zzso proteins that have been implicated in the processes of cell proliferation and zzso In particular, one zzso family member has been shown to be an essential regulator of cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso Each of the three zzso zzso zzso characterized to date is composed of two copies of the zzso zzso domain with associated zzso zzso In this study, we have addressed the biological significance of the zzso zzso family by comparing the zzso zzso zzso properties, and expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso Our data reveal that all three zzso family members, when expressed in adherent zzso associate specifically with the zzso zzso Moreover, all three zzso zzso are capable of interacting with the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Together, these observations suggest that zzso family members may exhibit overlapping cellular zzso zzso between the three zzso are evident in their protein expression patterns in chick zzso zzso expression is detected in a variety of zzso enriched in smooth zzso zzso is restricted to arteries and zzso zzso is dominant in zzso enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is also zzso regulated in the zzso Our findings suggest that the three zzso family members perform similar functions in different muscle zzso The demonstration that all members of the zzso family are associated with zzso components that have been implicated in the assembly and organization of zzso zzso suggests that zzso contribute to muscle cell differentiation via effects on zzso
