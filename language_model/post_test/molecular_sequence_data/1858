zzso zzso and zzso are members of the four and one-half zzso domain protein zzso that are expressed in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso are novel zzso zzso zzso They bind both the zzso and the zzso as well as different zzso zzso The minimal binding sites for zzso and zzso on zzso zzso whereas on zzso and zzso zzso they are situated zzso zzso the binding sites for zzso on zzso or zzso revealed that the zzso of the whole zzso is important for these associations, rather than any single zzso zzso zzso studies with cells expressing full-length zzso proteins or their deletion zzso showed that zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso with zzso at cell zzso zzso Further, their recruitment to the membrane results from binding to either the zzso or the zzso of the zzso zzso The association of zzso or zzso with zzso receptors neither influences attachment of cells to different zzso nor changes their migration zzso However, in cardiac and skeletal muscles, zzso and zzso respectively, are zzso with zzso zzso zzso at the periphery of zzso suggesting a role in mechanical stabilization of muscle zzso
