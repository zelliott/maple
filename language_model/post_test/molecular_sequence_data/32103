zzso zzso regulatory factor 2 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that is involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play an important role during normal zzso zzso but whether zzso is involved in this process has not been zzso This study was first conducted to investigate the expression of zzso transcript and protein in different compartments of the zzso monkey zzso and zzso during early zzso The results showed that both the cloned partial sequence of zzso gene and the corresponding zzso acid zzso shared zzso identity with those of human zzso On day 12 zzso of pregnancy, strong signals of zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and moderate expressions were detected in zzso zzso zzso During early zzso stage and zzso zzso stage, zzso zzso were mainly localized in the zzso zzso zzso column, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There appeared strong zzso signals in the zzso on zzso of pregnancy, but faint zzso signals on zzso of zzso No specific zzso of zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells and zzso The expression pattern of zzso protein was generally similar to that of its zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso may play specific roles in zzso zzso zzso cell invasion, and zzso through zzso the expression of the related proteins of zzso signaling zzso during early zzso
