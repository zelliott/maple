We have adapted a zzso technique to detect localized zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcribed in the presence of zzso is used as a probe and is detected via an zzso zzso We show that localized zzso can be detected from late zzso to zzso stages and that high as well as low abundance zzso can be zzso The method was tested on muscle zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso has previously been zzso In addition, we used the method to determine the distribution of zzso zzso an anterior zzso zzso which we show is expressed in the periphery of the cement zzso as well as in the region of the zzso zzso The sequence of an zzso zzso predicts a protein rich in zzso and zzso
