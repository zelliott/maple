zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is generated from the precursor protein through zzso processing and zzso the zzso of zzso bonds in zzso compounds such as zzso and/or the transfer of the zzso group to other zzso acids and zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso from zzso coli K-12 at zzso A zzso zzso has a stacked zzso fold zzso the large and small zzso similar to the folds seen in members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The active site zzso the zzso zzso of the small zzso is located in the groove, from which the pocket for zzso zzso binding zzso We have further determined the structure of the zzso intermediate trapped by flash cooling the zzso crystal soaked in zzso solution and the structure of zzso in complex with zzso These structures revealed how the zzso zzso and zzso are recognized by the zzso A water zzso was seen on the zzso carbon of the zzso zzso bond in the intermediate that is to be zzso zzso the zzso essential for zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso shown by zzso zzso of human zzso are all involved in the binding of the zzso zzso The structure of zzso coli zzso presented here, together with sequence alignment of zzso may be zzso to interpret the zzso and genetic data of other zzso
