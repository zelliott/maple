Despite the widely accepted view that zzso of zzso and zzso is required for efficient initiation of cloned zzso we show that these transcriptions have very little effect on initiation of zzso replication at zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, neither zzso nor zzso zzso is required in cells deficient in the zzso proteins zzso or zzso However, zzso that is sufficiently impaired for initiation by deletion of zzso box zzso requires zzso of at least one of these zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso and especially zzso is needed to activate zzso only under zzso zzso We suggest that either the zzso step of initiation is some other zzso occurring from zzso within zzso or the original zzso of zzso zzso derived from the zzso experiments is zzso
