The generation of zzso oxygen species in zzso acts as a zzso signal in triggering cellular events such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso An electron transport zzso zzso complex I, is the major host of zzso protein zzso An important response of protein zzso to zzso stress is to zzso form protein mixed zzso via zzso Exposure of complex I to oxidized zzso zzso resulted in specific zzso at the 51 zzso and 75 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 279, zzso Here, to investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso of complex I, we prepared isolated bovine complex I under zzso conditions and employed the techniques of mass zzso and zzso spin zzso for zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso of the 51 zzso and 75 zzso zzso from zzso complex I zzso revealed that two specific zzso zzso and zzso of the 51 zzso zzso and one specific zzso zzso of the 75 zzso zzso were involved in zzso modifications with zzso zzso The electron transfer activity zzso of zzso in catalyzing zzso zzso by zzso was significantly zzso However, zzso generation activity zzso zzso by zzso suffered a mild loss as measured by zzso spin zzso suggesting the protective role of zzso in the intact complex zzso Exposure of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of complex I, to zzso resulted in specific zzso on the 51 zzso zzso Both ETA and zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased in parallel as the dosage of zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso digest of the 51 zzso zzso from zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of the 51 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso center, suggesting that destruction of zzso is the major mechanism involved in the zzso of zzso The result also implies that zzso of the 75 zzso zzso may play a role in protecting the zzso cluster of the 51 zzso zzso from zzso modification when complex I is exposed to zzso change in the zzso zzso
