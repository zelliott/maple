Among the strains used as starters for making sour milk products on the territory of the zzso the bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso are frequently zzso In this work, we studied a new collection of zzso acid zzso and also obtained more complete data on the zzso sequences of zzso zzso genes in some strains studied earlier and found that most strains had certain distinctions in their zzso zzso genes as compared with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes available in the zzso zzso Based on these data, it is suggested that the strains of zzso acid zzso represent new, earlier unknown zzso of zzso that use milk as an ecological zzso
