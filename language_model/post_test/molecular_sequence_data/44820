zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for kidney and enteric zzso development, and zzso in zzso are associated with human zzso zzso of zzso by zzso has been shown to require an accessory zzso zzso zzso We report the isolation and characterization of rat and human zzso for a novel zzso associated accessory zzso zzso that shares zzso identity with zzso Both zzso and zzso can mediate zzso dependent zzso of zzso but they exhibit different patterns of expression in fetal and adult zzso The most striking differences in expression observed were in the adult central and peripheral nervous zzso In addition, the mechanisms by which the two accessory proteins facilitate the zzso of zzso by zzso are quite zzso In zzso binding experiments with soluble forms of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that while zzso binds zzso tightly to form a zzso complex which can then interact with zzso zzso only forms a high affinity complex with zzso in the presence of zzso This strong zzso dependence of the binding of zzso to zzso was confirmed by zzso analysis on zzso and zzso expressing zzso Together with the recent discovery of a zzso related zzso zzso these data raise the possibility that zzso and zzso have distinctive roles during development and in the nervous system of the zzso zzso and zzso represent new candidate zzso genes and/or modifier zzso for zzso zzso
