We propose a novel zzso assembly method for zzso modeling of zzso and show how it may be used along with zzso X-ray solution scattering zzso data to model zzso structures of particles having as many as 12 independent secondary structure zzso We assessed this zzso procedure by using both artificial data on a previously proposed benchmark and publicly available zzso With the artificial data, zzso models show better similarity to native structures than zzso zzso The publicly available data showed that zzso models can be used to zzso zzso structures previously deposited in the zzso Data zzso Our approach allows for fast and efficient building of de zzso models of zzso using approximate secondary structures that can be readily obtained from existing zzso zzso We also offer a rigorous assessment of the resolving power of zzso in the case of small zzso structures, along with a small zzso benchmark of the proposed zzso
