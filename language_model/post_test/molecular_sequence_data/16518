zzso 2 zzso a recently identified member of the zzso zzso of zzso shares the highest degree of zzso with the zzso member of the family zzso Whereas the study of the in zzso zzso activity of zzso shows that it resembles that of zzso as it zzso the same zzso often at the same zzso bonds and binds the same zzso compounds albeit with different zzso its zzso role remains elusive because of the lack of selective zzso To aid in the design of these novel compounds and better understand the different zzso patterns of zzso and zzso the zzso structure of zzso was used as a template to build a model of the zzso active zzso The results of our modeling suggest that the overall structure of zzso closely resembles that of zzso The model of the active site reveals a zzso sequence identity with that of zzso with differences located within the zzso zzso of zzso where zzso and zzso replace two zzso zzso in zzso To validate the proposed model, zzso zzso was performed on a series of zzso of zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, and their ability to bind various zzso and zzso compounds was zzso The results confirm the involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso binding and zzso activity of zzso and further show that the modifications in its zzso pocket, particularly the presence zzso of zzso account for a number of differences in inhibitor binding between zzso and zzso
