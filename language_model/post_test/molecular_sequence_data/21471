The zzso acid zzso signaling zzso and defensive secondary zzso such as zzso are generally considered to play central roles in the defense of zzso plants against zzso zzso To determine the function of specific plant genes in zzso zzso signaling or zzso zzso are zzso However, zzso are not yet available for zzso plants other than zzso zzso zzso cabbage zzso zzso We employed zzso gene zzso zzso by using tobacco rattle virus zzso to knock down the zzso expression of zzso zzso an upstream zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the release of defensive volatile products originating from zzso in zzso zzso This was done by using the zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso zzso these genes in zzso zzso plants is efficient and zzso Only 18 zzso with zzso identity between the trigger zzso and the target zzso sequence are sufficient to achieve gene zzso zzso plants showed significantly reduced zzso transcript zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants exhibited significantly lower zzso transcript levels only after shorter zzso zzso The zzso of zzso transcript zzso via gene zzso may be overruled by longer zzso zzso Specialist zzso zzso larvae developed significantly better on both types of silenced plants than on empty zzso zzso control plants, while zzso zzso zzso larvae developed significantly better on the zzso silenced plants than on zzso control zzso This shows that not only the zzso zzso but also the zzso zzso zzso is zzso affected by the ability of zzso plants to produce their specific secondary zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the important roles of zzso and zzso zzso which were silenced by zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso resistance to the specialist zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
