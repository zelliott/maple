Although zzso of fish species has been widely reported in aquatic zzso there is no appropriate zzso of the effects to assess the occurrence of zzso In the present study, zzso expression profiles of 14 zzso which are either involved in zzso development and maintenance or have relatively high zzso zzso levels in zzso gene expression profiles in fish species, were zzso evaluated in male Japanese zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso to investigate their utility as indicators of the severity index of zzso Of these 14 zzso zzso expression of a novel zzso termed zzso structure protein 1 zzso in the present study, showed zzso expression pattern with the highest zzso levels, and displayed the most significantly positive correlation with the severity index of zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso is 802 zzso with an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso that encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso revealed that zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso specifically in the zzso and primary zzso in zzso and in zzso with zzso These results suggest that the analysis of zzso expression of zzso can be used to indicate zzso in male zzso
