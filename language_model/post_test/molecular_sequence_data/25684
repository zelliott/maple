zzso is an extremely potent zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso The potent zzso effects of the drug are thought to be due to the formation of a zzso zzso with DNA through zzso of zzso Although the zzso linkage sites between zzso and DNA have been determined, the zzso form of the zzso modified zzso in the zzso duplex zzso was not zzso A zzso 12 base pair zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates zzso zzso containing the zzso most preferred binding sequence zzso was zzso and modified with zzso This zzso zzso duplex zzso was then studied by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso difference and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso experiments on the zzso labeled zzso duplex zzso demonstrate that the zzso zzso of the zzso modified zzso exhibit two signals at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments on the zzso zzso duplex zzso show that the two resonance signals for zzso zzso observed on the zzso labeled duplex zzso were split into zzso by the zzso nucleus with zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Parallel zzso zzso experiments on the zzso zzso duplex zzso show a zzso signal around zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
