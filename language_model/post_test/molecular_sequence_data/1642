We investigated the diversity of the zzso class A zzso gene in zzso zzso in order to study the evolution of the zzso A zzso portion was zzso in a panel of 28 zzso representative of three zzso groups, zzso zzso and zzso recently identified in zzso zzso and of different zzso zzso zzso previously zzso Three groups of sequences were found, two of them corresponding to the families zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and one, more heterogeneous, corresponding to a new family that we named zzso (for other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso acid were similar in the three zzso One new zzso zzso seven new zzso zzso and four zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso formed two zzso based on zzso zzso one with zzso of zzso and zzso and the other with zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso genes zzso coding for zzso A of zzso and zzso coding for zzso zzso were also zzso zzso analysis of the three genes studied revealed parallel evolution, with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso families corresponding to the zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso This correspondence was fully confirmed for 34 additional strains in zzso zzso specific for the three zzso zzso We estimated the time since divergence of the zzso groups zzso and zzso at between 6 and 28 million years, confirming the ancient presence of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso
