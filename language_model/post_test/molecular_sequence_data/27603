The complete coding region of the human zzso zzso gene has been isolated from a zzso zzso The information for the zzso zzso was found to be divided over eight zzso and the total length of the gene exceeded 90 zzso The sequence zzso the zzso region is present in one large zzso The two putative zzso fingers are zzso separately by two small zzso The information for the zzso domain is split over five zzso zzso of zzso are identical to those reported for the chicken zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA with various specific zzso reveal that the human zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso
