The addition of a zzso zzso cap to the zzso end of nascent zzso is carried out by the zzso zzso a zzso protein that is a member of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is composed of a zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso domain motion triggered by zzso binding mediates zzso requisite zzso zzso of the zzso zzso prior to the chemical zzso In this study, we employ targeted molecular dynamics zzso on the zzso capping zzso to probe the global domain dynamics and internal dynamics of zzso zzso during the zzso transformation from the open to the closed zzso Analysis of the resulting zzso along with structural and sequence zzso to other members of the zzso allows us to suggest a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso spanning all zzso zzso and all zzso DNA zzso Our results suggest that the zzso domain moves zzso toward the zzso domain, pivoting about a short zzso zzso The approach of the zzso domain brings a zzso zzso zzso an element of zzso motif zzso within proximity of the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and thereby allowing zzso fluctuations to partition the zzso toward the zzso competent zzso
