Using human zzso zzso zzso zzso channels as a model we aimed to characterize structural differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to gain new insights into the molecular zzso that define the interaction of these zzso peptides with zzso zzso We report here that the block of zzso but not of zzso on current through zzso channels is zzso zzso The replacement of zzso 236 from zzso channel with a smaller zzso acid, zzso did not change zzso binding zzso however, partially affected the zzso dependency of its block at low zzso In contrast, zzso binding affinity to the zzso channel zzso was increased suggesting that zzso might play a role in the binding of zzso but has only a weak influence in the binding of zzso to zzso zzso
