The zzso activities that zzso the genetically defined zzso and zzso functions of the zzso zzso protein have resisted in zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso including only the highly zzso B3 domain of zzso has a highly zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso fusion proteins that include larger regions of the zzso protein have very low activity, indicating that removal of the zzso protein sequences is necessary to elicit DNA binding in zzso DNA competition and zzso I zzso analyses show that B3 binds specifically to the zzso element involved in zzso zzso of the C1 zzso whereas binding to the zzso zzso element is of low affinity and is zzso zzso analysis of the C1 promoter revealed that sequences zzso the core zzso motif of zzso also contribute to the recognition of the zzso element in its native zzso The salient features of the in zzso zzso DNA interaction are in good agreement with the protein and DNA sequence requirements defined by the functional analyses of zzso and zzso elements in zzso zzso
