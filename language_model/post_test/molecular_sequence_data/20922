Intercontinental movements of northern zzso zzso zzso ducks wintering in Japan create a high-risk of both incursion and zzso of avian influenza viruses zzso that circulate in the zzso breeding grounds in zzso and zzso This predisposition is likely amplified by zzso zzso of zzso between Japan and zzso In this study, zzso viruses were characterized by means of zzso zzso site sequencing and found to be low zzso Through entire zzso analysis, as well as in zzso and in zzso zzso tests, one isolate - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - was zzso Comparative molecular analysis revealed that genes of this virus have zzso and zzso likeness at zzso and at zzso acid level, respectively, with genes of different zzso of viruses isolated from China, Korea, Russia, and zzso zzso zzso zzso clustered with viruses isolated from zzso zzso zzso affinity to a recent Korean zzso strain is zzso Related zzso zzso and zzso aspects were discussed, thereby signifying the importance of the described zzso zzso
