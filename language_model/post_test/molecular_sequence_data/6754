We have analyzed the interactions of human and mouse zzso with zzso and zzso The data showed that zzso human zzso A zzso and B zzso were both specifically bound to zzso and zzso immobilized to activated zzso zzso with subsequent zzso of the zzso to lower molecular weight forms, which were likewise bound to zzso The binding of zzso to immobilized forms of zzso and zzso was zzso in the presence of either soluble zzso or zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso 92 and approximately 52 zzso were also specifically bound to immobilized zzso upon which the two forms of the zzso were reduced to a approximately zzso zzso The binding of the approximately zzso zzso to zzso was also zzso in the presence of either soluble zzso or zzso Whereas only the activated zzso bound to immobilized zzso had significant zzso activity, both the zzso and the activated forms of zzso zzso soluble zzso to the same extent while still bound to zzso Our data suggest that cell surface bound zzso could perform two zzso they could zzso act as cell surface receptors or anchors for zzso and zzso and zzso bind and activate zzso on the cell zzso
