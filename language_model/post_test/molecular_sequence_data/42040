An zzso zzso clone was isolated that encodes a protein similar to the zzso zzso protein zzso from rubber tree zzso This zzso zzso zzso was zzso by either zzso zzso virus infection or zzso zzso In addition, expression was moderately zzso by treatment with the zzso compounds salicylic acid and zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of 212 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains a putative signal sequence of 21 zzso acids followed by a zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein is approximately zzso identical to zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso proteins from zzso and to zzso a zzso protein from zzso
