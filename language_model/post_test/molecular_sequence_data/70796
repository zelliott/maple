zzso zzso is an opportunistic zzso frequently isolated from colonies of various laboratory zzso Identification of this species, including its differentiation into two distinct zzso zzso and zzso is usually based on the use of conventional zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso amplification procedure was developed for use as an alternative method for identification and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso products were two distinctive fragments of 937 and zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso products could be achieved by zzso zzso leading to zzso plus zzso and zzso plus zzso fragments for each of the amplification zzso Use of this procedure confirmed identification of 34 field zzso and allowed definitive identification of some strains that could not have been done by use of zzso zzso Field zzso subjected to random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis had high genetic diversity among zzso zzso strains in contrast to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso could represent an additional means for identification of ambiguous strains of zzso zzso and a valuable zzso tool for identification of zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso
