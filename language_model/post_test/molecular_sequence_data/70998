A zzso DNA sequence harboring a processed zzso zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso It was a zzso of the zzso gene sequence including several point zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso of the zzso zzso predicted a truncated form of the zzso zzso suggesting that the processed zzso is zzso A repetitive zzso zzso found in the zzso and 3' zzso regions of the zzso and the zzso tract in the 3' end junction suggest that a zzso of zzso may have been converted to the processed zzso by zzso zzso Previously, it was suggested that an zzso zzso zzso 2 related gene on zzso 2, confirmed by Southern analysis using zzso cell hybrid cell lines, may be a processed zzso It is proposed that the processed zzso isolated in this study may be the zzso related zzso gene localized on human zzso zzso
