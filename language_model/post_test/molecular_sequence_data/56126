A zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso raised against outer membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to a zzso zzso of a major outer membrane protein of this zzso This outer membrane zzso which had an apparent molecular weight of approximately zzso in sodium zzso zzso gels, was designated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso bound to a majority zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso More importantly, mice passively zzso with zzso zzso exhibited an enhanced ability to clear a zzso challenge of zzso zzso from their zzso a result which suggested that zzso might have potential as a vaccine zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli, and zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene indicated that the zzso protein was zzso with a leader zzso a finding confirmed by zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the mature zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso DNA from seven different zzso zzso strains zzso with a probe zzso the majority of the zzso structural gene from strain zzso Additional data emphasizing the extent of conservation of the zzso protein among zzso zzso strains were obtained from Western zzso analyses with zzso zzso raised against zzso proteins from different zzso zzso strains used to probe the zzso form of the zzso protein from strain zzso The ability of the zzso protein to function as a target for biologically active zzso and its apparent conservation among zzso zzso strains warrant further investigation of this outer membrane protein as a potential vaccine zzso
