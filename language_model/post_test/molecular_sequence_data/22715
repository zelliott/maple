It has been believed that protein tagging caused by consecutive rare zzso involves zzso action at the internal zzso zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso either at sense or stop zzso caused by certain arrest sequences could induce zzso zzso near the arrest site, resulting in nonstop zzso that are recognized by zzso These findings prompted us to re-examine the mechanism of zzso tagging at a run of rare zzso We report here that either zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso zzso clusters inserted into a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso could cause an efficient protein zzso We demonstrate that more than three consecutive zzso zzso are needed to induce an efficient zzso zzso therefore zzso tagging in our zzso The zzso tagging was eliminated by overproduction of zzso corresponding to rare zzso indicating that a zzso of the corresponding zzso caused by the zzso cluster is an important factor for zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses of proteins generated in cells lacking or possessing zzso zzso a zzso tag sequence indicated that the zzso and zzso tagging occur within the cluster of rare zzso Northern and zzso analyses demonstrated that nonstop zzso truncated within the zzso clusters are detected in cells lacking zzso but not in cells expressing zzso We conclude that a zzso stalled by the rare zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in nonstop zzso that are recognized by zzso
