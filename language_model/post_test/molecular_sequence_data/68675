The zzso zzso neurotransmitter of the brain, zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso pores integral to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the presumed zzso zzso channel have been zzso but little information is available on the zzso important for zzso zzso zzso or zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and gamma zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and examined zzso We report here the identification of two separate and zzso zzso of the zzso each of which contributes a zzso and zzso essential for zzso by zzso Conservative substitution of each of these four zzso acids dramatically decreased zzso channel sensitivity to zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These zzso however, did not impair zzso by the zzso zzso indicating these two different classes of zzso activate zzso channels through distinct zzso We also present evidence suggesting that the two identified zzso of the zzso contribute a major component of the zzso zzso
