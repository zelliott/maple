We describe a novel strategy to zzso zzso the zzso of an zzso virus by exploiting zzso zzso zzso between synthetic defective interfering zzso zzso and the viral zzso zzso zzso introduced in the zzso zzso were replaced by the zzso zzso during zzso More importantly, however, these genetic markers were introduced into the viral zzso even in the absence of positive selection zzso zzso could be zzso This finding provides new prospects for the study of coronavirus replication using zzso DNA zzso As a first application, we describe the rescue of the temperature sensitive zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and limitations of this strategy are zzso
