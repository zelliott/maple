zzso binding to the alpha prion protein zzso can be both zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso at the copper zzso has been used to explore the site geometry under each binding mode using both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes and soluble zzso complexes of peptides containing one, two, and four copies of the zzso Analysis of the extended region of the zzso using a multiple scattering approach revealed two types of sites differing in the number of His zzso in the first coordination shell of zzso zzso containing one and zzso copies in zzso zzso complexes showed the direct binding of a single His in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex and zzso in its soluble complex with a zzso zzso at zzso showed zzso directly bound to two His zzso consistent with an zzso binding zzso zzso the zzso site occupancy from zzso to zzso in the zzso containing four zzso resulted in spectral features that are intermediate to those of the zzso and zzso zzso The transition from zzso zzso to zzso zzso on increasing zzso zzso offers a structural basis for the positive zzso of the zzso binding process and explains the capacity of zzso to participate in zzso zzso zzso
