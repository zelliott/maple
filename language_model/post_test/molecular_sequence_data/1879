zzso strains of influenza B virus were isolated and identified from 1997 to zzso zzso zzso were collected in children who presented in medical centers in both central and northern parts of zzso To clarify the molecular characteristics of these zzso both partial zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso gene zzso sequences were cloned and subjected to zzso sequence zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed that 16 out of 17 strains were similar to zzso virus, but grouped together to form an independent zzso Only one strain, zzso was similar to the zzso zzso In addition, all zzso except for zzso were similar to zzso and zzso which were chosen as the recommended vaccine strains in 1999 and zzso In contrast, the zzso gene of these zzso was evolved from zzso Based on the zzso of zzso drift in our zzso we conclude that influenza B virus is still prevalent in Taiwan and the zzso of zzso zzso indicated that our zzso form a new cluster that evolved from the zzso zzso
