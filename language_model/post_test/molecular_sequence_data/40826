The zzso birth of zzso is accompanied by massive transfer of zzso genes to the zzso host zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein is zzso in the zzso zzso while a second version is zzso and possesses a zzso zzso zzso necessary to target the protein into the zzso complex zzso Thus it can represent a gene captured during zzso gene zzso 

To specify the origin of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso we have performed extensive zzso analyses of both mentioned zzso We have also zzso tested the zzso location of the zzso zzso protein zzso through transformation of the zzso zzso zzso with the gene in question fused to zzso 

We show here that both versions of the zzso gene in zzso zzso are zzso We also provide experimental evidence for successful targeting of the zzso fused with zzso to the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso composition of the analyzed genes deeply influences the tree zzso and that appropriate methods designed to deal with a compositional bias of the sequences and the long branch attraction zzso zzso need to be used to overcome this zzso We propose that nuclear zzso in zzso zzso is a duplicate of a zzso localized version, and that it has been transferred from its zzso
