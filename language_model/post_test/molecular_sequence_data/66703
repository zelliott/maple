A tissue print followed by a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso activity is present at sites of cell zzso in both roots and shoots of the zzso zzso zzso This paper provides the first report and analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a club zzso In zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed a strong conservation of the zzso described in higher zzso The zzso site zzso varies in only one zzso acid compared with the consensus sequence and was shown to be functional after zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso activity over a broad pH zzso and temperature range zzso degrees zzso but it shows no zzso zzso The zzso site is followed by a consensus sequence for zzso zzso Four terminal zzso were shown to stabilize a putative zzso terminal extension region, which includes zzso zzso zzso involved in the recognition and binding of the zzso The zzso sugar interactions as well as the zzso bridges were shown to be necessary to perform zzso zzso The presence of a highly zzso zzso sequence and function in a zzso suggests that zzso were present before the divergence of zzso and zzso It also points to a possible key role for zzso in the production of a cell wall that allowed the further evolution of land zzso
