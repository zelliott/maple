The bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso largely known for their functional roles in zzso and tissue zzso A number of structurally diverse zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso to regulate zzso The differential zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso family of zzso represents the largest group of zzso zzso however, little is known of how they mechanistically inhibit zzso zzso Here, we present the structure of the DAN family member, protein related to Dan and zzso zzso solved by X-ray zzso The structure reveals a growth zzso appearance with an unexpected zzso mechanism that is formed through extensive zzso strand zzso Using zzso zzso coupled with zzso and zzso activity zzso we identified a zzso zzso on zzso We also determined that zzso binds zzso with high affinity and that zzso binding to zzso interferes with zzso zzso These results offer insight for how DAN family zzso functionally inhibit zzso zzso
