Many genes mapping to pigmentation zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso synthesis in the zzso The brown zzso locus controls zzso coat zzso and its product has significant zzso to the key zzso zzso zzso This has led to suggestions that the zzso is itself a zzso zzso In order to investigate its function, we have established lines of mouse zzso zzso expressing the zzso by zzso of a zzso expression zzso and a zzso zzso resistance to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso by these cells has the expected molecular mass of 75 zzso and zzso with three different zzso zzso We were unable to confirm previous reports that the zzso has zzso or zzso activity, but detected zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and the major product of its action on zzso is zzso zzso Since this activity is not present in zzso cells we conclude that the zzso has zzso zzso zzso zzso do not contain zzso the zzso zzso in which the zzso is located in zzso Nevertheless, indirect zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso produces a distinctive pattern of intense zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso of the zzso with the late zzso markers zzso and zzso both in zzso zzso and in mouse melanoma zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso are closely related to zzso
