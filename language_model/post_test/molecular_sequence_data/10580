zzso zzso regulation in bacterial systems is related to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we investigated the secondary structure of zzso an effective zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso preparations contain a single zzso The global structure was identified by a zzso experiment under native conditions using a short complementary zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate a zzso structure of zzso consisting of two zzso elements connected by a zzso zzso hinge zzso zzso data suggest that the formation of base pairs between a zzso zzso of zzso and its target zzso is essential for fast zzso The complementary sequence stretch of the target folds into a zzso secondary zzso The relationship between modifications in structural elements of zzso and the zzso zzso suggested that zzso steps of the zzso involve a single site of zzso and do not involve its zzso or zzso Further, the data indicate that both initial zzso interactions and duplex formation are dependent on the zzso zzso of the central region of zzso This mechanism represents a specific and efficient way of zzso zzso that is initiated by the interaction of zzso zzso zzso
