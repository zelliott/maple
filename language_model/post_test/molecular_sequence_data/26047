We present a molecular analysis of four dominant zzso of the zzso gene zzso Three of these, the zzso zzso cause zzso zzso defects and zzso transformations of the first abdominal segment to the zzso These zzso are shown to be zzso changes affecting two nearby zzso zzso zzso zzso for these zzso accumulate higher levels of zzso protein than wild type and show strong persistence of zzso zzso but not zzso These effects appear to result from stabilization of the zzso zzso since zzso stripes zzso much more slowly in zzso zzso than in wild type after injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso We trace the origin of zzso defects in zzso zzso to repression of the zzso gene zzso by excess zzso protein during stripe zzso zzso transformations are shown to be correlated with zzso expression of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso A zzso sequence containing the zzso zzso altered in the zzso zzso appears to be zzso in the proteins zzso by other zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso and may target these proteins for rapid zzso The fourth zzso zzso zzso also causes zzso transformations and is a zzso broken within the zzso zzso Both zzso transcript and protein stripes are persistent in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is stabilized relative to wild zzso
