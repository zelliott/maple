zzso zzso are zzso compartments that house highly ordered zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso as a model system, we show that zzso zzso exist in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso proceeds simultaneously in multiple zzso and zzso proceeds from the same location in each zzso The zzso zzso zzso is required for the formation of functional zzso zzso and displays a dynamic zzso zzso throughout the growth cycle of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso precisely coordinates zzso zzso and can serve as a model system for the study of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
