zzso are a zzso and functionally diverse group of zzso species that range from zzso zzso over zzso grazing zzso feeders to highly specialized zzso with complex host zzso We performed zzso analyses of small zzso zzso sequences from 97 species including an analysis that account for the zzso secondary structure in the models of zzso The present study confirms the sister relationship of the zzso zzso with the predominantly zzso zzso All analyses appoint the zzso zzso and zzso as being zzso but the zzso based hypothesis of their zzso could not be significantly zzso Within the zzso the families that exclusively zzso higher plants are joined in a single zzso However, only the zzso position of the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be zzso or zzso zzso and likelihood ancestral state reconstruction revealed that zzso zzso and sedentary zzso each evolved, respectively, at least six and at least three times zzso mostly from migratory zzso zzso Only zzso zzso have evolved from zzso zzso zzso Traditional zzso are partially misled by this zzso evolution of feeding type and associated zzso zzso mapping attributes of the zzso cellular architecture, including newly obtained data of 18 species belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a broad zzso of the zzso characters and the molecular zzso zzso Yet, the presence of an offset zzso and proliferation of zzso cells has evolved multiple times, the latter associated with derived zzso feeding specialization and resulting reproduction zzso zzso state reconstruction further revealed that the zzso of the zzso and ecologically dissimilar zzso and zzso zzso evolved from a common zzso
