zzso are zzso viruses with an approximately zzso zzso DNA zzso that replicate in the zzso zzso zzso an abundant structural component of the zzso core that is strongly associated with zzso DNA, is imported into the nucleus zzso with the zzso zzso shortly after virus infection and may promote DNA zzso In this study, we evaluated whether protein zzso uses specific zzso mechanisms for import into the zzso We found that it contains potent nuclear zzso signal zzso activity by zzso of cultured cells with protein zzso fusion zzso and by zzso of cells with zzso protein zzso zzso We identified three zzso regions in protein zzso by deletion mapping and determined important zzso zzso by zzso zzso We found that zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso strongly and specifically bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, and zzso which are among the most abundant cellular nuclear import zzso Moreover, these receptors can mediate the nuclear import of protein zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso together, these data support the hypothesis that protein zzso is a major zzso zzso for zzso import of zzso DNA and that multiple import pathways are zzso to promote efficient nuclear entry of the viral zzso
