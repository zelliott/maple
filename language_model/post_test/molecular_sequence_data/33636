zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso plays a regulatory role in zzso zzso and can also function as a signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that plays a prominent role in tooth formation and a potential role during the zzso zzso The possibility that zzso can cleave zzso to release biologically active peptides was investigated in this zzso zzso both in the zzso form and in its native state within the zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso for zzso zzso processing of zzso by zzso produced two major zzso one that contains the zzso region of the protein known to carry both the zzso zzso acid and zzso rich zzso domain involved in zzso and the DNA binding site of zzso In zzso experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso mimicking the zzso zzso products of zzso demonstrated an effect of the zzso on the differentiation of dental pulp zzso cells to a putative zzso zzso In zzso zzso of this zzso in a rat injured pulp model induced a rapid formation of a homogeneous zzso bridge covered by a zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an efficient repair zzso These data suggest that a zzso generated through the zzso processing of zzso by zzso can regulate the differentiation of zzso cells during zzso and thus sustain zzso zzso formation in pathological situations such as zzso zzso In addition, these data open a new therapeutic possibility of using this zzso to zzso zzso after an zzso
