zzso of the Gal zzso Gal zzso on membrane zzso and zzso is known to vary widely from one tissue to zzso In the course of studying the mechanisms underlying this zzso we have isolated from pig zzso four sequences corresponding to four zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso that links zzso in zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso differ from each other in the alternative presence of two zzso stretches of 36 and 63 base pairs in a segment zzso the stem region of the zzso zzso expression experiments show that all four zzso can zzso zzso activity to zzso cells, and that they are all located within the zzso zzso indicating that variations in length in the stem region do not affect zzso activity or cellular zzso Analysis of zzso from different pig zzso and cells shows quantitative differences between zzso in levels of zzso as well as qualitative differences, the four zzso being zzso represented in different zzso
