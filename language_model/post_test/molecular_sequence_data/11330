zzso cornea contains three unique zzso zzso zzso zzso of which two zzso and zzso have been characterized using molecular zzso The gene for the third protein zzso has not been zzso This study examined the relationship between the zzso protein and the gene for zzso a zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso occurs in zzso zzso cloned from bovine zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence makes up the zzso zzso of the deduced sequence of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso reacted with intact zzso zzso with zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso distinct from zzso and zzso zzso zzso not modified with zzso zzso were also detected in several zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed zzso transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in numerous zzso with the zzso transcript enriched in zzso zzso zzso protection analysis detected several protected zzso zzso fragments, suggesting alternate zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that the full-length translation product of the gene producing zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso also present in many zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso The multiple size protein products of this gene appear to result from in zzso zzso processing and/or alternative zzso of zzso The name zzso is proposed for this gene and its zzso
