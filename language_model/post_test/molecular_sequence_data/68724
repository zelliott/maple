zzso zzso zzso can be engineered to cleave target zzso of choice in a zzso manner zzso zzso they could be used to inhibit virus replication or to zzso host gene function in zzso However, zzso that are zzso in zzso are generally disappointing when zzso in cells unless expressed at high levels relative to their target zzso zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that this can be overcome by zzso zzso structure using cellular rather than zzso zzso We show that zzso of relatively long zzso complementary regions zzso while poor zzso in zzso can produce profound zzso of zzso replication in zzso By examining a series of zzso in which the zzso vary from 9 to zzso zzso we establish that the optimum length for activity in the cell is zzso or zzso 33 zzso
