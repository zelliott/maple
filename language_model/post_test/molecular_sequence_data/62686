Many surface proteins of zzso bacteria, which play important roles during the zzso of human infections, are anchored to the cell wall envelope by a mechanism requiring zzso zzso B, a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso sorting signal of zzso at the zzso motif and zzso the zzso to the zzso cell wall zzso During zzso the active site zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso form an zzso zzso which is then resolved by the zzso group of zzso zzso We report here the crystal structures of zzso in complex with two active site zzso zzso and zzso and with the cell wall zzso analog zzso These structures zzso for the first time, the active site disposition and the unique zzso zzso machinery of the zzso zzso and they also provide useful information for the future design of zzso agents against zzso
