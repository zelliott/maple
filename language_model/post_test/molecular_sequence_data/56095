zzso zzso from a zzso with mild osteogenesis imperfecta zzso I) zzso normal pro alpha zzso chains and shortened pro alpha zzso chains of zzso zzso The zzso collagen that contained the shortened alpha zzso chains was zzso unstable in that it was zzso at 30 degrees C by a mixture of zzso and zzso The zzso generating the shortened pro alpha zzso chains was shown to be a deletion of 19 base pairs from zzso to zzso of zzso 13 of the zzso gene by sequencing of zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso The same zzso was found in the zzso affected zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso demonstrated that about zzso of the zzso transcripts from the zzso zzso were spliced by zzso skipping from zzso 12 to zzso 14 and that about zzso of the zzso transcripts were normally zzso There was no evidence for use of cryptic zzso sites, even though two cryptic zzso sites had more favorable statistical scores and delta G degree 37 values than the new site that was created by the zzso and that was used for zzso of zzso of the transcripts into a normal zzso zzso of the results with observations on 17 previously reported zzso that produced zzso deletions of zzso acids from the zzso domain of zzso collagen indicated that deletions in the zzso half of the alpha zzso chain tended to produce milder zzso than similar deletions elsewhere in the alpha zzso or alpha zzso zzso
