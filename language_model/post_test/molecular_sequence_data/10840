zzso growth factors zzso are a family of zzso and zzso proteins that promote cell zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to be critical for their zzso The interaction of zzso growth zzso zzso or zzso using zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso was also shown to protect sequences in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and protected zzso products of zzso and zzso size were recovered by zzso affinity zzso suggesting that the zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso resides within an zzso zzso The zzso binding affinity of zzso zzso is reduced compared to zzso presumably due to the absence of zzso groups in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding domain shows that the majority of interacting zzso acids are contained within a zzso sequence that folds back upon itself (because of three zzso forming a triangular shaped cup of positive zzso The importance of zzso binding site zzso was investigated using three synthetic zzso mimics of the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso used to measure binding zzso demonstrated that a synthetic zzso analogous to the zzso binding site in zzso bound tightly to zzso zzso A zzso containing a zzso in place of zzso bound with considerably reduced zzso presumably due to the altered structure of the second turn in the binding zzso A zzso zzso expected to be zzso most similar to the triangular zzso binding site in zzso bound with the highest affinity to zzso zzso These data suggest the triangular zzso of the zzso binding site in zzso is critical for its interaction with zzso zzso Analysis of known zzso binding sites in 25 proteins using the zzso zzso show that these sites commonly contain zzso
