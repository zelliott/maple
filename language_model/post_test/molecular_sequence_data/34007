In order to investigate the zzso associated with binding of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso of the zzso acid sequence zzso at positions zzso on the zzso loop, and determined apparent zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso forms for the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso values for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased as compared with zzso suggesting that these zzso are associated with zzso zzso Of special interest is a property of zzso zzso its zzso efficiency for zzso was twice that for zzso indicating that the zzso zzso acts like a zzso zzso rather than a zzso The role of the zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso zzso was replaced with zzso zzso Y, I, A and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a zzso higher affinity for zzso and activity was largely lost in zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso showed a rather unique zzso zzso an increase in zzso concentration caused a decrease in initial zzso of the reaction zzso zzso This is the first report on the key zzso acid zzso responsible for zzso binding in zzso zzso
