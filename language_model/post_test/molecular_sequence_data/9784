Three sets of zzso were designed for zzso detection and differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first zzso zzso was designed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli based on their zzso zzso gene zzso The second zzso zzso based on the zzso gene zzso identified all tested reference strains of zzso zzso and also strains of that species which lack zzso zzso zzso The third zzso zzso based on the sequence of a cloned zzso zzso gene and the downstream open reading frame, identified all tested reference strains of zzso zzso The zzso will find immediate application in the rapid identification to species level of zzso The zzso combine with a protocol for zzso of total DNA from zzso samples to allow zzso zzso identification of zzso directly from zzso Of 20 clinical samples from which zzso had been zzso we detected zzso zzso in 17, zzso coli in 2, and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso These results were zzso with culture and zzso identification to species zzso zzso typing by zzso zzso length zzso of the zzso zzso gene detected identical zzso types in zzso DNA and the corresponding zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso stool samples gave no reaction with the zzso zzso These zzso zzso can rapidly define the zzso species zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
