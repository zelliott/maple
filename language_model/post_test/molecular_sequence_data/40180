zzso and zzso are zzso nuclear proteins zzso by zzso transcripts from the zzso zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso and contains an zzso interaction zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso interaction domain and a zzso zzso The zzso domain is a zzso domain identified in several nuclear proteins involved in zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso expression of genes present on zzso DNA in a zzso zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to characterize the DNA binding properties of full-length zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso associated with DNA whereas zzso did zzso The zzso zzso domain was essential for DNA zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso domain had no effect on DNA zzso zzso zzso associated with sequences containing zzso zzso Our results did not reveal any preference of zzso for bases zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso in a DNA sequence and spacing between zzso influenced zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso bind DNA in a cooperative zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso within the context of the zzso zzso We propose that the preference of zzso for zzso zzso provides a mechanism to target zzso to foreign DNA, including zzso DNA or viral DNA zzso most of which are zzso
