zzso 24 to 35 of T4 zzso zzso to the second and third strands of a region of zzso that is highly zzso in all known zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate the intrinsic propensity of these zzso acid zzso to form a defined structure they were added at the C zzso of the native zzso together with a zzso zzso Two crystal structures of this active, zzso protein were zzso to zzso and zzso resolution, zzso Even though the crystal conditions are similar, the appended sequence adopts very different secondary zzso In one case it is zzso structured and appears to extend through the zzso zzso perhaps in part adding an extra strand to the original zzso In the other crystal form the extension is largely zzso The formation of these alternative structures shows that the sequence does not have a strong intrinsic propensity to form a unique fold zzso zzso or zzso The results also suggest that structural conservation during evolution does not necessarily depend on sequence conservation or the conservation of folding zzso
