We demonstrated quantitative real-time zzso detection of DNA sequences using the liquid core optical ring zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a recently developed sensing platform that zzso zzso and zzso sensing technology with low detection limit and zzso detection zzso We analyzed zzso and theoretically the zzso response to a variety of DNA samples that had different strand lengths zzso zzso number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso to 10 zzso to evaluate the zzso sequence detection zzso In particular, we established the linear correlation between the zzso sensing signal and the zzso density, which allows us to accurately calculate the zzso density on the zzso It is found that the probe surface coverage was zzso and the extent of zzso was zzso The zzso curve for zzso probe and zzso target DNA yields a zzso constant of zzso zzso With a zzso zzso zzso detection of 10 zzso bulk DNA concentration was zzso The mass detection limit was estimated to be 4 zzso corresponding to a density of zzso zzso on the zzso We also showed that the zzso was sensitive enough to differentiate DNA with only a few zzso based on the raw sensing signal and kinetic zzso Our work will provide important insight into the zzso interaction at the ring zzso surface and lay a foundation for future zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso
