The hypothesis that a zzso zzso to the mouse zzso zzso virus zzso is involved in human breast cancer zzso has fascinated scientists from many years, but it has never been convincingly zzso zzso interest in this hypothesis developed when an zzso zzso zzso sequence was found in 38% of human breast cancer zzso Whereas some subsequent studies confirmed these findings, others did zzso The main reasons for this zzso among others, are the different sensitivities and technical details of current molecular approaches to the detection of these zzso This study is an attempt to find sensitive and zzso conditions capable of detecting zzso zzso sequence in human zzso To this end, we first developed a zzso zzso zzso method that was able to detect very low copies of the viral zzso and then screened a panel of 45 frozen breast cancer samples obtained by laser zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence was found in 15 zzso of the human breast zzso zzso whereas the same sequence was zzso neither in normal zzso nor in other types of zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso with the zzso zzso but no other significant similarities with the human zzso The combined use of frozen material, zzso cell populations and zzso provides a novel, sensitive, zzso zzso and fast methodology for the molecular detection of zzso This approach might be successfully used in large molecular studies that aim to investigate the hypothesis of a zzso zzso of human breast zzso
