zzso binding of zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso to the zzso group of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso being zzso A, or zzso has been zzso The extent of formation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso sequence contexts was significantly higher zzso and zzso zzso relative to that of the zzso zzso With the zzso sequence context, zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso When the reaction was allowed to proceed in the presence of zzso duplexes zzso of a zzso parent strand and a zzso zzso a significant increase in the extent of zzso formation was observed with zzso and zzso but not with zzso relative to those of the zzso zzso Independent of sequence context, no clear effect of zzso on zzso zzso binding to the opposite zzso in the complementary strand was zzso The level of zzso zzso binding to the zzso target in the zzso zzso is in general higher in zzso sequences than in the zzso With zzso and zzso for instance, zzso yields were 3- and zzso higher, zzso The zzso stability of the zzso zzso in the zzso duplex zzso of a zzso parent strand and a full zzso was substantially higher than in the zzso sequence zzso The stimulating effect of zzso zzso on the formation of DNA zzso of zzso has previously been demonstrated in other experimental zzso The increase in yield could possibly be rationalized in terms of zzso of the zzso ring system with the zzso prior to the zzso addition reaction of the zzso zzso zzso The results from induced circular zzso studies with the zzso zzso in the zzso duplex are consistent with substantial zzso of zzso zzso including both external minor zzso and zzso zzso
