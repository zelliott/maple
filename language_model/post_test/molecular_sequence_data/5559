The zzso zzso zzso species strain zzso harbors an zzso zzso zzso with a single open reading zzso Previously published analyses of the DNA sequence of zzso suggested that it may replicate by a zzso zzso replication zzso and this report provides experimental evidence supporting this zzso zzso zzso DNA accumulates in strain zzso as evidenced by the facts that this DNA bound to zzso zzso under zzso conditions, was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to only one of two zzso DNA zzso specific for each strand of the zzso The DNA zzso the open reading frame was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and gave a protein with a molecular mass of 26 zzso similar to that deduced by sequence zzso This protein bound to a zzso of zzso that contains a putative zzso replication region in a zzso reaction and made this zzso sensitive to zzso zzso zzso It did not cause this same zzso zzso sensitivity in the remainder of zzso This activity on zzso DNA suggests that this protein plays a role in zzso zzso
