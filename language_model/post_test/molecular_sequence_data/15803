The structure of a zzso Da zzso generated from bovine lens zzso zzso of 20,000 Da using zzso zzso zzso was studied by sequence analysis of a 30,000 Da zzso zzso Three zzso components were simultaneously zzso in the zzso 30,000 Da fragment, corresponding to zzso of the alpha A chain, and His zzso and zzso zzso of the alpha B zzso The relative proportions of the components suggests that the three zzso are present in zzso zzso It is concluded that the 30,000 Da zzso and, therefore, the zzso Da zzso is constructed of both the A and B zzso chains zzso zzso with zzso zzso At least one of these zzso is present towards the zzso of the A and B chains after zzso and zzso zzso
