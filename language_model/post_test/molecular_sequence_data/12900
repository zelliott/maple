A zzso protein of the zzso C virus zzso zzso contains zzso acid sequence motifs characteristic of zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding activity of the zzso protein with an apparent zzso constant of 2 zzso zzso M was detected using a zzso zzso Competitive zzso binding analysis suggested that the zzso protein binds zzso to the zzso zzso which is located at the 3' end of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein revealed the possibility that both the zzso zzso region and the zzso region were necessary for full zzso binding zzso
