We report in this work on the zzso of zzso energy as a tool to speed the zzso labeling of proteins using the zzso zzso The first part of the decoupling zzso zzso protein zzso reduction, zzso and zzso is done in 8 zzso under the effects of an zzso field whilst the second part, the zzso zzso was zzso with and without the use of zzso zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that the zzso labeling in a decoupling procedure cannot be accelerated using an zzso zzso
