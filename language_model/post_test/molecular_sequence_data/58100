zzso is a very early zzso zzso of T zzso It is a cell surface zzso that can only be detected after stimulation of zzso Despite extensive studies on its zzso activities, little is known about its molecular zzso To investigate the latter in more detail, we have cloned a zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its expression in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of clone zzso is zzso zzso in length and contains a single open reading frame of 600 zzso zzso a protein of 199 zzso zzso The predicted molecular mass of zzso Da could be confirmed by in zzso zzso The protein contains a zzso zzso region between zzso acids 41 and 61 but no zzso signal zzso which suggests that it is a type II membrane zzso It has one potential zzso site at zzso acid zzso Two zzso forms of 26 to 28 zzso and 32 to 34 zzso were detected both in zzso zzso cells and in in zzso translation in the presence of canine zzso zzso K degradation of the zzso part after in zzso protein synthesis supports the view of zzso being a type II integral membrane protein with the zzso 40 zzso acids in the zzso a zzso domain of 21 zzso zzso and zzso 138 zzso acids as the zzso zzso zzso searches revealed sequence similarity with members of a zzso family of type II integral membrane proteins with a zzso zzso domain, indicating that zzso is involved in signal zzso
