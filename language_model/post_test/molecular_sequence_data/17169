zzso zzso is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle zzso This gene has previously been implicated in the double zzso zzso in mice and zzso A systematic analysis of myostatin sequence evolution in zzso was performed in a zzso zzso The myostatin coding sequence was determined from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso to synonymous zzso substitution rate ratios zzso indicates that positive selection may have been operating on this gene during the time of divergence of zzso and zzso starting from approximately 23 million years ago, a period that appears to account for most of the sequence difference between myostatin in these zzso These periods of positive selective pressure on myostatin may correlate with changes in skeletal muscle mass during the same zzso
