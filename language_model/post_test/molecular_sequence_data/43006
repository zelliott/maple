zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso expressing a zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso gene are rendered sensitive to the zzso drug, zzso The bystander effect refers to the observation that not all cells need be zzso to eradicate the cell population by treatment with zzso We demonstrate that zzso cooperation can account for this bystander zzso When zzso human zzso cells marked with a zzso gene zzso were zzso with zzso cells zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso at a density at which the majority of cells were in zzso both zzso and zzso cells were killed by zzso When cells were zzso at a low density where the majority of cells are not in contact with one another, however, only the zzso cells were zzso This result suggests that cell contact with zzso cells is necessary to render the zzso zzso cells sensitive to zzso Because involvement of zzso cooperation in the killing of the zzso cells would require not only contact between zzso and zzso cells but also the capacity to transfer small zzso molecules from the former cell to the latter, transfer of radioactive molecules between the two cell lines was assessed by zzso after treatment of a zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells incorporated the labeled zzso into their zzso whereas isolated zzso cells did zzso zzso cells incorporated zzso only when in contact with zzso zzso These findings indicate that a zzso zzso product, presumably a zzso form, can pass from zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells and mediate zzso as a consequence of direct zzso
