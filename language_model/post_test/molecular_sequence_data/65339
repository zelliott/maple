zzso zzso are an abundant class of zzso zzso small zzso zzso that are thought to control gene expression by targeting zzso for degradation or zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso gene regulation represents a fundamental layer of genetic zzso at the zzso level and has diverse functional roles in zzso Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms by which zzso regulate gene zzso with specific focus on the role of zzso in regulating the development of immune cells and in modulating innate and zzso immune zzso
