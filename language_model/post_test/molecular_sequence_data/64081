zzso factor 1 is a zzso factor composed of zzso and zzso It plays an important role in the signal zzso of cell response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a high zzso and cold adaptation species living only at zzso m above sea level on the zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso of plateau zzso was cloned and its expression in various zzso was zzso The results indicated that plateau zzso zzso zzso was highly identical to those of the human zzso bovine zzso mouse zzso and Norway rat zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso identities with those of the human, zzso house zzso and Norway zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses detected two zzso named zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was highly expressed in the brain and zzso and much less in the heart, zzso liver, muscle, and zzso which was quite different from the expression pattern of mouse zzso Meanwhile, a new zzso of plateau zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso and zzso The deduced zzso composed of 536 zzso zzso lacks a part of the zzso degradation domain zzso both zzso zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso signal motif zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the zzso adaptation to zzso especially in brain and zzso and zzso zzso function pattern may be different from that of mouse zzso Furthermore, for the high ratio of zzso zzso among the animals, the zzso gene may be a good zzso performer in recovering the true zzso relationships among zzso
