It has been reported that zzso zzso possesses a very high level of zzso activity, but the regulation of zzso expression has not been investigated zzso In zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso it has been demonstrated that zzso is a positive regulator of hydrogen zzso zzso including the gene zzso zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned and used to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso confirming its identity and zzso The gene was zzso by inserting a zzso resistance cassette and used to make a knockout zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso In contrast to zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso activity and was more resistant to hydrogen zzso killing than the wild zzso These data are consistent with zzso in zzso zzso acting as a zzso of zzso zzso
