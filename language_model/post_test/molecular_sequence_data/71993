A zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso of pea zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has the zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso It is very similar to zzso a zzso induced during seed zzso in common zzso zzso zzso levels increase during the zzso of zzso pea zzso and are totally suppressed by treatment with zzso zzso In zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso distribution in zzso pea zzso is different from that of previously reported zzso induced during zzso suggesting the involvement of different zzso in the zzso of proteins from zzso pea zzso zzso is also induced during the zzso of pea seeds, indicating that a single zzso gene can be induced during two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which require protein zzso
