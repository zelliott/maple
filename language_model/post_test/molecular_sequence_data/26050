The zzso is a major cell type of the body, and in zzso zzso have potential for future gene targeting and drug zzso Despite the importance of zzso in cell biology and medicine, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso gene zzso Here, we report the first detailed characterization of the sequences and factors controlling expression of a human gene expressed specifically in zzso Using zzso upstream sequence of the human zzso zzso gene coupled to one of two reporter zzso we examined sequences necessary and sufficient for expression of zzso in both cultured human zzso and in zzso active zzso zzso of transgenic mouse zzso We demonstrated the existence of zzso and zzso elements located zzso from the zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso which when combined with a zzso box element, appear to act in concert to drive zzso zzso We examined the zzso region in zzso After using zzso zzso to narrow a zzso zzso element to within 110 zzso we demonstrated the existence of a zzso nuclear factor which binds to a zzso zzso zzso within this zzso Using zzso interference analysis, we identified the G zzso important for factor zzso and showed that point zzso in these G zzso not only blocked factor binding but also resulted in decreased zzso activity of an zzso zzso The factor was most abundant in zzso was expressed at lower levels in some simple zzso cell lines, and was not detected in zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso sequence was similar to sequences found in the zzso upstream sequences of several other genes expressed in zzso and at least one of these zzso the human zzso zzso contained a sequence that zzso with the zzso zzso element for binding zzso zzso our data suggest that both the sequence and the nuclear factor that we have identified may be involved in controlling zzso expression in zzso and in zzso
