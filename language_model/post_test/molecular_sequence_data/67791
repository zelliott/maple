To determine the complete zzso sequence of the zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso from a clinical zzso zzso strain that was isolated from a urinary tract infection in 1969 in a French hospital and compare it with those of contemporary emerging zzso zzso 

The zzso was zzso and zzso using a zzso sequencing zzso After draft zzso additional zzso and walking reads were performed for gap zzso zzso comparisons and multiple alignments with other zzso plasmids were done using the zzso zzso and zzso W, zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a shared zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso with current members of the zzso zzso resistance zzso family that are widely zzso zzso resistance zzso Nevertheless, two specific zzso resistance gene zzso probably acquired from other genetic elements were identified inserted at zzso hotspot zzso sites in the zzso zzso A novel zzso named zzso showed an zzso mixed zzso zzso composed of two mercury resistance zzso and two zzso zzso that are related to zzso and zzso respectively, and an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resistance plasmids have a broad host range and have been implicated in the dissemination of zzso resistance among zzso from humans and zzso This typical zzso genetic scaffold appears to carry various zzso resistance gene zzso and is now also a successful vehicle for spreading zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso
