The gene for an zzso cloned from strain zzso of zzso zzso was used to examine to what extent the corresponding genes are structurally similar in other zzso zzso zzso The structure of the gene itself was almost identical in zzso and a group of strains represented by strain zzso The gene was not detected at all in strain zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the structure of zzso zzso and zzso pattern of the zzso proteins indicates that strains zzso and zzso are closely related to each other, whereas strain 799 is zzso very distant from the zzso We estimate that strain 799 separated from zzso and zzso some zzso million years zzso zzso sequencing of the region containing the zzso gene from strains zzso and 799 revealed the presence of a zzso stretch that was highly similar in the two zzso Furthermore, comparison of the restriction map surrounding the zzso gene of zzso with that of a corresponding region in zzso indicated that the former strain contained an extra segment zzso zzso in zzso which included the zzso stretch mentioned zzso This segment was missing in zzso It thus appears that the zzso gene was brought into strains zzso and 799 from outside despite a large zzso zzso
