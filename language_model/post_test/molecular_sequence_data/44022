The application of detailed structural data bases has now culminated in the successful design of a new generation of zzso that form zzso DNA complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ling, zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso zzso zzso were designed to bind to DNA in complexes resembling those of zzso zzso at adjacent zzso The goal of the work described here was to zzso with X-ray zzso if a potent member of this newly designed and zzso class of zzso zzso binds as zzso zzso is composed of two zzso zzso linked zzso to zzso by a zzso zzso We have solved the zzso A X-ray crystal structure of a complex of zzso bound to zzso We zzso on a detailed molecular level, that the zzso design strategy is a zzso The structures of zzso and two zzso molecules bound to zzso provide the unprecedented opportunity for detailed comparison of zzso and zzso complexes of the same zzso allowing us to distinguish effects of zzso from those of zzso zzso are focused primarily in the centers of the zzso DNA unwinding and other zzso zzso zzso more efficiently to the center of the zzso complex than to the center of the zzso zzso
