The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex that carries out zzso zzso zzso It is composed of a peripheral zzso domain that zzso zzso and an integral zzso domain that zzso zzso zzso a is a zzso integral membrane protein zzso of zzso that possesses an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso domain functions in zzso zzso the zzso domain is critical for zzso targeting and regulation of zzso zzso Despite its importance, there is currently no high resolution structure for zzso a of the zzso Recently, the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the related zzso I from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso We have used zzso modeling to construct a model of the zzso domain of zzso one of two zzso of zzso a expressed in zzso To test this model, unique zzso zzso were introduced into a zzso form of zzso and their accessibility to modification by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition, accessibility of introduced zzso zzso to zzso modification was compared in the zzso complex and the free zzso domain to identify zzso protected from modification by the presence of zzso The results provide an experimental test of the proposed model and have identified regions of the zzso domain of zzso a that likely serve as zzso contact sites with the peripheral zzso zzso The possible significance of these results for in zzso regulation of zzso assembly is zzso
