In the zzso study of the zzso vaccine trial, the levels of zzso to the zzso region of the zzso envelope zzso were found to correlate zzso with risk of zzso zzso This recent demonstration of the potential role of zzso as a vaccine target has catapulted this region into the focus of zzso zzso We previously described seven human zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso individuals that are directed against zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, using zzso of zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso we mapped the zzso of these seven zzso All tested zzso demonstrated a similar binding pattern in which three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding of at least six of the seven zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of six or all of the zzso was reduced to zzso of zzso by single zzso at seven positions zzso 180, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while one change, zzso increased the binding of all zzso When mapped onto a model of zzso our results suggest that the zzso of the zzso V2 zzso is located mostly in the zzso region of the available crystal structure of zzso overlapping and surrounding the zzso binding site on zzso
