The zzso zzso zzso zzso can invade several types of normally zzso zzso zzso into cultured zzso cells requires the expression of zzso the first gene of an zzso zzso two zzso zzso which encodes zzso an zzso zzso and zzso which encodes a zzso zzso Several genes zzso to zzso are detected in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is one of zzso We have assessed the role of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso by constructing zzso zzso deletion zzso in the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that: zzso zzso is required for entry of zzso zzso into zzso but not into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a surface zzso zzso zzso plays a role for entry into some zzso cell zzso These results provide the first insight into the cell zzso displayed by zzso zzso
