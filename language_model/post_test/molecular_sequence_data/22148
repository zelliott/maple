The zzso zzso a category that includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a family of very promising zzso zzso compounds and are typically produced by soil zzso The zzso gene clusters for these zzso have been previously investigated, revealing the presence of highly similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso screening with several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to contain a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library screening using the zzso zzso gene probe identified a positive zzso zzso which contained a DNA zzso of approximately zzso zzso The complete sequencing of this DNA zzso revealed a total of seven complete and two incomplete open reading zzso which were found to be highly similar, but still unique, when compared to previously known zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso screening approach may constitute an efficient method for the isolation of potentially valuable cryptic zzso zzso gene clusters from various rare zzso
