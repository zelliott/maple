Three genes zzso a zzso synthetic system of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso coli clone produced zzso zzso The zzso newly designated as zzso were zzso with zzso genes of zzso zzso All of zzso zzso and zzso genes were essential for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso instead of zzso to the zzso medium resulted in an increase in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene in zzso coli cells harboring zzso genes increased both the zzso production and zzso content in the zzso The zzso produced by the zzso coli clone was higher in average molecular size than that produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso
