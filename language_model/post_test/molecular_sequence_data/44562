We have examined whether the zzso zzso zzso protein suppressed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and in the zzso gene of the shuttle zzso zzso zzso We used human zzso zzso cells, in which wild type zzso zzso protein was induced by treatment with zzso The induction of zzso zzso protein suppressed zzso zzso but not spontaneous zzso in the zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso induced by zzso of the zzso was also significantly lower in cells with induced zzso zzso protein than in the zzso zzso In addition, we found that frequency of G : C to A : T transition zzso which occurred at the 3' base pair of zzso sites were significantly lower in the cells with induced zzso zzso protein than in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso protein may play roles in modulating DNA repair pathway, resulting in the suppression of zzso zzso
