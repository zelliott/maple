zzso peptides zzso zzso by the innate immune system are prevalent as the effective zzso of defense to overcome recurring microbial zzso They have been widely accepted as the zzso for the development of new zzso agents for the treatment of drug resistant zzso However, there is also a growing concern that zzso with a sequence that is too close to the host zzso zzso may inevitably compromise its own natural zzso In this study, we design a series of synthetic zzso short zzso zzso to expand the arsenal of the zzso families and to gain further insights on their zzso zzso These zzso and zzso peptides have a general sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the number of repeat zzso and are designed to mimic the folding behavior of the zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso with 3 repeat units, zzso zzso and zzso are found to be more selective towards microbial cells than rat red blood cells, with minimum zzso concentration zzso values that are more than 10 times lower than their 50% zzso zzso zzso They are effective against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the studies using scanning electron zzso zzso have zzso that these peptides possess zzso activities against microbial zzso Furthermore, zzso immune stimulation zzso of a typical zzso shows negligible zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human peripheral blood zzso cells, which implies additional safety aspects of the zzso for both systemic and topical zzso zzso the peptides designed in this study can be promising zzso agents against the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
