zzso disease, zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso are diseases of the zzso central nervous system that involve the conversion of a cellular protein into an zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that the precursor protein contains mainly zzso and zzso zzso whereas the prion zzso is largely in the beta zzso The zzso prion is resistant to zzso and zzso zzso and can promote the conversion of the precursor protein to the zzso zzso These properties have yet to be explained in terms of the structural zzso of the zzso In the present study, molecular zzso showed that prion proteins could adopt the zzso zzso which has been established for a number of zzso proteins and has been suggested previously as the basis of zzso zzso The zzso zzso provides explanations for the zzso and zzso stability of zzso their ability to form templates for the transmission of pathological zzso and the existence of zzso strains of the prion zzso
