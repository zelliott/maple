zzso has an important role in zzso syndromes and zzso A recent report zzso et zzso zzso zzso proposed that the zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso in zzso and zzso through a mechanism that involves its association to the inner zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso to zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso and eliminate active zzso This model implies that the control of zzso sensitivity to zzso stimuli is governed by the zzso complex in the zzso zzso space and, more generally, that zzso proteins can control zzso zzso zzso from inside the zzso Further, it defines a novel, zzso zzso zzso for zzso In this study, we present evidence that, in zzso the activity of zzso cannot be mechanistically coupled to zzso because the two proteins are confined in distinct cellular compartments and their interaction in zzso is an zzso We also show by sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction that zzso is extremely unlikely to be a zzso protein because it lacks zzso zzso zzso These results indicate a different function and mechanism of zzso in zzso and zzso the question of whether zzso zzso in addition to zzso regulates zzso stress response through zzso zzso
