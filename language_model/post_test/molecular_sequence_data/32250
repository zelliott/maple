The extinct zzso zzso zzso zzso was a large type of cattle that ranged over almost the whole zzso zzso The zzso is the wild zzso of modern zzso but it is unclear whether European zzso contributed to this zzso To provide new insights into the demographic history of zzso and domestic zzso we have generated zzso zzso DNA sequences from 59 archaeological skeletal finds, which were attributed to wild European cattle populations based on their zzso date and/or zzso All zzso zzso belonged to the previously designated P zzso indicating that this represents the Late zzso Central European zzso We also report one new and highly divergent zzso in a Neolithic zzso sample from Germany, which points to greater zzso during the zzso Furthermore, the Neolithic and Bronze Age samples that were classified with confidence as European zzso using zzso criteria all carry P zzso zzso DNA, suggesting continuity of Late zzso and Early zzso zzso populations in zzso zzso analysis indicates that recent population growth gives a significantly better fit to our data than a zzso population, an observation consistent with a zzso expansion scenario, possibly from a single European zzso zzso Previous work has shown that most ancient and modern European domestic cattle carry zzso previously designated zzso This, in combination with our new finding of a T zzso in a very Early Neolithic site in Syria, lends persuasive support to a scenario zzso zzso Near Eastern domestic zzso carrying predominantly T zzso replaced P zzso robust zzso zzso populations in Europe, from the Early Neolithic zzso During the period of coexistence, it appears that domestic cattle were kept separate from wild zzso and zzso was extremely zzso
