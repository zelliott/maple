We have isolated two overlapping zzso zzso clones from a zzso zzso library containing 25 zzso of the human zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso human zzso zzso clone of zzso zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of the entire structural gene and the zzso clone were zzso The human zzso gene spans zzso zzso and its sequence organization with four zzso and three zzso is zzso to the chicken zzso gene and the human zzso zzso Human and chicken zzso genes differ mainly in the size of their zzso and 3' zzso zzso Four zzso repetitive elements were found in the human zzso zzso one in each zzso and one on the fourth zzso zzso transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size were detected in human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and surprisingly in human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso gene locus was assigned to human zzso 12 by zzso to a panel of zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso
