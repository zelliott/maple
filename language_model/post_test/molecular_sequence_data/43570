The gene zzso green fluorescent protein zzso from zzso zzso was zzso to adapt its zzso usage for expression in plants by increasing the frequency of zzso with a C or a G in the third position from 32 to zzso The strategy for constructing the synthetic zzso gene was based on the overlap extension zzso method using 12 long zzso as the starting material and as zzso The new gene contains 101 silent zzso changes compared to its zzso counterpart used in this zzso Several transgenic tobacco lines containing the zzso zzso gene contained minute amounts of a smaller protein zzso with zzso zzso whereas only one protein of the expected size was found in zzso with the synthetic zzso zzso The smaller protein was probably zzso by a truncated zzso zzso created by zzso of a 84 zzso cryptic zzso as detected by a reverse zzso zzso A comparison of zzso production in zzso with the zzso and the synthetic zzso gene under the control of the enhanced zzso zzso promoter showed that the large-scale zzso in the zzso gene increased the frequency of high zzso in the transgenic population but hardly changed the maximum zzso zzso The latter phenomenon may be attributed to a reduced zzso capacity of transformed cells with higher zzso zzso
