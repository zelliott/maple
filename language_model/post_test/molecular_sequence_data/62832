zzso zzso is executed by the zzso a complex of small nuclear zzso zzso and numerous zzso One such zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso zzso and box zzso small zzso zzso particles zzso which act during zzso zzso zzso zzso As such, it is the first zzso factor to be identified in two functionally distinct zzso zzso binds to an internal zzso zzso structure in the zzso zzso and two such structures in the zzso zzso Previous work has concentrated on the structural basis of the interaction of zzso with the zzso and has been carried out in zzso Here we present a functional analysis of zzso in zzso using a zzso zzso zzso strain to investigate the basis of three lethal zzso in zzso zzso Two are point zzso that map to the zzso domain, and the third is a zzso zzso These zzso result in zzso of zzso zzso confirming a role for zzso in zzso zzso In addition, these zzso also display zzso processing defects that are variable in zzso Analysis of one zzso in the zzso domain reveals a reduction in the levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and box zzso zzso but not zzso zzso supporting a role for zzso in zzso and/or maintenance of specific zzso The zzso in the zzso domain exhibit differential binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that there are differences in the mode of interaction of zzso with these two zzso
