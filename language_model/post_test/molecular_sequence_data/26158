This paper describes regulatory sequences responsible for the control of human zzso 1 beta gene expression in cells of the zzso zzso zzso plasmids containing different regions of the zzso 1 beta gene and the bacterial zzso zzso gene were zzso into human zzso zzso or zzso zzso After treatment with zzso which triggers cell zzso we have identified an zzso sequence which mediates the induction of gene activity by zzso The zzso approximately 180 base pairs long, is located between positions zzso and zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso Further analysis has shown that 132 base pairs immediately upstream from the start site of zzso are sufficient to promote zzso expression of the zzso Additional promoter zzso located within the first zzso maximize the level of gene zzso Although activated zzso and zzso are the main producers of zzso 1 zzso both the zzso and the zzso promoter can function in zzso cells as well as in zzso zzso zzso
