zzso the relative zzso of proteins in biological systems is an important aspect of zzso zzso provides the possibility to unravel the often subtle molecular differences that regulate biological processes in cells and zzso A common method to analyze differences in protein expression in complex samples is differential stable zzso labeling combined with zzso zzso In such experiments, proteins or peptides from different samples are labeled with different stable zzso and their relative amounts are determined from the zzso zzso zzso using mass zzso When human tissue samples are investigated, chemical stable isotope labeling strategies instead of zzso labeling strategies are zzso However, biological variation in protein expression between individuals is a key zzso we describe a method that allows for fully automated quantitative zzso zzso involving zzso triplex stable zzso zzso labeling and zzso strong zzso zzso phase separation of peptides prior to mass zzso analysis that can be applied to complex samples such as human tissue zzso We highlight the zzso of the method by characterizing the extent of biological variation between the zzso of primary human zzso from three healthy zzso Using our method we were able to zzso 967 proteins with a minimum of 2 zzso revealing very limited biological variation between the zzso The discovery is noteworthy considering the presence of significant zzso zzso activity, originating primarily from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso represents the largest quantitative zzso for human zzso zzso which was made possible by the use of an automated labeling zzso
