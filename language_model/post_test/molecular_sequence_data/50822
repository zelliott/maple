The expression of the rat cellular zzso binding protein I zzso can be zzso in zzso by zzso acid zzso Here we have analyzed the zzso promoter region and compared it to the corresponding mouse zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso region has been highly zzso between rat and zzso including a zzso response element zzso approximately 1 zzso upstream of the start of zzso The zzso is of the direct repeat type with a two zzso zzso Like other direct repeat zzso this response element is activated by zzso alpha and beta but not by zzso gamma zzso Furthermore, the zzso is most effectively activated when both zzso and zzso are zzso In addition zzso zzso are required for efficient binding to the zzso while zzso or zzso alone do not interact effectively with this response zzso The zzso gene is therefore most likely activated in zzso by a zzso zzso
