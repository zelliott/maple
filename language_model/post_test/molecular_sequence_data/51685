zzso zzso is the key zzso for zzso of zzso the major soluble zzso in resting cells of zzso This zzso was zzso from a strain of zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso It was found to be a zzso protein of 630 zzso zzso zzso were raised against its smallest zzso zzso zzso and used for screening a zzso zzso zzso This yielded an zzso zzso clone of zzso zzso containing an open reading frame of zzso base zzso Its zzso called zzso (for zzso zzso was represented by a single gene in the zzso zzso and was found to be almost identical with the recently zzso zzso a gene important for carbon zzso zzso believed to be zzso with zzso A zzso obtained by disruption of zzso had a very low activity of zzso zzso indicating that zzso is an important component of the zzso The zzso also showed a growth zzso when transferred from zzso to zzso a zzso similar to that of the zzso and zzso zzso deficient in carbon zzso zzso Thus, the smallest zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have, in addition, a central regulatory role in the zzso metabolism of zzso
