zzso frogs of the zzso zzso are of zzso distribution, and are so called due to the foul smell of their defensive skin zzso released from specialized skin zzso following stress or zzso zzso Here we report the application of a zzso skin zzso zzso library cloning technique which can rapidly zzso identification of zzso zzso zzso From a library constructed from the skin zzso of the Large Chinese zzso frog, zzso zzso zzso we have identified four novel peptides whose primary structures were deduced initially from cloned zzso zzso mature peptides were located in and structurally characterized from reverse phase zzso zzso of skin zzso Named zzso zzso these were found to be structural zzso of known zzso zzso families from zzso zzso Rapid identification of novel peptides can thus be rapidly achieved using this zzso zzso technology and the extensive similarities revealed between zzso zzso precursor organization and zzso acid sequences would lend support to the hypothesis that they have a common ancestral zzso
