We have previously shown that some strains of the zzso coronavirus mouse zzso virus zzso zzso an additional zzso species zzso zzso previously called zzso zzso with a size intermediate between that of zzso 2 and 3, suggesting the presence of an optional zzso initiation zzso This zzso start is dependent on the leader sequence of the virus zzso To study the mechanism of coronavirus zzso regulation, we have cloned and zzso the region of the viral zzso corresponding to the zzso unique coding region of zzso 2 of the zzso strain of zzso In addition to the open reading frame zzso predicted to zzso the viral zzso protein zzso a second complete ORF, with the potential to zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso initiation sites of both zzso zzso (formerly called zzso 2) and zzso zzso were determined by primer extension studies and zzso zzso The data indicated that zzso of zzso zzso initiated at a site, zzso that resembled the consensus zzso zzso In contrast, the start signal of the optional zzso zzso zzso deviated from the consensus zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso as shown by in zzso translation studies of zzso and zzso zzso and by the detection of an additional viral structural zzso zzso in the zzso strain that zzso this zzso Although the zzso strain of zzso was found to retain zzso zzso it lacked the correct zzso and zzso start signals for this zzso This study has therefore identified an optional gene product for zzso zzso and provided insights into the mechanism of regulation of zzso zzso zzso
