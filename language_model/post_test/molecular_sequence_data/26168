We have examined a panel of zzso zzso B zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso B cells separated into zzso on the basis of expression of the zzso surface zzso for their ability to produce zzso Where possible, we have used a combination of zzso detection methods in order to compensate for differences in sensitivity and zzso and the possibility of zzso masking an zzso All the zzso tested were shown to zzso express zzso and zzso In addition, varying levels of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso in most of the zzso and zzso of one zzso zzso additionally produced varying levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso normal zzso and zzso zzso B cells, were also shown to express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and very low levels of zzso following stimulation with zzso These data were supported by the detection of zzso and zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and zzso B cells using specific zzso None of the zzso or B cell preparations produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The purity of our normal B cell populations was assessed by zzso analysis on the zzso and also by the disappearance of certain zzso transcripts after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso most of which could be detected in zzso total zzso cell zzso This suggested that our B cell zzso method had reduced, to a level zzso in our zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression by zzso zzso and zzso B cells reduced the concern that zzso zzso mast cells could account for the observed zzso zzso We therefore believe our data provide strong support for production of a subset of zzso by zzso normal B zzso Both the zzso B zzso and normal zzso and zzso B cells appear capable of expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
