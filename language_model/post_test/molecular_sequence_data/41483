zzso is a zzso zzso zzso existing universally in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso can also locate on the cell surface and bind to zzso via which contributing to the zzso surface zzso of the bacterial pathogens and assisting the invasion into the host zzso The functions of the zzso zzso on the cell surface expression (including T cells, B cells, zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso are not zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2, zzso is an important zzso pathogen which has recently caused two large-scale outbreaks in southern China with severe zzso toxic shock syndrome zzso never seen before in human zzso We recently identified the zzso zzso as an important protective zzso which could protect mice from fatal zzso 2 zzso In this study, a zzso structure of the zzso zzso is zzso revealing an zzso arrangement in the zzso We further demonstrated that the zzso exists exclusively as an zzso in solution via a zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso is the biological unit of zzso zzso at least in zzso and most likely in zzso as zzso This is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive characterization of the zzso zzso zzso both structurally and zzso and the second zzso zzso structure in addition to that of zzso zzso We also investigated the zzso binding property of the zzso zzso
