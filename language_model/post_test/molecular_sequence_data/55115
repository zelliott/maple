The two related basic zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso protein zzso are present in blood and zzso zzso While their crucial role in early zzso is well established, their function in zzso cells and especially in zzso is less zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso which encodes a major regulator of zzso as a direct zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of any of the three zzso factors in human blood and zzso zzso cells caused zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso showed that the full activity of the zzso promoter required the integrity of a highly zzso zzso composite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso occupied this region of zzso promoter in human zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso played a central role in assembling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso The resulting complexes were able to activate zzso zzso expression in zzso cells as well as in zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso gene zzso during zzso concurred with the zzso of zzso and zzso Altogether, we identified zzso as a bona fide target gene of zzso with zzso and/or zzso highlighting a new function of the three zzso factors in the zzso zzso
