zzso western zzso virus relies on the zzso zzso zzso for its transmission in a persistent and zzso zzso To be zzso the virus must cross the zzso and the accessory zzso zzso zzso barriers by a zzso mechanism where zzso receptors interact with zzso The zzso and the zzso viral zzso implicated in this interaction mechanism have been zzso In this paper, we report that the coat and the zzso proteins that constitute the zzso of this virus are zzso zzso of the zzso core of these structural viral proteins by zzso with sodium zzso or zzso with zzso F or zzso abrogates the zzso transmission of the zzso zzso transmission could also be inhibited by zzso directed against zzso when zzso were allowed to acquire virus on artificial zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso proteins of beet western zzso virus contain zzso zzso that are implicated in zzso interaction and promote zzso transmission of the zzso
