Using chemical zzso zzso of zzso zzso that were defective in fatty acid synthesis were selected based on their growth requirements on saturated fatty acid zzso One zzso zzso was incapable of zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso A genetic analysis demonstrated that the zzso strain had a double zzso affecting fatty acid synthesis and zzso A zzso with a zzso in zzso synthesis zzso displayed normal growth characteristics in the temperature range of zzso through a zzso of the cellular fatty acid zzso Compared with the parental strain, this zzso zzso had increased sensitivity at low and high temperatures (15 and zzso zzso with an increased tolerance to zzso zzso The responses to ethanol stress were similar for the parental and zzso zzso zzso acid was also determined to play an essential role in the cell growth of zzso zzso These findings suggest that both the type of cellular fatty acids and the composition of fatty acids might be involved in the stress responsive mechanisms in this industrially important zzso
