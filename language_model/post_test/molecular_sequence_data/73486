Tomato golden mosaic virus, a member of the zzso family, has a zzso DNA zzso that is zzso and transcribed in infected plant cells through the concerted action of viral and host zzso One viral zzso zzso contributes to both processes by binding to a directly zzso zzso DNA sequence located in the overlapping zzso strand origin of replication and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which occurs as a zzso complex in solution, also zzso DNA zzso during initiation of rolling circle zzso To identify the tomato golden mosaic virus zzso zzso that mediate protein zzso DNA zzso and DNA zzso a series of truncated zzso proteins were produced in a zzso expression system and zzso for each zzso These experiments localized the zzso zzso domain between zzso acids 121 and zzso the DNA binding domain between zzso acids 1 and zzso and the DNA zzso domain between zzso acids 1 and zzso zzso of the first 29 zzso acids of zzso abolished DNA binding and DNA zzso demonstrating that an intact N zzso is required for both zzso The observation that the DNA binding domain includes the zzso domain suggested that zzso protein interaction may be a prerequisite for DNA binding but not for DNA zzso The significance of these results for zzso function during zzso replication and zzso is zzso
