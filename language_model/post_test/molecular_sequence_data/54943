We performed whole zzso sequencing of 22 zzso avian influenza viruses zzso isolated from domestic laying zzso on farms between 2005 and 2008, and compared the sequences with viruses previously reported in zzso A previous study revealed that two zzso distinct zzso were established within the zzso lineage by zzso drift since the first zzso zzso outbreak in South zzso We designated them as the zzso lineage and the zzso zzso Since late 2004, most identified zzso in Korea have belonged to the zzso zzso however, in this study we found that six among zzso zzso were belonged to zzso zzso indicating that the genetic divergence is still occurring after zzso Furthermore, it is noteworthy that five zzso among the defined zzso lineage had a 24 zzso acid deletion in the zzso stalk region, which were not in any other zzso zzso previously zzso The internal genes analysis demonstrated extensive zzso events among zzso from poultry farms, live bird markets, and wild birds, and multiple new zzso were zzso We identified several features of gene evolution in zzso zzso suggesting that the long-term zzso zzso surveillance study should be continued in South zzso
