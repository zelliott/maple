We have isolated and characterized complete zzso for two zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso one of four genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins of 810 and zzso zzso acids zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of these two zzso with those zzso the three other human zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso demonstrates that each corresponding zzso transcript has a unique region of sequence at or near its zzso consistent with alternative zzso zzso zzso expression of the five zzso in monkey zzso cells produced proteins of apparent molecular mass under zzso conditions of 68, 68, 95, 119 and 105 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of human cell lines and rat brain demonstrated the presence of species that zzso with the proteins produced in zzso zzso zzso and native zzso and zzso were found to exist only in the zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were found in both zzso and particulate zzso The zzso values for the selective zzso inhibitor zzso for the zzso forms of the five zzso were similar zzso zzso whereas they were zzso higher for the particulate forms of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), than for the corresponding zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are derived from alternatively spliced regions of their zzso are important in determining their zzso zzso activity and differential sensitivity to zzso
