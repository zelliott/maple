The expression of human zzso type 16 late genes zzso virus zzso proteins zzso and zzso is restricted to terminally differentiated zzso cells in the superficial layers of the zzso zzso We wish to understand the molecular mechanisms that determine the levels of expression of the human zzso type 16 late zzso We have previously shown that the zzso coding region contains zzso zzso Here we extend previous findings to show that the zzso end of the zzso gene contains strong zzso sequences but that the 3' end does zzso We show that the first zzso zzso of the zzso coding region contain multiple zzso elements that act independently of one another and that the major zzso element is located within the first 129 zzso of the zzso zzso Introduction of point zzso in the zzso elements in the zzso end of the zzso gene which altered the zzso sequence without affecting the protein sequence specifically zzso the zzso elements and resulted in production of high levels of human zzso type 16 zzso zzso and protein in human zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso sequences are present in the zzso coding regions of multiple human zzso types, demonstrating that these elements are zzso among the human zzso and suggest that they have an important function in the viral life zzso
