A gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso A zzso pair DNA fragment, isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso by double zzso with zzso and zzso contained two zzso the zzso gene zzso and the zzso gene zzso which was situated upstream of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso to those from other strains and zzso zzso that are responsible to bind irons were also zzso The expression system for rub was constructed under the control of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The zzso protein was soluble and had a characteristic visible zzso zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso analysis and electron zzso resonance analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of an iron zzso in a distorted zzso geometry that was the same as native zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso reduction analysis indicated that zzso zzso was active, and its zzso potential was determined as -5 zzso
