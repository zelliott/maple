zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso finger protein and belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso which determines the zzso specificity of zzso and regulates a variety of biological zzso We report here the identification and functional characterization of an zzso zzso in zzso which we named zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso which are the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso tree analysis further demonstrated that zzso belongs to the zzso family other than zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was zzso expressed in all examined zzso of zzso and the expression level of zzso was significantly induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso was expressed predominantly in zzso cells and localized both in the zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso had zzso zzso activity and could zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso and may be indirectly involved in the immune response of zzso through zzso
