zzso a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli, is involved in degradation of some of zzso integral membrane proteins and short-lived zzso zzso It is composed of an zzso zzso region and a following large zzso domain that contains zzso and zzso active zzso In the present study, it was found that zzso zzso zzso processing in zzso The processing was blocked by loss of function zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso This in zzso processing was observed only in the presence of zzso and not in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, such processing did not occur in the case of the zzso motif zzso zzso These results indicated that this processing is a zzso reaction that needs zzso zzso zzso in the zzso genes that zzso a possible zzso of zzso and the growth phase of the cells as well, affected the zzso zzso experiments with genetically constructed zzso suggested that both the processed and the zzso forms of zzso are zzso The zzso was found to occur between zzso and zzso removing a zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso revealed preferences for positively charged and zzso zzso acid zzso at these positions for zzso This zzso specificity may be shared by the zzso and the zzso reactions of this zzso
