We have cloned the zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a rat embryonic brain zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the cloned zzso expressed zzso on the cell surface and showed zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein zzso zzso acid zzso was predicted to have a type II membrane zzso containing the zzso zzso and was found to be zzso similar to its human zzso Analysis of the zzso specificity of zzso zzso protein indicated that this zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso gene is zzso transcribed in the brain and the zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with the highest level in the brain during embryonic days 15 to zzso In zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso zone of the embryonic rat brain and zzso In the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the cerebral cortex, zzso thalamus, and zzso These studies show that the zzso and zzso expression of zzso in the developing rat brain may be regulated in part by the level of zzso zzso zzso
