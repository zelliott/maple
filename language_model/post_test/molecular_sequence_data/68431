Mice zzso for the zzso zzso deletion die as zzso as a result of liver zzso Previous mapping studies have associated this zzso with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso regulation locus zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the last step of zzso zzso also maps to the same deletion zzso To test whether the zzso defects found in the zzso deletion zzso are attributable to loss of zzso and not to another gene mapping to the zzso we have generated zzso zzso mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem zzso zzso mice die within 12 zzso after birth from zzso and liver zzso In addition, the same pattern of altered liver zzso expression found in the zzso deletion zzso was also found in affected zzso We conclude that the zzso lethal and liver dysfunction zzso of the zzso deletion is entirely attributable to loss of zzso
