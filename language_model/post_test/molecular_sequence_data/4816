To investigate the interactions between zzso DNA and nuclear zzso in higher plants, zzso associated regions zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso First, we prepared nuclear zzso from isolated zzso by digesting them with zzso and then zzso with 2 M zzso About zzso of the total DNA remained in the nuclear zzso after this zzso and zzso The residual DNA fragments in the nuclear zzso were zzso Some of the cloned DNA fragments showed binding to certain nuclear zzso One of the zzso fragments contained sequences related to known consensus motifs and a hairpin loop zzso A method is presented for isolation of zzso associated region zzso zzso from plant zzso
