We found a zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 of zzso one of the genes responsible for zzso zzso These five bases may be part of an zzso zzso tract sequence that may affect zzso The purpose of the study was to examine the association of the zzso with cardiac zzso The study population consisted of 151 subjects with prominent concentric left zzso zzso and zzso healthy subjects recruited from medical zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso tended to be associated with a larger left zzso zzso ratio in the zzso population ( zzso Multiple zzso analyses indicated that the left zzso zzso ratio was determined ( zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Moreover, the frequency of the deletion zzso was significantly higher in the zzso population than in the control population ( zzso In zzso expression study revealed the deletion zzso significantly affected the zzso expression pattern by skipping zzso 4 during zzso In conclusion, zzso deletion zzso could be associated with a predisposition to prominent left zzso zzso
