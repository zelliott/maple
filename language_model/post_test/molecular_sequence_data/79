The formation of zzso zzso zzso is initiated from zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by a family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso W, a zzso zzso consists of 10 zzso zzso which are adjacent to the zzso site of zzso zzso and zzso M is Swedish zzso with double zzso on the left side of the zzso site of zzso zzso W is a normal product of the metabolism of zzso in the secretary zzso zzso M is known to increase the efficiency of zzso activity, resulting in a more specific binding model compared to zzso zzso zzso structures of zzso W and zzso M were studied by CD and zzso zzso in water zzso On the basis of these structures, interaction models of zzso and zzso peptides were determined by molecular dynamics zzso Four hydrogen bonds and one zzso interaction were formed in the zzso zzso In particular, the hydrogen bonding network of zzso zzso formed spread over the broad region of the active site of zzso zzso and the side chain of zzso formed a hydrogen bond specifically with the side chain of zzso These are more favorable to the zzso of zzso M by zzso than zzso zzso The two zzso peptides showed different tendency to bind to zzso and this information may useful for drug development to treat and prevent Alzheimer's zzso
