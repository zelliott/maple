Data presented in this paper deal with a further molecular characterization of 2 out of 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that we isolated zzso In order to zzso and characterize each zzso at the molecular level, we have cloned and completely zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso which does not contain any zzso levels of zzso protein and zzso we have found that the zzso is due to a single C to T base pair substitution in the reading zzso this leads to the incorporation of a zzso stop zzso zzso nonsense zzso For zzso zzso which contains normal levels of inactive protein and zzso levels, we found a G to A base pair zzso This gives rise to a zzso to zzso zzso acid substitution in the active site of the zzso zzso
