The presentation and recognition of foreign zzso is the critical initial event in the development of local zzso In the zzso zzso cell activity is largely attributable to pulmonary zzso cells zzso that are distributed along the airways and throughout the pulmonary zzso in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that DC zzso activity might be locally regulated by zzso zzso zzso cells, we evaluated the ability of rat type II zzso zzso cells to influence the capacity of zzso rat pulmonary DC to stimulate zzso proliferation in an zzso mixed zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso cells greatly enhanced the ability of zzso cells to induce zzso zzso This effect on DC zzso activity was zzso by a soluble factor zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cultures were found to express zzso for zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and blocking zzso against zzso partially neutralized the effect of zzso zzso media on DC zzso activity, indicating that the effect was due at least in part to zzso zzso zzso zzso Through the polar zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells may play an important role in creating distinct zzso environments within the zzso
