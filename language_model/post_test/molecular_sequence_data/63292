zzso migration zzso factor zzso have been identified from several zzso of zzso including zzso and have shown some functional similarities to the host zzso It was hypothesized that zzso molecules can act as a regulator in zzso interaction in favor of zzso survival during malaria zzso Although there has been some progress in recent studies, the biological function of the malaria zzso zzso is still far from zzso In this study, zzso of zzso was zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain and the zzso protein was generated and analyzed for both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso molecules are conservative both zzso and zzso And all the sequences of them have typical structure of zzso zzso family: zzso zzso was proved to have zzso activity on human zzso which was similar to zzso zzso but at lower concentration than the zzso Meanwhile, the zzso at position 2 was confirmed to be important for its zzso zzso With specific zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated the release of zzso from cultured zzso zzso and the zzso of it from zzso zzso cells in zzso and more importantly, we found the existence of zzso derived zzso zzso in the zzso of the patients infected by zzso zzso These results will contribute to the understanding of the zzso zzso role during malaria zzso
