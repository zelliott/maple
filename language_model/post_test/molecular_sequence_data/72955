zzso metabolism in zzso zzso involves the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso a reaction which is zzso zzso by a zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library of zzso zzso using zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso was determined and six zzso including the zzso zzso were zzso The gene expressed a zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which is in agreement with the molecular mass of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A short sequence at the zzso was found to be similar to known zzso zzso The expression of zzso in L zzso was found to be induced also by zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso in the growth zzso This indicates that zzso does not serve solely to degrade zzso but that it is also involved in the metabolism of other zzso The specific activity of zzso during zzso was dependent on the zzso concentration in the zzso The maximum specific activity of zzso increased by a factor of zzso and the specific growth rate by a factor of 7, when the zzso concentration was raised from zzso to zzso g zzso Furthermore, a higher amount of zzso produced relative to zzso zzso and ethanol was observed when the initial zzso concentration in the medium was zzso The specific activity of zzso responded similarly to zzso but the magnitude of the response was zzso zzso sugar zzso and zzso and zzso suppression was observed when zzso zzso was grown on the zzso combinations zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso was the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and both zzso activities were high throughout the zzso
