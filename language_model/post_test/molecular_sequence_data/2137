zzso and zzso clones of a gene expressed specifically in the zzso zzso of adult Aedes aegypti have been isolated and zzso This gene encodes an abundant zzso that is transcribed throughout the male zzso zzso but only in the cells of the zzso lateral zzso of the female zzso The deduced protein has many basic zzso zzso several possible sites for zzso and displays striking similarities with the products of a zzso zzso gene and three previously unidentified genes from zzso zzso We propose the name zzso zzso zzso to designate this zzso The presumed function of this gene product is to assist the zzso in its zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes have similar structural features zzso to the protein coding regions, indicating that these genes may share common control zzso
