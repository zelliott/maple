zzso zzso are likely to play a central role in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso since these zzso are unable to zzso zzso de zzso and must salvage them from their zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso and experimental drugs in these and other zzso We have cloned the gene for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and shown that this zzso is related in sequence to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and hence has the zzso specificity of the zzso type zzso zzso that have been previously characterized by zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso form zzso host zzso zzso but not in zzso form zzso zzso zzso indicating that the gene is zzso regulated during the zzso life zzso zzso Southern blots suggest that there are multiple genes related in sequence to zzso zzso the existence of a family of zzso zzso genes in these zzso
