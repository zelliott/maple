The zzso tick zzso zzso is the most important zzso of zzso disease in zzso Most zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso ticks have been classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso because of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, we found that a small number of zzso obtained from zzso zzso contained a smaller zzso zzso protein and single zzso zzso gene zzso Representative isolate zzso zzso zzso type zzso had the same zzso zzso gene physical map as zzso zzso The DNA base composition of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that strain zzso exhibited moderate levels of DNA zzso (24 to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the levels of DNA zzso with the previously described zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were only 8 to zzso None of the previously described species examined exhibited a high level of DNA zzso with strain zzso In addition, the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso was determined and aligned with the zzso zzso sequences of other zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed, and a zzso tree was zzso The results showed that isolate zzso is only zzso related to both previously described zzso disease zzso and zzso fever zzso Thus, the zzso isolated from zzso zzso and closely related zzso should be classified as members of a new zzso zzso We propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso strain zzso is the type zzso
