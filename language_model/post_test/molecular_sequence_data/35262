zzso mosaic virus zzso is seed and zzso transmitted and can cause significant reductions in yield and seed quality in soybean zzso zzso The roles in seed and zzso transmission of selected zzso proteins were investigated by constructing zzso in and zzso zzso between zzso 413 zzso zzso and seed zzso and an isolate of zzso zzso (not zzso or seed zzso As previously reported, the zzso zzso acid sequence motif near the zzso zzso of the coat protein zzso was the major zzso in differences in zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso and helper component zzso zzso played a secondary zzso zzso transmission of zzso was influenced by zzso zzso and zzso Replacement of the zzso coding region of zzso 413 with that of zzso zzso significantly enhanced seed zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 413 of the two zzso acids that varied in the zzso of the two zzso with those from zzso zzso G to D in the zzso motif and Q to P near the zzso zzso significantly reduced seed zzso The zzso substitution in zzso 413 also abolished zzso zzso zzso in plant introduction zzso This is the first report zzso zzso zzso and the zzso motif with seed transmission of a zzso and suggests that zzso interactions with zzso are important for multiple functions in the virus infection zzso
