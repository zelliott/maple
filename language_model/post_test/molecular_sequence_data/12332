Emerging evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potentially important zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso has been found in zzso during zzso and is a potent zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso Analysis of the promoter region of the human zzso gene demonstrates several putative binding sites for zzso zzso factors, including recognition elements for the zzso zzso factor, nuclear zzso B zzso zzso This study investigated the role of zzso B in zzso zzso expression by human zzso zzso We found that treating zzso cells with zzso resulted in the rapid zzso zzso 30 zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso B zzso could be blocked by preventing the zzso degradation of I zzso B, the zzso inhibitor of zzso B, with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso B with zzso correlated with a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raising zzso zzso levels, or exposing zzso cells to zzso A, treatments that block zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso B zzso Finally, blocking the synthesis of one of the protein zzso of zzso B with an zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels in response to zzso These data suggest that zzso gene zzso may be zzso in part, by the zzso factor zzso zzso
