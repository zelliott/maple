Short peptides derived from zzso and zzso zzso and 15 zzso acids in zzso respectively), two cancer associated zzso have been found to zzso into zzso zzso zzso protein zzso containing these zzso segments interact in cells and also undergo a zzso transition upon binding in zzso In contrast to the association of zzso zzso with zzso diseases, the system described zzso zzso the formation of zzso extended zzso as a novel mechanism of zzso zzso The zzso zzso formed from these peptides may allow the directed assembly of decorated zzso with applications as biological zzso
