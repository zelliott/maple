The zzso replication origin zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can function in many zzso bacterial species when supplied with the zzso replication protein zzso and zzso replication proteins including zzso Nine zzso binding sites zzso are known, and also two zzso binding sites, box 1, between zzso zzso 4 and 5, and box 2, downstream of repeat zzso The deletion analysis presented here shows that the core zzso requires zzso box 1 for function in zzso coli and zzso zzso This zzso box is not essential in zzso zzso although its deletion does reduce zzso copy number in this zzso A putative zzso binding site is located upstream of zzso box 1, but zzso zzso in zzso coli seems not to alter replication efficiency or copy number zzso zzso zzso can interfere with maintenance of an independent zzso zzso Analysis of replication zzso functions associated with zzso showed that a short putative zzso between zzso zzso 1 and 2 is not necessary for replication zzso the presence of repeats 5 to 9 in target and inhibitor zzso are not sufficient for efficient zzso and zzso does not correlate directly with the number of direct repeats zzso Rather, the results showed that the isolated repeats 1 and 2 to 4, zzso replication zzso disproportionately to their effect on the number of zzso binding zzso The results are consistent with the idea that repeats 1 to 4, arranged as a single copy and as an irregular group of three, zzso the ability of the zzso region to form complexes which inhibit zzso We suggest that zzso bound at these zzso may be more susceptible to forming pairs between zzso sequences on different zzso
