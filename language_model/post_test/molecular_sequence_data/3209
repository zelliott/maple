The type III zzso zzso zzso is used by numerous zzso pathogens to inject zzso factors into zzso zzso In addition to a functional zzso apparatus, zzso of zzso proteins depends upon specific zzso Using a zzso screen in zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso which is zzso by an zzso for components of the zzso apparatus, is associated in the zzso with three proteins that are zzso by the zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be necessary for stability of zzso but not zzso and for zzso of zzso molecules that were stored in the zzso but not those that were zzso while the zzso apparatus was zzso The ability of zzso to associate with several zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso in other zzso systems and the location of the corresponding genes within zzso for components of the zzso apparatus suggest that zzso belongs to a new class of zzso zzso
