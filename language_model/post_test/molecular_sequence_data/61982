zzso zzso zzso zzso the seventh zzso in the zzso pathway, zzso the transformation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso which is the last common precursor in the zzso of numerous aromatic compounds in bacteria, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso reaction involves a zzso of zzso acid from zzso and has an absolute requirement for reduced zzso as a zzso We have determined the three-dimensional zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso zzso The structure shows a novel zzso fold consisting of an alternate tight packing of two zzso and two zzso zzso showing no resemblance to any documented protein zzso The zzso is arranged as a tight zzso with zzso zzso in accordance with its zzso structure in zzso zzso density is missing for zzso of the zzso zzso spread over sequence regions that in the three-dimensional structure zzso on the surface of the zzso Many totally zzso zzso are contained within these regions, and they probably form a structured but mobile domain that closes over a zzso upon zzso binding and zzso This hypothesis is supported by previously published zzso zzso zzso that the zzso zzso considerable structural changes upon binding of both zzso and zzso
