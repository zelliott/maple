The zzso zzso had previously been demonstrated genetically to exist in zzso zzso by its ability to promote zzso and to elicit zzso on recipient zzso cultures, but it had not been physically zzso Using zzso gel zzso a 50 zzso linear DNA was isolated from zzso but not zzso strains of zzso zzso and from zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains to which zzso had been transferred by zzso or zzso We conclude that this linear DNA is zzso The terminal fragments of zzso were zzso The determined sequences revealed a zzso imperfect terminal zzso zzso The terminal zzso sequence of zzso was identical to those of two other zzso linear zzso zzso and zzso and similar to the terminal sequences of another zzso linear zzso zzso The zzso of zzso DNA were resistant to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso A truncated (probably zzso copy of zzso is present on the zzso While the zzso zzso exists as a free form in the host, a zzso zzso sequence corresponding to the segment of zzso from zzso to the right zzso is also present (at a copy number similar to the free zzso elsewhere in the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is partially zzso to a newly discovered 650 zzso linear zzso in zzso zzso
