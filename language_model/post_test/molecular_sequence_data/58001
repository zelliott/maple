We have isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso from cloned rat zzso zzso cells using a combination of zzso zzso affinity zzso with zzso III zzso zzso and gel zzso in zzso zzso The zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind tightly to AT III bear mainly zzso active zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso possess mainly zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso The core proteins of zzso and zzso were isolated by treatment with zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed that both sets of core proteins exhibited three major components with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that zzso and zzso possess extremely similar core zzso The primary sequences of internal peptides obtained from zzso core proteins and the zzso sequence analyses of the zzso component from the zzso core proteins demonstrate that the zzso component is a previously unidentified zzso as zzso the zzso component representing a zzso degradation zzso while the zzso component is the rat zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso J Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained for zzso and zzso by zzso and the corresponding zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso zzso type I integral membrane proteins of 202 and 313 zzso zzso respectively, which have zzso zzso and zzso zzso but very distinct zzso zzso In particular, zzso exhibits only 3 potential zzso zzso attachment sites within the zzso region while zzso has 5 zzso attachment sites within the same zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso were measured by quantitative zzso in primary zzso zzso cells and associated zzso cells isolated by cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso were abundantly expressed in both populations representing about zzso of zzso
