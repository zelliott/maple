zzso zzso zzso surface protein 1 zzso the zzso zzso of zzso surface protein 1, is a leading candidate zzso for development of a vaccine against the blood stages of the malaria zzso Many human and animal studies have indicated the importance of zzso immune zzso zzso zzso can prevent invasion of red blood cells by zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, the fine specificity of zzso zzso is also important, as only a fraction of zzso zzso zzso have zzso activity in zzso Human zzso from zzso locations show strong zzso zzso but individual serum samples vary greatly in zzso zzso zzso is an excellent method for studying zzso zzso and has been used widely to study binding of peptides representing known zzso (as well as zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The recent development of zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso and related methods has significantly extended the maximum size limit of molecules that can be studied by zzso zzso zzso experiments produce high quality zzso of zzso complexes that allow the mapping of zzso by the chemical shift zzso technique on a complete, folded protein zzso such as zzso We studied the complexes of zzso zzso zzso with zzso fragments from three zzso zzso Two of these zzso have zzso activity in zzso while the third is zzso zzso zzso mapping showed a close relationship between binding sites for the two zzso zzso distinct from the location of the zzso zzso Together with a previously published crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex with the zzso zzso of another zzso zzso these results revealed a surface on zzso where zzso zzso zzso This information will be useful in evaluating the zzso immune response in natural populations from endemic areas, as well as in vaccine zzso It will also be valuable for zzso the zzso zzso by rational vaccine zzso This work also shows that zzso zzso techniques are very effective for mapping zzso zzso at the level of individual zzso on small- to zzso zzso provided that the zzso can be expressed in a system amenable to stable isotope zzso such as bacteria or zzso
