In order to identify novel zzso involved in insulin zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library was screened with the zzso domain of the human insulin zzso as zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of an interacting zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso and several potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, heart, and zzso zzso and in differentiated zzso zzso We show that zzso associates with zzso situated within the zzso loop of the insulin zzso via the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso resulted in rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso whereas zzso growth factor treatment resulted in no zzso zzso In zzso we have identified a new insulin zzso zzso that is primarily expressed in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso whose zzso shows insulin zzso zzso These findings suggest a potential role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso
