One of the major roles of innate immunity system is the recognition and the determination of the nature of the zzso This ability is zzso by specific receptors as zzso receptors zzso zzso recognizes bacterial and viral zzso zzso while their potent zzso effect seems to be promising for zzso zzso Recent studies, however, show the presence of a big zzso within the zzso genes and the linkage between zzso and zzso to various zzso Moreover, different recognition ability seems to be zzso by different species and possibly zzso In this study, we characterized the protein coding region of zzso zzso zzso By using comparative analysis of two closely related species and humans, we suggest, which characteristics of protein could be responsible for altered zzso Furthermore, analyzing the presence of the zzso we show the zzso zzso and its possible zzso while attempting to define the association of discovered zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
