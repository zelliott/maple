We have investigated the zzso of an zzso random zzso zzso to a soluble form through zzso zzso and selection with the aid of the green fluorescent protein zzso folding zzso To assess the zzso of the zzso in the selected clones of each generation, the zzso genes were detached from the zzso zzso and expressed with a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso random zzso increased in each generation within the scope of the evolutionary process, and the zzso assumed a soluble form from the fourth zzso Analysis of the synonymous and zzso zzso found in the deduced zzso acid sequence of the selected zzso revealed that selection had accelerated the evolutionary zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso and the 25 arbitrarily chosen random zzso found in a previously prepared library were determined, zzso and interpreted from the landscape on the protein sequence zzso This study showed the zzso of an zzso arbitrary sequence toward a soluble one, zzso it provides a new perspective on the field of artificial zzso
