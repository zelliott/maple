The zzso search using the strand beta 2 zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso resulted in retrieving the zzso similar segment of zzso from garlic zzso virus zzso The detailed analysis of the entire zzso acid sequences of both zzso zzso and zzso suggested that the zzso segment zzso of zzso (the entire length of this zzso is 1924 zzso could share the structure of zzso zzso zzso identity using the entire sequence of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is supported by the fact that the sequence similarity can be observed along the whole sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The sequence of zzso exhibits zzso the similarity with that of lycopene zzso an zzso implicated in the zzso zzso that was previously found to share similarity with zzso zzso Thus the relevant segment of zzso is predicted to adopt an zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso
