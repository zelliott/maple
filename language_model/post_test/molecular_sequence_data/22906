zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a type III zzso system to the host cell zzso where it serves as a zzso for the binding of a second bacterial membrane zzso In response to the zzso zzso zzso is zzso at zzso and this zzso is necessary for the signaling of zzso zzso zzso of zzso has no equivalent zzso site but it is similarly needed for zzso zzso How these two zzso molecules achieve their function by apparently different mechanisms is not completely zzso To examine their intrinsic differences, the two zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso in complexes could be zzso down from the zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso By zzso neither zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was frequently found in zzso structures whereas zzso zzso was observed completely in a zzso zzso The zzso critical for the zzso zzso zzso formation was mapped to the zzso region of the zzso that deviates from the zzso zzso This region may play a role in taking an alternative route different from zzso zzso to zzso zzso
