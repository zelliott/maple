In humans, circulating zzso levels are increased in zzso states and suppressed in zzso In both extremes, zzso of the zzso environment zzso zzso release, leading to the conclusion that changes in zzso hormones and/or zzso promote changes in zzso synthesis and zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso can be zzso centrally by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso input to the zzso and/or by direct regulation of zzso zzso zzso Although data are available showing zzso free fatty acids zzso zzso and insulin have direct effects on rat zzso function, little information is available regarding the direct zzso effects of these zzso factors in zzso zzso this study examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, 100 and 400 zzso each), zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso on zzso release and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, in primary zzso cell cultures of zzso zzso zzso after 24 h zzso A commercial zzso kit was used to determine the amount of zzso released into the media, while quantitative real-time reverse zzso was used to determine zzso zzso To design zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso as a zzso zzso zzso sequence data for each zzso transcript were obtained and this data were submitted to zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso treatment did not significantly alter the expression of zzso a zzso factor essential for normal zzso development and zzso However, as previously reported in the zzso zzso increased, while zzso zzso and insulin decreased zzso release in zzso zzso cell cultures, where changes in zzso release were reflected by comparable changes in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased, while zzso zzso and insulin decreased the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso without significantly altering zzso A zzso zzso A role of zzso pathway, independent of zzso in regulating zzso function is supported by the fact that zzso zzso and insulin significantly suppressed zzso function at doses zzso and 5 zzso zzso not anticipated to activate their respective zzso and zzso the zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso at levels comparable to or greater than that of zzso commonly considered as insulin sensitive zzso liver, skeletal muscle, and zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso factors can directly zzso zzso zzso function through regulating zzso synthesis and release, as well as zzso the expression of receptors important in central zzso and systemic zzso regulation of zzso zzso
