zzso zzso comprise a unique zzso zzso zzso that has multiple zzso zzso and extends serum zzso of the zzso It has evolved by incorporating a previously untranslated region of the zzso gene into the reading zzso Although zzso sequences are encrypted in the zzso genes of several zzso the zzso zzso developed only in primates and zzso To study this restriction in evolution, we examined whether the cryptic zzso zzso from the bovine zzso gene zzso possesses key characteristics of the human zzso zzso The zzso does not impede several crucial aspects of hormone zzso but compared to the zzso the stretch lacks zzso and zzso for circulatory zzso zzso zzso and the associated zzso to extend serum zzso is a major drawback of the zzso This may explain why zzso did not evolve into zzso in zzso and consequently alternative mechanisms evolved to delay zzso early in zzso
