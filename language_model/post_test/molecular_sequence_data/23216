To investigate the structural and functional features of the second zzso zzso segment zzso of the zzso zzso carrier zzso we adopted zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were systematically introduced at zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso were treated with the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modified different zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso between the two distinct carrier zzso called the zzso and the zzso in which the zzso recognition site faces the zzso and zzso zzso When zzso acids in the zzso were projected on a wheel plot, these zzso zzso acids were observed at distinct sides of the zzso Since the zzso zzso specifically modified zzso in the zzso environment, these results indicate that distinct zzso surfaces of zzso faced the zzso space between the two zzso possibly as a result of twisting of this zzso In the recently reported crystal structure of bovine zzso several zzso acids faced zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso These zzso zzso to those modified with zzso in the zzso carrier in the zzso Since the binding site of zzso is known to overlap that of the transport zzso the zzso space was thought to be a zzso transport pathway, and zzso the observed twisting of zzso between the zzso and the zzso may be involved in the process of zzso zzso On the basis of the results, the roles of zzso in the transport function of zzso were zzso
