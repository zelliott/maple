zzso DNA contains a wide variety of repetitive zzso In zzso coli, there have been several classes of repetitive sequences reported, some of which cluster as tandem zzso We propose a novel method for analyzing symbolic sequences by two-dimensional pattern formation with zzso We applied this method for searching tandem repeats in the zzso coli zzso and found approximately 50 repeats with periods longer than 30 zzso The longest repeat has a period of zzso zzso
