zzso zzso zzso library and a zzso primer corresponding to a partial zzso acid sequence determined zzso the complete zzso sequence for the zzso of zzso which binds zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso was obtained by zzso chain zzso The open reading frame of the zzso encodes a novel zzso of 315 zzso acid zzso including a signal sequence of 19 zzso This protein contains six potential zzso zzso one zzso site, and a large amount of zzso zzso acid zzso The ability to bind zzso has been zzso by calcium overlay zzso zzso by sequence similarity in addition, it is concluded that zzso is a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso
