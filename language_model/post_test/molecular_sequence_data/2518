zzso a zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 49 zzso acids and 4 zzso bridges was zzso by zzso methodology in zzso zzso In the final step, air zzso of the zzso was found to be optimal at pH zzso The synthetic product was shown to be physically and biologically indistinguishable from native zzso It zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M and also prevents zzso initiated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Reduction of zzso synthetic zzso to zzso with zzso followed by air zzso zzso homogeneous zzso in quantitative zzso This highly specific zzso strongly suggests that the linear sequence of zzso contains all of the information that is required for the proper folding of the zzso The sequence zzso of zzso occurs also in adhesive zzso that bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex composed of zzso zzso and zzso In an effort to evaluate the role of this putative binding site we have zzso zzso of zzso with substitution of zzso Replacement with zzso zzso resulted in an analog having a zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso gave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the corresponding short sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a more important role in the binding of the zzso than in that of zzso
