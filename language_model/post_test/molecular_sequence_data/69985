The zzso alpha zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso of the alpha chain of zzso was zzso and used to zzso its binding site in the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso incubated with zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the resulting product was analyzed in several ways, including zzso zzso The binding of the radioactive zzso was mainly to the zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso After zzso zzso the zzso was present in zzso D1 and also in its zzso zzso but not in fragments zzso D3 or zzso zzso D1 zzso with zzso zzso was zzso by affinity zzso on immobilized zzso D zzso further zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso and the peptides were zzso by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence analysis of the radioactive peak revealed the presence of two zzso gamma zzso and zzso It was concluded that the binding site for zzso is in the sequence gamma zzso which is present in zzso D1 but absent in fragments zzso and zzso
