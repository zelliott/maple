We measured the relative zzso levels of the zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso zzso gene in cells at different stages of the zzso and zzso cycles, and after zzso zzso This gene is thought to zzso a DNA zzso concerned only with a specific recovery function, the replication on zzso templates that produces zzso zzso In keeping with this proposed function, the zzso gene showed no evidence of the periodic zzso at the zzso boundary of the zzso and zzso cycle that occurs with genes zzso replication zzso However, levels of zzso zzso were much increased in late zzso cells, like those of transcripts of some other DNA zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transcript were increased only slightly in response to zzso zzso
