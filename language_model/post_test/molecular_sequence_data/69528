The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and related zzso provides a rational target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness and several other zzso zzso To characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso in detail, the zzso zzso zzso was isolated within a zzso zzso zzso zzso insert and zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 630 zzso that zzso a protein of 210 zzso acids with a zzso zzso zzso zzso After gap zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso acid sequence identity, mostly in three clustered regions, with the zzso from human, zzso zzso and P zzso indicating that the zzso zzso was the most divergent of the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso was more zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed two zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso each expressed to equivalent degrees in insect zzso and zzso forms of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was inserted into an expression zzso and transformed into S zzso 606 zzso coli that are deficient in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed to high levels and zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso as zzso and was inhibited by a variety of zzso zzso The availability of a molecular clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso and large quantities of homogeneous zzso zzso zzso provides an zzso zzso molecular and zzso system for the rational design of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of African sleeping sickness and other diseases of zzso zzso
