zzso caused by human zzso zzso are often zzso or mild, although they may cause more severe illnesses as meningitis and acute zzso zzso zzso have globally posed a threat to children, and outbreaks of zzso meningitis and hand, foot and mouth disease are frequently zzso 

To identify zzso strains circulating among healthy children in a small community in zzso Cameroon two years zzso 

Species and zzso types were obtained by partial zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso from stool samples collected in October 2009 and September 2011 from 150 children in zzso 

In all, 74 children zzso were infected with 28 different types of zzso There were 29 zzso infected children in 2009, and 45 zzso in zzso There was a significant difference between detected species of zzso with 15 zzso children infected with zzso in 2009, and 22 zzso with zzso in 2011 zzso In 2009, one child was infected by a divergent zzso which was most similar to zzso Based on the complete zzso zzso it was shown to be a new zzso designated zzso 

The current study shows a high zzso of circulating zzso types among children in zzso zzso and a previously not described shift in zzso zzso zzso
