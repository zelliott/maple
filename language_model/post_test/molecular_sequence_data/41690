For the sucking zzso zzso zzso taste is essential for finding host plants and zzso zzso In zzso zzso taste relies largely on the sensory system located within its zzso In this study, we constructed a zzso library from zzso zzso zzso and conducted preliminary analysis of zzso zzso From this collection, we identified three putative zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and one zzso protein zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso was used to study the expression pattern of these four zzso All four were expressed mainly in zzso zzso and legs, suggestive of roles in zzso and zzso We expressed and zzso zzso versions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso of the four proteins then were investigated in competition zzso using zzso zzso acid zzso as a zzso Of the 58 small organic compounds and five cotton secondary zzso tested, plant zzso cannot effectively zzso zzso from any of the four zzso In contrast, most of the cotton secondary zzso have high affinities for the three zzso and zzso indicating that these binding proteins more likely play a role in zzso than in zzso
