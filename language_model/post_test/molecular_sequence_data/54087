zzso a key precursor of zzso is formed by the action of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes were isolated from zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso exhibit structural features and zzso to zzso of several plant species involved in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the expression of all genes zzso zzso and zzso is highly regulated during growth and zzso All three zzso are zzso expressed in rapidly growing zzso zzso is expressed at a much lower level than the other two zzso zzso During seed development, the high level of both zzso and zzso transcripts correlated with the period of rapid growth of the zzso The three zzso genes are not subjected to feedback regulation by zzso zzso
