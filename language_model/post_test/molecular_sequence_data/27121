zzso zzso causes a needle and shoot disease in zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso del zzso This newly discovered disease requires intensive research efforts that zzso the processing of large numbers of samples for which accurate zzso often by people not experienced in zzso zzso is zzso The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop zzso zzso for zzso zzso that amplify the internal transcribed zzso region of the zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso The zzso were tested over several zzso zzso as well as zzso isolated from zzso zzso In all cases, only zzso zzso was zzso In addition to the zzso zzso a zzso zzso length zzso protocol using available zzso zzso zzso was also used to generate a zzso profile for zzso zzso This provided a characteristic profile that allows the identification of zzso zzso and it could also discriminate between 27 different species of zzso Both techniques reported in this study make it possible to identify large numbers of zzso zzso cultures accurately and zzso which will be important for both zzso work and biological research on this important new zzso
