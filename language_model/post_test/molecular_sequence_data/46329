The zzso zzso the zzso part of the zzso is the major target of the zzso protective zzso response zzso upon host infection by zzso zzso the main zzso agent of the endemic form of zzso zzso The zzso repeat units zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso share the zzso backbone zzso with zzso zzso and/or zzso defining the zzso To investigate the zzso basis of zzso zzso we sampled zzso behaviors during zzso of molecular dynamic simulations for zzso representing three zzso of each one of the zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X and Y, zzso The calculated zzso were checked by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The simulations predict that in all zzso but zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the backbone do not induce any new backbone zzso compared with the linear type zzso Y, although they restrain locally the accessible zzso zzso Moreover, the influence of any given zzso on the backbone is independent of the eventual presence of other zzso Finally, only slight differences in zzso behavior between terminal and inner zzso were zzso These results suggest that the reported zzso of the protective immune response is not due to recognition of distinct backbone zzso but to binding of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The gained knowledge is discussed in terms of impact on the development of a zzso coverage zzso
