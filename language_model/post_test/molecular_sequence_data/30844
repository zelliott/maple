zzso combinations of zzso strains and transformation zzso allow for zzso zzso of normally zzso zzso resulting in the creation of linear zzso plasmids in zzso zzso The zzso results in the addition of zzso DNA, including zzso consensus zzso to zzso zzso The mechanism by which this zzso occurs is zzso but it has similarities to zzso gene zzso A DNA zzso which allows for linear autonomous replication upon zzso to the fungus was zzso and zzso This DNA sequence contains the repeated zzso sequence zzso flanked by a region of twofold symmetry consisting primarily of zzso zzso Isolation and identification of this sequence is the first step toward development of zzso that function as artificial zzso in zzso zzso This sequence was shown to promote autonomous replication and enhance transformation in several strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
