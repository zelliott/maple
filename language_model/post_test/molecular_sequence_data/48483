The zzso are among the zzso proteins in biomedical zzso These small zzso play an important role in oxygen supply, but may also have other zzso In addition to well known zzso and zzso six other zzso zzso types have been identified in recent years: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X, zzso Y, and zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso is the only known zzso that includes all eight zzso zzso Thus, zzso can also be considered as a zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso and zzso reconstructions allow us to trace the evolution and the functional changes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso from the other zzso types before the separation of zzso and zzso The zzso which are unlikely to be involved in zzso supply, form the earliest zzso branch within the zzso zzso zzso but do not group with the zzso zzso as it has been proposed zzso There is strong evidence from zzso reconstructions and gene zzso that the zzso zzso E and zzso zzso constitute a common zzso suggesting a similar role in zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses two zzso and two zzso zzso of which one zzso emerged prior to the divergence of zzso and zzso but has been retained only in the zzso zzso the embryonic zzso zzso of zzso derive from a common zzso while the embryonic zzso - with the exception of a more complex pattern in the zzso and zzso - display a zzso zzso zzso Y is associated with the zzso gene zzso but its zzso position is not zzso Our data show an early divergence of distinct zzso types in the zzso evolution before the emergence of zzso The subsequent loss of zzso in certain zzso may be associated with changes in the zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
