zzso II is an zzso protein composed of zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso light zzso and zzso zzso light zzso zzso II expressed in zzso zzso plays a central role in cell zzso migration and zzso The regulation of zzso II activity is known to involve the zzso of zzso which increases the zzso activity of zzso zzso However, less is known about the details of zzso II interaction or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the present paper, we investigate three highly zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso light zzso zzso zzso to as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that all three are associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells results in striking changes in cell zzso and zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso and zzso were reduced significantly in zzso zzso Comprehensive interaction analysis disclosed that zzso zzso and zzso can all interact with a variety of zzso zzso in diverse cell and tissue types, but do so zzso with zzso types of zzso zzso Taken together, our study provides direct evidence that normal levels of zzso zzso are essential for maintaining the integrity of zzso II, and indicates that the zzso are critical for cell structure and zzso
