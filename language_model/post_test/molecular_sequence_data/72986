Two full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library prepared from zzso zzso extracted from seeds zzso at 30 degrees C for 8 zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso 12, have open reading frames of zzso and zzso zzso with deduced zzso acid sequences of 580 and zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso 12 exhibit a zzso identity with each other, and have a greater than zzso identity with zzso from various zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso 12 terminate with the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, both being zzso zzso of the type 1 zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso and slot analysis revealed that zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso 12 zzso were present at low levels in the zzso of the mature and zzso seeds, and that the level of both transcripts increased markedly upon seed zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso level of zzso was low in the mature and zzso seed, then increased rapidly upon seed zzso zzso at around 8-10 days after zzso zzso Changes in the level of zzso activity in zzso extracts was similar to the zzso protein content with the exception that zzso activity was not detected in zzso extracts of mature or zzso zzso From zzso zzso when the zzso tissue zzso zzso activity decreased rapidly to near zzso zzso In contrast, zzso levels of zzso protein and zzso remained relatively constant during zzso zzso In zzso synthesis of zzso protein was measured to shed light on these zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso proteins indicated that zzso was zzso at very low levels during zzso zzso Together, the results show that zzso pine zzso gene expression is zzso While zzso regulation appears to be primarily zzso it also involves a number of zzso processes including at least one zzso and/or zzso zzso
