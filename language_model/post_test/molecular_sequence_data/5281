A defective zzso C virus zzso zzso in the zzso fluid of a patient with zzso zzso was cloned and zzso up to the 3' zzso zzso When compared with the published Taiwanese zzso zzso this defective zzso contained deletions of single zzso at eight sites, double zzso at two sites, triple zzso at four sites, quadruple zzso at one site and replacement of a short stretch of sequence at one zzso For comparison, the corresponding regions containing these zzso were also cloned from a serum sample from this zzso Except for deletions of two triple zzso in the zzso region, the reading frames of all zzso clones were zzso The defective zzso zzso zzso a truncated core protein with 90 zzso acid zzso (the last 20 zzso acid zzso came from a different reading zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso a full-length core zzso When expressed in zzso cells, these two proteins were localized to the nucleus and zzso zzso Using specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso were each detected alone in zzso fluid and serum samples, respectively, whereas both sequences were present in zzso zzso zzso The defective sequence thus constituted the major virus population in the zzso fluid whereas a putative helper zzso zzso with it inside the zzso zzso zzso This sequence is possibly a defective and interfering zzso
