We describe experiments to produce large quantities of the zzso domain of zzso coli DNA zzso I for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso used in previous studies was zzso when zzso and tended to zzso during zzso These problems were solved by a combination of two distinct zzso By changing the expression system, we were able to obtain the zzso protein in a soluble form, a necessary first step since attempts to purify the zzso domain from the zzso zzso were zzso The tendency of the zzso domain to zzso was eliminated by zzso the protein so as to remove both a zzso zzso patch and a potentially zzso region at the extreme zzso Unlike the original zzso the zzso derivatives zzso as a single species and could be zzso to zzso in good zzso Our experience in this study emphasizes the level of ignorance of the factors that influence protein overproduction and the need, in difficult cases, to evaluate many strategies in a zzso zzso
