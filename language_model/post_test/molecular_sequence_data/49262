zzso zzso a zzso marine zzso is a worldwide cause of food-borne zzso V zzso strains of a few specific zzso probably derived from a common zzso zzso have lately caused a pandemic of zzso The zzso is zzso close to V zzso the zzso agent of zzso 

The whole zzso sequence of a clinical V zzso strain zzso was established by shotgun zzso The coding sequences were identified by use of zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis with the V zzso zzso was undertaken with zzso 

The zzso consisted of two circular zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso it contained zzso zzso zzso of the V zzso zzso with that of V zzso showed many zzso within and between the two zzso Genes for the type III zzso system zzso were identified in the zzso of V zzso V zzso does not have these zzso 

The zzso is a central zzso factor of zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli, which cause zzso by invading or intimately interacting with zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that V zzso and V zzso use distinct mechanisms to establish zzso This finding explains clinical features of V zzso infections, which commonly include inflammatory zzso and in some cases systemic manifestations such as zzso distinct from those of V zzso infections, which are generally associated with zzso zzso
