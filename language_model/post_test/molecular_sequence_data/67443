A substitution zzso in human zzso zzso is associated with zzso dominant zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein exhibits altered structure, zzso zzso activity, impaired zzso stability and zzso on prolonged incubation at 37 zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso functions like a molecular zzso by suppressing the zzso of zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of zzso zzso on the stability and zzso activity of zzso 

zzso zzso was incubated in presence and absence of zzso and analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron microscope was used to examine the effect of zzso on the zzso propensity of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso was used to confirm the interaction of zzso with zzso The rescuing of zzso activity in zzso zzso by zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso We found that the addition of the zzso during incubation of zzso protected the zzso zzso from forming larger zzso that zzso with zzso The zzso zzso displayed zzso activity comparable to that of zzso zzso The complexes formed between zzso complex and zzso were more stable than the complexes formed between zzso and zzso zzso and mass zzso confirmed the binding of zzso to zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso activity of zzso These findings aid in our understanding of how to design zzso zzso that can be used to stabilize zzso zzso and preserve the zzso zzso
