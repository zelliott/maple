The zzso zzso cell surface is covered with a high molecular weight protein called the surface zzso Several genes zzso alternative surface zzso but only one is expressed at a zzso In addition, each of these genes shows a high degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains 156 and zzso have different zzso of the G zzso gene whose respective zzso can be distinguished in zzso using specific zzso An zzso exclusion phenomenon has been previously zzso zzso of the zzso zzso express only the 156 zzso of the G zzso zzso express both the 156 and the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is determined at the time of zzso zzso We have investigated the molecular basis for the different zzso zzso Both zzso are always produced, and the 156 zzso is always more abundant than the zzso zzso The relative amounts of these messages, however, vary greatly between different zzso and parallel their zzso zzso the analysis further, we show that the copy number of each zzso in the zzso zzso with the relative amounts of the zzso However, zzso dosage alone is not sufficient to explain the variations of the zzso zzso The G zzso gene is located near a zzso in the zzso We show that the distance between the zzso gene and the zzso is different in zzso and zzso It also varies among zzso and is correlated with the zzso zzso Thus, we have identified two different zzso both linked to the zzso zzso occurring during zzso zzso that correlate with the relative expression of the two zzso Two hypotheses concerning the influence of the zzso position on the expression of the gene are zzso
