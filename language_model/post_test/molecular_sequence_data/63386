We employed the zzso mark technology to perform a genetic analysis in 33 zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso mostly zzso zzso and their adjacent normal zzso A total of zzso single zzso zzso zzso derived from 766 zzso genes were zzso with partially zzso zzso zzso isolated from these zzso This directly targeted zzso profiling identified not only previously reported zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and deletions zzso zzso and zzso but also novel zzso zzso Among these novel targets, the most frequently deleted zzso regions were zzso zzso (including tumor zzso genes zzso and zzso and zzso 5 (including tumor zzso gene zzso The most frequently amplified zzso region was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and known zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso deletion and zzso amplification occurred zzso in nearly all of the affected cases, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of zzso zzso zzso We also detected significant differences in zzso zzso frequency between the zzso cohort of our study and normal control samples from the International zzso Project for 10 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that they might play roles in zzso cancer zzso and/or zzso Taken together, our results demonstrated the utility of the zzso technology for zzso genetic analysis in zzso tumor zzso and provided a detailed genetic profiling of zzso genes in human zzso zzso
