A zzso clone representing the zzso of structural proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso gene of zzso virus strains zzso and WR under the control of a strong zzso promoter for the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso viruses expressed zzso E protein on the membrane surface, as well as in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the E protein expressed from the zzso zzso reacted to nine different characteristic zzso zzso some of which have zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that two major proteins expressed in zzso cells were processed and zzso as the authentic zzso and E zzso of zzso zzso of rabbits with the infectious zzso zzso virus resulted in rapid production of zzso specific for the zzso and E zzso of zzso This zzso had both zzso and zzso activities against zzso Furthermore, mice vaccinated with the zzso also produced zzso zzso and were resistant to challenge with zzso
