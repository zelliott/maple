The zzso profiles of 18 zzso zzso strains belonging to 8 different zzso were determined using an alkaline zzso method for isolation of low molecular mass zzso Nearly all the strains contained zzso closed circular zzso DNA species ranging from 2 to 5 species per strain and from zzso to zzso zzso in size zzso corresponding to CCC zzso A zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain was used in Southern zzso experiments to zzso relationships among the low molecular mass plasmids of different zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was present in most strains which show toxicity against zzso It was not present in those strains toxic against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and fully zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso revealed the presence of an zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso acids in zzso that is preceded by a consensus sequence of zzso zzso crystal protein gene zzso zzso No significant zzso was observed with known zzso zzso toxin zzso acid sequences or with other known zzso
