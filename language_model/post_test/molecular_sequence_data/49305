The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso associated with an zzso zzso open reading zzso The deduced protein has a potential signal zzso of 24 zzso acids in the zzso region, and experimental evidence is consistent with the processing and export of the zzso protein through the inner membrane to the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in the zzso of zzso coli from a zzso zzso which contained the zzso zzso zzso gene lacking the region zzso the putative signal zzso zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso and has no apparent activity with zzso derived from cellulose zzso and other zzso A zzso alignment established structural relations between zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso family 1 zzso At zzso zzso the zzso zzso required for zzso by zzso zzso are present in zzso with only minor zzso Major differences are found at zzso zzso the zzso binding zzso This alignment seeded a zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealing an absence of horizontal transfer between zzso zzso analysis supported the definition of zzso and revealed that zzso the first characterized zzso from the zzso zzso represents a very divergent bacterial zzso closer to zzso zzso than to others of bacterial zzso
