zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso represents a promising approach for selective interference with cellular zzso such as the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso targeted to the zzso of the zzso zzso prevent the transit of zzso or the related zzso zzso to the cell surface, thereby zzso their transforming zzso While zzso zzso bridges important for zzso stability are correctly formed during expression in the zzso pathway, zzso expressed in the reducing environment of the zzso are often zzso To overcome this problem and to generate zzso fragments that interact with the zzso domain of human zzso in the zzso here we have chosen a zzso approach combining classical selection of zzso by zzso display with subsequent expression in zzso After enrichment of zzso zzso fragments from a zzso library by zzso a zzso zzso screen was performed using the zzso domain of zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids under highly stringent conditions yielded 223 colonies that represented at least five independent zzso clones functional in the zzso milieu of zzso zzso zzso of selected zzso fragments with the zzso domain of zzso was confirmed in zzso pull-down and zzso zzso Upon zzso expression in human tumor cells, zzso zzso with zzso at the plasma membrane demonstrating their functionality in zzso
