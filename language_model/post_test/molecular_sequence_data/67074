zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein family and has been shown to zzso zzso functions and to be essential for mouse zzso The related zzso protein has not been studied extensively at the cellular or zzso zzso Here we describe zzso zzso zzso and show that it is widely expressed during early zzso with subsequent enrichment of transcripts in the anterior head zzso zzso of zzso during zzso using specific zzso activates a zzso program of zzso and causes zzso arrest before the one zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso achieved by injecting lower zzso of zzso zzso the early arrest but leads to zzso zzso associated with excessive zzso These zzso can be rescued by zzso of human zzso zzso with the zzso or by treatment with a zzso inhibitor or a zzso zzso zzso Finally, the observed zzso of zzso 8 in the zzso is in zzso with the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso Our findings zzso zzso as a survival factor during early zzso development and zzso This may suggest that zzso and zzso can zzso opposing functions in the regulation of zzso
