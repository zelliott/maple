zzso the central player in harvesting light energy for photosynthesis, is zzso zzso during natural zzso leaf zzso fruit zzso or following zzso stress zzso The zzso properties of zzso and its zzso call for tight regulation of the zzso zzso zzso to avoid zzso of intermediate breakdown zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was previously demonstrated to be an zzso of zzso breakdown when zzso induced to be expressed during zzso citrus fruit color break or when zzso expressed in different plant zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to be translated as a precursor zzso which is subsequently zzso processed to a mature zzso We demonstrate that maturation of citrus zzso involves dual zzso and zzso processing which appear to be zzso zzso events when zzso expression levels are zzso The zzso precursor and intermediate forms were shown to be of transient nature, while the mature form accumulates over time, suggesting that processing may be involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso This notion is further supported by the finding that neither zzso nor zzso processed zzso are essential for zzso targeting of the zzso and that both processing events occur within the zzso zzso Studies on the processing of zzso versions truncated at the zzso or zzso or zzso to abolish zzso processing suggest that each of the processing events is zzso zzso zzso and zzso processing, not involving an zzso targeting zzso has rarely been documented in plants and is unique for a zzso zzso
