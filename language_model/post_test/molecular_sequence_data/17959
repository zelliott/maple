The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso family that encodes the D1 zzso of zzso zzso This family consists of four members zzso zzso that are each unique but highly zzso zzso III and IV are more closely related to each other than to zzso These three copies zzso identical zzso that differ from the zzso product by 21 zzso zzso The zzso initiation site for zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso upstream from the coding zzso zzso extension zzso performed with an zzso specific for zzso III and IV transcripts suggest that one or more of these genes is also zzso zzso mapping and zzso walking experiments demonstrate that none of the four zzso copies is within 20 zzso of another member of the gene zzso
