Three genes zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso in the higher plant zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso contain all the zzso signals known to be essential for zzso gene activity in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso box and the downstream 3' end formation zzso The zzso and zzso elements are centered approximately four zzso DNA turns apart, a feature characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso The genes zzso and zzso are actively transcribed in zzso plant zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of the third zzso zzso could not be zzso Since this gene is missing the downstream signal important for zzso 3' end formation, it probably represents a zzso The genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso long zzso which show zzso sequence similarity with broad bean and pea zzso zzso and zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be folded into the zzso zzso model supporting the importance of the zzso interaction during zzso zzso in plants as well as zzso
