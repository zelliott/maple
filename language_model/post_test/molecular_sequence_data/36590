Two overlapping clones containing sequences zzso to zzso human and chicken zzso have been recovered from zzso zzso zzso isolated from rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso using zzso cloning and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence analysis performed on these clones demonstrated that they zzso the complete mature rat zzso protein expressed by zzso Within the coding region, rat zzso exhibits zzso zzso sequence zzso to human and bovine zzso and zzso zzso to chicken zzso indicating a significant level of conservation among these zzso This level of conservation among species was also maintained at the protein level with rat zzso being zzso zzso to its human, bovine and chicken zzso As previously observed its human zzso rat zzso is made up of seven, tandem, zzso repeat zzso Furthermore, within the core of these repeats was the consensus protein sequence zzso which has been proposed to be the zzso binding region of zzso zzso Schmidt et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The vast majority of zzso acid zzso within rat zzso were of the conservative zzso The highest frequency of zzso acid zzso were found to be localized within a zzso region located near the zzso zzso of the zzso core zzso Unlike rat zzso rat zzso zzso levels were found to increase significantly in zzso zzso zzso In contrast to rat zzso gene zzso no quantitative differences in rat zzso zzso levels were observed between zzso zzso and zzso made zzso through serum zzso Finally, specific zzso zzso zzso proteins were able to regulate the expression of zzso at the zzso level in a slightly different manner than previously observed for zzso
