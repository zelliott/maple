zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso of the gap junction zzso zzso gene are important causes of zzso hearing loss zzso This study aims to determine if zzso zzso infection leads to deafness by inducing zzso zzso 

zzso gene sequencing and auditory zzso response testing were performed in 159 zzso zzso with and 96 without zzso zzso from August 2008 to August zzso For zzso with zzso zzso their parents were further screened for zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso but zzso in zzso children aged zzso y zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso rates of the zzso gene were observed in zzso with or without zzso infection zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso No significant difference in the zzso rate of zzso was found among zzso with zzso infection and zzso those with zzso infection and normal hearing, and zzso newborns with normal hearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso with and without zzso zzso All of the above zzso were also found in both or one of the corresponding zzso 

zzso zzso infections may cause deafness in zzso but this might be independent of zzso gene zzso
