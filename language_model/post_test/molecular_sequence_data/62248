zzso is an engineered protein that binds to its parent, the zzso Z domain of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso shows a reduced zzso content and a melting behavior that is less zzso compared with the zzso Z zzso Here we show that the difference in folding behavior between these two sequences can be partly understood in terms of an zzso model with 5-6 atoms per zzso acid and a zzso potential, in which folding is driven by backbone hydrogen bonding and effective zzso zzso
