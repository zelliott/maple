The mouse short ear gene is required for normal growth and patterning of skeletal structures, and for repair of bone fractures in zzso We have carried out an extensive zzso walk in the zzso region that surrounds this zzso Here we show that the short ear region contains the gene for a zzso zzso protein called bone zzso protein 5 zzso This gene is deleted or rearranged in several independent zzso at the short ear zzso Mice zzso for large deletions of the zzso coding region are viable and zzso zzso at the short ear locus provide an important new tool for defining the normal functions of zzso in zzso The specific skeletal defects seen in zzso animals, which occur against a background of otherwise normal skeletal structures, suggest that particular aspects of skeletal zzso may be determined by individual members of a family of signaling factors that can induce the formation of cartilage and bone in zzso
