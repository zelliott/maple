zzso storage disease type IV zzso also known as zzso disease or zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder caused by a zzso of zzso branching zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso structures in affected zzso The disease is extremely zzso in terms of tissue involvement, age of onset and clinical zzso The human zzso zzso is approximately zzso in length and encodes a zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of conservation throughout zzso The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso and consists of 16 zzso spanning at least 118 zzso of zzso zzso zzso the classic zzso disease is a rapidly progressive disorder leading to terminal liver failure unless liver transplantation is zzso Several zzso have been reported in the zzso gene in patients with classic zzso zzso in the zzso gene have also been identified in patients with the milder zzso zzso form of the zzso Several other zzso of zzso have been reported: a zzso with zzso involvement including skeletal and cardiac muscle, nerve and zzso a juvenile zzso with zzso involvement but normal zzso zzso and the fatal zzso zzso form associated with a zzso site zzso in the zzso zzso Other presentations include zzso zzso and even zzso zzso zzso body disease, characterized by widespread upper and lower motor zzso zzso can present with or without zzso zzso indicating that different zzso defects could result in an identical zzso It is evident that this disease exists in multiple forms with zzso and molecular zzso unparalleled in the other types of zzso storage zzso
