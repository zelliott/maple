The soybean zzso zzso zzso Walker, zzso has become a major zzso of soybean crops in zzso In order to determine the genetic diversity and zzso of zzso of zzso zzso single zzso zzso to zzso partial sequences of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained following zzso zzso and zzso trees constructed using maximum zzso and zzso zzso The aligned sequences showed zzso among the zzso where the zzso gene was by far the most variable and is predicted to be under positive zzso Furthermore, some of the zzso DNA sequence zzso are predicted to result in significant zzso acid zzso possibly leading to changes in oral zzso of this zzso zzso analysis revealed two closely related zzso groups, one containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and ID and another containing zzso zzso zzso IF and zzso The zzso of zzso in relation to 56 other zzso was also determined from the zzso partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso deduced zzso acid zzso using zzso and zzso zzso This analysis clearly places zzso with the Group II zzso where zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
