For the zzso zzso of zzso E zzso different zzso zzso zzso are known, which are coupled to distinct zzso zzso proteins zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso domain is essential for the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso we exchanged the zzso tail of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the corresponding zzso part of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was truncated at a zzso zzso zzso at the end of the seventh zzso region, representing the zzso site of the different zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso tail zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the resulting zzso zzso protein was studied in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not increase zzso zzso zzso zzso formation but did reduce the zzso zzso formation, indicating zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso did not show zzso activity as demonstrated for the zzso truncated zzso zzso Thus, zzso specificity of the zzso zzso is not exclusively zzso by the zzso tail, and zzso activity of a zzso truncated zzso zzso can be suppressed by the zzso zzso
