We describe a new zzso method for joining and/or constructing two or more DNA zzso DNA fragments containing ends complementary to those of a zzso or another independent molecules were generated by the zzso chain zzso The 3' ends of these molecules as well as the zzso DNA were then recessed by zzso activity and zzso in an zzso manner via their complementary zzso zzso This zzso DNA can be transformed directly into bacteria without a further zzso zzso Using this approach, we have constructed zzso DNA molecules zzso efficiently and zzso This method can effectively replace conventional protocols for zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso
