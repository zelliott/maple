zzso zzso were zzso by reductive zzso using zzso zzso zzso and examined by zzso mass zzso This zzso zzso primarily by zzso of the zzso zzso group and attachment of an zzso metal to give zzso + H + zzso zzso which were much more abundant that doubly charged zzso from zzso zzso with other aromatic zzso zzso of these zzso depended on the nature of the zzso metal zzso zzso and sodium zzso fragmented to give prominent zzso produced by zzso within the zzso zzso whereas the other zzso produced more abundant zzso from fragmentation of the zzso zzso of a sugar fragment, usually by zzso adjacent to zzso or zzso acid, together with a hydrogen zzso produced the most abundant zzso charged zzso zzso These zzso then formally fragmented by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced abundant losses of the zzso metal, but the resulting zzso appeared not to undergo extensive zzso Most zzso zzso from all of the zzso were zzso charged, the remainder being doubly zzso Although the zzso of the zzso + X + zzso zzso were not as zzso as those from the zzso charged zzso from other zzso they, zzso provided much valuable information on the structure of these zzso
