The relationship between the molecular structure of the zzso red and green visual zzso genes and zzso zzso as zzso by zzso was studied in 64 zzso zzso The great majority of zzso defects were associated with either the deletion of the zzso gene or the formation of zzso zzso hybrid genes or zzso zzso hybrid zzso A rapid zzso method allowed detection of hybrid zzso including those zzso by Southern zzso analysis, as well as more precise zzso of the fusion points in hybrid zzso zzso zzso defects appeared always associated with zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso of single zzso hybrid genes with fusion in zzso zzso were zzso However, carriers of hybrid genes with zzso zzso in zzso 2, 3, or 4 in the presence of additional normal green genes zzso as either zzso or zzso zzso with the majority being zzso zzso defects were associated with zzso gene zzso with zzso zzso hybrid zzso or, rarely, with zzso zzso hybrid zzso Complete zzso gene deletions or zzso zzso in zzso 1 were usually associated with zzso although we unexpectedly found three carriers of a single zzso gene without any zzso genes to be zzso zzso All but one of the other zzso subjects had zzso hybrid genes with zzso 1, 2, 3, or 4 zzso as well as several normal zzso zzso The one exception had a zzso normal gene zzso presumably with a more subtle zzso zzso acid differences in zzso 5 largely determine whether a hybrid gene will be more zzso or more zzso in zzso Various discrepancies as to severity zzso or zzso remain unexplained but may arise because of zzso of zzso zzso variation, or zzso When zzso zzso defects exist, the kind of zzso zzso or zzso can be predicted by molecular zzso zzso hybrid genes are probably always associated with zzso zzso zzso while the presence of zzso hybrid genes may not always manifest zzso with zzso zzso Four subjects who were found to have zzso zzso hybrid genes in addition to normal zzso and zzso genes had normal color vision as determined by zzso These were discovered among a group of 129 Caucasian males who had been recruited as volunteers for a vision zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
