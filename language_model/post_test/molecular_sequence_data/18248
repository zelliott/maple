zzso atmosphere of the earth did not contain oxygen gas zzso when the zzso were generated successfully as the result of chemical evolution and then zzso zzso they first had acquired zzso energy zzso zzso The cellular zzso have often been formed by zzso to combine or zzso between pre-existing zzso and newly born zzso zzso metabolism in zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso and a zzso reductive zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso zzso is made of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid cycle, which originate from a connection of zzso zzso and an zzso respiratory chain, which has been derived from the zzso These zzso already are completed in some evolved zzso for example the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it can be reasonably presumed that the zzso zzso and zzso have once been formed as the result of zzso (and zzso zzso in most evolved zzso zzso theory has explained the origin of zzso cell as that in which the zzso and zzso have been derived from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and has mentioned as one of the most potent supportive zzso that zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso show similarities to corresponding zzso zzso However, as will be shown in this discussion, many examples have shown currently that zzso sequences of zzso molecules are zzso well not only in those of the zzso and zzso molecules but also in the nuclear zzso In fact, the similarities in sequence of zzso molecules are preserved well among the organisms not only in zzso close relationships but also under highly selective pressure, that is under a zzso constraint for the species in their zzso zzso the similarities in zzso acid sequences of proteins between the zzso and the zzso are not necessarily direct evidence for their zzso zzso it gives still less evidence for a symbiotic relationship between the zzso and the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso is an important tendency in cellular evolution to guarantee high specificity and rate of the zzso It is suggested from the data that the zzso zzso are not zzso but undergo dynamic zzso Furthermore, these facts strongly support the zzso Evolution zzso which was proposed by one of the authors in zzso
