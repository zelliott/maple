The use of zzso vaccines is a novel and promising zzso approach for the development of zzso zzso This approach has been attempted in vaccine development for various virus species, including zzso Louis encephalitis, Russian zzso encephalitis, Central European encephalitis, dengue zzso 1 and 2, Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile zzso However, very little is known about the factors affecting its zzso Recently, we demonstrated that a single intramuscular zzso of DNA vaccine of Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses protected mice and horses from virus zzso Administration of these zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso particles that correlated well with the induction of protective zzso These results provided evidence that the zzso particles composed of zzso and envelope proteins are essential for zzso immune responses similar to those induced by live, attenuated virus zzso The zzso and protein processing of zzso and envelope proteins that preserve the native zzso and zzso profiles identical to zzso proteins could be determined by the effectiveness of the zzso signal sequence located at the zzso of zzso zzso The use of DNA vaccines in zzso and/or combination vaccines designed to zzso against multiple zzso is also a promising area of zzso
