The zzso zzso zzso of complex I zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso zzso of the zzso We have isolated and zzso a full-length zzso clone coding for this zzso The deduced protein is 104 zzso acid zzso long with a molecular mass of zzso zzso This particular zzso of complex I lacks a zzso zzso targeting zzso In agreement with its zzso within complex I, we have found that this zzso behaves like an intrinsic membrane zzso Nevertheless, the deduced protein is rather zzso exhibiting no zzso domain long enough to traverse a membrane in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows a significant similarity to the hinge protein of complex III, suggesting that these two zzso may be involved in identical zzso This complex I zzso is coded for by a single zzso zzso zzso zzso we located the gene on the right side of the zzso in linkage group I, linked to the zzso zzso
