The zzso genes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso types A and B, and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso amplification and DNA zzso The five zzso species have at least two copies of the zzso gene zzso arranged in tandem on the zzso The deduced zzso and zzso zzso sequences of the zzso proteins zzso of these zzso are well zzso but their central region zzso sequences are zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso protein revealed that these zzso which belong to zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster I zzso are more closely related to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso which belongs to the cluster zzso Moreover, a multiplex zzso reaction zzso system based on the zzso sequence was developed to rapidly identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso types A and B, and zzso zzso zzso of each zzso amplified a zzso zzso The multiplex zzso system may be useful for rapid identification of zzso zzso
