The terminal complement components zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are a group of serum proteins involved in the zzso killing of microbial zzso The zzso zzso share a unique core domain structure and were probably generated by the zzso of the ancestral zzso gene and subsequent addition and/or deletion of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and genes for all the zzso have been identified from zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso gene has been identified from zzso zzso using zzso zzso analysis and liver zzso zzso To clarify the evolutionary origin of zzso we performed zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso fish liver and identified the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso gene in shark suggests that one of the most crucial steps in the establishment of the zzso complement pathway, the addition of the zzso and zzso zzso to the primitive zzso occurred in a common zzso of the zzso zzso These results also indicate that the gene zzso among zzso occurred at an early stage of the zzso zzso zzso
