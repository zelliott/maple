zzso zzso are the first viral structures that can be discerned during zzso zzso The zzso consist of a zzso membrane and an outer lattice scaffold, which provides uniform zzso Relatively little is known regarding the composition of the zzso membrane or its mode of zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso which is zzso in all zzso zzso but has no discernible functional motifs or zzso zzso contributes to the formation of zzso and immature zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein was dependent on DNA replication and occurred late during zzso virus zzso Unlike many late zzso however, zzso was not incorporated into mature zzso or localized in cellular zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso an zzso zzso was constructed and shown to have a conditional lethal zzso zzso expression and infectious virus formation were dependent on zzso In the absence of zzso viral late proteins were made, but membrane and core proteins were not processed by the zzso zzso A block in zzso was demonstrated by transmission electron zzso neither typical zzso nor immature zzso were detected in the absence of zzso Instead, factory areas of the zzso contained large, zzso zzso some of which had partially coated membrane segments at their zzso zzso zzso inclusions containing the zzso scaffold protein and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso These features are most similar to those previously seen when expression of zzso another zzso zzso zzso is zzso
