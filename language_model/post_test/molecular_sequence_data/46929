We recognized a common zzso motif between the zzso zzso domain of zzso family members and zzso zzso We have shown that a zzso within the zzso motif is critical for zzso and also for its association with the zzso zzso Similarly, two zzso within the zzso delta gamma TM zzso have proven to be critical for their interaction with the zzso A three-dimensional zzso model of the zzso TM domain highlights potential zzso zzso involved either in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso alpha beta association, confirming our experimental zzso These results indicate that, for symmetrical reasons, the zzso zzso in the zzso complex assembly by interacting with zzso gamma delta TM zzso thereby masking their degradation signals located in the zzso zzso
