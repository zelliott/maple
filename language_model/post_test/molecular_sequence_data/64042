zzso factor B is a 90 zzso protein consisting of three zzso a zzso complement control zzso a von zzso factor A domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain that adopts a default inactive zzso zzso The interaction between factor B and zzso zzso is zzso by its A domain, triggering a zzso change in factor B that ultimately creates the zzso zzso of the alternative complement zzso We report the crystal structure of the A domain from factor B and show that it contains an zzso zzso motif that adopts the zzso zzso typical of zzso complexes, with an zzso zzso zzso by a fortuitous crystal zzso completing the coordination of the metal zzso Modeling studies indicate that the factor B A domain can also adopt the closed zzso supporting the hypothesis that an zzso zzso is zzso in complement proteins and perhaps in 60 other A zzso found within the human zzso
