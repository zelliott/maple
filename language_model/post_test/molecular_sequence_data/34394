This study is aimed at investigating the molecular basis of environmental adaptation of zzso mammoth zzso zzso to the harsh zzso conditions of the zzso ice zzso To this end, we have carried out a comparative zzso characterization of the structural and functional properties of zzso zzso zzso from zzso mammoth zzso zzso and Asian elephant zzso zzso in relation to human zzso zzso A and zzso zzso (a minor component of human zzso We have obtained oxygen equilibrium zzso and calculated zzso zzso zzso effects, and the apparent heat of zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the four zzso exhibit distinct structural properties and respond differently to zzso zzso In addition, the apparent heat of zzso zzso for zzso zzso is less negative than that of zzso zzso especially in zzso buffer and the presence of zzso suggesting that the oxygen affinity of mammoth blood was also less sensitive to temperature zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso data indicates that both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso whereas only the zzso interface in zzso zzso is zzso compared to that in zzso zzso The distinct structural and functional features of zzso zzso presumably facilitated zzso mammoth survival in the Arctic zzso
