A region of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA containing at least two zzso genes was zzso zzso in one gene were clearly reduced in zzso while zzso in the other were only moderately zzso Both classes of zzso were zzso and zzso and had zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso They also grew in zzso and in zzso at the same rate as the wild zzso zzso involving one of the clear zzso zzso indicated that the recovery of zzso cells from zzso zzso 24 zzso after zzso was lower than for the wild zzso This may be due to cell death as a result of action by some zzso or induced plant zzso From DNA sequencing an open reading frame was identified that zzso the site of the zzso giving a clear reduction in zzso The predicted protein sequence had no zzso with other proteins in the computer data zzso
