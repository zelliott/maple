zzso is a zzso zzso factor and a key regulator of the processes involved in cellular proliferation and zzso In addition, zzso zzso activity is linked to several pathological conditions including breast zzso A complex network of zzso proteins is largely believed to determine the zzso activity of zzso We report here the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso of tamoxifen zzso activity, which contains an zzso recognition motif and interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and its zzso zzso the partial zzso activity manifest by the zzso tamoxifen while minimally affecting zzso zzso zzso of the zzso recognition motif alters zzso binding specificity and results in a dominant negative form of zzso that leads to zzso of zzso zzso activity, allowing all classes of zzso to manifest partial zzso activity and enhancing zzso zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso binding proteins as zzso factors of the nuclear zzso family and reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso can manifest zzso activities in some zzso
