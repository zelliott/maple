zzso zzso is a widely spread zzso species which can produce potent zzso and result in zzso shellfish zzso To date, the molecular mechanisms regulating toxin zzso remain zzso This study compared protein profiles of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in the exponential phase, using two zzso differential gel zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso analysis showed that both subcultures were zzso identical with the distinctive zzso characteristics of zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the zzso and wild subcultures were genetically identical for these zzso 90 zzso expressed protein spots were identified from zzso of which 34 were zzso and 56 were zzso Using a multilayered strategy for de zzso protein sequence analysis, 67 proteins assigned to different functional categories were zzso Among them, 25 involved in zzso secondary zzso zzso protein modification and toxin zzso were zzso while 42 participating in carbon zzso stress response, zzso and protein folding were zzso This study indicated that the strengthening of certain biological processes coupled with the depression of essential reactions upstream or downstream of the toxin zzso zzso might have blocked toxin production and resulted in the loss of toxicity in the zzso zzso zzso
