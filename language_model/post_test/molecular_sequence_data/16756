The zzso zzso alpha zzso is a zzso zzso factor that regulates the expression of zzso zzso A key step in the zzso process is the initial binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso response element zzso We examined the effect of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in enhancing zzso binding affinity to single and tandem zzso Using zzso both zzso proteins are shown to enhance zzso binding and induce cooperative zzso binding on tandem zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso proteins facilitate strong zzso binding to zzso consensus zzso exhibiting binding affinities comparable with zzso binding to consensus zzso in the absence of zzso zzso These findings reveal that although zzso proteins enhance binding zzso they also relax zzso binding zzso zzso I zzso demonstrates that zzso binds very differently to consensus zzso and zzso consensus zzso whereas both zzso I and zzso III zzso show that the presence of zzso does not alter the DNA protection in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complexes support this conclusion and show that a global zzso change occurs in zzso when bound to the different zzso binding zzso Models for these interactions are discussed, together with a zzso mechanism that zzso proteins may zzso to produce these zzso
