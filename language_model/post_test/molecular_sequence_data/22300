To establish a transient zzso system in a zzso we constructed three zzso zzso by the promoter replacement and zzso of a zzso gene and zzso the zzso into zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The zzso efficiency and usefulness of the three modified zzso were estimated by identifying the expressions of the zzso and zzso protein from zzso zzso After zzso the zzso protein was functionally expressed on zzso of zzso zzso The strong zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of which the zzso promoter region in the expression zzso was replaced with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, when transgenic zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso target cells, the zzso protein was also located on zzso and zzso especially on a food cup that was formed in contact with target cells as it shown in zzso zzso zzso
