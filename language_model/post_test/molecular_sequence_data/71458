By constructing DNA zzso we have identified and cloned a human zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso 260 zzso acids represents the zzso domain which is highly zzso in all recently cloned zzso zzso zzso motifs indicate multiple zzso protein zzso Human zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso exhibits a specific activity of 58 zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso cells is essentially not inhibited by zzso it shows a high zzso for zzso of about 300 zzso and it is zzso zzso by approximately 200 zzso zzso These data zzso this zzso as type 3 zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso part moderately activate and those raised against the zzso zzso domain inhibit the zzso zzso The coexistence of two different type 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso in several human zzso including brain, suggests that these zzso are involved in distinct basic cellular zzso
