Two novel zzso transcripts have been identified that result from zzso and zzso alternative zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso B zzso editing zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso factor zzso family of related zzso The alternatively processed zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins that are components of the previously identified zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso and zzso in zzso sequence zzso binding but did not demonstrate strong binding to zzso In contrast, zzso bound strongly to zzso but demonstrated weak binding to zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso editing with less efficiency than full-length zzso These data, together with the finding that all zzso zzso were zzso in rat liver zzso (the site of zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso might compete with one another for zzso and zzso zzso binding and thereby contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso In support for this hypothesis, the ratio of nuclear zzso to zzso decreased when zzso editing was inhibited by zzso and increased when editing was zzso by zzso These findings suggested a new model for the regulation of zzso zzso editing in which the zzso potential of zzso is modulated at the level of their assembly by zzso in the relative abundance of multiple related zzso auxiliary proteins and the expression level of zzso
