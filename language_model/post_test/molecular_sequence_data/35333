No cases of wild zzso have been reported for more than one and a half years from zzso Cases of acute zzso paralysis zzso of undefined zzso continue to occur in the zzso Despite the recent discovery of the human zzso zzso in the feces of children from developing countries, there have been no studies of zzso infection in zzso 

To detect and characterize zzso in stool specimens of zzso zzso cases by zzso followed by zzso 

A total of zzso zzso samples collected from zzso cases in zzso Pradesh, India, between May 2010 and April 2011, tested negative on cell culture according to WHO algorithm, were subjected to zzso region specific zzso followed by sequencing to detect zzso zzso characterization of zzso strains was done by sequencing followed by zzso zzso 

123 zzso samples tested positive for zzso and 87 zzso were identified for genetic zzso by sequencing a zzso zzso in the partial zzso zzso zzso strains were characterized as putative species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while 5 zzso strains remain zzso The zzso infection appeared highest zzso in younger children, and showed a distinct zzso with a late summer peak and winter zzso 

This study demonstrates a diversity of zzso strains in zzso and reports the first investigation of zzso infection in children with zzso acute zzso paralysis in zzso Currently, this study provides baseline data for further studies of zzso infections in children with common enteric infections in zzso
