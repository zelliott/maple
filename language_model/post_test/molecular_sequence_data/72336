zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the processing of type I and type II zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso cause zzso in cattle and zzso and they cause type zzso zzso syndrome in humans, zzso disorders characterized by zzso of zzso and severe skin zzso zzso acid sequences for the zzso were used to obtain zzso from bovine zzso Three overlapping zzso had an zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with a complete zzso zzso an active zzso zzso that specifically zzso type I zzso The protein contained zzso sequences of the clan zzso of zzso that includes zzso zzso The protein also contained four repeats that are zzso to zzso found in zzso and in zzso and that can participate in complex zzso interactions such as zzso of zzso forms of transforming growth factor beta or the binding to zzso zzso the zzso may play a role in development that is independent of its role in collagen zzso This hypothesis was supported by the observation that in some zzso the levels of zzso for the zzso are disproportionately high relative to the apparent rate of collagen zzso
