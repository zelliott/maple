The underlying molecular basis for zzso Disease zzso is currently zzso zzso from patients with this zzso zzso bleeding disorder have multiple zzso including a markedly reduced von zzso zzso zzso due to a zzso of the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present studies, we have used an zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso for zzso I in the zzso alpha gene to study linkage between this gene and the inheritance of zzso in a family with two affected zzso Whereas the zzso was zzso showing both the zzso and zzso zzso bands of this zzso zzso her affected brother was zzso for the zzso zzso band zzso zzso these siblings did not inherit the same pair of zzso alpha zzso from their zzso Additionally, one child of the zzso was zzso while the second studied child was zzso with neither showing any evidence of zzso No construct of zzso or zzso for zzso alpha zzso in this family is consistent with a model in which one or more defective zzso alpha zzso could produce zzso zzso analysis with zzso or zzso showed entirely normal patterns in the patients, indicating the absence of any gross deletion of the zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso from patient zzso was reverse transcribed and subsequently amplified by the zzso chain reaction, demonstrating the presence of zzso alpha zzso Furthermore, trace amounts of zzso could be shown on the surface of patient zzso Based on these results, a zzso in the zzso alpha gene is unlikely to be the cause of zzso in this zzso
