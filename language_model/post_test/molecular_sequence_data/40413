A hallmark of zzso is the appearance of high levels of zzso zzso yet the roles of these modifications remain largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso at zzso 3 is directly recognized by an zzso zzso binding pocket in the zzso domain of zzso which is a member of the zzso passenger complex zzso This binding mediates recruitment of the zzso to zzso and the resulting zzso of its zzso zzso Aurora zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso which zzso zzso leads to defects in the Aurora zzso processes of zzso assembly and zzso of nuclear zzso These findings establish a direct cellular role for zzso zzso zzso zzso which is read and translated by the zzso to ensure accurate cell zzso
