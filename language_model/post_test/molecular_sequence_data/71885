Different strains of the zzso coli reference collection zzso differ widely in zzso zzso To analyze the nature of the differential gene pool carried by different zzso we have followed an approach in which random amplified zzso DNA zzso was used to generate several zzso zzso Those present in some but not all the strains were screened by zzso to assess their distribution throughout the zzso zzso Thirteen fragments with various degrees of occurrence were zzso Three of them corresponded to zzso markers of widespread zzso Of these, two were zzso genes shown by zzso to be present in all the zzso coli strains and in zzso zzso zzso the third zzso contained a zzso copy of zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso The other 10 zzso markers were found in only a few zzso However, zzso results demonstrated that four of them were actually present in a large selection of the zzso collection (between 42 and zzso of the zzso three of these fragments contained open reading frames associated with zzso or plasmids known in zzso coli zzso The remaining six fragments were present in only between one and four zzso of these, four fragments showed no similarity to any sequence in the databases, and the other two had low but significant similarity to a protein involved in the zzso capsule synthesis and to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Their percent zzso zzso content, and zzso adaptation index suggested an zzso origin by horizontal zzso These results can be interpreted as reflecting the presence of a large pool of zzso zzso whose origin could be outside the species zzso
