Core protein II of zzso zzso zzso complex is the second largest zzso zzso that is essential for the assembly of the functional zzso We have isolated, for the first time, a zzso clone for a zzso core protein zzso zzso of a zzso zzso rat liver zzso library resulted in isolation of a zzso zzso a partial sequence of rat zzso core protein II, and this cloned zzso was used as a probe for colony zzso to screen a human zzso zzso zzso By comparison with the known zzso zzso acid sequence of bovine core protein II, the zzso acid sequence deduced from a cloned human zzso was predicted to be composed of the part for the zzso extension of 14 zzso acid zzso and that for the mature zzso of zzso zzso The zzso is typical of precursors to zzso proteins in being composed of a combination neutral and basic zzso The deduced sequence shows rather low zzso with that of the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex; this finding is in contrast with the relatively high zzso observed for the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso On Northern zzso analysis of human zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to two zzso a major species of zzso zzso and a minor one of 2000 zzso Southern zzso zzso of zzso DNA suggested that the human zzso contains one or two genes for core protein zzso
