In polarized zzso cell lines, enveloped viruses are zzso released by zzso viral budding at specific plasma membrane zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso budding and zzso expression occur on zzso zzso whereas the release of zzso zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso is zzso We have examined the directional transport and surface expression of zzso and zzso envelope zzso using zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso polarized zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso both zzso and zzso surface zzso were zzso directed to zzso zzso Hence zzso expression appears to be a common property of the zzso of zzso zzso To explore the role of the zzso domain in directing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso surface, stop zzso were introduced to mimic the natural zzso zzso observed following repeated passage of these viruses in zzso These truncated zzso also were sorted to the zzso domain, but at a lower efficiency than the full-length protein zzso In contrast, when the entire zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso was deleted, the zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed on the zzso zzso These data indicate the presence of a zzso sorting signal in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso
