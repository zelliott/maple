New systems are proposed for the zzso analysis of zzso zzso sites in the gamma A and gamma G zzso genes and of zzso zzso site in the human factor IX gene of blood zzso DNA fragments amplified according to the systems described contain constant restriction site of the appropriate zzso in addition to the zzso one, which significantly improves the reliability of the zzso zzso The systems proposed are highly specific and may be used for DNA diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso
