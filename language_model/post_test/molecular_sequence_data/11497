zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso in cheese, caused by the outgrowth of zzso spores present in raw milk, can create considerable loss of product, especially in the production of zzso zzso like zzso cheese, but also in zzso and zzso zzso To demonstrate the zzso relationship between zzso zzso and late blowing in cheese, many zzso experiments were performed to provoke this zzso by using spores from several strains of the major zzso zzso A method of zzso amplification of a part of the zzso zzso gene in combination with zzso with zzso DNA zzso was developed to allow the specific detection of zzso sequences in zzso extracted from zzso The sensitivity was increased by using zzso zzso Late blowing was provoked in experimental zzso with 28 of the 32 zzso zzso strains tested, whereas experimental zzso made with spores from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed no signs of zzso acid zzso In all experimental and commercial zzso with obvious signs of late zzso DNA from zzso zzso was zzso in some cheeses, signals for zzso zzso were also zzso It was concluded that only zzso zzso strains are able to cause zzso acid zzso in zzso
