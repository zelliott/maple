zzso zzso zzso refer to a series of small, zzso zzso zzso to zzso peptides produced by zzso They are the largest group of zzso zzso peptides zzso known to zzso zzso zzso consist of two regions, the zzso zzso region, responsible for the general zzso capacity, and the variable region, responsible for the zzso zzso The small, zzso and unmodified zzso are predominantly active against many zzso bacteria by special zzso zzso The mechanism of action by which zzso kill bacteria involves an initial zzso binding of the peptides to an outer membrane zzso zzso This binding is followed by invasion of the zzso space, and by a specific and essentially irreversible combination with a zzso zzso that may be a component of a zzso zzso system on inner membrane zzso In the final step, the zzso is zzso into the interior of the cell where it meets its ultimate zzso Evidence that zzso are zzso for human and animal cells is a prerequisite for using them as novel zzso zzso This review presents the zzso zzso zzso and mechanism of action of zzso
