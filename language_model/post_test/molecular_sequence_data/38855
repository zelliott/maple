zzso tuberculosis caused by zzso zzso remains a significant disease of farmed cattle in many countries despite ongoing tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso typing methods such as restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis and zzso have been used to identify related zzso breakdowns in an attempt to identify more precisely the route of infection into cattle zzso and to trace the transmission of bovine zzso A recent geographical survey of Irish zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that a significant proportion of zzso ( approximately zzso exhibit a common strain type, limiting the value of current strain typing methods as an zzso zzso We have identified and cloned a region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which generates a clear, highly zzso zzso pattern when used as an zzso probe on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and which effectively subdivides this common strain zzso When used to type 60 Irish zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited greater zzso power than the commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DR and detected an equivalent number of strain types to a combination of these three zzso zzso also detected significantly more strain types than the zzso technique, while maintaining a high level of zzso between zzso related and unrelated zzso zzso The zzso element within zzso remains to be fully zzso however the potential for this probe to greatly decrease the workload necessary to zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis is zzso
