zzso zzso zzso are a versatile method to control zzso zzso particularly when zzso secondary structure is the zzso Here, we examine the application of zzso bridges, formed by the zzso reaction between zzso and zzso side zzso for the stabilization of a zzso zzso involved in a zzso zzso A series of sequence zzso of the zzso coiled zzso zzso bearing zzso bridges at zzso positions were prepared and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso and subsequent zzso proceed rapidly and cleanly at zzso in the folded protein zzso zzso of folding thermodynamics among a series of different zzso bridges show that the cross links are consistently stabilizing to the coiled zzso with the extent of stabilization sensitive to the exact size and structure of the zzso X-ray zzso analysis of a coiled zzso with the best cross link in place and a second structure of its linear precursor show how the bridge is zzso into an zzso zzso of a zzso zzso by simultaneous formation of two linkages in zzso demonstrates the potential use of triggered zzso formation to both trap and stabilize a particular zzso folded zzso in the bound zzso
