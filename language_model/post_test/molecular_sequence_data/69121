By means of a zzso zzso zzso procedure involving a human zzso zzso zzso which was established by zzso zzso myeloma cells and human zzso from a cancer patient, zzso was proven to be a fetal zzso of human lung and to be a zzso zzso in small cell zzso of human zzso but not of other lung zzso zzso large cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the simultaneous detection of zzso zzso zzso with rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso and, consequently, small cell lung zzso could be classified into zzso and zzso zzso zzso types, zzso and zzso respectively, which were detected in four and 27 of 31 patients' zzso and in one and three of four nude zzso small cell lung zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in small cell zzso indicated that different zzso pathways for zzso were activated to give the distinct zzso compositions in the two types of small cell lung zzso
