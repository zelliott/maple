To relate the zzso specificity of three zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso hormone zzso II zzso to their primary structure, we have zzso zzso for the variable regions of their heavy and light zzso zzso of the sequences indicates that each of the zzso zzso very closely related V genes in both heavy and light zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso display an zzso preference for the zzso zzso of zzso A third zzso zzso zzso displays a lesser specificity for the zzso zzso of zzso than either zzso or zzso This zzso differs in sequence from the others mainly in the light chain zzso determining regions zzso 1 and 3 and in zzso 3 zzso zzso on the heavy zzso We interpret these sequence differences as the basis for the observed specificity zzso
