In the present study, we zzso von zzso factor zzso assigned its entire sequence to specific zzso and related these zzso to structure using electron zzso zzso The D zzso are zzso of smaller zzso visible as zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso include von zzso D, zzso zzso zzso E or zzso type zzso zzso and a unique zzso module in zzso The zzso zzso shows 2 large connected zzso each containing smaller zzso The previous B and C regions of zzso are zzso as 6 tandem von zzso C zzso and zzso zzso These 6 zzso zzso zzso to 6 zzso zzso that associate in pairs at zzso pH in the stem region of zzso zzso zzso This correspondence is demonstrated by binding of zzso zzso to the fourth module seen in zzso zzso which bears the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso knot domain zzso zzso in a manner predicted by zzso to zzso and zzso approximately perpendicular to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso to zzso in other proteins allow many zzso bonds to be tentatively zzso which may have functional zzso
