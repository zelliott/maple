The two major envelope proteins of zzso the membrane protein zzso and the major zzso zzso associate into a zzso zzso that is incorporated into the zzso and has been assumed to be a prerequisite for virus zzso Using an zzso zzso virus zzso infectious zzso zzso we have analyzed the requirement for zzso zzso and have identified the zzso zzso involved in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso The single zzso zzso zzso in the M zzso was crucial for zzso and virus zzso zzso of any of the five zzso zzso in the zzso zzso or removal of the single zzso zzso site also rendered the full-length clone zzso However, an analysis of zzso yielded an exceptional zzso in which zzso 52 to 79 of the zzso zzso had been deleted and the original zzso zzso had been zzso zzso this zzso lacked the zzso zzso site zzso and retained only a single zzso zzso zzso By using this zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso of zzso and zzso of M are essential for zzso zzso a key event in the assembly of the zzso zzso
