The primary zzso response produces zzso zzso so to clear the initial infection, and generates a population of corresponding memory cells to prevent infection by future encounters with the same zzso The continuous genetic modification of a zzso exterior, however, is one mechanism used to evade the immune defenses of its zzso Here we describe a novel means, involving zzso zzso by which the host can counteract such pathogen genetic zzso by zzso of its primary zzso zzso An zzso response against primary zzso zzso creates zzso zzso zzso some of which zzso zzso are able to bind the zzso zzso We have discovered that binding of zzso to its corresponding zzso can expand zzso ability to bind variations of its zzso This expanded zzso zzso is shown not only to increase the binding activity of zzso but also its ability to neutralize a zzso infectious zzso zzso zzso is an zzso which is highly zzso for the zzso envelope protein zzso This zzso can be rendered zzso and zzso for an otherwise resistant zzso strain by its interaction with a unique zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, molecular characterization of this expanded zzso was accomplished using zzso zzso display zzso zzso
