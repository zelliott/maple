Studies on zzso elements of the zzso family have led to different models for zzso gap repair in either plants or zzso zzso products generated by the plant zzso elements zzso and zzso imply a more or less straightforward zzso of broken ends; zzso products of the zzso P element indicate the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent findings that zzso products of zzso and zzso can also contain traces of the element ends zzso however, that zzso repair might be an alternative repair mechanism in zzso A functional zzso repair mechanism in plants can also be deduced from the observed rapid increases of zzso copy number during plant development and from the involvement of zzso in the generation of internal zzso zzso On the other hand, alternative repair mechanisms may also be functional in zzso because some of the zzso generated upon P zzso can be explained by a mechanism that has been zzso for zzso gap repair in zzso It is concluded that plants and zzso can use similar repair mechanisms, but that the predominance of a certain repair mechanism is determined by the zzso
