The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso cryptic zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso Based on the characteristics of its putative replication zzso zzso and zzso zzso was assigned to the family of zzso small zzso identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The replication systems of these plasmids show striking similarities to the ones used by the zzso family of plasmids from zzso with respect to both zzso factors and zzso zzso Two possible zzso stabilization systems are zzso on zzso a zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso coli zzso proteins for zzso zzso resolution and an zzso zzso related to the zzso of proteins in zzso zzso zzso The proposed replication termination region of zzso has features in common with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso composed of a zzso zzso inserted in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso produced zzso that could be shuttled between zzso coli and several zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso shuttle zzso zzso was zzso maintained in zzso zzso and zzso zzso growing under zzso zzso
