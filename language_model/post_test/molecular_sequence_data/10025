A gene responsive to zzso hormone zzso has been identified in the adult rat brain cerebral zzso A zzso probe zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso rat cerebral zzso generated by reverse zzso differential display of zzso was used to screen the rat brain zzso zzso A zzso zzso positive clone zzso in Northern blots with a zzso zzso zzso that proved to be zzso responsive zzso The remaining coding sequence and a part of the zzso untranslated region of this zzso were obtained by zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that zzso protein zzso a 68 zzso zzso has zzso sequence similarity with zzso zzso protein zzso which is a zzso for zzso zzso activity of zzso The extensive similarity between the two proteins suggests a potential role for zzso as a zzso for zzso Northern analysis showed that the expression of zzso zzso in zzso rats is zzso that in zzso zzso There is also a zzso increase in the concentration of zzso as zzso by Western zzso zzso to the extensive similarity between rat zzso and human zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully used for Western analysis of proteins from the rat zzso The observed increase in both the zzso and the protein did not decline after zzso system blockade with zzso suggesting that the action of zzso on the expression of this gene is not zzso through the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso cells were particularly rich in zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso are rapidly induced in zzso after intravenous administration of zzso zzso distribution studies indicated that the cerebral tissue was particularly enriched with zzso zzso and 68 zzso zzso A zzso clone for a zzso gene could provide a useful tool to study the molecular mechanisms of zzso effects on cerebral tissue in adult zzso
