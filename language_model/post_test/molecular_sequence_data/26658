To investigate the genetic structure of the zzso Washington clam population, zzso zzso Sowerby, in zzso A portion of zzso zzso gene sequences zzso zzso for zzso comparison was zzso zzso analysis of 62 individuals collected from six regions revealed 13 zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso Package zzso subdivided the zzso Washington clam into two zzso zzso zzso A and B), weak supported groups zzso 65 of zzso zzso This zzso subdivision was also in accordance with geographic zzso one each at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the other at zzso zzso genetic analysis subdivided these two population groups with a geographic distance zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, in the zzso population, the maximum sequence divergence zzso and minimum zzso diversity zzso were shown in which might be reflective of a relatively small population size and the geographical isolation of the population as compared with other zzso However, a very high migration rate zzso zzso zzso and a very low level of geographic distance zzso zzso zzso were noted to exist among the South and East Sea zzso suggesting that individuals between populations should show a significantly active genetic mixing and migration regardless of zzso These findings allowed us to conclude that the zzso Washington clam populations occurring in the South and East Sea were formed with randomly dispersed zzso
