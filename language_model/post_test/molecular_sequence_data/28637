zzso display technology has been applied in many fields of biological and medical sciences to study molecular interactions and especially in the generation of zzso zzso of human zzso However, extremely low display level of zzso molecules on the surface of zzso is an intrinsic problem of a zzso display system resulting in low success rate of zzso specific binding zzso We show here that display of zzso zzso zzso zzso generated with zzso zzso can be increased dramatically by using a genetically modified zzso zzso has a zzso zzso gene that produces a functional zzso zzso in suppressing zzso coli strains but does not make any zzso in zzso zzso zzso Packaging zzso zzso zzso fusion in zzso zzso zzso strains with zzso enhanced the display level of zzso fragments on the surfaces of zzso zzso particles resulting in an increase of zzso zzso zzso compared to packaging with zzso helper zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso provides a system for the efficient enrichment of specific binding zzso from a zzso display library and, zzso increases the chance of obtaining more diverse zzso specific for target zzso
