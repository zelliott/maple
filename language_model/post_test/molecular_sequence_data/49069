To study the zzso effects of zzso from zzso zzso 

zzso activity of zzso was tested by zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was determined by characterization of zzso in zzso A zzso system, rabbit zzso zzso was introduced to zzso the zzso activity of zzso on protein zzso 

The zzso had a powerful zzso action upon protein synthesis in zzso zzso with an zzso (95 % confidence zzso value of zzso zzso zzso The zzso (95 % confidence zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and human zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have no toxic to zzso cells and normal cells zzso After the zzso of zzso was treated with zzso and zzso at zzso condition, a zzso zzso of approximately 450 zzso appeared, but this zzso did not occur after treatment with zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that there were relatively high similarities among zzso The percentages of zzso between zzso and zzso A chain, between zzso and zzso were found to be 54 % and 57 % zzso zzso the zzso zzso forming the active sites of the A chain of zzso and zzso occurred in zzso 

zzso has an obvious zzso effect and its mechanisms are related to the zzso zzso
