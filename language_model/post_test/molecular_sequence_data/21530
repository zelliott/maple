zzso membrane proteins are integrated zzso into the membrane of the zzso zzso in a process zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso chain gain access to the surrounding membrane through a lateral gate in the wall of the zzso channel zzso den Berg B, et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso J, et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso To clarify the nature of the zzso process, we have measured the zzso efficiency into the zzso zzso membrane of model zzso segments containing zzso zzso and aromatic zzso zzso We find that an zzso zzso contribution to the apparent free energy of zzso is directly zzso to the zzso accessible surface area of its side chain, as expected for zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso But unlike zzso zzso characterized by a zzso zzso zzso of 23 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for transfer from zzso to zzso is 6-10 zzso zzso zzso pointing to important differences between zzso zzso and simple zzso zzso Our results provide compelling evidence for a zzso zzso model and insights into the physical properties of the zzso
