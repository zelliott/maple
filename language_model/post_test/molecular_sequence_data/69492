Two zzso linked genes are present in the zzso zzso zzso that code for the zzso zzso PO zzso The genes are identical in the coding region, although a striking lack of zzso sequence conservation is observed when the boundaries of the coding regions between both genes are zzso The 3' untranslated regions of the two genes are, moreover, different in zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso PO protein zzso shows a high degree of sequence zzso including the highly charged zzso zzso domain, with the zzso PO proteins of other zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments showed that two different size class transcripts are expressed in the gene cluster and that the steady state level of each of the transcripts in zzso phase zzso is markedly zzso The abundance of both transcripts is zzso in zzso cultures on reaching stationary zzso Since it seems that the two zzso zzso PO genes are expressed in a single zzso transcript, it is likely that the different levels of PO zzso observed in cultured cells is due to a zzso regulatory zzso
