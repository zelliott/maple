We describe a simple approach for molecular characterization and locus assignment of structural zzso by direct sequencing of zzso amplified DNA selective to alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso gene zzso zzso substitution of two structural zzso zzso II alpha zzso and J Mexico alpha zzso were determined and their zzso zzso were zzso The amplified segment encompasses sequences upstream of the zzso box to downstream of the zzso addition zzso Hence all of the alpha zzso structural zzso and most of the zzso alpha zzso zzso should be zzso by this zzso
