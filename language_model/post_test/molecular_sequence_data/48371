This study analyzes the application of degenerative zzso for the screening of zzso salt zzso genes zzso in various zzso zzso In the first stage, the design and evaluation of the universal zzso zzso for amplifying the partial coding sequence of zzso salt zzso in zzso were zzso The amplified zzso gene fragments were zzso and the obtained sequences were compared to the zzso genes present in zzso The determined results showed the utility of the designed zzso zzso for the amplification of partial gene zzso zzso salt zzso in different zzso zzso Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that zzso salt zzso genes may be used as valuable molecular markers for zzso studies and identification of even closely related members of the zzso zzso
