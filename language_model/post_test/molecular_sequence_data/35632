The zzso diagnosis of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso in zzso using a transgenic mouse model for the trait of human zzso zzso has been zzso A sensitive procedure was developed for the amplification of the human zzso gene sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were undertaken on one to five zzso zzso cells and isolated zzso of the zzso mouse zzso After biopsy the zzso were cultured whilst the cells were zzso for the presence of the zzso and a high proportion zzso were viable as assessed by the presence of a zzso cavity within a zzso zzso The majority of the zzso cultured zzso were frozen and used to confirm the zzso 90 zzso cultured zzso were transferred to zzso recipients and zzso established zzso zzso from day zzso zzso fetuses was also used to confirm the original zzso The time zzso zzso required to carry out the analysis zzso a need for extended culture or zzso of the zzso zzso In individual experiments under optimal conditions, the presence of the zzso in zzso cells was detected with zzso zzso and the zzso analysis was sensitive at the zzso zzso The overall success rate of diagnosis and confirmation of the presence or absence of the human zzso sequence in the zzso zzso was zzso Over the entire experimental period zzso zzso DNA contamination from a variety of sources did occasionally zzso the methods used to overcome this problem are zzso
