Ran is a nuclear zzso zzso that is required for various nuclear events including the zzso transport of proteins and zzso through the nuclear pore complex, zzso formation, and zzso of the nuclear zzso One of the key regulators of Ran is zzso a Ran specific zzso zzso zzso The question of whether a mechanism exists for controlling zzso transport through the regulation of zzso activity continues to be zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was identified as the major zzso site, by zzso zzso Site directed zzso at this position abolished the zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso such as zzso and zzso strongly suggest that zzso zzso II zzso is the responsible zzso Although the zzso of zzso of zzso did not significantly alter its GAP activity, the zzso wild type zzso but not a zzso harboring a zzso at the zzso site zzso efficiently formed a stable zzso complex with Ran and zzso in zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso affects the Ran zzso
