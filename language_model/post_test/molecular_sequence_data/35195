Sister zzso separation depends on the activity of zzso which in turn requires the zzso of its zzso zzso It has been speculated that zzso also supports the zzso of zzso In this study, we found that zzso was the major zzso zzso expressed in most normal and cancer cell zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso called zzso was unable to interact with zzso Using zzso between zzso and zzso and other approaches, we zzso a single zzso acid that accounted for the loss of zzso function in zzso zzso of the zzso position in zzso zzso switched zzso from an inhibitor into an zzso of zzso In agreement with this, zzso lacking zzso was able to trigger premature sister zzso zzso zzso introduction of zzso into zzso is sufficient to allow it to bind zzso These data demonstrate that while the motif containing zzso has a strong affinity for zzso and is involved in zzso it, another zzso is involved in zzso zzso and has a weaker affinity for zzso Although zzso lacks zzso function, its differences from zzso provide evidence of independent zzso and zzso functions of zzso on zzso
