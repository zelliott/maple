This study aimed to assess the usefulness of a zzso approach to the detection and differentiation of zzso strains in infected zzso The conservation of potential zzso zzso primer zzso sites within the 16 zzso S zzso gene zzso zzso regions of zzso species was confirmed following sequence analysis of the zzso zzso regions of four previously untested zzso The extent of zzso variation within the specific zzso was assessed by comparison of sequences obtained from 17 strains of four zzso zzso Eight sequence zzso were zzso Each species for which multiple strains were tested possessed at least two zzso zzso regions zzso but the differences between these strains were markedly less than those observed zzso zzso analysis was performed on 60 zzso obtained from blood zzso collected from zzso zzso communities in which zzso infections were known to be highly zzso Twelve zzso were encountered, only five of which had been found among the studied zzso zzso zzso zzso region amplification followed by product sequence analysis offers a potentially sensitive and totally zzso means of zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso and its use in this study has broadened our knowledge of the zzso spectrum of zzso associated with natural infections among UK zzso zzso
