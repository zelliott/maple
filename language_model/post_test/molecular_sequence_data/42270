We have isolated and zzso 20 S zzso from zzso zzso and characterized their zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed 13 distinct zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso indicated that the preparation was zzso zzso each individual zzso appeared to have the full set of zzso We have not obtained any evidence for changes in zzso composition at different zzso zzso The zzso clones coding for two zzso (4 and zzso both of the zzso have been cloned and zzso It has been shown by zzso zzso that each zzso is composed of two identical halves, related to each other by C2 zzso The resulting model implies that the zzso and zzso have a fixed pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso are found both in the zzso and, in higher zzso in the zzso
