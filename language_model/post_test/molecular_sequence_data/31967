As species colonize new zzso they must adapt to the local zzso Much of this adaptation is thought to occur at the regulatory zzso however, the relationships among genetic zzso expression variation and adaptation are poorly zzso zzso zzso which expanded from an ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa around 15 zzso years ago, represents an excellent model system for studying regulatory zzso Here, we focus on the gene zzso which differs in expression between an African and a European population of zzso zzso The expression difference is caused by variation within a zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso coding zzso zzso of sequence variation indicate that this zzso was the target of recent positive selection, suggesting that the expression difference is zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso in new population samples from Europe, Asia, northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa revealed that sequence zzso is greatly reduced outside the ancestral zzso A derived zzso absent in sub-Saharan Africa is at high frequency in all other zzso These observations are consistent with a selective sweep accompanying the range expansion of the zzso The new data help identify the sequence changes responsible for the difference in zzso zzso
