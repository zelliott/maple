zzso were collected in zzso province in 2002, four virus strains were isolated by zzso of zzso onto zzso cell zzso The viruses were zzso Multiple alignment and zzso analysis were carried out by zzso X zzso zzso acid zzso analysis was carried out by zzso zzso 

Biological characters of four newly isolated strains were examined and it was found that all of them could produce zzso effect zzso in zzso cells, killing sucking zzso zzso tests showed that all of these zzso reacted positively to zzso zzso zzso and E gene regions were amplified and zzso zzso analysis showed that all the newly isolated zzso strains belong to zzso zzso Using the vaccine strains zzso as control, analysis of the E gene of the new strains and two zzso strains zzso zzso isolated previously from zzso province showed that these new zzso zzso sequence had a zzso of up to zzso and the zzso acid sequence zzso up to zzso zzso Compared with the standard zzso vaccine strain zzso and the four new zzso the zzso sequence zzso was zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso Compared with vaccine strain, there were seven common variations in all the four newly isolated zzso 

Four zzso virus strains were isolated in zzso zzso As compared to the vaccine strain, six variations were found in the newly isolated strains at the eight sites relevant to the zzso of the zzso
