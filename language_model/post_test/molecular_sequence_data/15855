We have isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso the embryonic zzso of the zzso zzso light chain zzso from a human fetal skeletal muscle zzso The zzso clones were detected by their weak zzso to a human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the complete zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame for 197 zzso zzso The derived protein sequence constitutes the first structural information on this zzso zzso of any zzso zzso structural similarities to other zzso zzso zzso particularly to those of the zzso type, are zzso Under conditions of high zzso the zzso clone zzso to an abundant zzso species in fetal zzso muscle and adult zzso muscle, whereas in fetal skeletal muscle only a very zzso zzso zzso component was zzso These zzso were indistinguishable by size and the zzso stability of their hybrids formed with the DNA insert of clone zzso We therefore conclude that identical zzso is expressed in these zzso presumably transcribed from the same zzso According to its pattern of zzso zzso the novel zzso zzso described here was designated as zzso and zzso zzso light zzso zzso in reference to its zzso zzso and zzso appearance in embryonic skeletal muscle, fetal zzso and adult zzso
