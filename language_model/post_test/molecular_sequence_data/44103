We have previously reported the zzso sequences of gene 2 zzso zzso protein zzso gene 6 zzso zzso protein zzso and the 3' end untranslated region of a novel avian infectious zzso virus zzso strain, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 259 zzso In the present report we describe the sequences of the remaining genes of this strain zzso 3, 4 and 5) with the exception of gene 1 zzso zzso zzso Gene 3 contained three open reading frames zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 195 and 282 zzso zzso zzso Gene 4 zzso zzso protein zzso consisted of zzso zzso with a single zzso of 687 zzso Gene 5 contained two zzso zzso and zzso with 198 and zzso zzso zzso Thus, in total, there were zzso zzso from the zzso end of S protein gene to the 3' end of the zzso zzso The overall zzso sequence zzso between gene 3, 4, and 5 of zzso and those of other strains were between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid zzso sequence zzso revealed that gene zzso and zzso were more zzso than zzso zzso and zzso Each individual gene of zzso strain (with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso had a different level of zzso with the zzso gene of other zzso suggesting that the evolution of zzso strains in general has been a complex, and as yet, poorly understood zzso
