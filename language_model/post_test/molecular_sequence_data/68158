To facilitate the introduction of specific point zzso in plasmids that are too large to be amplified efficiently by a single zzso we have developed a method for zzso zzso by generating partial zzso fragments, which introduces changes as simply as conventional zzso zzso containing a zzso of the human zzso virus zzso zzso envelope gene were subjected to zzso with four pairs of zzso zzso for each desired point zzso One primer in each of two of these four pairs contained the desired zzso The four pairs of zzso were designed so that four overlapping fragments were amplified from the zzso template, two of which contained the zzso These fragments were then zzso and zzso directly into zzso zzso The desired zzso was typically found in zzso to zzso of the resulting zzso The technique is almost as simple as previous techniques, shows similar efficiency and is zzso to plasmids that would normally be too large for efficient zzso zzso The entire zzso from zzso amplification to zzso into zzso coli, can be completed in one zzso
