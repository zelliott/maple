The zzso characteristic of strain zzso of zzso zzso that is most relevant from the zzso point of view appears to be the capacity of growth under zzso conditions using zzso as electron zzso This property is not restricted to this species only within the zzso zzso since it is also present in strains of zzso 1 or 5, and 3 of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described as a zzso species, but the isolation of zzso that are able to grow zzso in the presence of nitrate is possible after zzso under selective zzso The subdivision of zzso zzso into a number of species on the basis of these characteristics does not help to clarify the zzso relationships among the members of an otherwise coherent group of zzso and the considerations presented in this communication support the zzso of the new species name zzso zzso which in our opinion, should be considered as a Junior name of zzso zzso A zzso sequence analysis, together with a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gives new insights into the zzso and evolution of the zzso
