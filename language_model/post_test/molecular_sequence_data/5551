We have zzso a previously zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein gene zzso The new segment includes genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and part of zzso These zzso zzso genes map in the same order as the genes in the zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso Two potential promoter sequences were identified, one approximately 200 bases and the other approximately 140 bases upstream of the zzso zzso The activities of the two promoters were demonstrated by primer extension analysis, in zzso zzso experiments, and in zzso promoter fusion zzso zzso In agreement with previous reports, our Northern analysis of zzso growing cells failed to identify zzso or other active promoters within the zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the two zzso promoters reported here are responsible for zzso a zzso transcript for all of the genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso
