Sugar zzso are central zzso to mediate zzso transport of zzso into the cells, and sugar availability may serve as a signal to regulate the sugar zzso However, the mechanisms of sugar transport regulation by signal sugar availability remain unclear in plant and animal zzso Here, we report that a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso both localized to plasma zzso were identified from apple zzso zzso zzso Using a combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the two distinct sugar zzso were shown to interact physically with an apple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso In the zzso systems, the two different interaction complexes function to zzso the affinity of the sugar zzso allowing cells to adapt to sugar zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also interacts with the two sugar zzso and functions zzso The point zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso interactions but without significantly affecting the zzso activities, abolish the stimulating effects of the sugar zzso zzso complex on the affinity of the sugar zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an additional interacting partner of the two plant sugar zzso has no function in the regulation of the sugar zzso indicating that the observed biological functions in the zzso systems are specific to plant zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the plant cells tailor sugar zzso to the surrounding sugar zzso
