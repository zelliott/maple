zzso and zzso are members of the transforming growth zzso zzso sharing a common zzso but with opposite biological activities on the release of zzso hormone from zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso is the long sought after zzso induction factor in zzso To determine if zzso and zzso affect the proliferation and differentiation of chick limb bud zzso cells during cartilage formation of the zzso zzso human zzso A and zzso A were tested on stage 24 chick limb bud zzso zzso The results showed that zzso A has an zzso effect on zzso zzso as indicated by zzso blue zzso and decreased zzso incorporation into zzso In addition, the expression of type II collagen zzso a specific zzso marker of cartilage, was greatly inhibited when cultures were exposed to zzso A for 5 days at a dose of 10 zzso In contrast, zzso A zzso cartilage formation, as indicated by increased expression of type II collagen zzso and synthesis of zzso These results imply that zzso A and zzso A can zzso zzso during differentiation of limb bud cells in zzso
