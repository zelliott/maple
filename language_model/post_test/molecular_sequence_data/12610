zzso zzso II zzso is an zzso involved in the processing of zzso zzso Using a previously isolated zzso zzso clone as a probe, we have isolated zzso clones encompassing the human zzso zzso open reading frame and initiated isolation of human zzso zzso During the isolation of zzso zzso genes related to that zzso zzso were zzso One such gene was found to zzso an zzso designated zzso A zzso zzso clone zzso zzso was then isolated from a human melanoma zzso zzso However, comparison between zzso and zzso zzso suggested that the cloned zzso encodes a truncated zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso while zzso consists of zzso zzso acid zzso To zzso the sequence of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed with zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso products with the zzso zzso sequence revealed that alternative zzso of the zzso transcript can result in an additional transcript zzso a zzso acid zzso Northern analysis showed zzso of zzso in various zzso suggesting that the zzso gene is a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso containing the full-length open reading frame showed an increase of zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to human zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene was mapped to zzso
