The development of resistance to zzso drugs targeted against zzso is an increasing clinical problem in the treatment of zzso zzso Many patients develop drug-resistant strains of the virus after treatment with inhibitor cocktails zzso zzso which include multiple zzso zzso zzso it is imperative that we understand the mechanisms by which the viral zzso in particular zzso zzso develop zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso in complex with the potent zzso inhibitor zzso at zzso A zzso We have also obtained the crystal structures of three zzso forms of zzso zzso containing one zzso three zzso zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso in complex with zzso The three zzso zzso arose zzso under ex zzso selective pressure in the presence of zzso and exhibit zzso zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso This series of zzso crystal structures offers insights into the zzso and structural mechanisms by which the zzso can overcome zzso by zzso while recovering some of its native zzso zzso
