We previously identified a third type of the zzso large zzso named zzso as a zzso whose zzso is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle at levels approximately zzso more abundant than those of the conventional zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso were screened by two zzso zzso raised against two specific sequences in zzso but the zzso protein could not be zzso To examine this apparent zzso between the amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was expressed normally in zzso cells, only very small amounts of the protein and its presumed degradation products were detected by the zzso described zzso A series of zzso deletion zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso cells and zzso cells, a rat zzso cell zzso When zzso one of the specific regions of zzso was completely zzso the truncated zzso proteins were expressed zzso and the amount of the expressed proteins was at least zzso higher than with zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso zzso was introduced to change the presumed zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso the zzso zzso proteins were highly expressed like the zzso zzso These results indicate the zzso 1) The zzso for zzso is normally transcribed in zzso zzso and muscle zzso 2) the zzso protein becomes active in the zzso immediately after zzso 3) the zzso protein virtually disappears from cells by zzso degradation; and 4) the zzso zzso region plays an important role in this zzso In zzso translation experiments support this zzso Furthermore, zzso shows nuclear zzso when expressed in zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso in muscle is discussed on the basis of the analysis of these zzso
