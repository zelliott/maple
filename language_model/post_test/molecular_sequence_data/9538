In modern zzso DNA zzso is particularly useful where zzso parameters are difficult to determine or useless zzso to the poor quality of zzso These situations are frequent in zzso Here, we present an integrated study, based on both DNA zzso and zzso analysis, on zzso belonging to the zzso zzso for which zzso is still largely zzso In particular, we characterized zzso from Italian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domestic cats zzso zzso zzso and hybrids zzso Adult zzso were collected by zzso examinations of the hosts and zzso identified as zzso zzso We produced zzso zzso sequences for all the zzso zzso and we compared them with reference sequences of individuals belonging to the zzso zzso retrieved from zzso In order to evaluate the performance of a DNA zzso approach to discriminate these zzso the strength of correlation between species identification based on classical zzso and the molecular divergence of zzso sequences was zzso Our study provides clear evidence that DNA zzso is highly efficient to reveal the presence of cryptic lineages within zzso zzso zzso Indeed, we detected three zzso molecular lineages within the whole panel of specimens zzso identified as zzso Two of these molecular groups were already identified by other authors and should be ranked at species zzso The third molecular group encompasses only samples collected in Italy during this study, and it represents a third candidate species, still zzso zzso
