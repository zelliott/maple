zzso is a globally significant zzso caused by zzso zzso Iron is essential for growth of most bacterial zzso Since iron availability is low in the host, pathogens have evolved complex iron acquisition mechanisms to survive and establish zzso In many bacteria, expression of iron zzso and storage proteins is regulated by zzso zzso zzso encodes four predicted zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso in one of these, zzso We conducted zzso analysis to identify zzso genes and to study the effects of zzso zzso on gene zzso Under zzso conditions, 43 genes were zzso and 49 genes were zzso in the wild zzso Genes zzso proteins with predicted involvement in zzso zzso transport and metabolism (including zzso proteins and outer membrane transport zzso were overrepresented in the zzso list, while zzso of zzso expressed genes had no known zzso There were 16 zzso genes of unknown function which are absent from the zzso zzso zzso and which therefore may zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes was not significantly affected by zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is not a global regulator of iron zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes and a putative zzso in the zzso suggested that zzso is more similar to zzso a regulator of the zzso stress zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso was more resistant to zzso stress than the wild zzso Our results provide insights into the role of iron in zzso metabolism and regulation of the zzso stress response, including genes likely to be important for zzso
