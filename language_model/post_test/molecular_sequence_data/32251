To screen zzso expressed genes in zzso with zzso B virus zzso infection and to discuss the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso tissue specimens from zzso and zzso DNA positive pregnant women were used as the study group and 30 zzso tissue specimens from normal pregnant women with zzso and zzso DNA zzso were served as the control zzso The suppression zzso zzso zzso technique was zzso Total zzso of zzso tissue of the study group were mixed as the zzso and total zzso of zzso tissue of the control group were mixed as the zzso A zzso zzso library was constructed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the library were carried out with zzso coli strain zzso by reverse spot zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso tissue with zzso zzso 

Colony zzso showed that the clones contained 200 - 1000 zzso zzso Thirty five clones were confirmed by reverse spot zzso and analyzed by sequencing and zzso Thirty three known genes and 2 genes with unknown function were zzso zzso preliminarily confirmed that zzso gene was zzso in zzso infected zzso 

The zzso expressed genes in zzso with zzso B virus zzso infection using zzso technique has been screened out zzso These zzso expressed genes zzso proteins participating in cell vital metabolism and zzso and signal zzso zzso This finding brings some new clues for studying the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
