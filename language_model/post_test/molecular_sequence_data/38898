zzso proteins are important zzso zzso regulators characterized by the presence of one or several double zinc finger zzso the zzso zzso which are zzso zzso Using the zzso of the previously described zzso zzso protein zzso from sunflower as a zzso probe we have isolated the coding sequence for a related protein from zzso libraries from various sunflower zzso This zzso zzso is 188 zzso acids long and, like the zzso protein zzso contains two zzso zzso separated by a 48 zzso zzso zzso The two sunflower proteins are structurally related to the animal zzso proteins zzso and zzso A zzso gene transcript was detected by zzso in all zzso and zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso expressed and zzso protein recognize a zzso of zzso 50 zzso in these zzso zzso studies detect the protein in many cell types in each of these zzso where it is localized either to the zzso the nucleus, or zzso The protein is often associated with zzso and smaller cellular structures or zzso In late zzso and early zzso of dividing cells from zzso stems and roots it accumulates in the zzso and may therefore also play a role in zzso
