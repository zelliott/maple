zzso zzso accumulates zzso as an zzso regulatory zzso in response to zzso zzso Upon a decrease in the external zzso the zzso zzso levels should be adjusted in order to attain zzso zzso In this study, the patterns and zzso of zzso export from zzso zzso were zzso Upon a decrease in external zzso zzso was rapidly exported from cells to the external zzso The amount of zzso released from the cells was zzso to the degree of change in the external zzso The export process was well controlled and was not affected by reduced zzso This points to zzso zzso controlling zzso export using specialized zzso proteins as has been found in zzso zzso where a zzso family channel protein zzso is zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso databases revealed a putative transport protein zzso with zzso to zzso channel proteins of the zzso zzso However, expression of the gene into the zzso zzso strain lacking a zzso channel protein zzso zzso did not complement the zzso in zzso export during zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect zzso zzso or release in zzso zzso The patterns and zzso of zzso release in the zzso were similar to those of the wild type strains suggesting that the export process is independent of zzso the only putative zzso family zzso channel zzso in zzso zzso While the process of zzso export in response to zzso stress is similar to budding zzso the underlying molecular mechanism in zzso zzso appears distinct from that described in zzso zzso Further studies are needed to zzso the zzso role of the zzso zzso
