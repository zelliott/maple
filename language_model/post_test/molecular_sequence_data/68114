We have zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso either with an zzso or a zzso zzso recognized by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the efficiency of transient zzso and to establish human embryonic kidney zzso cell clones showing stable high level expression of zzso Analysis of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso is an integral plasma membrane zzso zzso oriented zzso as predicted for other members of this class of seven pass membrane zzso In addition, zzso was expressed in zzso cells to high levels as a zzso membrane zzso The easily zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso as exemplified for zzso in zzso cells, provides a suitable system for further functional studies and offers an efficient screening tool for the identification of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
