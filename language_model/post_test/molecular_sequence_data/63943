The zzso family is a zzso of zzso genes suggested to perform a zzso function in the patterning of the early zzso We had already isolated a member of this gene family zzso in zzso zzso which has a very complex expression pattern during zzso To identify the regulatory elements controlling its zzso zzso we have characterized the gene structure and the regulatory upstream zzso By zzso experiments, we demonstrated that a zzso region located upstream of the gene contains all the regulatory elements able to reproduce its spatial expression zzso zzso progressively truncated fragments of this region, three discrete and separate regions driving zzso reporter gene expression in the zzso zzso primordial zzso and neural territories have been zzso We further investigated the zzso necessary for zzso zzso in the nervous system during embryonic development by in zzso and in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of overlapping wild type and zzso zzso demonstrated that a unique sequence of 30 zzso is involved in zzso neural zzso from zzso to zzso zzso This sequence contains consensus binding sites for various ubiquitous zzso factors such as zzso whose possible implication in formation of the regulatory complexes is zzso
