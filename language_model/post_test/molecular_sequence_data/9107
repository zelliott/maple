zzso and zzso zzso male zzso zzso and zzso are the core components for hybrid breeding in zzso zzso rice based on the zzso system using zzso and zzso lines has been successfully developed and applied widely in zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of zzso and zzso remains zzso In this study, we mapped and cloned a major zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso male zzso locus on zzso zzso which zzso zzso in the zzso rice line zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso rice line zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso was able to restore the zzso fertility of zzso and zzso plants in genetic zzso zzso encodes a unique zzso zzso which produces a zzso small zzso that we named zzso A substitution of zzso in zzso the only zzso relative to zzso is present in the zzso small zzso namely zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso sequence of zzso in transgenic zzso and zzso plants also produced zzso and restored zzso zzso The small zzso was expressed zzso in young zzso but its expression was not markedly affected by different day lengths or zzso Our results reveal that the point zzso in zzso which probably leads to a zzso for zzso constitutes a common cause for zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso lines, zzso Our findings thus suggest that this zzso small zzso gene is an important regulator of male development controlled by zzso between the genetic networks and environmental zzso
