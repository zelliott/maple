We identified two alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso targeting signal 1 zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We characterized the molecular and functional differences between the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There is only a zzso of zzso in the rice zzso and zzso analysis points to alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso region zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that this region affected zzso expression of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso and zzso are able to restore zzso of a model zzso protein zzso into zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso via specific interaction zzso and zzso with each other and zzso to form zzso Although zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso zzso of zzso only resulted in partial zzso
