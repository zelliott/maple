Channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned to investigate its structure, evolution, and expression in different zzso zzso is an important gene in the zzso zzso the main zzso of the stress zzso zzso gene was isolated from a zzso zzso library and zzso sequence was zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a protein of 212 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein contains a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso zzso intermediate lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein does not contain a zzso region and most of the joining zzso and part of the zzso are zzso zzso sequence alignment showed the highest similarity with the carp zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso II zzso while the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most zzso The average similarity was zzso among the 44 zzso proteins from 36 different species zzso Compared to the zzso zzso levels in the zzso the concentration of the zzso zzso was zzso in the anterior kidney and zzso in all the other zzso except in the skin where the lowest expression zzso was zzso zzso architecture of channel zzso zzso is highly similar to those from other zzso
