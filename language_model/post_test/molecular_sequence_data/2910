zzso infection zzso a large increase in the DNA binding activity of a cellular zzso factor that is zzso by the viral zzso promoter and termed zzso Using zzso zzso we have developed an zzso for the in zzso zzso of DNA binding activity of zzso zzso activity is zzso in zzso extracts but upon incubation with a fraction from zzso cells, there is an zzso increase in zzso DNA binding zzso This increase does not occur using an equivalent fraction from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with an infected cell fraction restores zzso activity as does incubation with a known protein zzso In contrast, incubation with an extract from zzso cells does not restore zzso We conclude that the DNA binding activity of zzso is regulated by zzso in an zzso zzso
