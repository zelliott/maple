The zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso acid sequences surrounding 196 zzso sites extracted from the National zzso Research Foundation zzso zzso When analyzed according to the cumulative zzso specificity model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these data were found to be consistent with an zzso active site which interacts with an zzso long segment of the zzso spanning 3 zzso acid zzso preceding and 4 zzso acid zzso following the zzso zzso or zzso The model zzso independent interactions of the 8 zzso acid zzso with their respective binding sites, designated as zzso zzso through zzso and zzso to zzso High selectivity is expressed at all zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso The zzso specificity was confirmed by in zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins containing predicted sites for zzso and synthetic peptides designed to be zzso zzso In synthetic peptides the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso about 35 times faster than zzso Our results suggest that the specificity of the zzso is not dependent on any particular secondary structure of the zzso but, rather, it is determined by the zzso acids in the zzso zzso segment as well as by the accessibility of this zzso It also appears likely that bovine zzso zzso is able to catalyze in zzso the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso
