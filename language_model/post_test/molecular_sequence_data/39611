The zzso of zzso c zzso requires coordination between the nucleus and zzso because both these compartments provide the structural zzso of this zzso In addition, zzso membrane zzso and assembly of the zzso zzso zzso are controlled in a concerted way by numerous zzso factors, including zzso and zzso which play successive roles in zzso assembly in zzso zzso These two factors share a weak structural similarity and define two zzso of the zzso gene family, whose members facilitate the membrane zzso of various zzso proteins into diverse biological zzso In this study, we have analyzed a second human and a third zzso zzso member of the zzso We show, by deletion in the zzso zzso zzso as well as expression and functional zzso experiments in both zzso that these new genes belong to the zzso rather than to the zzso zzso So far, the zzso zzso gene zzso is the smallest functional member of this gene zzso zzso gives rise to various zzso with different coding zzso and we show that zzso and zzso are expressed at a low level and appear to be zzso zzso This zzso control contrasts with the zzso abundance of the zzso zzso and might reflect major functional differences between these nevertheless structurally related zzso
