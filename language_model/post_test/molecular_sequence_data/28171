A segment of the zzso region of the chicken cardiac zzso zzso gene extending from zzso zzso to the zzso start site is sufficient to allow zzso zzso In this paper, we zzso by zzso analysis, sequence elements which are essential for the promoter zzso Furthermore, we present evidence for a zzso element which is possibly involved in zzso the muscle zzso Nuclear proteins specifically bind to the DNA zzso as demonstrated by gel mobility shift zzso and zzso I protection zzso The significance of the zzso interactions for the function of the promoter in zzso is demonstrated by competition experiments in which zzso zzso were zzso into zzso of zzso where they successfully zzso for the protein factors which are required to trans activate the zzso zzso The ability to bind nuclear proteins involves two closely spaced zzso sequence zzso one of which constitutes the zzso zzso The binding properties correlate well with the capacity to activate zzso in zzso since zzso in this region of the promoter zzso lead to loss of binding and zzso zzso
