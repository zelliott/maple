zzso zzso zzso zzso detects an zzso zzso and is useful for the zzso of zzso zzso We established a sandwich zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso against a breast zzso zzso core protein as a catcher and a zzso zzso With this zzso system, the binding of the zzso zzso zzso to an zzso in the human kidney tissue zzso was clearly inhibited by zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso showed a significant binding activity to the synthetic zzso corresponding to the tandem repeat of a human zzso zzso core zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso could detect the zzso core of a zzso and may be of use for studying zzso as a gene zzso
