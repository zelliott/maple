We conducted zzso sequence amplification zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso based on consensus of zzso repeat zzso using zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, liver, and lung of water buffalo zzso zzso and uncovered 25 zzso of six different sizes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 324 base zzso These fragments, cloned and zzso were found to represent several functional, zzso and structural zzso zzso search of all the 25 zzso showed zzso with 43 zzso genes across the zzso Of these, the zzso fragment, having zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso changes at six identical places in the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso fragments showed zzso with the zzso modular calcium binding protein zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed maximum expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gamma zzso genes in the zzso zzso in the liver, and the zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso compared to those used as zzso zzso We zzso that these genes have evolved from a common zzso and zzso to various biological functions during the course of zzso zzso approach coupled with real-time zzso has zzso to uncover accurate expression of a large number of genes within and across the species zzso the screening of zzso zzso
