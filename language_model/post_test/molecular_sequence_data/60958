As a first step in determining whether there are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that are associated with nicotine addiction, we isolated zzso clones of the zzso genes from human and mouse zzso zzso Although zzso sequences were available for the human zzso only the promoter sequence had been reported for the mouse zzso We determined the zzso structures by sequencing 12 zzso of the human gene and over 7 zzso of the mouse zzso While the sizes of zzso in the mouse and human genes are the same, the zzso differ in zzso Both promoters have a high zzso content zzso zzso to the zzso and share a zzso zzso element zzso but overall sequence identity is only zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1, we mapped the human zzso zzso zzso to zzso with the order of markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso had previously been mapped to zzso 3 in a region zzso to human zzso zzso We refined mapping of the mouse gene and other markers on a radiation hybrid panel of zzso 3 and found the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that this cluster of markers on human zzso 1 is zzso with respect to its orientation on the zzso compared with markers in the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso
