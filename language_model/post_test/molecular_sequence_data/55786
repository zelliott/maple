Recent work has shown that the ability of zzso to direct zzso heavy chain zzso zzso to particular heavy chain constant zzso region zzso genes zzso with the induction of specific zzso zzso zzso To test the role of zzso transcripts in class zzso we have used zzso zzso to mutate the zzso heavy chain locus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the parent cell line, the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locus zzso prior to class switching to zzso The heavy chain locus of the zzso cell line contains the zzso heavy chain zzso and variable region gene promoter in place of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line zzso transcribes the zzso locus in the absence of zzso zzso the zzso cell line also switches to zzso in the absence of zzso This result demonstrates that, at least in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso plays a direct role in class switching to the zzso zzso In addition, the ability to change the pattern of class switching by altering zzso activity indicates that zzso of zzso zzso is mechanistically important in regulation of class zzso
