The zzso Associated zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, fused to zzso zzso gene has been shown to promote drought tolerance in zzso We dissected zzso in order to understand the various elements associated with its zzso and zzso The activity of zzso was higher in mature and early zzso leaves, and zzso stress induced its activity in mature zzso zzso analysis suggests the interactions of multiple zzso elements in the control of zzso zzso In zzso gel shift zzso and zzso one hybrid system revealed interactions of zzso with zzso factors related to zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso fused to zzso gene was used to identify specific regions regulating zzso under zzso or during drought zzso zzso of zzso hormonal treatments were characterized in entire plants and in leaf disk zzso and regions responsive to various hormones were zzso Our results indicate a complex interaction of plant hormones and additional factors modulating zzso activity under stress resulting in a transient induction of zzso
