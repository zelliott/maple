zzso zzso and other zzso states of proteins are now known to play important roles in many cellular zzso From equilibrium unfolding studies of two zzso proteins and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and two of its zzso zzso zzso zzso and its isolated zzso and a zzso zzso we demonstrate that only zzso forms a molten zzso intermediate at low zzso zzso We demonstrated that a loop in the zzso zzso zzso binding domain that promotes communication with the zzso domain and indirectly zzso zzso acid binding is also responsible for stabilization of the molten zzso zzso This loop was inserted into zzso in the zzso branch after the zzso split, right around the time when zzso zzso Because of the structural and functional importance of the loop, it is proposed that the zzso of the loop into a putative ancestral zzso in zzso produced a zzso active molten zzso zzso Because of their enhanced dynamic nature, zzso active molten zzso are likely to possess broad zzso zzso It is further proposed that the putative broader zzso specificity allowed the zzso active molten zzso to accept zzso in addition to zzso acid, leading to the evolution of zzso
