The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso unconventional zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of overlapping zzso fragments reveals a single open reading frame which predicts a 130 zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso presents the three characteristics zzso of zzso I zzso zzso This protein presents zzso with zzso zzso from other zzso but striking zzso with zzso unconventional zzso were also zzso The predicted zzso and zzso sites are located in the head zzso The heavy chain zzso region is zzso to zzso zzso I with an zzso zzso present at the zzso zzso In the neck domain, an zzso motif indicates potential binding of zzso to the zzso I heavy zzso In the tail of zzso zzso the three characteristic regions of zzso I are zzso A putative membrane binding domain a very short domain rich in zzso and zzso we demonstrate to be functional for zzso zzso and the zzso 3 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first unconventional zzso so far described in a lower zzso
