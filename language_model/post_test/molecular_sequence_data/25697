The protein products of zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso modified to give mature forms that are localized to the inner surface of the plasma zzso We have previously demonstrated that the mature form of the zzso zzso zzso gene product is zzso zzso at a modified zzso zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that this zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso This result establishes common zzso modifications for zzso proteins and zzso sex zzso These zzso exhibit sequence similarities at their zzso that appear to be the critical recognition elements for a common set of modification zzso In zzso cells, proteins with analogous zzso sequences appear to be zzso and zzso zzso by a similar zzso
