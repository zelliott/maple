zzso zzso a zzso zzso with defensive and protective activities, accounts for approximately zzso of chicken egg white proteins and is known as a major zzso zzso along with zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso structure of OT has not been zzso Here, using zzso equipped with a zzso detector and mass zzso analysis in combination with zzso zzso we investigated the zzso type and zzso pattern of zzso and compared them with those of zzso The zzso peak area was used to calculate the relative quantity zzso of each zzso zzso zzso including 11 zzso (1 core structure and 10 zzso zzso that commonly exist in zzso and zzso were zzso Six characteristic zzso (2 truncated structures, 1 zzso and 3 zzso zzso in OT and eight characteristic zzso in zzso were zzso OT contains the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso contained mostly zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso comprised zzso and zzso of the total zzso in OT and zzso zzso Moreover, using circular zzso analysis, we observed that the secondary structure of the zzso OT is quite different from that of the intact zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze zzso in OT in comparison with those of zzso
