To investigate the germ cell zzso in zzso we cloned a zzso sequence from the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso and raised zzso specific to zzso zzso is a zzso of the human zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are involved in zzso or germ cell zzso During zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein was detected at first in the small zzso zzso in females but was not localized as seen in zzso and was restricted to secondary zzso prior to zzso in zzso During early zzso maternal stores of the zzso transcript and protein were present in the entire zzso not localized in any specific zzso The zzso expression was detected in zzso larvae zzso 50) by zzso analysis whereas specific cells expressing zzso could not be determined by in zzso zzso at this zzso Strong expression of zzso and zzso were detected in primordial germ cells zzso that had entered the zzso zzso at late stage zzso These results suggest that zzso does not function early in development, for the zzso of germ cells, but functions later for differentiation of germ cells in the developing zzso during zzso and for zzso regulation, supporting the previous idea of an intermediate germ cell formation mode in zzso
