Muscle differentiation requires the transition from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the assembly of a highly regular zzso zzso This striking zzso zzso is coordinated with a transformation of focal zzso zzso contacts into zzso To assess mechanisms underlying this differentiation process, we searched for muscle zzso partners of zzso We identified an interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso protein family member zzso in nascent zzso during muscle zzso which is zzso by an interaction of the second zzso zzso domain 3 zzso domain of zzso with the zzso region of zzso To understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we determined the structure of this zzso domain at zzso A resolution, as well as its complex with the zzso binding zzso at zzso A zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to the charged zzso binding zzso the zzso contains only zzso zzso and for the first time such an interaction was observed structurally in zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso confirmed the zzso interaction, zzso it further by a weak binding zzso zzso experiments revealed further characteristics of zzso functions in muscle zzso All three zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso appeared to zzso in targeting the protein to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in altered muscle zzso contact zzso suggesting its involvement in the establishment of mature zzso Further evidence for the role of zzso in the maintenance of mature zzso sites in zzso comes from the observation that zzso expression was zzso in zzso failing hearts, and that this effect was reverted upon mechanical zzso These results provide new insights in how low affinity zzso interactions may contribute to a fine tuning of zzso zzso processes during muscle differentiation and in adult zzso
