The gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The structural gene zzso zzso encodes a product zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence is zzso identical zzso zzso to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso of zzso zzso It exhibits no significant similarity to zzso and zzso the stable zzso zzso II zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso resembles the zzso zzso in being zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso oxygen zzso and partially zzso by zzso plus zzso The zzso gene is the first gene zzso a Class I zzso to be characterized in any zzso other than zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies further indicated that zzso zzso resembles zzso coli in containing an zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso comparisons revealed significant similarities between the Class I zzso and the products of adjacent zzso frames zzso and zzso located upstream of the zzso synthesis zzso zzso at 67 zzso in the zzso linkage zzso Located downstream of zzso there is an unidentified gene zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso genes involved in the initiation of root zzso zzso
