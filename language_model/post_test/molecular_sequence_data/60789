zzso protein and serum zzso P component are members of the zzso family of zzso serum proteins which has been zzso through zzso In humans both have zzso structures and both play complex roles in the immune response, zzso protein being the classical zzso zzso produced in response to tissue damage and zzso An zzso zzso zzso has not previously been identified and it has been zzso that zzso protein and serum zzso P component are products of a gene zzso event within zzso zzso We have isolated serum zzso P component from the zzso of the zzso ancient zzso zzso the zzso crab zzso zzso and determined the three-dimensional structure by X-ray zzso The structure of the previously undiscovered zzso serum zzso P zzso the first zzso zzso structure to be determined, reveals the zzso fold and a novel doubly stacked zzso zzso The crystal structure and the discovery that both zzso zzso are present in zzso raises the possibility that both were present in the common ancestors of zzso and zzso over 500 million years zzso The impact of the results on our understanding of the origins and evolution of zzso and innate immunity is zzso
