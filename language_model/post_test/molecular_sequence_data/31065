We have studied the influence of the 600 zzso long leader sequence of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso on downstream zzso Plant zzso were zzso with plasmids expressing a zzso reporter gene from a zzso containing zzso or zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of three separate zzso sequence regions, S1, zzso and zzso The latter two interact with each other to enhance downstream translation zzso to zzso This enhancement was not observed in zzso from a zzso zzso In the absence of either zzso or zzso the region zzso located in between, exerts an zzso effect on downstream translation, probably due to the presence of short open reading zzso zzso of a reporter gene inserted into zzso increases zzso upon deletion of either zzso or zzso We propose that zzso regions zzso and zzso form a complex with cellular factors that allows scanning zzso to bypass region zzso
