The sequence of two fragments derived from the variable region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso One zzso zzso zzso situated immediately upstream of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso DNA, which does not zzso to other zzso zzso The other zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso 5 zzso contains zzso of repetitive sequences which are also found outside this zzso zzso analysis suggests that approximately zzso of the remaining part of the divergent region, which has not yet been fully zzso consists of similar zzso Neither segment contains genes for zzso proteins or zzso as judged from computer zzso This conclusion is supported by the fact that zzso DNA of zzso species other than zzso zzso does not zzso to either zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso experiments zzso however, that both zzso regions are transcribed into zzso of varying length zzso zzso albeit at a low zzso The function of these zzso that are derived from both DNA zzso and the likely absence of protein and zzso genes from the variable region of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
