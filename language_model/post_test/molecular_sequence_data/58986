The zzso gene of zzso zzso is required for checkpoint pathways that respond to DNA damage and replication zzso We report the complete zzso gene sequence and show that zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso checkpoint zzso This establishes zzso as the only zzso protein which is required for all the DNA structure checkpoints in both zzso model zzso zzso is an zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which includes the zzso protein defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso domain is required for zzso function, and zzso of zzso zzso demonstrates an associated protein zzso zzso The previous observation that zzso zzso can be rescued by a truncated clone lacking the zzso domain may be due to zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso data suggest that zzso exists in a complex containing multiple copies of zzso We have identified a novel human gene zzso whose product is closely related to zzso zzso can functionally complement zzso radiation sensitivity in zzso zzso Together, the structural conservation and functional zzso suggest strongly that the mechanisms underlying the DNA structure checkpoints are zzso throughout zzso
