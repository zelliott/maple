To assess the routine use of a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for the direct detection of zzso tuberculosis in zzso zzso zzso 

A pair of zzso zzso were designed to amplify the 38 zzso protein of M zzso The specificity of the zzso was evaluated in 31 M tuberculosis zzso 15 zzso zzso species, and several zzso bacteria of the upper respiratory zzso The zzso was subsequently applied to zzso zzso specimens from 85 zzso of a chest hospital in Hong zzso 

An amplified product of 239 base pairs was found in all M tuberculosis zzso standard strains of M zzso and M zzso but not in the other bacterial strains zzso For the 51 patients with pulmonary zzso zzso the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was subsequently confirmed by both culture and zzso in 41 of zzso Five patients who were treated before admission were positive by zzso zzso All but one patient in the control group zzso with acute zzso of chronic zzso airway zzso or those with zzso zzso diseases were zzso zzso The zzso remained positive after four weeks of zzso treatment in 29 patients, 16 of whom had become culture zzso 

This zzso zzso is a useful technique for the diagnosis of zzso and recently treated cases of pulmonary zzso
