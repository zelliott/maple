zzso zzso a zzso zzso expresses a group of surface proteins with a common zzso domain zzso that are exported by a novel zzso system to the surface, where they are zzso zzso Using zzso as a model zzso zzso we have produced a series of zzso zzso in the zzso sequence at zzso zzso and at zzso that may be modified and, zzso surface zzso The zzso zzso proteins were expressed in a zzso zzso host lacking functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a protein with a deletion of zzso zzso to 702 zzso The zzso were characterized for zzso zzso zzso activity and for cellular distribution using zzso zzso and Western zzso of culture zzso All the zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity similar to that of the positive control except for the zzso and zzso zzso For all zzso except zzso and zzso the zzso proteins were found modified and attached to the cell surface, which was the same profile found in the zzso zzso Only trace amounts of the precursor form of the zzso zzso were detected in the outer zzso with none detected in the zzso or culture fluid although cell transcript levels were zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso to 702 of the zzso in particular, zzso zzso have an important role in the attachment of zzso at the cell surface and that without attachment zzso does not zzso
