To identify genes that map on human zzso 21 zzso and that may contribute to the zzso of Down syndrome zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso DNA from an zzso library zzso More than 550 potential zzso were cloned and partially zzso One of these, zzso zzso zzso showed strong zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso acid 665 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned the full-length zzso for this human zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and mapped it to within zzso zzso and zzso between markers zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso encodes a zzso zzso that shows zzso identity to the zzso zzso protein and contains a zzso domain and a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in several zzso zzso spliced zzso species have been zzso The zzso zzso protein is a member of the zzso group genes that maintain zzso gene repression and are thought to control gene expression by regulating zzso The strong sequence conservation suggests a possible function of zzso in regulation of gene zzso and zzso zzso it may therefore contribute to certain zzso of Down syndrome by altered regulation of its target zzso
