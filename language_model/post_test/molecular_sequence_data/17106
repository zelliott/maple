The putative zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from the model zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame of the zzso encodes a deduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso expressed zzso protein forms an zzso active zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso The protein belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso acid sequence exhibits considerable similarity to zzso zzso However, neither the zzso zzso and zzso nor the zzso zzso and zzso were efficiently zzso by the zzso The smaller zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso represent better zzso but, surprisingly, the zzso most efficiently zzso the zzso of zzso acids analogous with zzso As determined by the zzso values, the zzso zzso zzso prefers zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso analyses revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso occurs exclusively at the zzso zzso of the side zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, which does not possess a zzso zzso results in a pronounced resistance against the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits the highest zzso with a number of zzso found in numerous zzso from bacteria to zzso that have not been zzso characterized so far, suggesting a novel group of zzso zzso closely related to zzso but with a distinct zzso zzso Taken together, we propose to name the zzso zzso zzso
