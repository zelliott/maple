This study aims to compare the influence of different genes to the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We first split 47 near full-length zzso sequences of zzso zzso into different regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which derived from various risk populations and geographic regions from zzso Myanmar and China from published zzso zzso analyses were performed to each region zzso The zzso results of different regions were compared to that of the near full-length zzso zzso The pol gene was found to have the lowest diversity and evolutionary rate, and could repeat the zzso results by using near full-length zzso zzso Although the zzso gene has the highest diversity and evolutionary rate, it could not achieve the similar zzso This study compared the influence to the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses by using different genes and laid foundation for further molecular survey and analyses of the transmission of zzso zzso in zzso
