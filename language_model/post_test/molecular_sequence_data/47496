Circulation and tissue colonization are essential properties of zzso cells and involve major families of zzso molecules zzso , zzso zzso zzso and molecules from the zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso was recently identified and found to be involved in the colonization of the zzso by zzso precursor zzso Here we show based on zzso analysis of zzso sequence database resources that zzso belongs to a new family of related molecules present from zzso to zzso This family includes the zzso zzso zzso and a central protein domain is shared between zzso and zzso families, suggesting that zzso molecules might bear an zzso zzso Five of these molecules were new zzso zzso sequences only described as zzso The three human zzso genes map to the same region of zzso zzso The detailed results are zzso at the zzso web page zzso zzso
