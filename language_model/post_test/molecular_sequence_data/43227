zzso molecular interactions involved in zzso by zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was generated against a transition state analog zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso Construction of a three-dimensional molecular model of zzso and sequence comparison within a panel of related zzso suggested candidates for zzso zzso His zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these were targeted for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso possessed zzso activities comparable to that of the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso displayed an approximately fivefold decrease in zzso In the transition state analysis, the plots of zzso versus zzso for the zzso are zzso with a slope of approximately zzso indicating that the entire zzso energy in the zzso is also zzso to bind the transition state and to accelerate the zzso In addition, a dramatic change in the zzso activity was observed when the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso light chain was replaced with zzso The zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso This zzso led to a large, zzso reduction in transition state zzso with no change in zzso zzso zzso with the previous kinetic studies and chemical modifications of the intact zzso zzso this zzso study has demonstrated that His zzso plays an essential role in stabilization of the transition state, the mechanism of zzso by the zzso zzso
