To understand the role of respiratory zzso virus zzso in children with acute respiratory infections zzso in zzso zzso Region and the contribution of two major groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected from hospitalized children with zzso in Department of Pediatrics, zzso People's Hospital in zzso zzso from April to July in 2011 and tested for seven common respiratory viruses and human zzso zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso Total zzso were extracted from zzso positive samples by zzso and reverse zzso to zzso zzso was employed to determine the zzso of zzso which were confirmed by real zzso and sequence analysis for G protein zzso zzso The zzso and variations of G genes from zzso in this project were identified by sequence comparison with those G genes in zzso Out of 167 samples, 65 were positive for respiratory viruses with a total positive rate of zzso including 45 zzso zzso samples for zzso Among 42 samples that were positive for zzso and zzso 40 were identified as group A and 2 as group zzso zzso analysis of full-length G genes for 7 zzso of group A indicated that all of these belonged to zzso zzso The zzso identities between zzso from zzso and zzso zzso strain were zzso with zzso identities of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acids were mainly located in both ends of a highly zzso region in the zzso of the G zzso The data indicated that zzso was the most important viral zzso agent of zzso in spring of 2011 in zzso and group A of zzso was zzso during the study zzso High divergence existed in the zzso of G proteins of zzso from zzso
