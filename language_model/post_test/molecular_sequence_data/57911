zzso and zzso proteins contain three zzso zzso zzso Here we examine the role of these zzso bonds in the folding and function of one family member, human zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli, zzso and analyzed with respect to zzso solution structure, and zzso zzso An analogue lacking all three zzso bonds zzso zzso is inactive and zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso bond, previously shown to occur in an early intermediate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lauren, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Weiss, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso results in a compact partially folded state with low but significant biological zzso Additional but incomplete structural organization and biological activity are observed following introduction of either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Native function, structure, and stability require the presence of all three zzso zzso These zzso provide genetic models of IGF-1 zzso zzso Their characterization suggests that zzso of the IGF-1 folding zzso reflects alternative late steps in the folding of a zzso zzso
