zzso stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso in type II zzso zzso by unknown zzso We identified, zzso and characterized a protein that binds the zzso zzso This zzso D, increases the activity of the zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso zzso D was identified by its ability to bind the zzso promoter region, which it binds at an zzso site from zzso to zzso zzso Its binding was abolished by zzso of promoter DNA with zzso which cuts at zzso zzso D was cloned and zzso It is a new DNA binding protein of 33 zzso whose zzso end contains a modified basic zzso zzso DNA binding motif zzso The effects of D on zzso promoter activity were studied in zzso cells, using a reporter construct containing 212 zzso from the zzso promoter with a zzso reporter gene zzso which was zzso with a protein D expression construct in which D expression was controlled by the zzso early zzso These two plasmids were zzso into zzso zzso Without added zzso D did not alter zzso promoter zzso When zzso was added, D strongly enhanced zzso promoter zzso Identification of this protein suggests that, at least for zzso zzso responsiveness may involve one or more zzso unknown gene zzso
