zzso DNA zzso forms a zzso zzso intermediate at a zzso target site zzso downward zzso in duplex zzso The zzso engages the target site within a zzso protein zzso Here we mapped the interface of zzso with the DNA minor groove by introducing zzso zzso R and S zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at single zzso zzso positions within the zzso DNA zzso These trans opened zzso zzso fit into the minor groove without zzso zzso zzso or base zzso and the R and S zzso are oriented in opposite directions within the minor zzso We measured the effects of the zzso zzso on the rate and extent of zzso DNA zzso We observed a sharp margin of interference effects, zzso zzso and zzso zzso modifications were well tolerated but zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were severely zzso zzso effects at the zzso zzso (the R zzso zzso whereas the S zzso did zzso delineated at high resolution the downstream border of the minor groove zzso zzso zzso of zzso is likely caused by zzso exclusion of constituents of the zzso from the minor zzso We also applied the zzso interference method to probe the interactions of zzso III with the minor zzso zzso containing these zzso zzso were protected from zzso by zzso III, which was consistently arrested at positions 2-4 zzso prior to the zzso zzso
