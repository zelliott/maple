The expression of human zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso regulated in zzso cells, up to zzso by variations in cellular cholesterol zzso An earlier deletion analysis of the zzso region of the zzso gene demonstrated that most of the zzso promoter activity is detected within a zzso pair sequence located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso a rat zzso of zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso binds to zzso regulatory element zzso sequence zzso present in this region zzso zzso zzso zzso Koch, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In our present study, we demonstrate that zzso of this zzso element significantly reduced, but did not zzso the response of zzso promoter to change in zzso zzso zzso scanning indicates that two additional DNA promoter sequences are involved in zzso zzso The first sequence contains an zzso zzso element zzso and the second contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso in any of these sequences reduced, but did not completely remove, the response to zzso Combination zzso studies showed that the zzso promoter activity was abolished only when all three elements were zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso proteins zzso or zzso with zzso zzso reporter resulted in a dramatic increase of zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift studies indicate differential binding of the zzso to regulatory sequences in the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by multiple regulatory elements in the zzso
