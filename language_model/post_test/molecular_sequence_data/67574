The diversity of zzso zzso bacteria zzso in the rice zzso field zzso was investigated by combined zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso of a Japanese rice zzso field were the focus of the zzso zzso surface soil, bulk soil, zzso soil, zzso zzso stem of rice plant, and rice zzso of previous zzso Based on zzso gene analysis and transmission electron zzso zzso four type I, and nine type II zzso zzso were obtained from the highest dilution series of enrichment zzso The type I zzso zzso included a novel species in the zzso zzso from zzso and this is the first type I zzso strain isolated from zzso of a rice zzso zzso In the type I zzso two zzso from zzso were closely related to zzso zzso one isolate obtained from zzso soil was most related to zzso zzso Almost all the type II zzso zzso were related to zzso zzso FISH confirmed the presence of both types I and II zzso in all the zzso and in the related enrichment zzso The study reported, for the first time, the diversity of zzso zzso including a novel species of type I zzso in rice zzso field zzso Refining growth media and culture conditions, in combination with molecular approaches, will allow us to broaden our knowledge on the zzso community in the rice zzso field zzso and consequently to implement strategies for zzso zzso zzso from this zzso
