zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous and important zzso that zzso zzso to zzso Many viruses zzso zzso zzso which plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the viral DNA both by reducing the zzso levels and by providing the zzso for the zzso zzso A zzso gene of duck zzso virus zzso zzso to zzso zzso was first reported in this zzso The gene encodes a protein of 477 zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment suggested that zzso zzso was quite similar to other identified zzso zzso and functioned as a zzso The five zzso motifs of zzso zzso with zzso arrangement have been zzso and the zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was genetically close to the avian zzso Furthermore, zzso dot zzso western zzso and zzso analysis indicated that the zzso was expressed at early and late stages after zzso zzso also confirmed that zzso zzso localized in the zzso of zzso duck zzso zzso as early as 4 zzso zzso zzso Later, the zzso transferred from zzso to nucleus at 8 zzso and then reached its expression peak at 12 zzso both in the zzso and zzso The results suggested that the zzso zzso gene might be an early viral gene in zzso zzso infection and contribute to ensuring the zzso of zzso zzso
