zzso catalyze the first step of zzso zzso zzso in bacteria by zzso of two zzso zzso A zzso molecules to zzso and also take part in the degradation of fatty zzso During growth on zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso could be significantly reduced in an zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso deficient in nine zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In order to examine the zzso production capacity when zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso fatty acids were provided as carbon sources, the growth and storage behavior of several zzso from the previous study and the newly generated zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, or zzso was chosen as the sole carbon zzso On zzso no significant differences in growth or storage behavior were observed between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso In contrast, during the growth on zzso of a multiple zzso lacking zzso zzso and zzso diminished zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the amount of accumulated zzso in the multiple zzso grown on zzso zzso it was much lower than that on zzso The zzso activity toward zzso in zzso and all the multiple zzso remained zzso lower than the activity of the wild type, regardless of which carbon source, zzso or zzso was zzso During growth on zzso as a sole carbon source, the zzso zzso accumulated almost a zzso zzso zzso with 99 zzso zzso zzso
