A new member of the insulin gene zzso was identified by screening a zzso zzso library of zzso human zzso and, zzso was tentatively named early zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the early zzso zzso zzso revealed significant overall and structural zzso with members of the zzso hormone zzso Moreover, the organization of the early zzso zzso zzso which is composed of two zzso and one zzso is similar to that of insulin and zzso By in zzso zzso the zzso gene was assigned to band zzso of the short arm of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso tissue distribution revealed that its transcripts are expressed in the zzso and zzso
