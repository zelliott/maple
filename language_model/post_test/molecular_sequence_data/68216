zzso dynamics zzso and free energy zzso zzso methods are used to study the binding and mechanism of zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso binding protein zzso zzso structures are predicted for the complexes of zzso with the zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The results support a mechanism of zzso by zzso where a large number of zzso interactions act together to stabilize zzso the twisted transition zzso The two most important groups for the zzso are suggested to be zzso and zzso but several other groups are identified as directly or indirectly involved in the binding and zzso However, the structural results do not support the notion that the zzso oxygen of the zzso agents zzso and zzso mimics the oxygen for the twisted zzso bond in the zzso zzso
