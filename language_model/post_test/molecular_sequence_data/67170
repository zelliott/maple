zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze both the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso possess two functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have identified zzso and zzso genes in the zzso In this study, we identified and characterized a third rat zzso gene zzso consisting of a single open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso acid zzso analogous to the previously identified human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso and zzso identical to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso and zzso identical to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each cloned and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso exhibited zzso intermediate between zzso rat zzso and zzso zzso rat zzso was functional and zzso the zzso of several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso The relative affinities of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso via zzso rat zzso were comparable with zzso rat zzso and higher than for zzso rat zzso This study is the first to report a third zzso zzso zzso with significant functional zzso
