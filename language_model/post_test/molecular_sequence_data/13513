The activated zzso zzso zzso is extremely potent in inducing zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso greater than 200 times as many tumors as the activated zzso zzso when directly introduced into in zzso rat zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso In order to characterize mechanisms underlying this zzso we sought to identify uniquely zzso genes in zzso tumors that were not zzso in tumors induced by weaker initiating agents, including activated zzso and the chemical zzso zzso and zzso Several zzso including those zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso class I zzso were found to be zzso in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso induced by other agents, when compared to their expression in normal zzso zzso One zzso however, zzso a member of the zzso and zzso protein families, was zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumors and was not zzso in zzso or chemically induced zzso This uniquely zzso gene was termed zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was produced in a zzso system, zzso and used to generate zzso zzso Western zzso analysis indicate that zzso zzso zzso express abundant zzso protein when compared to other zzso zzso
