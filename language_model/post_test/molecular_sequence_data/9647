A large variety of genes is expressed as fusion proteins for the purpose of characterization and zzso in molecular zzso We have used this strategy to append zzso peptides in order to achieve specific binding of the zzso to zzso flat, zzso charged mica zzso We show that the model zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso binds to mica via its zzso based on zzso exchange of naturally occurring zzso zzso Only zzso binding was observed with the control protein that is free of the zzso This novel technology will be widely zzso to orient functional proteins on flat zzso
