zzso regulated zzso genes play a pivotal role in the determination of the fate of a zzso zzso is known to zzso regulate genes important in regulating cell growth zzso Using differential reverse zzso analysis of rat zzso zzso cells containing a zzso zzso zzso we were able to isolate several transcripts zzso specifically in cells harboring functional zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are previously described zzso Two previously zzso zzso cell growth regulatory zzso genes zzso and zzso were zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of these novel proteins contain known zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso suggestive of zzso zzso and zzso appear to be primary response genes expressed to moderate levels in functional zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are able to inhibit the growth of several cell zzso
