zzso are closely related orphan nuclear receptors zzso functioning as dominant zzso zzso through an association with the nuclear zzso zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso lack the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso acid zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso binding is thought to zzso zzso causing zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus leading to zzso zzso Here we present zzso models of the zzso zzso which show that the putative zzso cavity is occupied by side zzso suggesting the absence of zzso zzso Modeling also revealed a very zzso surface due to the absence of zzso exposing zzso from zzso loop zzso zzso and zzso zzso of specific zzso from this surface severely impaired the in zzso and in zzso interaction of the zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso reinforcing the view of the physical association of zzso with a zzso surface encompassing zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso in the zzso surface significantly reduced the ability of zzso and zzso to function as zzso of zzso Interestingly, a zzso surface comprised of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso mediates the interaction with zzso zzso it appears that zzso and zzso bind to overlapping surfaces of zzso zzso the zzso change associated with zzso upon zzso binding resulting in a switch from a zzso to a zzso zzso
