Treatment of zzso mouse zzso with serum growth factors or zzso of protein zzso such as zzso results in a stimulation of zzso zzso zzso but has no effect on zzso of zzso zzso such as the vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso zzso studies demonstrated that a single zzso element of the general form zzso was necessary and possibly sufficient to impart serum and zzso to the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso promoter exhibits at least three similar sequence zzso it remained zzso to serum and zzso zzso However, deletion of a 33 base pair sequence between zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start site resulted in the zzso zzso of this zzso promoter in rapidly growing or zzso zzso Although the activity of this truncated promoter was zzso by zzso in a manner indistinguishable from that of the zzso promoter, this was dependent on a more complex array of interacting zzso These included at least one zzso box and a putative upstream zzso element closely associated with the zzso to zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the expression of a zzso zzso gene in zzso is suppressed by a zzso negative control element and that in the absence of this element, the promoter is responsive to growth zzso signal zzso zzso
