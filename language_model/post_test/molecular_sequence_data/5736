zzso of human zzso virus zzso derived from the central nervous system zzso display properties distinctive from zzso zzso including a high zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the zzso envelope zzso zzso but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat zzso may contribute to differential gene zzso To investigate the nature of zzso zzso sequence variation in the brain, we have zzso bases zzso to zzso of the zzso from the brains of four zzso zzso A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three zzso or white matter alone (one zzso and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple zzso A total of five zzso zzso were zzso Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between zzso comparable to that seen in zzso of the envelope zzso derived from blood or zzso The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two zzso B zzso Compared to the zzso T zzso zzso zzso a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique zzso in zzso factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the zzso clones zzso and zzso and altered the zzso and zzso zzso factor binding zzso These findings correlate with published functional studies showing zzso zzso zzso are distinct from the zzso zzso zzso and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which zzso sequence variations are associated with zzso differences in gene expression in the zzso
