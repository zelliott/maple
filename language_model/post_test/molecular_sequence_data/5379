The crystal structure of the zzso and zzso domain of the zzso coli gene regulatory zzso zzso has been determined in complex with the competitive inhibitor zzso at pH zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso An in-depth analysis shows that the structural basis for zzso zzso specificity arises from the precise arrangement of hydrogen zzso protein zzso around the bound sugar zzso van der zzso interactions also contribute to the zzso and zzso selectivity of the zzso The zzso group of zzso is zzso by small zzso movements in the zzso site that result in a slight distortion in the positioning of the zzso zzso A comparison of this structure with the zzso A structure of zzso zzso with zzso at neutral pH surprisingly revealed very small structural changes between the two zzso Based on solution data, we suspect that the low pH used to crystallize the zzso complex affected the structure, and speculate about the nature of the changes between pH zzso and neutral pH and their implications for gene regulation by zzso A comparison with the structurally unrelated zzso coli zzso zzso proteins reveals that zzso features of zzso recognition are present, despite a complete lack of structural similarity between the two classes of zzso suggesting zzso evolution of zzso zzso
