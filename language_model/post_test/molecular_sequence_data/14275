zzso cell zzso zzso named after its cloning origin, the zzso is actually a zzso expressed and highly zzso zzso protein zzso Recently we reported that zzso supports cell proliferation and zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso significantly disrupted the zzso target of zzso zzso complex 1 zzso signaling zzso However, the biological zzso that mediate the downstream signaling effects of zzso in proliferation and the molecular mechanisms by which zzso interacts with zzso are not well zzso Our prior studies also provided zzso evidence that zzso interacts with the zzso complex in cells and zzso zzso in zzso In this report, we investigated whether and how zzso targets zzso to regulate the activity of zzso Using the zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso we identified a putative zzso site, zzso for zzso in human zzso By mass zzso and a zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso is a novel in zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso and when zzso exists in protein complexes with or without zzso Although expression of the zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso integrity, it markedly impaired the zzso zzso by insulin or by zzso of the small zzso protein zzso under zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate an important role for zzso in modulating the activity of zzso through zzso of zzso zzso and thus zzso a potential signaling mechanism by which zzso regulates cell proliferation and zzso
