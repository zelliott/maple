We recently used zzso protein design to create an extremely stable, zzso zzso zzso with a sequence and fold not observed previously in zzso Since zzso was created in the absence of genetic selection, it provides a rare opportunity to investigate aspects of the cellular protein production and surveillance machinery that are subject to natural zzso Here we show that a portion of the zzso protein corresponding to the final 49 zzso zzso is efficiently zzso and accumulates at high levels in zzso zzso We used circular zzso zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to show that the resulting zzso zzso zzso protein adopts a zzso extremely stable, zzso zzso Based on the solution structure, we engineered an even more stable zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso that should be an excellent platform for design of novel zzso The zzso of high levels of zzso exposes the high error rate of the protein translation zzso The rarity of zzso stable fragments in natural proteins coupled with the observation that high quality zzso binding sites are found to occur within zzso coli zzso regions significantly less often than expected by random chance implies a stringent evolutionary pressure against protein zzso that can independently fold into stable zzso The zzso zzso between two identical zzso zzso zzso to generate an extremely stable structure parallels a mechanism for natural zzso evolution by modular zzso of protein zzso
