The main zzso was zzso to zzso in zzso yield, from a solid culture of zzso zzso on 1 part wheat zzso parts zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso of 50 zzso zzso zzso which gives the zzso sequence zzso It is remarkably stable, with crude extracts losing no activity over 3 h at 80 degrees C, and the zzso zzso retaining its activity over several months at 4 degrees zzso The zzso of zzso at 25 degrees C of various zzso by this retaining zzso were measured, absolute parameters being obtained by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The variation of zzso for zzso with pH is zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso value for zzso is zzso at the optimal pH of zzso and zzso at zzso indicating masking of the intrinsic effect at optimal zzso There is no zzso effect on binding zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 510 times slower than the zzso but has no zzso activity on the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso with poor leaving groups is zzso but that of zzso with good leaving groups exhibits pronounced apparent zzso zzso with zzso values similar to zzso zzso We attribute this to the binding of the second zzso zzso to a zzso zzso forming an zzso zzso complex which turns over slowly, if at zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso is a zzso zzso indicating that the effect of zzso substitution is greater on the first than on the second step of the zzso zzso
