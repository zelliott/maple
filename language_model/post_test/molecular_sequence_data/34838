zzso is specifically expressed on zzso zzso in a defined set of zzso cells such as zzso pancreatic zzso It zzso binds the zzso form of zzso and regulates the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso directly interacts with zzso the zzso zzso zzso and with zzso a zzso zzso We previously reported evidence that zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso onto the plasma membrane through these zzso zzso This chapter details the methods and protocols we use to analyze the function of zzso with particular attention to the zzso for detecting the zzso protein zzso and effects on zzso of zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso and their zzso cell zzso
