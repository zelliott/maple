zzso is a zzso zzso protein required for the assembly of a zzso zzso zzso structure at zzso and the cryptic zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains a putative zzso adjacent zzso zzso domain at its N zzso that shares strong sequence similarity with the zzso domain of a zzso of the origin recognition complex zzso zzso The zzso domain forms a zzso complex with the zzso interaction region zzso of another Sir zzso zzso which targets formation of silent zzso to the zzso Interestingly, despite sequence similarity of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso established importance in zzso zzso does not bind the zzso Here we report the zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso The structure reveals two key features that can account for zzso zzso inability to interact with zzso First, several zzso domain zzso known to directly contact zzso are altered in the zzso zzso Second, a critical zzso pocket present on the surface of the zzso domain is zzso in the zzso domain structure, potentially making it zzso to zzso These findings imply that the zzso domain structure has evolved for functions distinct from those of the zzso zzso
