We previously reported that zzso produces zzso relaxation and zzso zzso in canine coronary zzso To determine whether these opposing vascular effects of zzso are zzso by the same zzso zzso but at different cell types, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on isolated canine coronary arteries with and without intact zzso In coronary arteries with intact zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso to the newly exposed zzso after zzso of the cloned human zzso zzso produced zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was zzso zzso and zzso value was zzso zzso Mechanical disruption of the zzso completely abolished the zzso zzso instead a zzso contraction was zzso zzso as a percentage of the maximum 70 zzso zzso contraction, the maximum contraction observed with 3 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coronary arteries with either 3 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso relaxing factor or zzso oxide zzso also inhibited the relaxation and unmasked the zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the opposing coronary vascular effects of zzso are similar to those observed with zzso but specific zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which inhibit both zzso zzso and zzso effects, had no effect on zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
