Progressive zzso zzso zzso is a canine retinal disease that maps to the zzso end of zzso in a region of zzso with the zzso part of zzso As such, zzso has been zzso as the only animal model of zzso a human zzso zzso locus that maps to zzso In an effort to establish more detailed regions of zzso between dog zzso and the zzso region, we created a robust zzso zzso map with 34 zzso markers and 12 zzso with the highest resolution and number of markers for the zzso end of zzso Furthermore, we built an approximately zzso physical map containing both zzso and zzso genes so far identified by zzso linkage analysis as being closest to the zzso zzso and generated about zzso zzso zzso zzso canine zzso zzso to human comparative sequence analysis identified 49 transcripts that had been previously mapped to the zzso zzso The generated zzso canine sequence was zzso with a working draft of human sequence from zzso and we used this scaffold to order and orient the canine sequence against zzso This order and orientation are zzso as zzso zzso sequencing of zzso has not been fully zzso
