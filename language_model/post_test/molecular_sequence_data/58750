The level of expression of the zzso gene is much higher in the zzso zzso strain than in the susceptible zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 89, zzso To understand the role of zzso and related genes in zzso resistance, we have isolated and characterized two new zzso genes from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso by these two zzso zzso and zzso show 77 and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso and 60 and zzso identity with zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso genes are closely clustered within 4 zzso and map at region zzso of the second zzso In between them another zzso gene is present which is more related to zzso than to zzso The zzso gene which is zzso highly active in zzso moderately active in zzso and silent in the zzso strain zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso with the zzso and/or zzso zzso While the level of zzso zzso is similar in all three zzso the level of zzso zzso is highest in the zzso strain and barely zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that a zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso elements for the expression of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso all these genes in all three strains and increases the levels of the two zzso transcripts and the zzso zzso produced by the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso in the hybrids of zzso and zzso strains despite the fact that the hybrids carry one copy of the highly active zzso of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso Based on these results we propose that the zzso gene in zzso strain may be turned off by an active zzso which might be inhibited by zzso zzso In the zzso strain, the putative zzso may be zzso allowing high level of zzso expression of the zzso zzso
