From a differential display designed to isolate genes that are zzso upon differentiation of the central nervous system in zzso zzso zzso we isolated zzso zzso repeat and zzso of zzso signaling zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso protein altered the expression of neural precursor genes zzso and zzso and resulted in an initial relative increase in zzso cell zzso This was reflected by zzso expansion followed by premature zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso labeling and resulting in reduced size of the definitive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was capable of zzso inducing zzso while it diminished or entirely abolished zzso zzso of zzso in both a zzso and a zzso zzso cell line resulted in the zzso zzso of terminal zzso differentiation and enhanced zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel regulator of the zzso zzso compartment size by maintaining the neural precursors in the zzso zzso state possibly through the control of zzso zzso zzso
