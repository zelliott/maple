The purpose of this study was to sequence the central part of the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso gene to improve the zzso counting of cells after milk zzso The coding region was amplified by zzso and the amplified products were zzso A DNA sequence analysis of positive clones gave us zzso zzso with a partial calculated zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso filament protein sequence exhibited high levels of zzso to sequences of zzso protein from other bacteria in both zzso and zzso parts, but little zzso in the central zzso A zzso zzso length zzso analysis of amplified zzso zzso zzso gene products confirmed the zzso of the central zzso The zzso zzso was determined to be zzso zzso in size, which suggests a zzso zzso Furthermore, the deduced protein zzso contains zzso potential zzso sites and one sequence rich in zzso which could be modified by zzso
