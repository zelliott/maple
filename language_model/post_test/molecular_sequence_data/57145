To examine the role of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso and zzso zzso were constructed by zzso chain reaction and zzso expressed in zzso cells, the zzso activities were measured, and the protein was localized in the cells by zzso zzso or indirect zzso zzso We showed earlier that the deletion of the zzso zzso tail and zzso domain from zzso zzso the stable expression of this protein in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso Further deletion analyses of the zzso region show that the first 21 zzso acids of zzso are not essential for the stable production of the protein and are consistently localized in the zzso zzso In addition, analysis of hybrid zzso showed that zzso zzso of zzso can functionally replace the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso This fusion protein also showed zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso fusion protein zzso needed additional zzso sequences zzso the zzso domain of the zzso for stability and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso or substitution of zzso by zzso at positions 40 and 41 coupled with the zzso of 4 zzso zzso at position 43 zzso released the zzso proteins from the zzso and was detected on the cell zzso Our results show that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso along with its stem region, all play a role in zzso targeting and participate in a common mechanism that allows the protein to be processed properly and not be zzso in zzso zzso increasing the length of the zzso domain zzso the zzso retention signal and directs the zzso to the plasma zzso and zzso the length of the zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso is an important zzso but is not sufficient by itself for zzso zzso
