The coexistence of sexual and asexual zzso cycles within the same individual is a striking phenomenon in numerous zzso In the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso factor, serve as zzso signals that zzso the timing and balance between sexual and asexual spore zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative fatty acid zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso acid derived zzso zzso zzso is required for balancing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the level of zzso and increased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore numbers zzso In contrast, forced expression of zzso resulted in elevated levels of zzso and decreased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore numbers zzso zzso expression is zzso by two zzso regulators, zzso and the zzso zzso such that zzso transcript levels are correlated with the initiation of asexual and sexual zzso body zzso zzso zzso in zzso bodies in these zzso These data support an important role for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso spore zzso
