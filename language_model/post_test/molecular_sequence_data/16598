To investigate whether zzso cassette zzso 1 zzso zzso genetic variation is correlated with blood zzso 

zzso of peripheral blood were collected from zzso patients with cerebral zzso aged 62 zzso aged 12, and 352 zzso and zzso persons without zzso zzso zzso chain zzso fragments length zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso 107 zzso and 70 zzso and zzso type zzso zzso and 70 zzso The zzso and zzso type products were zzso 

The level of zzso showed an upward trend in the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a significant difference between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in the zzso The levels of zzso tended downward in the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, without a significant difference between any 2 zzso Linear zzso analysis showed that the zzso level was positively correlated with age in the zzso of zzso genetic variation zzso zzso and the zzso level was zzso correlated with age in the carriers zzso + zzso zzso In the cohort aged zzso 70 the zzso level was higher in carriers than in zzso 

zzso genetic variation results in a beneficial profile of blood zzso more evident in zzso zzso + zzso zzso is more pronounced in the individuals aged zzso zzso
