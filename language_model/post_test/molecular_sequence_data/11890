The human factor zzso protein 1 zzso is composed of seven repetitive zzso (short consensus zzso zzso that are identical in sequence to the seven zzso zzso of the complement regulatory protein factor zzso We have identified the native zzso protein as a zzso human plasma protein by zzso and by comparing the mobility to that of a zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct zzso human plasma proteins that represent the zzso zzso protein and the previously identified zzso factor zzso 1 beta zzso Similar to factor zzso the zzso zzso protein displays zzso activity in factor zzso zzso of zzso To identify relevant zzso of factor H and zzso we zzso expressed the zzso shared between the two proteins in the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and all truncated forms that include zzso 1 to 4 displayed zzso zzso All four zzso zzso are essential, as deletion zzso composed of zzso 1 and 4 only; of zzso 1, 2, and 4 only, or of zzso 1, 3, and 4 only were functionally zzso Similarly, the distance between these individually folding zzso is critical for function, as a zzso protein that had two and four zzso acids inserted between zzso 1 and 2 or between zzso 3 and 4, respectively, had no zzso These results demonstrate that all four zzso zzso of zzso (and of factor zzso are required for zzso activity in factor zzso zzso of zzso and that the distance between these zzso is zzso
