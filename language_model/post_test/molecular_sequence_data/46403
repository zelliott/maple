zzso of zzso zzso in regulation of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been extensively studied in recent years, albeit no protein of this zzso zzso has been zzso Using a zzso strategy, two zzso zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso were cloned and named zzso and zzso The deduced 149 zzso acid sequences possess four zzso binding zzso and exhibit a close identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to bind zzso was demonstrated following expression of the corresponding zzso zzso Furthermore, transient expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells showed a typical zzso zzso of both zzso in agreement with the wide distribution of zzso target zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, we showed that zzso and zzso genes had a broad pattern of expression in zzso zzso zzso and are zzso expressed during a zzso zzso cell culture cycle, with a slight zzso effect of zzso for zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we also detected zzso and zzso zzso in the vascular bundle region of young zzso zzso Finally, using specific zzso we also showed that zzso are required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells by acting on regulation of expression of genes zzso zzso that zzso early steps of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
