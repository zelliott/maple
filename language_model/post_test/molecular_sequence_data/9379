zzso the viral zzso present in an environment, have been studied by direct sequencing of the viral DNA or by cloning in small insert zzso The short reads generated by both approaches make it very difficult to assemble and zzso such flexible zzso zzso Many environmental viruses belong to unknown groups or prey on zzso and little known cellular zzso and hence might not be present in zzso 

Here we have used a different approach, the cloning of viral DNA into zzso before sequencing, to obtain natural zzso that are close to the size of a viral zzso We have studied a relatively low diversity extreme zzso saturated zzso zzso which zzso the analysis and interpretation of the zzso zzso different viral zzso were zzso and some of these were almost complete, and could be tentatively identified as zzso zzso zzso 

We found a cluster of zzso zzso that most likely zzso zzso zzso the square zzso and major component of the community in these zzso zzso The identity of the prey could be confirmed by the presence of zzso zzso sequences shared by the virus and one of the available strain zzso Other viral clusters detected appeared to prey on the zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso covering most of the diversity of microbes found in this type of zzso This approach appears then as a viable alternative to describe zzso in a much more detailed and reliable way than by the more common approaches based on direct zzso An example of transfer of a zzso cluster including repeats and zzso was accidentally found supporting the dynamic nature and frequent transfer of this peculiar zzso mechanism of cell zzso
