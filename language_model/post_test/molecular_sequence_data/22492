zzso a zzso that represents a serious health risk for humans and zzso is produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in freshwater bodies zzso Here we describe the discovery of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that shares zzso identity with the potent zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were employed to demonstrate the high specificity of the protein for zzso structures containing zzso linked zzso zzso zzso binding analyses and zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggest that zzso is involved in zzso recognition and zzso attachment of zzso A binding partner of zzso was identified in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso lacking the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso contain much lower amounts of zzso than the zzso zzso We discuss a possible functional correlation between zzso and the zzso and possible implications on zzso zzso zzso This study provides the first experimental evidence that zzso may have an impact on zzso colony formation that is highly important for the competitive advantage of zzso over other zzso zzso
