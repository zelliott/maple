By screening a pigeon zzso DNA library, we isolated a zzso zzso clone containing the zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the approximately zzso insert zzso of the zzso clone was zzso The sequence suggested the existence of pigeon zzso gene located zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso in late zzso was also shown by the zzso zzso sequence of the intact zzso zzso These results show that two adult zzso zzso zzso and zzso exist in the pigeon zzso and the zzso is expressed at the late zzso zzso The zzso expression suggests the existence of regulatory elements and factors interacting to inhibit zzso at the adult zzso
