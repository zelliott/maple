zzso zzso produces low levels of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are widely used in cancer zzso The zzso reaction leading to zzso is a key regulatory step for the production of the zzso zzso in zzso and has potential application in the industrial production of two zzso derivatives also used as zzso zzso In this work, we report the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of an zzso with zzso zzso activity identified as the major class III zzso present in zzso zzso leaves and named zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso to a zzso of zzso zzso acids including an zzso signal zzso showing the zzso nature of zzso zzso has a zzso structure and is present as a single gene zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso belongs to an evolutionary branch of zzso class III zzso whose members seem to have been recruited for different functions during zzso zzso of a green fluorescent zzso fusion confirmed the zzso zzso of this zzso the exact zzso zzso of the zzso zzso precursors and zzso zzso zzso data further supports the role of zzso in zzso zzso indicating the potential of zzso as a target to increase zzso levels in the zzso
