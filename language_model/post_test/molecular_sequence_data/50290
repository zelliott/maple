The activity of the zzso major late promoter is substantially increased as the infection proceeds from the early to late zzso To gain insight into the regulation of this promoter, we analyzed zzso interactions by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the course of zzso zzso Little or no protein interaction at promoter sequences was detected early (5 zzso after infection but strong interactions at the major late zzso factor zzso binding site and at the zzso box were evident late (12 zzso after zzso zzso of in zzso and in zzso zzso revealed that the in zzso interaction late after infection results from binding of the cellular zzso factor zzso Nuclear extracts prepared from zzso cells as well as cells harvested at 5 and 12 zzso after infection contained similar levels of zzso footprint activity, therefore the lack of a zzso interaction early after infection is not due to reduced levels of the factor early in the viral growth zzso zzso DNA replication was required for zzso binding at the major late zzso These results indicate that DNA replication zzso in the regulation of zzso late gene expression by zzso the binding of a zzso factor to the major late zzso
