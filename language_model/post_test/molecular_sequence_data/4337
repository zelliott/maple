The first zzso pocket, zzso of class II zzso has been shown to be an important site of zzso zzso Two zzso occur in this pocket in the human class II zzso beta chain at position 85 and zzso beta 85 is usually zzso occasionally Ala, whereas beta 86 can be zzso or zzso However, zzso is found only in conjunction with zzso The independent effect of the zzso at these two positions on the binding of normal and zzso zzso peptides has never been zzso To do so, three soluble zzso zzso that contain the naturally occurring combinations of these side chains at these two positions were generated and tested with a panel of influenza zzso peptides varying at anchor zzso zzso zzso differing only at position 86 are very similar in the binding of a panel of zzso zzso indicating that beta 86 does not substantially influence the zzso binding of zzso In contrast, zzso varying only at position beta 85 differ in their binding of zzso peptides containing Ala, zzso or zzso at the zzso anchor zzso Thus, beta 85 shows the zzso effect on the zzso anchor side chain preference of the zzso pocket in zzso This is in contrast to other zzso zzso where beta 86 has been shown to control the nature of the zzso zzso These previous data together with our own imply that the role of zzso in zzso may be influenced by the contextual framework of the remaining zzso zzso
