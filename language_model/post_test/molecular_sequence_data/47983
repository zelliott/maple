In zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso are detected and altered efficiently during the sexual cycle by a process known as zzso zzso point zzso zzso sequences are subjected to multiple zzso zzso To explore the pattern in which base changes are laid down by zzso we examined two sets of zzso First, we examined the products of a zzso spontaneous zzso event at the zzso zzso zzso of sequencing suggested that a single zzso event produces two distinct patterns of change, descended from the two strands of an affected DNA zzso zzso results were obtained using an exceptional zzso from a cross with a known zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence data were also used to further examine the basis for the differential severity of zzso zzso on the coding and zzso strands in zzso The known bias of zzso toward zzso sites in conjunction with the sequence bias of zzso accounts for the differential zzso Finally, we used a collection of tandem repeats (from 16 to zzso zzso in zzso within the zzso gene to examine the length requirement for zzso No evidence of zzso was found with zzso shorter than 400 zzso while all longer tandem zzso were frequently zzso A comparison of these results with zzso zzso data for the same zzso is consistent with the idea that zzso of long tandem zzso and zzso share a common zzso
