zzso represent a novel family of zzso zzso proteins containing one copy of the zzso type 1 repeat zzso which in zzso is shared by several proteins with diverse biological functions, including cell zzso zzso and patterning of developing nervous zzso We have determined the zzso organization of human zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso 1), a novel zzso gene zzso a protein that contains a zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso domain in zzso and other zzso characteristic of zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso gene encompasses more than zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence surrounding the putative zzso start region revealed a zzso promoter located in a zzso zzso Several consensus binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso were identified in this promoter zzso In humans, zzso gene is located on zzso zzso within zzso zzso right zzso zzso type 1) critical zzso preliminary evidence suggests that it is expressed in several zzso showing multiple alternative zzso
