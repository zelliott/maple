zzso is a zzso protein which is associated with small zzso zzso and is required for zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized the gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and we have followed its expression under various zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein which appears to be highly zzso throughout zzso In zzso human or zzso zzso a single zzso zzso is detected while, in zzso zzso a single copy gene encodes different zzso which differ at the 3' zzso Under normal growth conditions, two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are detected with the zzso zzso being the most zzso Both the total amount and relative abundance of these two zzso are strongly affected by exposure to low temperature, namely the zzso zzso zzso almost disappears while the zzso zzso is less markedly zzso A new species of zzso zzso accumulates in the cell, which contains an unusually long 3' untranslated region of 2 zzso We have found that exposure of the cells to a cold shock has a profound effect on 3' end formation in zzso since the zzso of several other zzso is also capable of skipping the normal 3' end site to terminate at a further downstream zzso
