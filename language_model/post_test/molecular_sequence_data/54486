The influenza A virus zzso complex, consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso represents a promising target for the development of new zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the zzso interaction domain between PA and zzso using peptides derived from the extreme N zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso 1 to zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso To increase the binding affinity of these zzso we performed a systematic zzso relationship zzso zzso and zzso acid scans revealed that almost all zzso acids in the core binding region zzso 5 to zzso are indispensable for PA zzso Using a library of immobilized peptides representing all possible single zzso acid zzso we were able to identify zzso acid positions outside the core zzso region zzso 1, 3, 12, 14, and zzso that are variable and can be replaced by zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance binding studies revealed that combination of several zzso zzso led to an additive zzso Thus, the feasibility to enhance the zzso affinity presents an intriguing possibility to increase zzso activity of the zzso zzso and one step forward in the development of an zzso drug against influenza A zzso
