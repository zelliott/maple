Sea bass nervous necrosis virus is the zzso agent of viral nervous zzso a disease responsible of high economic losses in zzso and juvenile stages of cultured sea bass zzso zzso To identify genes potentially involved in zzso immune defense, gene expression profiles in response to zzso infection were investigated in sea bass head kidney using the suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso of the expressed sequence tags found in the zzso library showed significant similarities with immune zzso of which a zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from groups II and zzso respectively, and a short zzso zzso were selected for further zzso zzso of zzso were validated by in zzso zzso of expression of zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso To examine the potential zzso of zzso in response to zzso infection in further detail, the zzso protein zzso was produced, and selected functional zzso were zzso A zzso decrease of respiratory burst was observed in sea bass head kidney zzso after incubation with increasing zzso of zzso A decrease in zzso zzso and zzso expression was observed in the brain of sea bass simultaneously injected with zzso and zzso compared with those infected with zzso zzso Moreover, the protein was detected in the brain from infected fish, which is the main target of the zzso These results suggest a potential zzso protective role of zzso during viral zzso
