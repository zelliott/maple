The zzso zzso zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of wheat and zzso were determined in order to zzso their zzso position in the zzso These zzso strains form a zzso cluster with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two of them zzso and zzso had previously been identified as zzso zzso zzso 2) by zzso characterization zzso zzso Evidence for nitrogen fixation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso was provided by zzso activity, and confirmed by amplifying and sequencing a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree of zzso zzso acid sequences was compared to the zzso tree of zzso zzso All zzso zzso sequences formed a coherent cluster distinct from that of related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was neither detected in the zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso nor in the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso nitrogen fixation among zzso zzso zzso seems to be restricted to a subset of species in the zzso zzso
