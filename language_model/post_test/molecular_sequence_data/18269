We have examined the effect and potential mechanism of zzso A zzso on the zzso alpha chain zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to zzso decrease in zzso zzso surface expression and a zzso decrease in the steady state zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso factors which recognize a zzso sequence present in the zzso alpha chain regulatory region have been suggested to participate in the zzso regulation of the zzso alpha zzso Using zzso corresponding to the zzso regulatory region of the zzso alpha gene zzso 245 to zzso zzso upstream of the start zzso and nuclear extract from resting T zzso we detected two specific bands by gel mobility shift zzso One of these bands is specifically increased after stimulation with zzso zzso and it is inhibited by zzso zzso The same pattern of binding activity has been observed with the tandem repeat of zzso binding site present in the zzso element of the human zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso affects zzso zzso alpha chain expression by zzso the interaction of zzso factors to zzso sequences after zzso zzso These findings may be of some relevance for the understanding of the zzso effects of zzso in normal human T zzso
