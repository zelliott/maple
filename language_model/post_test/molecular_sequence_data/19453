zzso also known as zzso D3 or zzso regulates the differentiation and functional properties of zzso zzso Many of these effects involve zzso signaling zzso which are not fully zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso differentiation marker and zzso with zzso for bacterial zzso by zzso was shown previously to be zzso zzso however, the mechanism of gene zzso remained zzso Using a zzso zzso array screen coupled with zzso we found evidence for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells incubated with zzso Furthermore, analysis of the zzso promoter of human zzso identified regions that contained up to seven zzso which showed significant similarity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso activated zzso binding to one of these regions at zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site in a zzso zzso This zzso region also became zzso active in a reporter zzso in response to zzso again dependent on zzso zzso of the zzso within the zzso abolished this zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso zzso leading to zzso of the zzso promoter, involves zzso zzso downstream of zzso
