An important goal in cancer gene therapy is the development of novel targeted zzso zzso The observation that zzso of a zzso envelope zzso lacking an R zzso into human cells results in considerable zzso fusion and subsequent cell death prompted us to explore the potential for using this zzso membrane zzso zzso as a targeted zzso zzso As proof of principle, we therefore displayed zzso growth factor zzso on the N zzso of zzso envelope zzso both with and without an R zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso envelope expression plasmids did not cause zzso zzso The zzso zzso envelopes were incorporated into zzso zzso whose zzso was investigated on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso incorporating an zzso unmodified envelope was able to zzso all human cell lines zzso zzso of the zzso incorporating an envelope on which zzso was displayed was restricted on zzso zzso cells (but not on zzso zzso zzso and could be restored by zzso zzso of the displayed domain or competition with zzso zzso The zzso fusion capacity of the zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso unmodified and with zzso display of both zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso was investigated by zzso DNA zzso While the zzso unmodified zzso zzso fused all human cell types tested, zzso of zzso zzso on which zzso or zzso was displayed was considerably restricted on zzso zzso zzso competition experiments showed that zzso could be restored by competition only with the relevant zzso zzso Thus the specificity of zzso fusion by a zzso zzso envelope zzso can be regulated by zzso display of growth factor zzso There is therefore significant potential for further development of the targeting of the zzso capability of this zzso viral zzso by using strategies similar to those we have developed for the targeting of zzso zzso
