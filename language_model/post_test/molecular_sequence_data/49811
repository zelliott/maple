zzso differential display identified a novel sequence induced in zzso by the zzso protein zzso We named this gene zzso gene and zzso zzso and also cloned two other novel genes zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Together, these three zzso form a novel family of genes coding for type I zzso proteins which contain a signal sequence for zzso and a zzso zzso The deduced zzso parts of the zzso contain six zzso repeats zzso flanked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by one zzso domain close to the zzso zzso A zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso promoted prominent zzso extension in zzso zzso and in solution, the same zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso A zzso and zzso binding mechanism is shown between the members of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the members of the zzso protein family are novel cell zzso molecules among which zzso is specifically expressed on fiber tracts of zzso zzso and zzso in their zzso
