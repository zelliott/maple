During the replication cycle of zzso virus, four different forms of viral particles are zzso The two zzso enveloped forms, zzso enveloped virus and zzso enveloped virus, are responsible for zzso transmission and long-range spread of infection both in zzso and in zzso Despite the biological importance of the enveloped forms, the mechanism of zzso and the components involved in this process have been zzso only zzso Therefore the individual steps and the zzso factors of the zzso process are still zzso The protein zzso an zzso but zzso envelope protein of molecular mass 37 zzso has been shown to be essential for zzso However, this study shows that zzso of zzso by zzso virus zzso reduces rather than increases the yield of infectious enveloped virus which is mainly due to the enveloped zzso exhibiting a strongly diminished specific zzso
