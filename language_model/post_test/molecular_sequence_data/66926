zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso belong to a family of zzso zzso channels that play important roles in central and peripheral nervous zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso has important implications for function and is not well zzso Here, we analyzed the targeting of two major types of zzso zzso by expressing zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed distinct patterns of zzso with zzso targeted zzso to the zzso zzso whereas zzso was localized to both zzso and zzso zzso When fused to zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso alpha zzso zzso which are normally distributed zzso the zzso zzso loop from the zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso loop from the zzso zzso led to surface zzso zzso zzso screening and zzso substitution further identified a zzso zzso motif zzso containing an zzso targeting sequence within the zzso loop and a zzso zzso and zzso motif zzso containing a zzso targeting sequence from the zzso zzso These results provide valuable information in understanding diverse roles of zzso zzso in zzso and modulating synaptic transmission, synaptic zzso and nicotine zzso
