zzso zzso and acute inflammation are key processes in zzso defense to a skin zzso Recent studies uncovered the mediation of 2 zzso zzso zzso G and zzso in both zzso Working with a mouse model of acute zzso we revealed that an zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso disease pathogens in Europe, extensively zzso zzso formation and influx of zzso in the inflamed zzso We named this tick zzso zzso zzso zzso as I zzso zzso zzso and we show that it primarily zzso zzso G and zzso while in higher zzso zzso it affects zzso activity as zzso The zzso specificity was explained using the crystal structure, determined at a resolution of zzso zzso Moreover, we disclosed the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the first time, an zzso protein is shown to exhibit such pharmacological effects and target zzso The stringent specificity and biological activities of zzso combined with the knowledge of its structure can be the basis for the development of future pharmaceutical zzso
