zzso virus zzso is known to cause sporadic or explosive zzso However, little is known about the endemic transmission of zzso To ascertain the endemic occurrence of zzso transmission, we tested blood samples from patients with a zzso zzso illness who participated in a prospective cohort study of factory workers in zzso zzso From August 2000 to June 2004, and September 2006 to April 2008, 1901 zzso episodes occurred and 231 zzso dengue cases were zzso The remaining zzso cases were evaluated for possible zzso infection by measuring zzso zzso and zzso zzso in acute and zzso zzso Acute samples of zzso positive cases were subsequently tested for the presence of zzso zzso by zzso and/or virus zzso A total of 135 zzso zzso infections were identified, providing an zzso rate of zzso person zzso zzso infections were identified all year round and tended to increase during the rainy season (January to zzso Severe illness was not found and severe zzso was not a prominently reported zzso zzso zzso samples from nine cases were tested to obtain a kinetic picture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were persistently detected in high zzso for approximately one zzso Three patients demonstrated evidence of possible sequential zzso zzso The high zzso rate and continuous zzso cases in this adult cohort suggests that zzso is zzso transmitted in zzso Further characterization of the circulating strains and surveillance in larger areas are needed to better understand zzso epidemiology in zzso
