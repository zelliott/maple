The zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene in zzso coli results in the ability to transport zzso rapidly into the zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso compete for the zzso zzso An zzso knockout zzso of zzso grows slightly more slowly on zzso but is still able to take up zzso at rates equivalent to that of the zzso zzso This means that zzso must have a second zzso zzso zzso zzso
