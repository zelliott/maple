The zzso 3 zzso domain is one of the most frequent protein recognition zzso zzso being represented in signal zzso pathways and in several zzso such as cancer and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso protein 2) is an zzso protein that contains two zzso zzso and is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is required for viral replication and it has been shown to bind directly or indirectly to several host zzso zzso their zzso In this study, we show interaction between the cellular factor zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso The binding is zzso by the zzso sequence of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso As the zzso protein zzso zzso in a wide variety of signaling zzso we characterized at least one of the possible downstream effects of the zzso interaction on the well-known zzso zzso We show that the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, while zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction affects also viral function by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and viral replication in infected primary zzso
