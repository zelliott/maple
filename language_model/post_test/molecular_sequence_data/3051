zzso is the dim light zzso zzso of zzso In this work, we undertook to study the structure of zzso from zzso and compare it with bovine and rat zzso zzso zzso was analyzed using methodology developed previously for mass zzso analysis of integral membrane zzso Combining efficient protein zzso and high performance liquid zzso separation with the sensitivity of mass zzso zzso this technique allows the observation of the full protein map and the zzso modifications of the protein in a single zzso The zzso protein from a single zzso eye was zzso completely, with the exception of two zzso acid fragments and one zzso acid fragment, and the gene sequence reported previously was zzso The zzso zzso similar to the ones reported previously for bovine and rat zzso were also zzso Although zzso zzso has a high degree of zzso to bovine and rat zzso and most of their zzso modifications are zzso the zzso and zzso patterns observed were zzso These results show that zzso from a single zzso eye can be characterized completely by zzso This technology opens the possibility of zzso structural and functional studies aided by powerful mass zzso analysis, using the fellow eye as an internal zzso
