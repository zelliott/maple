An automated method to identify zzso zzso directly zzso with zzso during amplification reaction was zzso The zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and captured on commercially available test tubes coated with zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso were detected using zzso zzso fragments zzso to zzso and the zzso reaction automatically evaluated as an zzso zzso Fifty serum samples were tested by the zzso and the results were in accordance with those obtained by Southern zzso analysis of amplified zzso Due to the high sensitivity, specificity and zzso zzso the zzso seems to be a practical and reliable test for the diagnosis of zzso infection and can be easily adapted to identify any zzso amplified product of viral zzso
