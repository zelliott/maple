Several proteins at zzso zzso zzso membrane contact sites contain a zzso domain that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso a zzso motif that interacts with the zzso protein zzso and a zzso transfer zzso This architecture suggests the ability to both zzso zzso and transport lipids between zzso We show that in zzso binding protein zzso these two activities are coupled by a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso domain and the zzso motif enables zzso transfer by the zzso transfer domain zzso followed by back transfer of zzso by the zzso Finally, zzso is zzso in zzso by the zzso protein zzso The energy provided by zzso zzso drives zzso transfer and allows negative feedback when zzso becomes zzso Other zzso transfer proteins are zzso by the same zzso Thus, zzso back transfer of zzso might coordinate the transfer of other zzso species at the zzso zzso
