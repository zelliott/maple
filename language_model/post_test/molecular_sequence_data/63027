zzso zzso is the leading cause of infantile zzso zzso RV zzso protein 4 zzso the first characterized viral zzso is a zzso zzso that has zzso functions in RV infection and zzso zzso has multiple forms enabling it to perform its different zzso zzso such functions could be facilitated by use of zzso zzso This work mapped the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso generated against synthetic zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso for zzso mapped to zzso zzso wherein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso generated to two peptides zzso and zzso with zzso activity each recognize a single but distinct zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso to zzso was mapped to zzso zzso with highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso being critical for zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso binds to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso are critical for this zzso Finally, the zzso for the zzso to zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso wherein zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso of the binding sites of zzso zzso can aid in further characterizing different functions of zzso To demonstrate this, we characterized the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and show that binding of zzso to zzso is blocked by zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso The use of single zzso zzso to zzso block functions of zzso is a feasible approach to determine the functional domain structure of this important RV zzso zzso
