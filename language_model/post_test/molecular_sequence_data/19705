zzso zzso proteins can be zzso zzso or localized in both zzso and zzso Most of the zzso for zzso targeting are localized in the zzso part of the zzso which were therefore analyzed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and dual zzso sequences have an overall similar zzso However, zzso is rare in the first 20 zzso of zzso and dual zzso and Ala is more frequent at position 2 of these two types of sequence as compared to zzso zzso According to these zzso zzso were performed in three dual targeted proteins and analyzed by in zzso import into isolated zzso and zzso First, experiments performed with zzso proteins suggest that the binding of precursor proteins to zzso is highly efficient, whereas the import and processing steps are more efficient in zzso Moreover, different processing sites are recognized by the zzso and zzso processing zzso Second, the zzso approach shows the positive role of zzso zzso for enhancing zzso import or processing, as expected by the in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso at position 2 have dramatic and zzso effects, either enhancing or completely abolishing zzso This suggests that the nature of the second zzso acid zzso of the zzso sequence is essential for the import of dual targeted zzso
