The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is a zzso complex essential for normal zzso and zzso zzso An increasing number of zzso disorder of zzso type II zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso indicating its importance in zzso We report a new zzso patient zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso combined with a zzso zzso The resulting zzso of zzso expression additionally affects expression or stability of other lobe A zzso Despite this, full complex formation was maintained albeit to a lower extent as shown by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our data indicate that zzso are present in a zzso pool and full complex formation assists zzso preceding membrane zzso By extending this study to four other known zzso patients, we now present the first comparative analysis on defects in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso The observed structural and zzso abnormalities correlate with the severity of the zzso with the zzso zzso being the zzso All together our results indicate that intact zzso complexes are required to maintain zzso dynamics and its associated zzso According to the current zzso zzso this newly identified zzso is designated zzso
