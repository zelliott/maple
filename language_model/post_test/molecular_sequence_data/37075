Three distinct types of storage zzso are expressed in the zzso larvae of the rice zzso zzso zzso A zzso expression library was constructed from fat zzso and screened with a zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two slightly different zzso zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso Both include open reading frames of zzso zzso which are translated into zzso of 703 zzso acids with zzso zzso Signal peptides of 19 zzso acids are present at the zzso The 684 zzso acids native proteins have a high content of zzso groups zzso According to both the criteria for zzso acid composition and the zzso analysis, zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso Northern zzso studies revealed that the zzso genes are zzso and zzso expressed in fat body cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso
