The zzso includes the ordinary zzso found along the sea shore and is the most diverse and well-studied zzso of zzso However, although the literature abounds with scenarios explaining the evolution of these zzso very few studies have attempted to test these hypotheses in a zzso zzso The few attempts at zzso analyses have suffered from a lack of zzso signal and small numbers of zzso We collected DNA sequences from the nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso total) and data for 37 adult and 53 zzso zzso characters from 43 zzso representing all the extant zzso zzso (except the zzso zzso Four zzso zzso modified zzso zzso zzso and a zzso + zzso zzso zzso hypothetical zzso were used as the zzso for the molecular and zzso zzso zzso We analyzed these data separately and combined using maximum likelihood zzso under zzso and genetic zzso zzso searches, maximum zzso procedures, and zzso zzso coupled with zzso chain zzso Carlo techniques under mixed and homogeneous models of zzso zzso The resulting zzso trees answered key questions in zzso zzso The zzso zzso were shown as the most primitive zzso and the zzso zzso were placed as the sister group of the zzso These relationships suggest for the first time in an zzso that zzso zzso may have evolved from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso were depicted as zzso and appear to have evolved from a stalked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to have the following zzso zzso zzso zzso divergence times were estimated under zzso local clock, zzso and penalized likelihood approaches using an zzso data set and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso million years ago zzso zzso zzso 340 zzso and zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso dates varied considerably within and between approaches depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso local clock models that assume independent rates zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso or zzso species generated the most zzso estimates among zzso and agreed more closely with the zzso fossil zzso zzso estimates were also obtained under the zzso procedure of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but using multiple zzso Most of the dates estimated under the zzso procedure of zzso and Yang zzso zzso zzso zzso and the penalized likelihood method using single and/or multiple zzso were inconsistent among zzso and did not fit the fossil zzso
