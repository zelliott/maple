zzso zzso the zzso agent of type B zzso zzso ulcers, gastric zzso and zzso lymphoma, uses the zzso type IV zzso system to induce a strong zzso response in the gastric zzso and to inject its zzso protein zzso into gastric zzso zzso zzso results in altered host cell gene expression profiles and zzso zzso and it is considered as a major bacterial zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that binding of the type IV zzso apparatus to zzso receptors on target cells is a crucial step in the zzso zzso Several bacterial zzso including the zzso components zzso and zzso have been involved in this zzso Here, we have examined the zzso and interactions of zzso in the bacterial zzso Since the zzso gene zzso and is zzso with the zzso zzso the role of zzso for type IV zzso system function has been difficult to zzso and conflicting results have been reported regarding its involvement in the zzso zzso Using a zzso gene deletion approach and genetic zzso we show now that zzso is an essential component of the zzso type IV zzso apparatus for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is distributed over soluble and zzso pools and seems to be partly zzso zzso of several genes zzso essential zzso components has an impact on protein levels of zzso and zzso suggesting that both proteins require partial assembly of the zzso zzso Finally, we show by zzso that zzso and zzso interact with each zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso form a functional complex which is formed at a late stage of zzso apparatus zzso
