Little is known about the zzso regulation of zzso motor activity in zzso zzso control of zzso zzso is subject to changes during development in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso control of zzso smooth muscle in the zzso zzso zzso and explore possible changes in this system during the zzso phase of zzso zzso of zzso compounds on mean force and contraction frequency in zzso circular muscle strips from zzso zzso and juvenile animals were zzso Before zzso low zzso of zzso reduced motor activity, whereas the effects were reversed at higher zzso zzso relaxation was not inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso but was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso indicating that an zzso zzso zzso the relaxation response at this zzso zzso induced relaxation before, zzso and after zzso which was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The stable zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the circular muscle strips in zzso zzso However, in juvenile zzso zzso caused relaxation, as did zzso at low zzso The zzso zzso zzso antagonized the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso increases in mean force at all stages zzso This study demonstrates the existence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation and a zzso zzso zzso contraction in the zzso zzso gut before, zzso and after zzso Furthermore, the development of a zzso zzso relaxation during metamorphosis is zzso
