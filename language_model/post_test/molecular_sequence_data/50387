The zzso gene encodes the surface zzso zzso which mediates cell zzso resulting in zzso zzso transfer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis by Northern zzso zzso and primer extension indicates that zzso zzso is zzso and zzso Previous zzso zzso and sequencing analysis of a zzso zzso region of zzso indicated that several genes including zzso and zzso are required to activate expression of zzso The distance zzso zzso between these regulatory genes and zzso suggested that the zzso might function in zzso To test this, a zzso zzso gene fusion to zzso was constructed and cloned without some or all of the regulatory zzso Several restriction fragments of the regulatory region were cloned in a higher zzso zzso and numerous zzso studies were carried out in zzso zzso zzso in trans was not observed in any of these zzso However, when the regulatory region and target genes were cloned in different sites of the same zzso separated by as much as 12 zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Interestingly, this zzso occurred only when the regions were cloned in the same relative orientation in which they exist on zzso zzso These results suggest that one or more regulatory molecules may bind to an upstream zzso site and track along the DNA to reach a target site to activate zzso zzso
