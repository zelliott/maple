Human breast tumors contain DNA sequences with high zzso to the Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the membrane zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso and is required for zzso If humans become infected with zzso identification of a human zzso might shed light on the mechanism of zzso Here, we identified two human zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins highly related to the mouse zzso zzso sequences were also detected in other zzso zzso Thus, zzso transmission of zzso is a real possibility given the existence of highly zzso zzso zzso
