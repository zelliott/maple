The structure of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso have been investigated through zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso For the first time two-dimensional zzso techniques are applied to zzso zzso other than zzso zzso Several active site signals have been assigned to specific zzso on the grounds of their zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The experimental zzso shifts for the zzso belonging to zzso zzso have allowed the identification of a plausible orientation of the magnetic zzso zzso around the zzso zzso as well as of the magnitude and the zzso of the principal zzso zzso In turn, a few more signals have been tentatively assigned on the grounds of their predicted zzso zzso The two inhibitor derivatives have a very similar orientation but a different magnitude of the zzso zzso and the protein structure around the active site is highly zzso The results encourage a more extensive use of the two-dimensional techniques for obtaining selective structural information on the active site of zzso With this information at hand, comparisons within zzso series of zzso with various zzso and/or zzso of the same zzso of known structure should be possible using limited sets of zzso zzso
