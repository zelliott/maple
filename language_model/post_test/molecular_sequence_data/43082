We have developed a method for the whole sequence amplification of zzso artificial zzso zzso DNA excised from zzso zzso gel zzso using single unique zzso chain reaction zzso We used seven zzso zzso zzso which span 2 zzso of the Huntington disease gene region on zzso to amplify the zzso zzso The average size of the amplified DNA was approximately 300 zzso long, and 12 DNA markers located on the zzso clones positively zzso with these amplified products, zzso that the sequences of the zzso clones were zzso amplified by our zzso These amplified zzso zzso greatly facilitate the characterization of zzso zzso leading to the detailed analysis of the defined zzso zzso
