Family zzso zzso is a genetic disorder caused by zzso in the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso It is characterized by a high concentration of low density zzso zzso which frequently gives rise to zzso zzso and premature coronary artery zzso We studied a FH family zzso was diagnosed by clinical features and blood zzso zzso The Total cholesterol level of the family was zzso zzso and the LDL level was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso FH subjects, while the total cholesterol was zzso zzso and LDL was zzso zzso in the zzso FH zzso DNA segments amplified with zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso FH zzso Two novel identical zzso zzso of zzso which caused an zzso acid change from zzso to Ala, were detected in zzso of LDL zzso gene in zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed that the zzso parents were zzso with the same zzso zzso as the zzso These results are in coincidence with the clinical zzso zzso zzso virus transformed zzso zzso were derived by routine virus infection transforming zzso The cells bounded with the zzso zzso LDL were measured by zzso flow zzso The ratios of functional zzso in zzso originated from zzso zzso zzso FH and normal control were zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a result, the zzso FH patient's zzso had zzso and the zzso FH patient's zzso had zzso of the activity of the zzso It is apparent that LDL zzso activity of zzso FH subject is significantly lower than normal zzso The data from zzso flow zzso analysis of zzso strongly support the clinical diagnoses and the results of DNA zzso In accordance with the updated version of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso gene which we have identified is a novel zzso of the zzso gene in human with zzso
