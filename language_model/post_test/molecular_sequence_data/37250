zzso is a suspected zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of the five-member ring of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso from zzso cultures amended with zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso was found to possess approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso per zzso respectively, whereas protein obtained from zzso cultures contains near zzso levels of zzso We conclude that zzso is incompletely activated in the zzso cells, perhaps due to an zzso of a needed accessory zzso zzso isolated from zzso cultures possesses very low activity zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso values of 5,000 and zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso These rates and corresponding zzso values zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso are significantly greater than those that have been reported zzso zzso zzso of the zzso species reveals a band centered at zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso is a competitive inhibitor of the zzso with significant zzso differences for the zinc and zzso species zzso and zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zinc zzso zzso only the S zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso prefers the S zzso but also zzso the R zzso at about zzso the zzso This is the first report for metal content of zzso from any zzso
