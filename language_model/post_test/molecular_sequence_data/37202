In solid zzso defective DNA mismatch repair zzso is most commonly caused by zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by promoter zzso and results in the acquisition of characteristic zzso zzso zzso of zzso repeats located within the coding regions of defined target zzso We previously identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso patient tumor samples and others have reported coding region zzso zzso in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso Thus, while zzso gene zzso are known to occur in some human zzso tumors in zzso it is still unknown if the coding region zzso zzso detected in human cell lines also occur in zzso or if zzso or zzso promoter zzso contributes to defective zzso in these zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding region repeats in 16 human zzso patient tumor samples and identified six with zzso zzso in one or both zzso There was no evidence of zzso or zzso promoter zzso as assessed by standard zzso specific zzso or by a novel zzso temperature zzso zzso zzso method that analyzed 25 and 30 zzso sites in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that coding region zzso zzso characteristic of defective zzso occur in some human zzso in zzso but not as a consequence of zzso or zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, the identification of zzso and zzso coding region zzso in zzso implicates these genes in the zzso of human zzso
