In order to provide important information about early diagnosis and treatment of tumor zzso a study on the biological regulation of zzso at the molecular level was carried out by zzso and identifying human zzso zzso gene or related DNA sequences from a pair of cell clones with different zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso technique zzso gene cloning and analysis by zzso were applied to this zzso Two cell clones of pulmonary giant cell zzso originating from the same patient were zzso The zzso cell clone which shows lower zzso zzso was used as tester and the zzso as a zzso 

Five zzso clones so obtained were expressed on much higher levels in the poorly zzso cancer cell clone than the highly zzso zzso zzso analysis of all five zzso fragments by zzso through zzso showed high zzso with the known human zzso 

Through using zzso we have identified five zzso fragments which are expressed at much higher levels in the poorly zzso cancer cell clone than the highly zzso zzso zzso it is supposed that they might play an important role in the suppression of zzso tumor cells and may very well have potential application in the diagnosis and treatment of zzso
