zzso zzso to zzso zzso are a common feature of a subset of zzso H chain genes that code for the majority of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso To examine the consequences of such zzso acid zzso on DNA zzso we reverted three zzso zzso of a zzso zzso H chain zzso zzso and zzso the effect of those zzso by expression in a V zzso 1 L zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso eliminated virtually all zzso binding and sharply reduced zzso zzso While the complete zzso zzso of zzso retained a low level of DNA zzso the substitution of zzso a product of N base addition in the third zzso determining region zzso with zzso zzso was sufficient to abolish zzso DNA zzso zzso with higher affinity for DNA were generated by introducing zzso into zzso at any one of four positions where zzso zzso to zzso had been identified by sequencing other zzso zzso H chain zzso All four zzso zzso showed affinity increments consistent with their direct involvement in DNA zzso although one such zzso zzso required the simultaneous zzso of an adjacent zzso acid zzso to the zzso zzso Two zzso with three zzso zzso showed further improvements in DNA affinity suggesting that their contributions to DNA binding may be zzso zzso modeling of zzso and zzso zzso structures and calculations of their zzso zzso were used as an aid in interpreting the results and in predicting the location and size of possible combining zzso
