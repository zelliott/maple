zzso protein zzso was originally identified as a zzso zzso domain zzso In a subsequent study, zzso was found to be a zzso zzso zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso gene and found that it is composed of 12 zzso and zzso on zzso zzso To better understand the structure and function of zzso we have generated a series of zzso that recognize different regions of zzso Using these zzso we found that zzso is expressed in four zzso as a result of differential zzso of zzso 8 in addition to the use of either the first or the second zzso zzso as the start zzso We also found that all these zzso are localized in the zzso and are zzso Furthermore, our data revealed that the zzso domain and zzso zzso are required for the zzso activity of zzso
