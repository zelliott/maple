Earlier studies from this laboratory had identified three regions in zzso zzso that influence the active zzso of the zzso These zzso are associated with the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this report, we define these zzso more accurately by identifying their critical clusters of zzso zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso zzso in zzso growth zzso and zzso binding studies, we are able to show that these three zzso defined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso are likely located on the surface of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in close spatial zzso We conclude that the zzso and zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso binding interactions and constitute zzso recognition sites in zzso zzso from our biological activity data, in the context of a number of zzso zzso that provide insights into the zzso surface zzso and flexibility of zzso acid zzso we zzso that the zzso zzso influence the active zzso of zzso most zzso This region likely represents a loop structure that is relatively rigid in zzso The zzso located strategic domain, zzso is comprised of two clusters of zzso acid zzso one that forms part of a rigid zzso the other a more flexible loop zzso Similarly, the zzso domain comprises a portion of an zzso structure that is followed by a loop zzso Close examination of the zzso acid sequences in all three regions among the different species of zzso s and human zzso indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso are most highly zzso yet some zzso is apparent in the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso region influences species specificity among the zzso and human zzso s and determines the differential specificity of action between human zzso and human zzso
