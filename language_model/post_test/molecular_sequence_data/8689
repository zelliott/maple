Two synthetic peptides 31 and 32 zzso acids in length were prepared as deduced from a known zzso acid sequence of zzso protein 2' zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were generated from fused cells of myeloma cells and zzso cells of mice zzso with the synthetic zzso Western zzso zzso analysis demonstrated specific binding of the zzso to zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso was developed by using these zzso for simple detection of zzso
