Previous studies suggested that zzso zzso is a repulsive guidance zzso on growth cones that binds to an unknown zzso zzso Here we present genetic evidence that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso a companion paper presents zzso evidence that zzso binds zzso zzso is a large zzso zzso protein expressed by zzso zzso In slit zzso growth cones enter the zzso but never leave it; they zzso continue to express high levels of zzso while at the zzso slit and zzso display zzso genetic zzso indicating that they function in the same zzso slit is also required for migration of muscle precursors away from the zzso zzso appears to function as a short-range repellent controlling zzso crossing of the zzso and as a long-range zzso controlling zzso migration away from the zzso
