Analysis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso had previously led to the definition of the zzso zzso the fusion partner on zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso zzso libraries identified 2 highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among these 3 zzso zzso has been found to be identical to zzso which codes for an zzso tumor zzso expressed in various human zzso zzso thus belongs to the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with characteristic zzso expression in normal zzso and in zzso To define additional CT zzso we have zzso a zzso zzso expression library with an zzso serum from a melanoma patient, and both zzso and zzso were zzso Further studies using zzso zzso and zzso zzso defined 2 new members of this gene family, zzso and zzso while a shorter zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso All 5 members of the zzso family shared strong sequence zzso with zzso zzso ranging from 88 to zzso and zzso acid zzso ranging from 77 to zzso zzso cloning of a zzso zzso gene zzso showed that its coding region is zzso by 6 zzso and the shortened form of zzso zzso represents an alternatively spliced product lacking the 5th zzso Analysis of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso confirmed that all 5 zzso genes are expressed in zzso In addition, analysis of a panel of 12 melanoma cell lines showed strong zzso expression of either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating variable zzso of the genes in zzso zzso
