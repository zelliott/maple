The three zzso zzso and zzso receptors have recently been cloned and characterized at the molecular zzso Our analysis of zzso zzso transcripts by zzso revealed two zzso products derived from delta and zzso zzso with size higher than expected from the known zzso zzso DNA sequencing showed additional zzso inserted between the known zzso sites, indicating the possible existence of alternative zzso pathways for delta and zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso transcript is expressed in mouse brain and contains a 243 zzso zzso This additional sequence is located at the zzso junction between the first and second coding zzso and is zzso by a single zzso located 9 zzso upstream zzso 2 in the zzso zzso The other alternative transcript occurs in human zzso and T zzso cell lines and encodes a novel form of the zzso zzso The zzso product presents a 23 zzso deletion at the 3' end of zzso 2 followed by a 246 zzso zzso found between zzso 2 and zzso In the zzso zzso this zzso is zzso by two DNA zzso One of them is located zzso zzso downstream zzso 2 while the second is zzso zzso 3 on the zzso zzso Both novel putative delta and zzso zzso present zzso stop zzso that would lead to truncated zzso zzso A possible functional or regulatory role of these shorter proteins in zzso function remains to be zzso
