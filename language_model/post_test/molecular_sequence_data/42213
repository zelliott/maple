The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso C zzso from the white muscle of the European zzso has been determined by zzso degradation zzso Its single zzso zzso is situated in zzso H at zzso acid position 152 of the aligned zzso the zzso is the first zzso on the zzso side of zzso binding loop zzso The increase of zzso zzso zzso intensity occurring upon zzso of zzso with zzso has been used to determine the affinity zzso of zzso for zzso The calculated affinity of zzso for zzso results in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso typical of the zzso sites of the second domain of fast skeletal muscle zzso Moreover, a direct competition between zzso and zzso was also zzso The calculated affinity of zzso for zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to probe the affinity zzso of the zzso binding sites of the regulatory domain, zzso was zzso with zzso zzso The zzso fluorescent signal was used to estimate the affinity zzso of zzso for zzso and also for zzso zzso a competitive zzso between these two metal zzso The calculated affinity zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These values are typical of the zzso sites of the regulatory domain of fast skeletal muscle zzso
