zzso zzso exchange zzso rate zzso of bovine zzso in an ammonium zzso solution containing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso were obtained using top-down, electron transfer zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso The zzso zzso replaces the acid and temperature zzso step in the conventional zzso approach to zzso experiments by causing rapid protein zzso to occur in the zzso zzso The higher charge state zzso that are produced with zzso are more zzso as measured by zzso mobility, and result in higher fragmentation efficiency and higher sequence coverage with zzso Single zzso acid resolution was obtained for 44 of 72 zzso zzso sites, and summed kinetic data were obtained for regions of the protein where adjacent zzso zzso were not observed, resulting in an overall spatial resolution of zzso zzso zzso of these results with previous values from zzso indicates that the zzso zzso does not cause significant structural changes to the protein in the initial zzso solution and that scrambling or zzso is zzso This new method for zzso zzso enables real-time kinetic data zzso under zzso conditions, similar to those obtained using zzso with comparable spatial resolution and significantly better zzso
