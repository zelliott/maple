zzso zzso coli zzso strains are a leading cause of infections in humans, but the mechanisms governing host colonization by this zzso remain poorly zzso Previous studies have identified numerous gene clusters zzso proteins involved in sugar zzso in zzso zzso We investigated the role in fitness and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso complex of the zzso zzso system, which is found more frequently in human strains from infected urine and blood zzso than in zzso coli isolated from healthy humans zzso We studied the role of this locus in zzso using the zzso zzso coli strain zzso zzso and zzso derivatives in two experimental mouse models of zzso zzso strains displayed attenuated zzso in a mouse model of zzso A role in kidney colonization was also demonstrated by zzso experiments in a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso examinations showed that the zzso zzso produced much smaller amounts of a zzso surface material than the wild type, particularly when growing in human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso led to an increase in the amount of zzso resistance to serum killing, and zzso It was therefore clear that the loss of zzso genes was responsible for all the observed zzso We also demonstrated the involvement of the zzso locus in gut colonization in the zzso mouse model of zzso zzso These findings confirm that zzso transport and metabolism zzso the ability of zzso strains to colonize the host zzso and to zzso various host zzso
