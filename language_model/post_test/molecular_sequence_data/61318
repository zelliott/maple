Six zzso zzso that bind to zzso zzso zzso were identified by in zzso selection from a zzso zzso The two most abundantly represented zzso interact with the zzso zzso loop, each through a sequence block with perfect zzso zzso to the zzso It was possible to zzso one of these zzso to a simple hairpin loop that forms a classical zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Three other zzso have nearly complete zzso to the zzso zzso The sixth zzso has two sequence blocks, one complementary to the zzso T loop and the other to the D zzso this zzso binds better to a zzso zzso that zzso the normal zzso zzso interaction than to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso occurred despite an attempt to direct binding to zzso structural features of zzso This serves as a reminder of how special the zzso interactions are that are not based on zzso Nonetheless, these zzso must present the zzso complement in some special structural zzso the simple zzso complement of the zzso loop did not bind zzso zzso
