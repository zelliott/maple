The zzso is a cell type that is highly specialized for its bone zzso zzso In order to decipher the numerous zzso functions of zzso a description of the gene expression profile of zzso would be zzso We have sought to identify genes that are highly expressed in zzso by partially sequencing zzso randomly chosen zzso clones from a representative rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid and protein sequence databases indicates that 135 of these zzso are identical to or zzso to known zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso with zzso zzso were used to verify the zzso expression of some of these zzso zzso zzso including two abundantly expressed species, have no significant similarity to the sequence databases and likely represent novel zzso The most abundant of the zzso expressed genes zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso Each were represented at a frequency of zzso of the clones in the library zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The high expression of these gene products is consistent with the high zzso of zzso and their very active hydrogen zzso zzso Other abundantly expressed sequences include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two novel gene sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso
