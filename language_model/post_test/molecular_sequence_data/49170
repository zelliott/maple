zzso interference with zzso zzso is a new method for the study of gene function in various zzso In this report, we show that an zzso repeat of a short zzso zzso sequence of an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by a small zzso family of four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso can specifically suppress the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso sequence similar to a transcribed zzso zzso The expression of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not affected, although the coding sequences of the zzso family genes are highly zzso zzso with this zzso small interfering zzso were detected for the zzso sequence used for the zzso zzso and not for the coding zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso having a zzso sequence could be useful for an zzso zzso interference of the family genes in zzso zzso
