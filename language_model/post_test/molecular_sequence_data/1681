zzso receptors zzso and specific zzso of zzso receptors are clustered at zzso by the zzso protein zzso which in turn is zzso to the cell membrane by the zzso exchange factor zzso We report the characterization of several new zzso of zzso which are created by alternative zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso domain and three alternate C zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of the zzso domain zzso regulates the ability of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Because the majority of native zzso zzso appear to harbor the zzso domain, this suggests that zzso activity may be regulated by zzso interactions at the zzso zzso We localized the binding sites for zzso and the zzso beta zzso to the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso and show that zzso of this domain is required for zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso in zzso systems and cultured zzso requires both zzso interactions and an intact zzso zzso zzso zzso The vital importance of zzso for zzso zzso is zzso by the discovery of a zzso zzso in zzso 2 of the human zzso gene zzso in a patient with clinical symptoms of both zzso and zzso The clinical manifestation of this zzso zzso zzso may result, at least in part, from zzso of zzso and a major zzso zzso zzso
