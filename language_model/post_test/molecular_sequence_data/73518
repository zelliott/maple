Studies on zzso interactions are important for the design of zzso or zzso of natural zzso We developed a zzso reporter zzso to screen zzso growth factor zzso zzso binding molecules rapidly for their ability to stimulate or inhibit signal zzso Human zzso displayed on zzso zzso zzso presented an activity similar to soluble zzso when tested for binding to the zzso for induction of cell cycle progression or in the zzso zzso Two libraries of human zzso zzso displayed on zzso were constructed in which the zzso acid zzso at position 46 or the zzso zzso at position 41 were zzso zzso zzso displayed on zzso were screened in parallel for binding to the zzso using an zzso zzso and for zzso activity using the zzso zzso Regarding the 46 position, most of the zzso retained the ability to bind the zzso and their zzso activity corresponded perfectly with their zzso For the more crucial 41 position, only the zzso zzso was able to bind the zzso Our approach allowed a simple determination of crucial positions and paved the way for identification of zzso with altered zzso zzso
