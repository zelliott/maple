zzso The effects of substitution of the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso on the zzso properties of the cloned human zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell lines, have been investigated using zzso and the structural zzso of zzso zzso The zzso or the zzso zzso forms of the zzso when expressed in cells in the absence of zzso toxin zzso are two orders of magnitude more sensitive to zzso of zzso zzso production by zzso and zzso respectively, than cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the effects are not due to an increased zzso affinity for the zzso receptors and that they are likely to be due to zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso After incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and above) produced a stimulation of zzso zzso levels in cells expressing the zzso zzso form of the zzso but showed no stimulation in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions zzso did not produce any increases in zzso zzso production in cells expressing either of the zzso zzso forms or the zzso zzso zzso The results zzso the importance of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in exerting an zzso influence on the ability of zzso and zzso respectively, to induce a zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is clear that zzso also prevents zzso from generating a zzso zzso that can increase zzso zzso levels, zzso the importance of this zzso in the zzso zzso of this zzso to different second zzso zzso
