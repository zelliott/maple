The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a protein that functions as a secondary zzso in a zzso system controlling the initiation of zzso zzso of the zzso gene was known to be dependent on an intact gene for the zzso regulator zzso In zzso footprint analysis revealed that zzso protein bound to two locations in the zzso promoter zzso zzso of a 40 zzso region upstream of one of the promoters zzso abolished the zzso of zzso expression that occurs at the onset of stationary phase and zzso This 40 zzso region contains a zzso zzso These observations are consistent with a hypothesis that zzso binding to this region is responsible for zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso binding at a downstream site could zzso the level of this zzso Since zzso protein is required for the formation of zzso (the form needed for zzso zzso a positive feedback loop controls zzso of zzso
