The zzso zzso protein B1 binds to the DNA consensus sequence zzso located twice in intervening sequence 2 of both of the mouse zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 was cloned by expression of a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso library in zzso zzso cells and screening by zzso mobility shift zzso B1 is identical to the zzso zzso zzso an zzso family zzso zzso contacts are shown to resemble those of the zzso zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, we found that zzso zzso is present at low levels during zzso zzso maturation and is at least zzso higher in zzso zzso a transformed zzso cell line which contains an zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation decreases zzso zzso to approximately zzso of the zzso level before commitment zzso In addition to zzso cells, zzso zzso is present in B cells, zzso and mast cells but not in T cells and zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso expression in bone zzso zzso zzso zzso of the liver, and zzso zzso cells of the zzso The zzso locus was mapped on human zzso 11 to the same zzso as zzso zzso acid zzso between the anonymous DNA markers zzso and zzso This region has not yet been found to be associated with a human zzso
