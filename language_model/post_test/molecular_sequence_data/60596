The embryonic lethal abnormal vision zzso proteins are zzso proteins that regulate zzso zzso The zzso members of this family are required for zzso zzso We identified the binding region of zzso zzso protein to a target zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso protein and demonstrated an in zzso interaction between the zzso protein and its target zzso zzso We show that treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso directed against zzso blocks the induction of zzso outgrowth and decreases the levels of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso proteins are required for zzso zzso
