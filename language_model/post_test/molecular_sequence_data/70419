A zzso zzso virus expressing both zzso H zzso and zzso L zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso was used to examine the protective response to zzso in zzso mice and to compare these responses with those induced by the highly protective zzso zzso D zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were obtained in response to the zzso complex, virus clearance from the site of challenge was marginally enhanced compared to that observed following zzso with zzso alone, and zzso was found to protect mice against acute infection in the zzso although not as efficiently as zzso
