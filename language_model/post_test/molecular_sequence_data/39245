The zzso tuberculosis zzso protein zzso are attractive potential drug targets, and protein zzso D zzso is particularly interesting, as it is zzso on 11 zzso binds proteins containing zzso associated zzso and contains a zzso motif that likely functions as an zzso sensor zzso We created a zzso knockout of a clinical zzso tuberculosis zzso and found that on in zzso zzso of cell wall zzso it lacked a family of zzso zzso seen in the zzso Mass zzso identified the zzso zzso as zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso presumably because it zzso zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso to the cell zzso zzso of the zzso family of zzso has not been previously zzso but these results suggest that zzso and perhaps other zzso zzso could regulate their critical role in the formation of the zzso tuberculosis zzso
