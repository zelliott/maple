To explore how to improve the zzso of zzso zzso zzso based zzso and to trigger an zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell response in zzso 

A new panel of zzso therapeutic peptides based on the zzso B cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso region, the zzso zzso of zzso and the universal T helper zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed using computerized molecular design method and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso properties of stimulating zzso and proliferation of zzso of inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in zzso using zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from healthy donors and chronic zzso B zzso 

zzso demonstrated that the therapeutic zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and universal zzso zzso could stimulate the zzso and proliferation of zzso induce specifically and effectively zzso T cell expansion and vigorous zzso zzso zzso in human zzso 

It indicated that the introduction of zzso T helper plus zzso with short and flexible zzso could dramatically improve the zzso of short zzso zzso in zzso
