The zzso zzso zzso gene is unique among the zzso coding genes in being transcribed by zzso zzso zzso The primary transcript of zzso is a zzso precursor zzso from which a long leader sequence is zzso to generate the mature zzso zzso We found that the box A and box B sequence elements in the leader region are both required for the in zzso zzso of the zzso As expected box B, but not box A, was absolutely required for stable zzso yet in zzso Surprisingly, however, the box B was found to be largely zzso for in zzso zzso of zzso whereas the box zzso template effectively recruited zzso yet it was zzso zzso Even in the complete absence of box B and both upstream zzso and zzso zzso the box A still directed efficient, zzso zzso Box zzso zzso was also observed for two members of the zzso gene family, but not for two zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso supported box zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso but only in the presence of zzso zzso with a crude zzso zzso zzso zzso in this fraction were also required for zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the box zzso zzso genes was strongly influenced by their zzso regions, and it was zzso by zzso and zzso proteins zzso The box A can thus be viewed as a core zzso element that, assisted by upstream zzso zzso is sufficient to promote class III gene zzso
