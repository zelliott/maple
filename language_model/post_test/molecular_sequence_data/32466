The zzso untranslated region zzso of the mouse zzso virus zzso zzso contains zzso sequences necessary for zzso and zzso A consensus secondary structural model of the zzso 140 zzso of the zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso derived from all three major zzso groups is presented and characterized by three major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provides structural support for zzso and zzso in three group 2 zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in all zzso typically containing a zzso zzso in zzso stacked on a 5 zzso zzso with some sequences containing an additional U 3' to zzso zzso therefore possesses sequence features consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are significantly protected from exchange with zzso consistent with a hydrogen bonding interaction critical to the hairpin loop zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso containing point zzso predicted to zzso the zzso structure zzso zzso were not viable, while those that maintain the structure zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso supports both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but fails to direct the synthesis of zzso or zzso zzso zzso These data support the existence of the zzso in our models, and further suggest a critical role in coronavirus zzso
