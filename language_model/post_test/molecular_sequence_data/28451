The mating zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a three-step zzso procedure with an overall yield of zzso It was identified as a protein of molecular weight 8000 having an zzso point of zzso Its complete primary structure was determined by automated zzso degradation of the whole protein after zzso acid zzso and of peptides generated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed sequence is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated molecular weight of zzso which is in good agreement with the value of zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso mass zzso suggests that the native structure is a zzso with three zzso zzso bonds in each zzso The zzso acid sequence is zzso identical with that of the zzso zzso mating zzso zzso with the identities concentrated in the zzso zzso The zzso locations are zzso but zzso is two zzso shorter than zzso zzso of the secondary structure suggests that zzso may also contain a zzso structure at the zzso zzso These results indicate that the mating zzso of zzso zzso form a zzso zzso
