Control of structure and function in membrane proteins remains a formidable zzso We report here a new design paradigm for the zzso of protein components in the context of zzso environments of biological zzso An zzso staged assembly process relying on the unique properties of fluorinated zzso acids was used to drive zzso zzso zzso In the first step, zzso peptides zzso into zzso zzso zzso phase separation of simultaneously zzso and zzso fluorinated zzso surfaces fueled spontaneous zzso of higher order zzso The creation of these ordered zzso protein ensembles is supported by gel zzso circular zzso zzso equilibrium zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy zzso
