zzso exposure of the grass zzso zzso may regulate flowering via changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso we have examined both zzso levels and expression of a zzso zzso factor that is specific to the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso This zzso gene from zzso zzso shows over zzso zzso identity with the barley and rice zzso zzso and, like them, zzso acid zzso zzso its expression in the zzso Furthermore, zzso of both the barley and zzso zzso zzso show the same simple patterns of zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso shoot zzso of zzso zzso the in zzso zzso expression of zzso does not change during the earliest steps of zzso initiation at the zzso However, by 100 h (the zzso stage of zzso its expression increased substantially and was highest in the terminal and lateral zzso zzso zzso expression declined overall but then increased within zzso zzso Prior to increased zzso zzso zzso exposure sufficient to induce flowering led to increased zzso to zzso levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso Thus, increases first in zzso level in the leaf followed by increased expression of zzso in the zzso suggest important signaling and/or response roles in zzso
