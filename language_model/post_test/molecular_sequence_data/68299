Plasma membrane zzso zzso of defined zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso and subjected to limited zzso to investigate the zzso and zzso composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso sites on the zzso complex are located primarily at the zzso face of the zzso with little or no zzso zzso occurring as the result of zzso at the zzso zzso In the zzso form, zzso activity was resistant to zzso by zzso zzso however at least four zzso previously implicated as possible zzso components zzso 83, 57 and 43 zzso were extensively zzso zzso of 31, 29 and 27 zzso resisted zzso E zzso and were also enriched in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and product zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapidly zzso by zzso zzso indicating that most zzso zzso sites are deeply embedded within the zzso This study provides direct zzso evidence that zzso integral membrane proteins oriented primarily towards the zzso face of the PM are important for zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, these results form the basis of a zzso derived working model largely consistent with zzso derived models proposed for zzso zzso zzso complexes in higher zzso
