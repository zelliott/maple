A new zzso site, which is a zzso zzso was found between zzso zzso and zzso in alpha zzso from the aged human zzso After zzso zzso of alpha zzso two peptides that include zzso were obtained and have remarkable zzso That is, the zzso of the zzso in the normal length zzso was predominately zzso to the zzso of zzso form zzso of zzso However, the zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso that lacks the sequence following zzso to the zzso remained predominately in the zzso form as indicated by a zzso value of zzso The results suggest that the secondary structure in the region of zzso to the zzso may constitute a field that causes the inversion of the zzso to the zzso zzso Since this kind of zzso was not found in alpha zzso from young zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso is probably the result of zzso
