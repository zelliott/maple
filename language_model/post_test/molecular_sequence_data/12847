The first four genes zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso are predicted to zzso the zzso required for the zzso of zzso which constitutes the backbone structure of the zzso of the zzso Based on zzso to known zzso families, the following functions are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is zzso from zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso zzso by zzso to zzso by zzso to zzso by zzso and to zzso by zzso This final product would then serve as the zzso for the addition of the zzso which could then be zzso into the zzso for transfer to the zzso A plus core zzso and export to the cell zzso The organization of these genes are such that one would expect them to be zzso coupled as part of the zzso zzso However, the absence of readily zzso promoter sequences suggests low levels of transcription, in line with other zzso The zzso sequence of these genes is absolutely zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were expected to show zzso sequence zzso This suggests very tight constraints on the zzso within these zzso
