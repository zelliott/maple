The production by zzso zzso of therapeutic zzso intended for use in zzso is held back by the inherent difference in protein zzso and by the inability of the zzso cell to modify proteins with zzso zzso zzso Here, we report protein zzso engineering in two zzso zzso We functionally expressed in the zzso hosts zzso zzso fusion proteins containing different zzso peptides and zzso zzso This strategy allowed the isolation of a strain with a functional zzso producing increased amounts of zzso of the zzso zzso This strain was further engineered by the introduction of a functional zzso zzso I construct yielding zzso zzso Additionally, we deleted zzso genes coding for an zzso involved in an early step of the zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso This modification of zzso zzso is a step toward the ability to produce humanized complex zzso on therapeutic proteins in zzso zzso
