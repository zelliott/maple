An zzso zzso evaluation of 100 zzso zzso complex zzso clinical zzso led to the identification of five respiratory tract zzso that were potential representatives of three novel MAC zzso zzso zzso features of zzso zzso and zzso included a zzso zzso and both zzso and acid zzso zzso These two zzso exhibited sequence similarities of zzso % for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for zzso zzso gene internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for zzso and zzso and zzso % for zzso respectively, with the type strain of zzso zzso the most closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso lacked zzso and zzso zzso They exhibited sequence similarities of zzso % for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for zzso zzso % for zzso and zzso and zzso % for zzso respectively, with the type strain of zzso zzso the most closely related zzso zzso zzso lacked zzso and zzso activities, but it exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and acid zzso zzso It had sequence similarities of zzso % for the zzso zzso zzso zzso % for zzso zzso % for zzso and zzso % for zzso with the type strain of zzso zzso the most closely related zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences showed the uniqueness of these five zzso as representatives of three novel species, with zzso values zzso % in all zzso On the basis of these zzso and genetic zzso these five zzso are proposed as representatives of three novel MAC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
