zzso zzso is closely associated with the development of some forms of zzso The major zzso zzso released by this zzso zzso zzso bonds only after zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso No target protein zzso have been identified for either zzso leading us to investigate their zzso by human plasma alpha zzso zzso zzso Both 50- and 95 zzso zzso R were efficiently inhibited by alpha zzso whereas the zzso activity of zzso K could not be zzso All 3 zzso were, however, inhibited by a zzso zzso from rat zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso must be zzso in the so-called zzso zzso in order to inhibit zzso by a mechanism involving physical zzso of the zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequences of the 2 zzso indicates that the lack of zzso zzso within the bait region of alpha zzso protects zzso zzso from being zzso On this basis, other highly specific zzso might also not be inhibited by alpha zzso possibly explaining the inability of the inhibitor to control zzso activity in some zzso induced inflammatory states, despite its abundance zzso zzso in vascular zzso
