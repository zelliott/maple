zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are counterparts in the metabolism of zzso lipids and a balanced regulation of both zzso appears to be important for the cellular zzso tone regulating the expression of zzso sensitive zzso In contrast to zzso the molecular biology of zzso is less well zzso In this study we cloned the zzso zzso from a mouse zzso zzso library and the zzso gene from a mouse zzso zzso The gene spans approximately 4 zzso which includes 1 zzso of zzso region and consists of seven zzso and six zzso The immediate promoter region does not contain a zzso box but there are binding sites for several zzso factors which also occur in the zzso zzso Our investigations provide useful tools for future targeted gene disruption zzso
