Most models for the central zzso folding unit in zzso zzso of the Alzheimer's plaque protein zzso align the peptides in register in zzso parallel zzso zzso Some models require the zzso zzso to undergo a chain reversal when folding into the zzso core, while other models feature very long extended zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso In this paper we introduce the use of zzso bond zzso to probe the fold within the core and the packing interactions between zzso In one approach, zzso zzso grown under reducing conditions from each of three double zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso sequence were subjected to zzso zzso Of these three zzso only the zzso zzso could be zzso efficiently while resident in zzso In another approach, double zzso zzso were zzso as zzso before zzso and the resulting zzso were assessed for stability, zzso zzso dye zzso and zzso zzso Here too, zzso from the zzso double zzso zzso most closely resemble zzso zzso zzso These data support models of the zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso side chains of the same zzso pack against each other at the zzso interface within the zzso zzso Related zzso strategies may reveal longer range spatial zzso The ability of the zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso to also make zzso zzso illustrates a remarkable plasticity of the zzso structure and suggests a structural mechanism for the generation of zzso zzso of zzso
