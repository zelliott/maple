We isolated four kings of zzso clones of zzso of zzso zzso of protein zzso 1 zzso from rat liver and zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso fragments of zzso and zzso which zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso Two of the four zzso were thought to be derived from the same gene and produced by alternative zzso Based on the comparative study of their zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences with those reported, these zzso clones were named rat zzso zzso zzso gamma 1, zzso gamma 2 and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these four zzso clones showed about zzso zzso Their zzso regions were highly zzso and their differences were mainly in the zzso zzso Furthermore, several zzso acids located in the middle regions of the peptides were zzso in all the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso regions are suggested to be the functional zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by a food zzso zzso showed increased expression of zzso zzso but no increased expression of zzso gamma 1, zzso gamma 2 or zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha in zzso or in zzso cell proliferation was zzso
