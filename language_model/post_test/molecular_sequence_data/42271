zzso is a zzso approximately zzso zzso smooth zzso protein which is zzso expressed in up to four zzso zzso binds very strongly to zzso in a zzso manner and is localized to the thin filaments in smooth muscle, where it is present at a zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso cycling zzso without affecting zzso zzso The zzso interaction is blocked and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is reversed upon zzso of zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso these properties are restored upon zzso of zzso by a type 2A protein zzso zzso with these in zzso findings, zzso is zzso in intact smooth muscle in response to zzso zzso The increasing body of evidence, both in zzso and in zzso strongly supports zzso zzso as a thin zzso regulatory system in smooth zzso
