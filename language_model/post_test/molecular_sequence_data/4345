The zzso version of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been found on zzso and other tumors, but not on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically targets zzso zzso in zzso when labeled using zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso consisting of the variable region of zzso and the constant zzso of human zzso has been developed that has an affinity and zzso zzso fraction comparable to zzso In zzso both zzso were zzso and processed by zzso expressing cell lines zzso delta zzso or zzso at similar rates zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso tissue distribution studies in zzso mice bearing zzso delta zzso tumor zzso the zzso zzso zzso ratio in normal zzso rose to greater than zzso whereas in zzso the ratio remained zzso throughout the zzso These results indicate that zzso exhibits similar binding and zzso properties as its zzso parent, but suggest different zzso processing and/or deposition of zzso in normal zzso for zzso
