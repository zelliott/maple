zzso zzso zzso genes constitute a complex zzso family with six major zzso zzso in zzso The recently zzso zzso of domestic apple, zzso was zzso for zzso zzso by blasting full-length cellulose zzso protein zzso sequences zzso in the apple zzso against protein databases from the plant models zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thirteen genes belonging to the six zzso zzso zzso and coding for proteins with zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso from family 2 were zzso Based on their zzso relationship to zzso zzso as well as expression patterns, a nomenclature is proposed to facilitate further zzso zzso of their zzso organization revealed that zzso is closely linked and zzso with zzso a gene coding for a zzso repeat zzso The zzso and zzso genes display zzso zzso in zzso and are partially zzso in the apple zzso Interestingly, the presence of a zzso zzso transcript was detected in zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso transcript contains a spliced zzso sequence that is predicted to fold into hairpin structures typical of internal zzso entry sites, suggesting its potential zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso is alternatively spliced and lacks the zzso zzso The possible roles of zzso and the alternatively spliced zzso zzso during cellulose zzso in zzso are zzso
