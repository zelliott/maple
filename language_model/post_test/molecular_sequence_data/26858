zzso zzso likely transmit the greatest variety of human and animal pathogens of any zzso zzso Despite their medical significance little data is available about the zzso molecules in the central nervous system that coordinate all zzso processes in these animals, including zzso In our study, we performed the first comprehensive zzso analysis of a tick species by using zzso mass zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The forthcoming sequence of the zzso of this species will represent the first zzso analysis of a member of the large zzso zzso For our approach we used information from predicted zzso precursor sequences found in zzso databases zzso zzso zzso discovery in zzso an in zzso investigation using publicly accessible expressed sequence zzso Gen zzso zzso zzso as well as data obtained by complete de zzso zzso The direct tissue profiling yielded 20 zzso from 12 zzso zzso The sequences of these zzso are not as unique as zzso a comparison with the zzso of other zzso shows a close relationship with insect zzso This work will provide a resource for studying tick zzso and will hopefully also help to identify novel targets for tick and zzso disease zzso
