A zzso zzso has been highly zzso from the zzso of human acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The apparent molecular weight of this zzso was approximately 50,000, as indicated by its zzso in zzso zzso The zzso did not zzso with DNA zzso activity, required zzso for its zzso activity, and was inhibited by zzso above 60 zzso The zzso was active on zzso DNA, DNA duplexes and zzso duplexes, and it was efficient at removing zzso zzso from zzso The products of the zzso reaction were zzso zzso The behavior of the zzso was examined on DNA terminated at the 3' end with a variety of zzso that are potent against human zzso virus type zzso The zzso has a broad zzso zzso however, the rate of the zzso reaction varied among the D zzso tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso was examined for its zzso with DNA terminated by either the D or L zzso of zzso zzso or zzso The removal of zzso with the native D zzso was at least zzso more rapid than that of the zzso and the type of structural modification had an impact on the rate at which the D zzso were removed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were potent zzso of the zzso at zzso zzso while zzso partially inhibited the zzso at zzso zzso Based on its physical and zzso properties, this zzso represents a novel zzso that may have an important role in determining the relative zzso of zzso against human zzso virus type zzso
