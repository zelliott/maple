zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is thought to play an important role in zzso zzso However, its exact function is still zzso 

Here, we characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigate its importance for zzso function and zzso We show that zzso is highly zzso among different species and zzso zzso interference against zzso causes severe zzso characterized by early zzso arrest, zzso dysfunction and embryonic zzso Investigation of zzso physiology revealed a zzso in zzso structure while zzso and function, as indicated by complex I and zzso zzso activities, appeared to be zzso according to the zzso zzso Nevertheless, we observed very low complex I and zzso zzso activities in zzso larvae populations in comparison to higher zzso and adult zzso Our findings indicate that zzso animals arrest at zzso stages with low zzso zzso In addition, a reduced zzso fat storage and low zzso content after depletion of zzso suggests a central role of this protein for zzso zzso 

In zzso our data clearly indicate that zzso is essential for zzso zzso development in zzso Moreover, our results suggest that the protein is important for the zzso of zzso activity during the transition to higher zzso zzso
