The full-length zzso zzso and DNA zzso sequences zzso a basic zzso factor 3, designated as zzso were first isolated from common wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso protein was mainly located in the zzso and zzso In zzso transgenic wheat zzso obtained using the zzso gene zzso zzso method, the zzso zzso content was markedly zzso However, the zzso zzso and zzso contents were zzso and the structure of the wheat zzso cell was seriously zzso Furthermore, transcripts of the zzso and zzso genes were significantly reduced in zzso transgenic wheat zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene might function in the development of the wheat zzso zzso and zzso zzso This paper is the first report to describe the involvement of zzso in maintaining the normal plant zzso cell zzso
