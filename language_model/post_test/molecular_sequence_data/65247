The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize a zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was used as indicator strain in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction was influenced by pH and buffer zzso The protein was active in the pH range zzso zzso activity was lost by both heating and treatment with zzso zzso and decreased with organic zzso The substance is rather unstable but maintains zzso of its activity after being exposed to zzso and when stored at zzso degrees zzso The zzso substance was first zzso by ammonium zzso and further partially zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis showed that the molecular mass was 23 625 zzso and the sequence obtained for the zzso was: zzso 

The evidence presented in this study supports the idea that an zzso substance produced by zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso diseased site is a novel zzso which we designate zzso 

We anticipated that zzso might play an important role at the zzso zzso This compound could also be attractive in zzso applications as an interesting tool for oral zzso zzso
