We have identified a major zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso protein zzso based on zzso data and zzso zzso with zzso raised against zzso from another zzso zzso A zzso for this zzso identified by a zzso cloning strategy, zzso all 68 of the zzso acids zzso thus confirming the identity of the zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed at both the zzso and protein levels, and only zzso transcripts corresponding in size to the zzso sequence were zzso zzso zzso analyses show that there are roughly zzso copies of the zzso gene in zzso making this gene one of the most highly repeated zzso genes ever reported, yet the sequence of the different gene copies in the zzso appears extraordinarily well zzso as judged by Southern zzso zzso The zzso as indicated by Southern zzso and zzso data, is suggested to be present in zzso zzso copies arranged head to tail in the zzso separated by zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso sequence of the zzso region, its presence next to each of the zzso coding zzso and the uniform size of the zzso transcript, we propose that this region represents a zzso zzso zzso This putative promoter region contains none of the sequence elements for zzso proteins involved in zzso initiation reported in other zzso
