To identify transcribed sequences rapidly and zzso we have developed a zzso zzso to screen zzso zzso libraries for sequences that share zzso with a given zzso This strategy determines zzso whether a given probe is transcribed in a given tissue at a given time of development, and may also be used to isolate zzso the transcribed sequence free of the screening zzso We illustrate this technology for the fragile X zzso demonstrating that it is transcribed zzso in an 11 week zzso in a variety of 20 week human fetal zzso including brain, spinal cord, eye, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, and in adult zzso
