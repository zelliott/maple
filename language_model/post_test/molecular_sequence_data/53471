zzso initially identified as a soluble human plasma protein with zzso zzso IV activity that is expressed and released by activated T zzso also has been identified as the product of the zzso mahogany gene with connections to control of pigmentation and energy zzso The mahogany product, however, is a zzso zzso raising the possibility of a human membrane zzso in addition to the zzso zzso The zzso structure of human zzso reveals that soluble zzso arises from zzso of 25 sequential zzso on human zzso zzso where the 3' terminal zzso contains sequence from a long zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso element that includes a stop zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso for membrane zzso zzso over the zzso zzso and includes five zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with organization and coding potential almost identical to that of the mouse zzso The relative abundance of soluble and zzso zzso measured by reverse zzso is zzso regulated in zzso zzso Because zzso of peripheral blood zzso with zzso zzso strong expression of cell surface zzso followed by release of soluble zzso these results suggest that a zzso event unique to zzso zzso zzso has provided an evolutionary mechanism for regulating cell interactions during an inflammatory zzso
