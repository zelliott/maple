In cultured rat cardiac zzso a zzso pair sequence zzso of the rat zzso heavy chain zzso promoter mediates induction by both alpha zzso stimulation and a zzso activated zzso zzso C zzso and binds cardiac zzso nuclear zzso through an zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Simpson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we report identification of this zzso core binding factor as the rat zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a human zzso factor for viral zzso In gel mobility shift and zzso zzso the zzso factor and human zzso were indistinguishable in terms of sequence recognition, mobility, and zzso Furthermore, DNA binding activity for the zzso zzso core and zzso zzso correlated zzso These results are the first to suggest a role for zzso in zzso regulation by zzso The data also provide direct evidence for interaction of zzso with the zzso promoter, supporting a function for zzso in regulation of cellular gene zzso as well as zzso and outline a zzso for alpha zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso in cardiac zzso
