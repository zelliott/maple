zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein that is highly concentrated in nerve terminals where it interacts via its zzso domain with zzso I, a zzso implicated in synaptic zzso zzso We show here that the zzso domain of zzso but not a zzso zzso domain, bound with high affinity to a single site in the long zzso region of human zzso I, that this site was distinct from the binding sites for other zzso zzso and that the zzso of two adjacent zzso acids in zzso I was sufficient to abolish zzso The zzso I sequence critically required for zzso binding zzso fits in the novel zzso binding consensus identified for the zzso domain of zzso via a zzso zzso library approach: zzso Our data demonstrate that the long zzso stretch present in zzso I contained multiple zzso domain binding sites that recognize interacting proteins with high zzso
