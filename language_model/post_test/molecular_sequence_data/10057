We have cloned 15 zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso gene from liver zzso library, which contains 6 zzso upstream sequence from the translation initiation zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso DNA from the liver has revealed that zzso zzso zzso gene is the single gene in the zzso To study the zzso expression mechanism of the zzso we at first determined the zzso start site of the zzso zzso of a rapid amplification of zzso end procedure as well as that of primer extension analysis indicated that the zzso start sites clustered between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the gene (A in zzso is designated as zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene and zzso gene expressed significant zzso activity when zzso into a rat zzso cell line, zzso but little activity was observed in zzso rat liver zzso zzso analysis of the zzso indicated that a minimal region, exhibiting promoter activity and cell zzso is located between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso I zzso shows that nuclear extracts from zzso but not zzso cells protect a region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso have demonstrated that nuclear extracts from zzso cells formed a specific zzso complex with an zzso probe corresponding to zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso but that from zzso cells did not, suggesting that zzso nuclear factors bind to the zzso When the nuclear extracts from zzso cells were zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing nuclear zzso formation of the complex was abolished and the band was zzso We also found that the probe formed a zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the binding site eliminated factor zzso When zzso was zzso with the minimal promoter zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene into zzso cells, which express no zzso it caused a significant increase in the zzso activity of the reporter zzso but not of the construct having zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso gene in zzso
