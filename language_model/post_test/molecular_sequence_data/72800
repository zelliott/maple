zzso Display was used to isolate genes that show zzso changes in the kidney during the development of diabetes in the zzso zzso Eight candidate zzso zzso fragments, zzso were isolated and zzso zzso sequencing and subsequent database analysis revealed that zzso 4, 5 and 6 showed no significant sequence similarity to previously reported zzso suggesting that they represent novel zzso whereas zzso 1, 3, 7 and 8 showed significant similarity with rat zzso zzso rat zzso sensitive sodium channel, zzso and mouse zzso protein zzso The differential zzso expression of zzso was confirmed using differential screening of slot zzso zzso 2, 4 and 8 zzso appeared to increase whereas zzso 5, 6 and 7 zzso decreased in the zzso of zzso rats with increasing zzso The altered zzso zzso expression of these genes in association with increased zzso in the zzso rat suggest that they are candidates for a role in the development of diabetic zzso
