The loss of the fragile X zzso binding zzso zzso causes zzso and mental zzso in zzso The discovery of a mouse zzso led to the development of several zzso knockout mouse strains that zzso some features of the zzso As mouse and human zzso differ in several zzso acids in their zzso binding zzso we compared the zzso binding profiles of these two zzso Five zzso zzso whose differences arose from alternative zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso binding zzso were zzso zzso binding studies showed that human zzso zzso bound a broader range of zzso zzso than mouse zzso zzso and these interactions were both complex and zzso zzso and zzso also displayed significant preferences toward binding their own zzso specifically we found that the zzso zzso bind zzso zzso much more tightly than their human zzso Finally, these data demonstrate that each zzso zzso binds zzso zzso resulting in a set of proteins with differing zzso
