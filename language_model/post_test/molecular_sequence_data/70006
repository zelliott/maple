zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a recently described protein family, zzso by the sexual accessory zzso and become associated with the zzso head upon zzso They contain zzso zzso acid zzso two zzso zzso bridges, are not zzso and have zzso primary structure zzso These zzso zzso are zzso zzso which possess zzso zzso and/or zzso capability and have, therefore, been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is unique among zzso zzso in that it is the only member of the family which is known to be zzso and which possesses weak zzso but not zzso zzso In this study we report the structural and functional characterization of the two zzso contained in the zzso zzso One component is identical with zzso a major zzso seminal plasma protein whose function has not yet been identified, while the second protein is a zzso zzso of zzso Here we show that the inability of the zzso zzso zzso to bind zzso zzso zzso as well as the weak binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is due to the presence of the zzso chain on a zzso zzso zzso This indicates that modification of a zzso zzso framework may serve to zzso its zzso zzso
