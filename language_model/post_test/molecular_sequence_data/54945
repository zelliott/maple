Avian influenza virus zzso infection is a major problem of product performance in poultry zzso zzso is used to limit spread, but more knowledge is needed on the epidemiology of virus zzso to improve vaccine zzso In this study, 40 zzso zzso avian influenza viruses zzso were isolated from vaccinated poultry flocks in China from 2010 to zzso zzso zzso from different virus strains was zzso and zzso We found that the zzso genes of these strains shared zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso that ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso respectively, when compared with vaccine zzso zzso analysis showed that the strains tested could be divided into two major zzso Group I consisted of 24 strains isolated mainly from Eastern and Central zzso Group II consisted of 20 strains isolated from Southern zzso The zzso site within the zzso protein contained two basic zzso zzso for group I, and zzso for group zzso Additional potential zzso sites were found at zzso acid position 295 in the zzso of the zzso in group I, compared with zzso in group II and the vaccine zzso Furthermore, 38 out of the 40 zzso had a zzso zzso at position 216 zzso 226 in zzso which was characteristic of human influenza zzso zzso zzso In the present study we found that geographical factors play a significant role in virus evolution, and emphasize the importance of continuing surveillance of zzso zzso in chickens in zzso
