To monitor the evolving molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of zzso in a country where many distinct strains zzso we performed genetic analyses on sequences from 75 zzso zzso 74 were group M and 1 was group zzso Of the group M zzso 74 were classified into the following zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and E zzso zzso 1, zzso and 1 was a zzso zzso zzso of zzso for 70 matched zzso and zzso sequences showed inconsistent zzso for 18 zzso zzso Our data show that zzso is rampant in Cameroon with zzso viruses continuing to zzso adding to the complexity of circulating zzso zzso This expanding genetic diversity raises public health concerns for the ability of diagnostic zzso to detect these unique zzso mosaic zzso and for the development of broadly effective zzso zzso
