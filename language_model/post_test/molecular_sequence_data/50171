The zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to a dual effect on the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lab zzso 1998, zzso The zzso zzso zzso was recently determined to be zzso zzso zzso et zzso Am J zzso 2001, zzso In this study we determined the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso A zzso analogue zzso of zzso zzso with 18 zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso as a part, reproduced the dual function in the zzso zzso A zzso analogue zzso attracted zzso as well as zzso When zzso 12 zzso of zzso zzso after the zzso zzso zzso were connected to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso newly obtained the dual function, indicating that the zzso portion of zzso zzso functions as a zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso His was not essential but the next zzso was necessary for the zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that was truncated for the zzso 4 zzso lost the zzso selectivity in the zzso zzso in zzso as in the case of the zzso zzso in zzso These results indicated that the conversion of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso is attributed to the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
