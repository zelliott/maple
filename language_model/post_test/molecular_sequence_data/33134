Discrimination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the members of the zzso zzso zzso complex, is important for diagnosis and zzso studies of visceral zzso zzso We have developed two molecular tools including a restriction zzso length zzso of amplified DNA zzso and a zzso that are capable to discriminate zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the complex was performed by a simple zzso of zzso zzso B zzso gene followed by zzso with zzso The zzso cuts the zzso zzso of zzso zzso into 400 and zzso zzso fragments whereas the 702 zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso The designed zzso zzso primer pair is specific for zzso zzso and is capable of amplifying a 317 zzso of 3' end of zzso gene of zzso zzso whereas it does not generate an zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the restriction zzso were designed based on a 39 zzso zzso zzso in the middle of the zzso zzso Both zzso could differentiate correctly the two species and are reliable and zzso alternatives for molecular diagnosis and zzso studies of zzso in various zzso
