Because it is difficult to differentiate male and female zzso birds zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso detection of DNA fragments associated with zzso binding genes or zzso genes have been widely zzso The objective was to establish a zzso zzso amplification system involving the zzso zzso zzso gene and a zzso gene for sex identification of zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso chain reaction zzso random amplification zzso zzso and amplified zzso length zzso target DNA was amplified under zzso conditions (the entire process was completed in zzso zzso By modulating various parameters involved in amplification, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the relative ratio of zzso zzso and temperatures, optimal conditions for both targets were established that had equal detection limits zzso zzso To simplify sex determination, direct observations of the presence of white zzso zzso from zzso zzso were used for positive samples, which was compared with the zzso ring which formed in a negative sample after addition of zzso This approach was a rapid alternative to zzso or zzso DNA extracted from the blood and feathers of various birds were tested using zzso zzso zzso results were consistent with a standard zzso Thus, the zzso was a simple, accurate, fast, and economical alternative suitable for veterinary zzso
