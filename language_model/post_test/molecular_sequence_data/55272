We investigated the promoter activity of zzso gene and analyzed its zzso regulatory zzso 

We cloned promoter zzso into promoter probe zzso which has a reporter gene zzso thus the promoter activity could be measured by detecting zzso zzso Then, the promoter region was minimized by cloning different truncated promoter fragments into promoter probe zzso Using zzso zzso technology, we introduced site zzso in some key sequences and investigated their effects on promoter zzso 

The promoter region of zzso gene was determined, and also the zzso region and zzso region were zzso Meanwhile, a negative regulatory sequence just upstream of zzso promoter was discovered, and our results show that these sequences have important influence on the zzso zzso 

We identified the zzso regulatory sequences of zzso zzso and this facilitated our understanding of gene zzso
