We have designed a zzso competition zzso to evaluate zzso binding to empty zzso zzso class II zzso The efficiency of this zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso molecules zzso produced in insect cells and 13 peptides from human zzso reverse zzso zzso We demonstrate that our method allowed accurate zzso of zzso Ki values and can thus discriminate strong, moderate and poor zzso zzso In zzso we showed that among zzso zzso the most zzso in healthy individuals were those with moderate affinity for zzso while no T cell response could be evidenced against peptides with very strong or very low affinities for zzso This strongly suggests that the precise determination of zzso affinity with our method can improve zzso class II zzso zzso
