zzso is the sole representative of the zzso zzso which were widely distributed during the zzso period before the spectacular rise of zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso zzso of this zzso The zzso features of zzso are remarkably conservative and differ little from zzso living 200 million years zzso In the present paper the determination of the primary structure of the zzso zzso is zzso three components are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso A zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso D zzso zzso beta zzso The components were characterized zzso the four different zzso chains were characterized by zzso zzso as well as by zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso were isolated on columns of cellulose zzso zzso zzso determination was carried out after zzso of the individual chains with zzso and after a specific chemical zzso of the zzso zzso For sequence determination the film technique and zzso method were zzso The data are compared with the sequence of the human zzso and interpretations of the zzso sequences are zzso Particularly notable is the evidence of zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso beta zzso is found only in birds, and in two cases in zzso However, this component is not found in other zzso The results make possible an interpretation of the relatively high oxygen affinity and explain the lack of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso
