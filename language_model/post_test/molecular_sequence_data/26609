The zzso controlled zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains only one zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The biological role of this zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso functions of zzso was examined by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso not only obviously decreased the zzso capacity of the zzso bacteria exposed to zzso zzso hydrogen zzso but also significantly interrupted the normal growth and survival of the zzso bacteria and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating a key role played by zzso in the zzso and zzso functions of zzso This study also suggested that the zzso or zzso with other interacting proteins is critical to the zzso function of zzso
