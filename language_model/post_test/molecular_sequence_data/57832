An initial crucial step in zzso zzso of gene expression is the interaction of the zzso zzso with a specific zzso sequence zzso responsive element zzso Previously, we found that the zzso zzso binds zzso and with high affinity to the lower strand of the rat zzso imperfect zzso which contains zzso structure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso Using perfect and imperfect zzso from the upstream region of the chicken zzso II zzso we have now extended our findings and have determined that the zzso zzso zzso interacts with either perfect or imperfect zzso which contain zzso zzso A similar structure is present in a synthetic 42 zzso zzso corresponding to the lower strand of a perfect zzso with zzso sequences from the rat zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from the zzso consensus sequence decrease the binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We also have determined that zzso zzso sequences contribute to the affinity of the zzso for the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso sequences can influence the types of interactions that the zzso zzso makes with the zzso zzso
