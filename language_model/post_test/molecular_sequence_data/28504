The beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso is markedly zzso by zzso cells of differing zzso origin including those present in zzso breast, prostate and zzso zzso We have previously shown that some patients with zzso zzso zzso tumors have circulating T cells that zzso in response to zzso zzso To make a comprehensive study of zzso beta as a potential target for cancer zzso we investigated whether zzso beta peptides could induce zzso or zzso zzso responses in zzso By stimulating peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from three donors with zzso of overlapping zzso synthetic peptides analogous to portions of either the zzso beta zzso or the zzso beta zzso region, we established six zzso zzso lines that proliferated specifically in response to five distinct zzso located within these two zzso beta zzso Three zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso were presented by zzso zzso while the two other zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso were presented by zzso zzso Interestingly, one zzso line specific for zzso zzso beta zzso recognized zzso beta peptides zzso at position zzso either an zzso or an zzso acid zzso with the latter zzso being present within the protein expressed by some tumor zzso In addition, three other zzso zzso peptides that exhibited zzso binding ability were able to stimulate zzso zzso T cells from two zzso zzso These three zzso peptides corresponded to regions zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso beta possesses numerous zzso zzso liable to stimulate zzso and zzso T zzso and might thus be an effective target zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
