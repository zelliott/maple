The affinity to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of the Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso is here described for the first zzso By a strategic combination of zzso techniques, molecular zzso and data mining tools it was possible to identify the crucial zzso acid zzso that are responsible for zzso ability to bind zzso acid zzso in a specific zzso Furthermore, we are able to discuss the role of the functional groups of zzso acid when bound to zzso Also the impact of zzso in its zzso or zzso on zzso zzso affinity is of special interest, since it answers the question if zzso is a crucial zzso acid for stabilizing complexes between zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be considered as a proper model system that provides further insights into the binding mechanisms of zzso zzso to zzso acid on a zzso zzso
