A rapid and simple zzso chain reaction zzso method was developed to detect zzso zzso in gastric biopsy specimens and dental plaque zzso The zzso were targeted to the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The system was found to have a theoretical detection level of zzso to 5 zzso zzso cells in a 5 zzso sample of dental zzso In the absence of zzso the detection level was even better: zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells were detected in water zzso However, this appeared to be due to the presence of free bacterial DNA in the culture used for the sensitivity zzso Thus, the actual sensitivity of the system was found to be fewer than five zzso zzso cells, irrespective of the type of sample zzso The method was then used to zzso 29 dental plaque and gastric biopsy specimens collected from patients with a history of zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourteen stomach specimens were positive for zzso zzso when tested with the zzso method, while the respective figures with culture, zzso examination and the zzso test were 11, 12 and zzso No positive dental plaque samples were zzso
