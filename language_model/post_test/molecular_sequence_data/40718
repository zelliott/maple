zzso embedded in the cell wall and plasma membrane of zzso zzso and zzso provide a means by which these organisms can interact with their local zzso However, cell wall and membrane proteins have often proved difficult to isolate using conventional zzso zzso Here we have used liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso to facilitate rapid and sensitive zzso of the cell wall zzso We report the use of zzso to identify zzso regulated proteins from the cell walls of three different zzso stages of the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso We have also used quantitative real-time zzso to confirm that the transcripts corresponding to some of these zzso namely those identified in cell walls of zzso zzso with zzso accumulate zzso throughout the zzso These proteins may, therefore, be important for zzso development and early zzso Up to 31 zzso and zzso bound cell zzso proteins were zzso All of the proteins identified in zzso zzso with zzso and several of those from zzso zzso were classified as putative zzso or zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso including members of the zzso family, the zzso family, the zzso zzso family and two zzso Thus, the cell wall of zzso zzso may represent an important zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted to be cell surface proteins included zzso like zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso family zzso zzso we identified up to 27 zzso proteins from zzso zzso phase zzso zzso membrane zzso producing the first inventory of zzso zzso zzso Four of these proteins are small zzso zzso and several are associated with zzso
