zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso signature zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of an 18 182 zzso locus zzso 29 potential zzso zzso Thirteen of the 29 putative zzso were found to share extensive zzso with genes on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso were not only found in a zzso but also in the same gene order, in both zzso A number of mobile zzso including a zzso zzso a novel zzso family zzso sequence zzso and various zzso zzso were found zzso this zzso gene zzso These features of the zzso locus suggested that it might have undergone several DNA insertions from different sources by horizontal gene zzso zzso analyses of the zzso locus revealed that zzso zzso were zzso as a single zzso zzso zzso were constructed to investigate the function of the sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Competition zzso performed with the zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso element plays an important role in the full zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso This study provides the first experimental evidence that a zzso family zzso is directly associated with zzso zzso zzso
