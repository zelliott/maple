Until recently, zzso virus was considered to be the only human pathogen of the zzso zzso However, other zzso virus zzso such as zzso have now been isolated and are thought to cause infections clinically and zzso indistinguishable from those caused by zzso zzso Whereas zzso virus related zzso have a low genetic diversity of only zzso zzso disparity of up to zzso was found for the new zzso suggesting that zzso virus zzso may not be zzso using zzso virus specific zzso zzso To overcome this problem, we designed consensus zzso and zzso to enable the simultaneous detection of both zzso and zzso virus and subsequent discrimination of the two lineages by melting temperature zzso zzso A total of 196 clinical zzso from 185 patients with a history of or an zzso resembling zzso virus infection, were analyzed using the consensus zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in 37 of these samples and was found to be zzso virus specific in each case, confirming previous results using zzso virus specific zzso Although no zzso virus DNA was detected in any of the clinical samples tested in this study, more extensive studies are zzso The routine use of zzso consensus zzso in the diagnosis of zzso virus infection should provide valuable information on the epidemiology and clinical role of zzso virus zzso its use in screening would increase the safety of blood zzso
