We have developed a very rapid method for the detection of the Philadelphia zzso based on the zzso chain zzso This zzso zzso generates zzso fusion zzso which were transcribed in zzso and subsequently amplified with two sets of zzso Through the use of an additional internal primer set the method reaches the sensitivity to detect a single zzso cell among zzso unaffected cells without any zzso zzso The whole zzso procedure starting from zzso isolation up to zzso gel zzso can be performed in about 5 zzso First results indicate that the frequency of the zzso zzso exceeds 40 per cent in certain zzso zzso of adult acute zzso
