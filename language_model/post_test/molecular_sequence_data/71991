In cucumber zzso zzso high zzso zzso activity has been detected in the soluble fraction prepared from zzso of zzso seeds, and the involvement of this zzso in zzso turnover has been suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso In this study we have investigated the expression of the gene zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso expression is highly coordinated with that of a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso during the zzso stage of zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso transcripts accumulated in tissue during in zzso zzso no zzso of zzso zzso could be observed, suggesting that zzso plays a specialized role in fat zzso zzso is also known to be a major zzso body zzso The partial zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso body zzso entirely coincided with that deduced from the zzso zzso zzso The data strongly suggest that zzso and zzso body zzso are derived from a single gene and that zzso can exist both in the zzso and on the zzso zzso We constructed an in zzso zzso system to address the mechanism of this dual zzso and to investigate the action of zzso on lipids in the zzso zzso zzso cannot act on the lipids in intact zzso bodies, although degradation of zzso body zzso either during zzso growth or by treatment with zzso allows zzso bodies to become susceptible to zzso We discuss the role of zzso in fat zzso and its mechanism of zzso
