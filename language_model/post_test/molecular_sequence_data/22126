zzso zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein anchored in the zzso zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso fatty acids that are required for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four mouse zzso of zzso zzso and two human zzso have been zzso In the current study, we characterize the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso acid mouse zzso protein predicts that the protein contains four zzso zzso zzso and three zzso connecting the zzso zzso To define the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso tags were zzso expressed in zzso cells and analyzed by indirect zzso and zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that the N and C zzso of zzso are oriented toward the zzso with four zzso zzso separated by two very short zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and one large zzso loop in the zzso In addition, based on the previous observation that zzso is a zzso zzso we sought to investigate whether the zzso zzso were essential for zzso activity through zzso studies, and our data suggest that the zzso in zzso are not zzso zzso
