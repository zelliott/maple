The minimum requirement of an zzso for the human zzso zzso zzso gene was analyzed by zzso and zzso interaction zzso A series of deletion and zzso zzso were expressed zzso in a rat zzso zzso cell, zzso The results revealed that the zzso region between zzso and zzso base pairs zzso from the zzso start site is essential for efficient zzso of the human zzso zzso Two zzso zzso sequences were located within this region, and they were shown to bind zzso zzso zzso factor by zzso and gel zzso zzso This zzso however, has an zzso effect and is located approximately 1000 zzso from the zzso start site, unusual for the conventional zzso box zzso Furthermore, the sequence between these zzso zzso sequences is shown to bind another novel zzso factor by gel zzso zzso and to be necessary for efficient zzso zzso On the other hand, gel zzso zzso using a nuclear extract from zzso zzso cells suggested that zzso zzso factors could also participate in the enhancing activity of this zzso Taken together, the results demonstrate that two zzso zzso sequences and another zzso zzso sequence located between zzso and zzso zzso act zzso and are essential for efficient zzso of this low expressed human zzso zzso
