zzso of zzso for zzso zzso cell differentiation zzso factor zzso 2) in zzso zzso cultures of human zzso zzso zzso zzso are enhanced by zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso alpha and beta cause a particularly strong increase in the zzso of zzso 2 zzso in zzso We have evaluated whether the zzso 2 gene is regulated at the zzso level by using nuclear zzso zzso zzso We observed that the zzso 2 gene is transcribed at a low level in zzso zzso cells and that this zzso activity is increased zzso to zzso in zzso cells, zzso to zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 enhance zzso across the zzso 2 gene zzso to zzso The enhancing effect of zzso alpha on zzso 2 gene transcription, but not that of zzso zzso or zzso 1, is inhibited by zzso suggesting that zzso protein is involved in the increase in zzso 2 zzso in response to zzso alpha but not in the response to the other zzso Furthermore, the enhancement of zzso 2 zzso is sustained for up to 14 h after zzso alpha induction but is transient and declines to base line levels within 6 h after zzso zzso These observations suggest that there are important differences in the mechanisms by which zzso alpha and zzso increase zzso 2 gene zzso in zzso
