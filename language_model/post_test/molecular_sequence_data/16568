A gene that zzso resistance to the systemic zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso strain of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso resistance gene was mapped to a zzso of approximately zzso zzso and a zzso zzso library was zzso Two zzso clones that were able to transform a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso to resistance were isolated from the zzso Analysis of a zzso containing the resistance gene revealed the presence of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso gene of a zzso strain and that of a zzso strain revealed a single point zzso which results in the replacement of zzso by zzso at position zzso zzso of zzso c zzso activity in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso resistance of the fungus is caused by a decrease in the affinity of the zzso complex for zzso This zzso zzso also zzso zzso against another systemic zzso zzso an zzso that is structurally related to zzso In other organisms zzso resistance zzso have been found in the genes zzso and zzso but this is the first demonstration that a zzso in zzso can also zzso zzso The zzso gene cloned in this work can be zzso as a dominant zzso marker in gene manipulation experiments in zzso zzso
