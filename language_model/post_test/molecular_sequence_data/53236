zzso a zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso protein to form a general zzso repression complex in zzso zzso As part of a genetic analysis of this complex, we targeted zzso to the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and applied selection for zzso expression of the hypoxic gene zzso All but one of the resulting zzso failed to express full-length zzso zzso indicating that they zzso zzso zzso or nonsense zzso The one zzso zzso zzso a protein with three zzso acid zzso and the combination was required for the zzso zzso One zzso a zzso substitution for a zzso at zzso 51, was used in a second round of zzso in which six further zzso zzso were zzso These were separated into their component zzso and again, all but one of the single zzso displayed the zzso zzso The single and multiple zzso were characterized in terms of their effects on the repression of the zzso zzso gene and the a zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso proteins were also tested for their ability to associate with zzso The zzso P zzso despite its lack of a zzso zzso had lost the ability to fully associate with zzso in zzso In general, those single zzso that fell within the first two zzso repeats impaired zzso activity, while the two that fell in zzso repeats five and eight retained this zzso zzso of zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso in only some of the multiple zzso The results are discussed in terms of the current models of zzso function and the structure of zzso zzso
