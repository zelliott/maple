zzso of zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is an important zzso adaptation to zzso zzso This process requires recognition of a zzso in the zzso zzso and its subsequent movement through the membrane by the zzso zzso zzso Here we identify a zzso membrane protein complex in the zzso zzso that links these two zzso The central component of the complex, zzso is a zzso of zzso a zzso protein whose zzso prevents the elimination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with different zzso as they move through the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein that specifically targets zzso class I heavy chains for export from the zzso as well as with zzso a novel membrane protein that recruits the zzso zzso and its zzso
