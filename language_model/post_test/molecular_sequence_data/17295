A protein with molecular weight of 21 zzso zzso as zzso has been isolated from potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolation procedure includes zzso with zzso gel zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso The protein effectively zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with the zzso at the zzso ratio of 1 : zzso The inhibitor has no effect on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the protein consists of 19 zzso acid zzso and is highly zzso to sequences of the known zzso from group C of the zzso of potato zzso zzso zzso zzso By cloning zzso products from the zzso DNA of zzso a gene zzso as zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso sequence zzso from 15 to zzso of the protein zzso by the zzso gene is identical to the zzso sequence zzso from 1 to zzso of the isolated protein zzso Thus, the inhibitor zzso is very likely zzso by this zzso
