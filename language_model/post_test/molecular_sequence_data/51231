A zzso clone zzso the complete precursor of the delta zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a tobacco zzso zzso leaf zzso library in zzso zzso The 880 zzso insert encodes a zzso of 248 zzso acid zzso of which 61 zzso constitute an zzso zzso and zzso zzso make up the mature delta zzso zzso and translation of the zzso in zzso produced a protein of 29 zzso which was imported by isolated pea zzso and processed to the mature 20 zzso zzso The delta zzso precursor was processed to the mature size by a processing zzso present in pea zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to Southern blots of tobacco zzso DNA suggests the presence of two genes in the zzso zzso
