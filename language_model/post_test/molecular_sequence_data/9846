zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disease in which a pathological zzso response is mounted against the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our laboratory previously identified a T cell zzso zzso derived from the human zzso zzso alpha zzso which triggered zzso to zzso from about zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso was also found to be an zzso T cell zzso in zzso mice and a cryptic zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice with cells from a zzso zzso T cell line caused zzso zzso manifestations in those zzso In these studies we analyzed zzso alpha and beta chain sequences used by T cell lines and clones from both zzso and zzso mouse strains in response to zzso T cell lines generated from either strain expressed single zzso V beta gene segments zzso beta 17 in zzso mice and V beta 8 in zzso zzso By deleting V beta zzso T cells in zzso zzso mice we established a T cell line that expressed the V beta 6 gene product, suggesting that zzso mice are not limited to using a single V beta gene segment in response to zzso In addition, we found that zzso and/or zzso peptides of zzso presented under the same culture conditions to different clones bearing the same zzso alpha beta chain, could elicit very different zzso responses from the zzso Thus, even within a constrained system, factors other than zzso sequence contribute to the differential stimulation of T cell zzso
