The aim of this study was to establish a zzso physical map along the zzso zzso by construction of zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso class II zzso located on zzso was zzso Four major zzso zzso and 10 short zzso span a region equivalent to 800 zzso measured by zzso zzso The zzso zzso were initiated by zzso screening with zzso derived from human zzso zzso extended by zzso walking, and controlled and oriented by zzso mapping with the two available panels, zzso and zzso The location of 43 genes was revealed by zzso zzso either from zzso ends or zzso products from zzso zzso The 220 zzso end sequences zzso were also used to analyze the different marks of zzso Comparative mapping analysis between pigs and humans demonstrated that the gene organization on zzso and on zzso and zzso segments was zzso during evolution, with the exception of long fragments of zzso which shuffled and spliced the zzso extended class II zzso Additional zzso variations zzso gene zzso were observed, even within zzso zzso revealing the evolutionary complexity of this zzso In addition, 18 new zzso zzso have been selected in order to cover the entire zzso zzso
