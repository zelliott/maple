The development of zzso zzso zzso no organic acids is highly desirable for ethanol production coupled with membrane separation zzso because the zzso zzso zzso acid, significantly zzso the membrane zzso of zzso Of the zzso and zzso zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso showed the highest ethanol productivity zzso g zzso zzso from 150 g zzso zzso of zzso comparable to the strains of zzso zzso and produced much less of the acid zzso g zzso zzso than the zzso strains zzso g zzso zzso under zzso zzso Interestingly, under zzso conditions, strain zzso showed no production of the zzso zzso zzso exhibited a good zzso of the acid, while zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso in strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso higher than that in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso More significantly, zzso was abundantly transcribed in strain zzso different from that in strain zzso zzso regardless of the culture zzso From these results, zzso zzso zzso efficiently takes up zzso acid and zzso it in the zzso cycle, producing an extremely low level of byproducts in the culture zzso zzso zzso zzso is not only a promising alternative to zzso zzso but also a suitable model for zzso engineering of zzso zzso
