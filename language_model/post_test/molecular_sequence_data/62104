The zzso zzso of zzso named on the basis of a zzso zzso fold zzso is the Latin term for a small zzso was originally discovered using a zzso motif found within zzso and zzso proteins from higher zzso Previous analysis of zzso had identified some 18 different functional classes that range from zzso bacterial zzso such as zzso and zzso involved in the modification of cell wall zzso through to zzso zzso such as the zzso seed storage zzso and zzso zzso factors including one linked to the zzso response in zzso Recent advances in comparative zzso and the resolution of many more 3-D structures have now revealed that the largest subset of the zzso zzso is the zzso dependent zzso The zzso for this zzso of zzso are many and varied and in total amount to probably zzso different zzso zzso including several involved in plant growth and zzso Although the majority of zzso zzso contain iron as an active site metal, other members contain either copper, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as a zzso with each zzso allowing a different type of chemistry to occur within the zzso zzso zzso This review discusses the range of structures and functions found in this most diverse of zzso
