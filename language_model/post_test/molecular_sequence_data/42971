The zzso chain reaction zzso and direct sequencing of zzso genes were applied for zzso relationship analysis among zzso zzso Representatives of 10 species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to establish zzso between zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso data were subdivided into 3 zzso and zzso zzso to zzso secondary zzso and zzso including only zzso zzso were independently analyzed to construct zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum zzso approaches were applied to zzso zzso Trees were examined in terms of zzso zzso The DNA sequences support the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The hypothesis of zzso origin in zzso is zzso
