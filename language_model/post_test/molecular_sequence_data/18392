The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that is implicated in signal zzso processes that regulate zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrate that zzso zzso unlike most other zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso sequences upstream relative to the major open reading frame zzso zzso that serve as satisfactory targets for recognition by zzso zzso zzso There exist two distinct zzso zzso generated through alternative promoter zzso that differ only in their zzso untranslated region zzso Both transcripts are present in zzso and human zzso and the structures of the two distinct zzso untranslated regions have been closely zzso since the divergence of these zzso Moreover, both transcripts contain zzso zzso zzso inspection of primary sequence data for other zzso transcripts reveals that virtually all contain zzso zzso and many contain a large number of these potential zzso By zzso with the well-studied zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso I propose that control of zzso zzso permits tight regulation of expression of the zzso gene product and of other zzso protein zzso zzso
