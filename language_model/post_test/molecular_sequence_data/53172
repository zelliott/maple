A zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constructed in the zzso zzso zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso by screening for clones showing a reduced zzso to zzso The product of the cloned zzso named zzso contains a zzso zzso and exhibits an zzso pH of zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a zzso B zzso which shares the closest structural similarity zzso of identical zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso being a new member of the highly divergent zzso B3 zzso All the zzso that in zzso are known to be directly or indirectly involved in coordination of the zinc zzso were found to be zzso also in zzso suggesting that the geometry of zinc coordination in the active site of the latter zzso is identical to that of zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso appeared to be zzso in gel zzso zzso experiments and exhibited a distinctive zzso specificity with a marked preference for zzso and zzso The properties of zzso overall resembled those of a zzso previously zzso from the same strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso and are as yet unique among class B zzso reinforcing the notion that considerable functional zzso can be encountered among members of this zzso A system for zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli, based on the zzso zzso promoter, was also zzso
