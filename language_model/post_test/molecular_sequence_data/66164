In zzso infection by the human malaria zzso zzso zzso export of proteins from the zzso zzso to the zzso is key to zzso This export is zzso by a zzso zzso signal present on a zzso of hundreds of zzso proteins engaged in zzso the zzso However, the route of zzso export is poorly zzso Here we show that minimal soluble and membrane protein reporters that contain the zzso motif and mimic export of zzso P zzso proteins are detected in the zzso of zzso structures zzso by the zzso zzso are efficiently targeted by the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso signal does not directly zzso across the zzso zzso membrane zzso surrounding the zzso to deliver protein to the zzso zzso as suggested by current models of zzso protein trafficking to the zzso Rather, it is a zzso signal that sorts protein into zzso which then are exported beyond the zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso which are unique to the virulent P zzso species, are zzso zzso zzso that concentrate zzso soluble and membrane zzso proteins in their zzso for delivery to the host zzso
