Through zzso zzso the authors have compared sites within the zzso zzso of two zzso one from the zzso zzso and one from the zzso zzso where zzso acid substitution zzso the function of gap junction zzso In zzso 11 sites resulted in no channel function, or an zzso zzso gating zzso referred to as zzso zzso whereas in zzso 7 such sites were zzso In both zzso the sites lie along specific faces of zzso zzso suggesting that these may be sites of zzso domain zzso In zzso one broad face of the zzso zzso domain and a narrower, polar face of zzso were identified, including one site that was shown to come into close zzso with zzso in the closed zzso In zzso the same face of zzso was identified, but sensitive sites in zzso differed from zzso Many fewer sites in zzso disrupted channel function in zzso and those that did were on a different zzso face to the sensitive sites in zzso A more in depth study of two sites in zzso and zzso of zzso showed that zzso length or branching are important for maintenance of normal channel behavior, consistent with this being a site of zzso domain zzso
