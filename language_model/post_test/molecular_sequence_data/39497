The zzso zzso zzso lives in organic tubes on the walls of active zzso zzso along the East Pacific zzso To examine the diversity of the zzso community associated with the zzso tubes, we constructed libraries by direct zzso amplification and cloning of zzso zzso zzso Almost half of the sequences of the zzso zzso gene libraries clustered with zzso zzso zzso In an effort to access zzso information from zzso zzso members we further constructed a zzso library from the same DNA zzso One of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso Its sequence analysis revealed an incomplete zzso zzso and 32 predicted zzso zzso of these zzso have been assigned putative functions, including zzso and translation, cellular processes and zzso transport systems and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene suggested that zzso formed a new lineage related to members of zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso analyses of predicted proteins revealed the existence of likely cases of horizontal gene transfer, both between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso This study is the first step in using zzso to reveal the physiology of an as yet zzso group of zzso from zzso zzso zzso
