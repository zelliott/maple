A panel of zzso carrier proteins was developed and screened for functional activity with essential zzso involved in carrier zzso zzso zzso on either side of the recognition zzso II within three carrier proteins zzso from distinct zzso pathways were swapped in all combinations to generate 24 zzso zzso This panel of zzso carrier proteins was tested using two previously established and one novel carrier protein zzso The results suggest a significant contribution from multiple structural units within carrier protein structure, rather than universal recognition zzso is necessary for proper recognition and activity with partner zzso
