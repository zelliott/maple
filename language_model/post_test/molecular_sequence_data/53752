We screened a zzso library of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso to clone genes which zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso Among several clones zzso one clone codes for a zzso protein similar to the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso contains a putative signal zzso sequence at the zzso a zzso zzso domain, and two zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso reacted with zzso from patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that this gene and its zzso protein would be valuable for the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
