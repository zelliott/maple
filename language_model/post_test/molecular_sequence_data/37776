zzso growth factor zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso are new zzso zzso zzso zzso that were recently zzso and cloned from the human stomach cancer cell line zzso as specific zzso against zzso zzso Both proteins contain two zzso inhibitor zzso and are expressed abundantly throughout the gastrointestinal zzso in addition to the zzso zzso and zzso In this study, to assess the possible roles of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso and zzso during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso but not zzso was detected more strongly in zzso zzso than in normal zzso although both proteins were detected throughout the human gastrointestinal zzso During the course of zzso zzso experimental colitis in an in zzso mouse model, zzso but not zzso was zzso in the recovery phase, suggesting that zzso but not zzso is associated with the zzso of damaged zzso zzso zzso of zzso may serve to zzso the zzso response after initial zzso of zzso zzso by zzso factor after an zzso
