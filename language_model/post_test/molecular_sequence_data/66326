In the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso III zzso is zzso expressed with other zzso during growth on zzso its zzso and zzso To zzso zzso induction zzso we cloned and zzso the upstream region of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso a putative binding site for zzso and zzso regulator zzso were found on the template strand of the zzso upstream zzso zzso analysis of the zzso upstream region using the zzso zzso reporter system revealed that removal of regions containing the zzso motifs and the region between zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso motif severely affected zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the two zzso motifs and the zzso motif of this region led to a significant decrease in zzso zzso These data indicate that both zzso and zzso are key motifs for zzso zzso and that zzso induction may also be controlled by zzso This hypothesis was supported by in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso in which zzso expressed zzso specifically bound not only zzso but also zzso zzso
