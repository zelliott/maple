Oil zzso tailings ponds receive and store the solid and liquid waste from zzso extraction and are managed to promote zzso zzso and water zzso The ponds are highly zzso due to increasing zzso content as a function of depth but can be impacted by tailings addition and removal and by zzso due to microbial gas zzso We characterized the microbial communities in relation to microbial activities as a function of depth in an active tailings pond routinely treated with gypsum zzso to accelerate zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the zzso surface layer, where the highest level of zzso (6 zzso but no zzso was zzso had a very different community profile than the rest of the zzso zzso zzso layers were dominated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a variety of other zzso that have been implicated in hydrocarbon zzso or iron and sulfur zzso The zzso were most abundant from 10 to 14 zzso zzso the zone where the zzso reduction rate was zzso Similarly, the most abundant zzso and zzso identified as a function of depth closely mirrored the fluctuating zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in laboratory zzso by nearly 50% when zzso was supplied at zzso zzso suggesting that in zzso zzso reduction can substantially minimize methane zzso Based on our data, we zzso that the zzso of zzso due to zzso activity in the gypsum treated pond is also limited due to its high zzso and zzso in surface zzso
