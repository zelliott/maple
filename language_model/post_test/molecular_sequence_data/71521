zzso DNA clones zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of guinea-pig cardiac zzso zzso channels were isolated using the zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids for the zzso and zzso zzso acids for the zzso zzso The proteins showed zzso and zzso respectively, identity to the respective zzso of the rabbit zzso The message size of the guinea pig zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in the heart, while the zzso zzso is expressed in the heart, zzso whole brain, and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and the channel currents were studied using the zzso patch clamp technique in medium containing 30 zzso zzso In cells expressing zzso alone, the zzso current was activated at zzso zzso and more positive zzso and peaked at about 10 zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso did not affect the zzso of the zzso but increased the peak current and accelerated current zzso In cells zzso with guinea pig zzso and rabbit zzso a zzso current comparable to those in native zzso was zzso The zzso current can be blocked completely by zzso and is enhanced zzso by Bay K zzso On the other hand, neither zzso nor zzso acid affects the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not easily reproduced in zzso cells, unlike that seen in native cardiac zzso
