zzso an zzso zzso is important in zzso Although marine zzso are potential sources of zzso for industrial applications, they have been zzso zzso The fungus zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso wood and identified as zzso zzso based on the zzso region of zzso and the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso several synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso content from zzso zzso pulp by zzso within 24 h at 30 degrees zzso zzso was the major zzso zzso zzso 24,000 U zzso produced when grown in zzso medium with zzso zzso Three zzso zzso I, zzso II, and zzso III, of differing molecular masses were zzso Each of these, further resolved into four zzso by zzso exchange zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the major zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso to zzso from zzso It contained an zzso zzso content of zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso zzso were 3 and 70 degrees C, respectively, the zzso at 70 degrees C being 90 zzso The zzso was most stable at pH 9 and retained zzso of its activity up to 180 zzso at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees zzso The zzso was not inhibited by zzso Fe, zzso Li, zzso and zzso at 1 zzso This is the first report on the characterization of zzso zzso zzso from a zzso fungus with a potential for industrial zzso
