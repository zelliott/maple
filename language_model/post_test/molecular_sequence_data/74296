Two closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso grabbing zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso grabbing zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso or zzso directly recognize a wide range of zzso of major impact on public zzso Both genes have long been considered to share similar overall structure and zzso zzso This review presents more recent zzso and structural studies, which show that they have distinct zzso properties and different zzso zzso Of importance in both these genes is the presence of an zzso domain consisting of an extended neck region zzso by tandem repeats that support the zzso domain, which plays a crucial role in influencing the zzso properties of these zzso The notable difference between these two genes is in this zzso zzso zzso the zzso region remains relatively constant size for zzso there is considerable zzso for zzso zzso of the neck region of zzso has been shown to be important for zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso of zzso in which neck lengths differ could thus affect zzso zzso zzso studies on the effect of this zzso region on zzso as well as genetic association studies for various infectious diseases and among different zzso are zzso Worldwide demographic data of the zzso region showing distinct differences in the zzso zzso and zzso distribution among different ethnic groups are zzso These findings support the neck region as an excellent candidate acting as a functional target for selective pressures exerted by zzso
