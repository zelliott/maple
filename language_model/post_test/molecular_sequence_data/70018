zzso expression and zzso zzso was studied in a group of tissue culture cell lines from mice, zzso rats and zzso Cell surface zzso protein was detected in seven of ten cell lines from a variety of zzso and showed both cell surface and zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells could be persistently infected with zzso in zzso but zzso mouse zzso cells were never successfully zzso Foreign zzso molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso acid 102, and zzso mouse zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in mouse zzso zzso However, none of these cell lines could be successfully infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of these foreign zzso molecules did not lead to spontaneous generation of zzso zzso or a zzso zzso agent in zzso
