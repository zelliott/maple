Previous studies have demonstrated that efficient zzso of the primary transcript of the zzso zzso gene requires the zzso zzso which is produced only in zzso zzso A genetic selection was devised to recover zzso zzso that bypass the requirement for zzso in zzso zzso This selection identified a zzso in zzso the gene for zzso zzso The zzso zzso affects the first zzso in zzso zzso allowing this zzso to base pair with the eighth zzso in the zzso zzso This base in zzso lies outside the zzso zzso that defines the zzso zzso site in zzso The zzso zzso zzso site zzso differs from the consensus in zzso zzso at the third zzso When this zzso is zzso to restore the consensus, base pairing with zzso zzso is increased and the requirement for zzso is zzso
