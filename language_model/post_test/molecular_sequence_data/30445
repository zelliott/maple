The zzso of the zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain genes is coordinate and B zzso zzso This expression of the zzso genes is under the control of regulatory zzso the promoters located zzso of each variable zzso gene and the enhancers located between the joining and constant genes in the zzso and zzso locus and downstream on the C zzso zzso These sequences represent sites for the binding of zzso zzso A zzso zzso ubiquitous proteins zzso as well as two specific B cell proteins zzso zzso bind to the zzso site of the V promoter and zzso zzso The zzso protein binds to the zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso but also to zzso sites found in the promoter regions of other zzso This paper reviews the recent data on these factors and other zzso factors which bind to the promoters and enhancers of the zzso genes and control their zzso
