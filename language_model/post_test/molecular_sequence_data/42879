The association between multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso of the zzso class II genes indicates that at least one zzso zzso gene is linked to the zzso class II zzso However, the actual locus responsible has not been precisely zzso The recent cloning of new genes involved in zzso processing that map within the zzso class II region led us to zzso the restriction zzso length zzso zzso technique and zzso zzso zzso these genes might play a role in zzso zzso to zzso We studied large zzso zzso zzso 2 and 7 and zzso associated with zzso processing zzso 1 and 2 gene zzso in 60 zzso zzso patients and 60 zzso healthy subjects and found no specific or preferential zzso patterns or coding sequence zzso in the patient zzso Our data do not support a role for these genes in zzso zzso
