Ran is a small signaling zzso that is involved in zzso zzso Two additional functions of animal Ran in the formation of zzso zzso and the zzso of the nuclear envelope in zzso cells have been recently zzso In contrast to Ras or zzso Ran is not associated with zzso Instead, the spatial zzso of its accessory zzso the Ran zzso protein zzso and the zzso exchange factor zzso appears to define the local concentration of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso is bound to the nuclear pore by a mechanism involving the attachment of small zzso modifier protein zzso to its C zzso and the subsequent binding of the zzso domain to the zzso zzso Here we show that plant zzso zzso a different mechanism for nuclear envelope association, involving a novel targeting domain that appears to be unique to zzso The zzso WPP domain is highly zzso among plant zzso and the small, zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso but not present in zzso or animal zzso zzso laser scanning zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso fusion proteins showed that it is necessary for zzso targeting and sufficient to target the zzso protein zzso to the plant nuclear zzso The highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the WPP motif are necessary for its zzso The zzso WPP domain is the first zzso targeting domain identified in zzso Its fundamental difference to its zzso counterpart implies that different mechanisms have evolved in plants and animals to anchor zzso at the nuclear zzso
