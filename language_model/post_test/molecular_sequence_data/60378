A zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by screening a zzso library prepared from leaves of zzso zzso followed by rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso an open reading frame encodes a protein of 522 zzso acids zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The derived zzso sequence does not contain any discernible transit zzso zzso site zzso similarly to two other recently zzso full-length zzso zzso for zzso and shows zzso zzso identity to zzso proteins from other zzso The corresponding gene was found to be expressed in all zzso examined zzso and stem leaves, zzso flowers and zzso The ubiquitous expression of the gene is consistent with its critical role in starch synthesis in zzso
