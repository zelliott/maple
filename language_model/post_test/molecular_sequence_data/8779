We have zzso zzso from rabbit skeletal muscle a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso factor zzso that stimulates both zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the rate zzso at which the zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso This was manifest by the finding that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso were sufficient to produce fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and activated zzso This contrasted with the zzso zzso excess ratio of zzso to zzso required to produce fully zzso and activated zzso in the absence of zzso zzso acid analysis revealed that in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was ordered, with zzso zzso preceding zzso zzso However, the rate at which zzso was zzso relative to zzso was greatly zzso The finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased its ability to be zzso by zzso suggests a mechanism of action in which zzso interacts with zzso to alter its zzso
