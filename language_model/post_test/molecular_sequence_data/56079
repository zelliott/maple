It became clear that zzso can be stabilized in a zzso translation system of zzso coli by zzso with a small DNA zzso at its 3' zzso The stability increased when a small DNA zzso containing a stable hairpin structure with a zzso loop was zzso The enhancement of stabilization was brought about because the hairpin structure is resistant towards the zzso contained in the translation zzso The hairpin structure is effective by stabilizing the added DNA zzso itself towards the zzso
