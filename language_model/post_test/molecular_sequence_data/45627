Fish have the ability to compensate for zzso in growth as a result of zzso When food levels are zzso growth in these fish can increase over and above normal zzso This phenomenon, known as zzso zzso has been studied with respect to enhancing food conversion zzso However, the mechanisms by which food intake activates an increase in zzso growth, and especially in muscle growth, are not well zzso In this study, we report first on the isolation of two complete zzso sequences zzso sea bass zzso zzso myostatin and zzso growth factor 6 zzso which have been shown to be major genetic zzso of skeletal muscle zzso The open reading frames of myostatin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso sequence identity with other zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also report on the expression profile of myostatin and zzso in sea bass skeletal muscle in response to different feeding regimens, as zzso by real-time zzso zzso status significantly influenced the myostatin expression levels in muscle, inducing an zzso during zzso and a zzso during the recovery from zzso whereas the muscular zzso zzso levels were not significantly affected by the feeding status of the zzso These findings suggest that myostatin has an zzso role in muscle growth in response to different feeding regimens, whereas zzso is not involved in the muscle zzso growth induced by zzso
