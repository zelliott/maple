The backbone dynamics of the zzso zzso domain from the regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been investigated in the absence of, and in complex with, a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso relaxation rates and zzso zzso zzso values were measured by means of zzso correlated two-dimensional methods and were analyzed within the framework of the zzso zzso Several zzso in the BC loop and in the zzso secondary structural elements display fast local dynamics in the absence of zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso displays zzso exchange phenomena as indicated by an above-average zzso relaxation zzso Upon binding of the zzso zzso the zzso values increase to values observed for regular secondary structure and the exchange contribution to the zzso relaxation rate for zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate a loss of backbone flexibility upon zzso zzso zzso exchange contributions for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are known to make important interactions with the zzso are attenuated upon zzso zzso Several zzso in the zzso region and the zzso loop, which contribute to the zzso binding surface of the zzso exhibit exchange terms which are reduced or zzso when the zzso is zzso Together, these observations suggest that zzso binding is accompanied by a loss of zzso flexibility on the zzso binding face of the zzso However, comparison with other zzso zzso reveals an apparent lack of consensus in the changes in dynamics induced by zzso zzso Exchange rates for individual zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso from the dependence of the exchange contributions on the zzso delay in an zzso series and show that zzso zzso zzso is affected by multiple zzso exchange processes with exchange rate zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on the protein surface show a zzso of zzso with similar zzso zzso and suggests that clustered zzso are affected by a common zzso exchange zzso
