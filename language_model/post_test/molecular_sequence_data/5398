Human zzso virus zzso zzso protein zzso virulent progression of acquired zzso syndrome zzso by its interaction with specific cellular proteins involved in signal zzso and host cell zzso zzso has been shown to bind specifically to a subset of the zzso family of zzso The structures of free zzso and zzso bound to zzso zzso region 3 zzso domain are important for the zzso of how the affinity and specificity for the zzso zzso family zzso zzso are zzso and also for the development of potential drugs and vaccines against zzso 

We have determined the crystal structures of the zzso core of zzso zzso protein alone and in complex with the zzso zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso of the bound and zzso zzso structures revealed that a zzso motif zzso which is implicated in zzso zzso is partially zzso in the absence of the binding zzso this motif only fully adopts a left-handed zzso type II zzso zzso upon complex formation with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the structures show how an zzso zzso zzso of zzso interacts with zzso 100 of the so-called zzso loop within the zzso zzso domain, and triggers a zzso zzso which allows the loop to adapt to complement the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain is specifically zzso in the same zzso pocket of zzso as the zzso zzso of a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds to zzso with higher affinity than the wild zzso 

The three-dimensional structures support evidence that the zzso complex forms in zzso and may have a crucial role in the T cell zzso action of zzso by altering T cell zzso zzso The structures of bound and zzso zzso reveal that the zzso of zzso binding may be achieved by a zzso induced flexibility in the zzso zzso The structures suggest possible targets for the design of zzso which specifically block zzso zzso
