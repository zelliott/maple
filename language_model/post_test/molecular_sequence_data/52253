zzso 2A of human zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and partially zzso the preparation was used to study various zzso zzso Using a zzso acid zzso representing the native zzso region of zzso zzso an apparent zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A minimum of 9 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso to zzso was necessary for zzso to zzso zzso of zzso peptides was highly tolerant toward changes at zzso zzso and zzso but an absolute requirement for zzso zzso and a high preference for zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso 2A only zzso zzso zzso derived from other zzso zzso and zzso that possessed zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the sequence zzso may form the basis of the cellular zzso site processed by zzso zzso during viral zzso Studies with various zzso support the hypothesis that zzso 2A belongs to a new class of zzso zzso
