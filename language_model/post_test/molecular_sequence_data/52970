The expression cloning of a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved using an zzso zzso and mouse L cells as a recipient cell line for the zzso The isolated zzso clone designated zzso predicted a type II membrane protein with 19 zzso acids of zzso domain, 26 zzso acids of zzso region, and a zzso domain with 308 zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso clone into L cells resulted in the zzso of zzso and the extracts of the zzso cells showed zzso zzso activity only on zzso and zzso In Northern zzso a zzso zzso was strongly expressed in heart, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso small zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso into L cells resulted in the constitution of sensitivity to the zzso with zzso toxins zzso Since zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso series zzso the isolation of this zzso will make possible further investigations into the function of its important series of zzso
