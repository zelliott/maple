The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one member of a family of unique zzso proteins that catalyze the synthesis and degradation of the regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso and provides a switching mechanism between these two opposing pathways of zzso zzso zzso The activities of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso regulated by a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at a single zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso the zzso and activates the zzso in part through an zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso mimics the effects of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso tail regions also have an interaction with their respective active sites on the same zzso to produce an zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso In support of this hypothesis, deletion of either the zzso or zzso tail region, or both regions, leads to a disruption of these interactions with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso is observed with the zzso forms, in which there is also a diminution of zzso zzso to decrease the zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso these zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso control zzso
