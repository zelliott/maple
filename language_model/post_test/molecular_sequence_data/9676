zzso import into zzso is zzso by zzso located in the outer and inner zzso (Tom and zzso and a zzso zzso driving zzso By blue native zzso we identify an approximately zzso complex with assembled zzso and zzso as the core of the inner membrane import site for zzso zzso zzso spanning the two zzso link virtually all Tim core complexes with one in four Tom complexes in a stable zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso are present in zzso amounts in the zzso zzso zzso in transit stabilize the Tim core complex, preventing an exchange of zzso Our studies define a central role for the Tim core complexes in zzso protein zzso they are not passive diffusion channels, but can zzso interact with zzso and determine the number of zzso contact zzso We propose the hypothesis that zzso functions in protein import not only by direct interaction with zzso but also by exerting a regulatory effect on the Tim zzso
