zzso disease is a T cell zzso zzso caused by the zzso of zzso in genetically predisposed individuals carrying zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing multiple zzso and zzso zzso are largely resistant to degradation by gastric and zzso zzso zzso zzso however exhibit zzso zzso activity, discovered towards zzso and zzso zzso zzso The aim was to explore if zzso can serve as zzso for oral microbial zzso 

zzso activity in suspended dental plaque was studied towards a) zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso b) a mixture of natural zzso and c) synthetic highly zzso zzso peptides zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso was conducted to obtain the approximate molecular weights and pH activity profiles of the zzso oral zzso and liquid zzso focusing was performed to establish overall zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being most rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso were extensively zzso in the presence of oral zzso zzso zzso revealed that prominent zzso exhibit molecular weights zzso zzso and are active over a broad pH range from 3 to zzso zzso zzso focusing indicated that most zzso zzso are zzso in nature with zzso points between zzso and zzso 

This is the first reported evidence for zzso zzso associated with the upper zzso zzso Such zzso may play a zzso unappreciated role in the zzso of dietary zzso and thus protection from zzso disease in subjects at zzso
