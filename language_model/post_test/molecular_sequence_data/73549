A secondary structure has been predicted for the heat shock protein zzso family from an aligned set of zzso protein sequences by using a transparent method in both manual and automated zzso that extracts zzso information from patterns of variation and conservation within the zzso No statistically significant sequence similarity relates this family to any protein with known crystal zzso However, the secondary structure zzso together with the assignment of active site positions and possible zzso properties, suggest that the fold is similar to that seen in zzso domain of DNA zzso B (the zzso zzso
