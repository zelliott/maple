The experiments described were designed to test the hypothesis that the zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso A affect the zzso of mouse zzso zzso by competing for binding to satellite DNA with one or more zzso zzso The studies focused on the zzso zzso protein zzso since its binding properties predict it would be a target for zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show that zzso forms specific complexes with satellite DNA and that the formation of these complexes is zzso for by both zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA complexes showed essentially the same protection pattern for both drugs and a similar, but not zzso zzso zzso If these in zzso results reflect the in zzso situation then the incomplete zzso of zzso zzso observed when mouse cells are grown in the presence of either chemical zzso could be a consequence of competition for binding of zzso (and possibly other zzso to satellite zzso
