The zzso protein zzso plays an essential role in viral zzso zzso although its precise zzso activities or structural requirements have not been zzso The protein has several distinctive properties, including zzso activity and membrane and zzso zzso that are zzso among zzso of many zzso zzso zzso zzso alignments have placed these proteins in the zzso zzso family, a subset of the zzso zzso zzso A feature common to zzso proteins is the formation of zzso rings that are essential for their zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso in which zzso protein was fused to zzso formed soluble zzso and that zzso activity was restricted to zzso zzso from zzso zzso The active fraction was zzso by zzso electron zzso as zzso particles composed of 5-8 zzso This conclusion was confirmed by mass zzso obtained by scanning transmission electron zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso domain demonstrated that loss of the ability to bind or zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso of active zzso and inactive zzso proteins generated mixed zzso that exhibited little zzso activity, suggesting that incorporation of inactive zzso eliminates the function of the entire zzso Finally, deletion of the zzso 38 zzso acids blocked zzso of the fusion protein and eliminated zzso activity, despite retention of an zzso zzso zzso
