zzso zzso D zzso regulates cardiac zzso growth and zzso through zzso of proteins such as class zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso In response to zzso that activate zzso receptors zzso zzso is zzso by protein zzso C zzso on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso within an zzso loop of the zzso domain, resulting in stimulation of zzso zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso target site located adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso This site zzso in human zzso is zzso in each of the three zzso family members and is efficiently zzso by multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso we demonstrate that this site in zzso is rapidly zzso in primary cardiac zzso exposed to zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of this event to pharmacological zzso of zzso and data from in zzso zzso zzso suggest a zzso role for zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest a novel, zzso mechanism for controlling zzso function in cardiac zzso
