The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso one of the two envelope zzso of zzso is known to play a crucial role in the fusion between this virus and the host cell zzso The influence of lipids on this role was investigated using different zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso affinity for the zzso zzso was measured by following the zzso variation in the lateral surface pressure and we demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso containing the saturated zzso zzso zzso as well as to the zzso zzso zzso and to mixed zzso containing zzso and cholesterol zzso The secondary structure of zzso in the presence of these zzso zzso was determined by polarization zzso infrared reflection zzso zzso zzso The data showed that zzso was an oriented zzso in the presence of zzso However this zzso method was unable to detect the zzso structure in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso modifications of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by Brewster angle zzso zzso The zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso disturbed the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso delayed the condensed state of zzso and zzso indicating that, although zzso was not detected by zzso it was present in these zzso zzso
