The X-ray structure of a zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso inhibitor complex zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso has been zzso This structure shows several interactions between the zzso chain and the zzso zzso of the inhibitor at zzso and the zzso The interactions of the remaining part of the polar head group are less zzso Because zzso is in close proximity to the head group, we tested the importance of charge at position 53 on zzso activity and zzso zzso has been replaced by a zzso and a zzso acid in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of the zzso were tested with both zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso as zzso the zzso zzso and zzso display twofold and zzso respectively, increased zzso values, composed of increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso Tested on zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are more active than the native zzso whereas these zzso have an opposite effect on the activity on zzso zzso Thus, whereas the native zzso is zzso times as active on zzso as on the zzso zzso these ratios are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso No changes in activity were observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso confirmed the increased affinity for zzso zzso and the reduced affinity for zzso zzso The kinetic and binding data indicate the involvement of the charge of zzso 53 in zzso specificity and suggest a position of zzso 53 closer to the zzso or zzso than to the zzso
