The zzso from a highly virulent strain of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and a zzso from the traditional strain zzso bearing the zzso from zzso to zzso zzso both induce an acute lethal disease in zzso The zzso zzso and its surrounding sequence resemble the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso which is present in the zzso tail of zzso and zzso zzso receptors and mediates signaling during zzso zzso We show here that the zzso from zzso performs the same zzso First, not only does zzso increase the activity of the zzso factor zzso which is one of the downstream targets of zzso zzso but the zzso from the zzso by itself also activates zzso Second, the zzso from zzso is zzso on zzso zzso by zzso and associates with zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso zzso zzso on the zzso is required for the recruitment of zzso Finally, zzso is required for the zzso of zzso by zzso These results demonstrate that zzso contains a functional zzso and zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso
