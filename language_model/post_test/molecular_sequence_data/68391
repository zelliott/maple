We have converted a bacterial zzso precursor containing a 205 zzso zzso group I zzso into a zzso zzso that zzso zzso of an external zzso zzso The reaction involves zzso steps analogous to both the forward and reverse zzso zzso steps of group I zzso as such it depends entirely on 3' zzso site zzso The zzso zzso is a 20 zzso analogue of the zzso zzso zzso whose 3' end resembles the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso junction of the zzso is attacked by the 3' end of the zzso then the zzso zzso the original 3' terminal zzso so that the new 3' zzso is brought into the active site and used as the attacking zzso in the next zzso zzso occurs via a series of zzso zzso zzso of the structure zzso where zzso zzso 1 to zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso accumulates during the course of the reaction and can attack the zzso zzso to produce zzso products of structure zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in unchanged zzso In this manner, the zzso converts 20 zzso zzso into zzso up to at least 180 zzso by 10 zzso zzso These results have significant implications for the evolution of zzso zzso zzso
