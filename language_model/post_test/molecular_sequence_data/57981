The human zzso gene zzso is organized in two zzso zzso A contains a single zzso designated zzso zzso B contains four zzso named zzso II, III and zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso zzso factor zzso alpha interacts with zzso zzso and that zzso zzso and IV are binding sites for members of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso II and III seem to be respectively the targets for the zzso protein and for zzso a factor not yet completely zzso Analysis of zzso zzso regions establishes that each zzso is required for full zzso activity and that the proteins binding to zzso II, III and IV may interact within a zzso zzso This zzso region presents no activity in the zzso cells of zzso where zzso is also zzso We demonstrate that in zzso cells, the members of the zzso family are not zzso this fact may account for the zzso of the zzso in these zzso
