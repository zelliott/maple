We have previously identified a human zzso zzso zzso zzso finger zzso which encodes a putative zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 90, zzso Here, we report isolation of mouse zzso zzso and its structure containing three zzso zzso zzso finger and B1 and B2 zzso a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso and zzso by zzso protection zzso By in zzso zzso zzso the transcripts of zzso were also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain, and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was particularly demonstrated in these female zzso Moreover, the level of zzso zzso in zzso and brain, which are known as target zzso for estrogen, was zzso in zzso by 17 zzso Furthermore, both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were stained in the brain zzso of zzso zzso by whole mount in zzso zzso These findings raise the possibility that zzso is an zzso gene that mediates zzso action in various target zzso
