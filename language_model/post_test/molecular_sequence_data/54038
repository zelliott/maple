To investigate the events leading to initiation of DNA replication in zzso zzso the time when zzso origin recognition complexes zzso became functional was related to the time when zzso zzso and zzso proteins became zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso defined as those able to initiate DNA zzso were absent during zzso and early zzso phase, and zzso as cells progressed through zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso proteins were present in zzso at equivalent zzso throughout the cell cycle, but only zzso was zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso were easily zzso from zzso during zzso and early zzso phase, but became zzso bound during zzso phase, zzso with the appearance of a functional zzso complex at a zzso replication zzso Since zzso zzso proteins are closely related to their human and mouse zzso the unexpected behavior of zzso zzso provides a novel mechanism in zzso for delaying assembly of zzso complexes until zzso is complete and a nuclear structure has zzso
