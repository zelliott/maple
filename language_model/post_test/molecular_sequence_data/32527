The zzso genes that are part of the neuroendocrine growth axis play crucial roles in the regulation of growth and development of zzso The identification of genetic zzso in these genes will enable the scientist to evaluate the biological relevance of such zzso and to gain a better understanding of quantitative traits like zzso In the present study, seven pairs of zzso were designed to obtain unknown sequences of zzso zzso and other 25 pairs of zzso were designed to identify single zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso technology in four pig breeds zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly differing in growth and development zzso A total of 101 zzso were discovered in zzso base pairs zzso from six genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor II zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 2 zzso zzso growth factor binding protein 3 zzso and zzso zzso The observed average distances between the zzso in the zzso coding regions, zzso and zzso were 134, zzso 81 and 92 zzso zzso Four zzso were found in the coding regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two synonymous zzso were obtained in zzso and zzso genes respectively, and two zzso were found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Seven other zzso were also zzso zzso zzso markers were found among 101 zzso of the six zzso The zzso discovered in this study would provide suitable markers for association studies of candidate genes with growth related traits in zzso
