Four novel proteins zzso zzso have been isolated from the North American zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of these zzso were determined zzso using a combination of zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso C, E and F consist of 46 zzso acid zzso and zzso D of zzso All proteins had six zzso similar to the earlier described zzso A and B, which are zzso The zzso of each protein was evaluated in a human cell line panel that represented several zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the different cell lines in the panel, correlation with those of standard drugs was zzso The most potent zzso zzso C was further tested on primary cultures of human tumor cells from zzso The solid tumor samples from breast cancer cells were 18 times more sensitive to zzso C than the tested zzso tumor zzso
