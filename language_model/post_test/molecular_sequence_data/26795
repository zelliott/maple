The zzso tract of zzso insects is extremely zzso In the present work, molecular adaptation of zzso zzso to this environment was investigated in the flour zzso zzso zzso an important zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-3 zzso with an alkaline pH optimum were zzso from larvae and zzso zzso These zzso differ significantly in their sensitivity to zzso zzso of plant origin that are directed against zzso as zzso Such functional zzso renders the zzso system less vulnerable to suppression by plant defensive zzso Moreover, we found that expression of zzso is zzso in larvae feeding on a diet enriched with an zzso zzso The zzso are zzso into the zzso zzso by an zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined, and a zzso model of zzso was built in order to analyze the structural features responsible for adaptation to alkaline zzso First, the overall fold was found to be stabilized by zzso of zzso zzso Second, molecular simulations supported by activity zzso showed that zzso does not bind a zzso zzso to an zzso zzso in a zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso are in contact with the zzso zzso and this change might help to fine-tune the zzso zzso values to an alkaline pH zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are zzso adapted in terms of structure and expression dynamics for effective functioning in the zzso zzso
