The conventional method of zzso zzso was used to develop two zzso zzso zzso and zzso for detecting zzso zzso The zzso strain was derived from zzso zzso zzso strain transformed by a zzso zzso A zzso zzso was inserted between zzso zzso 312 and 313 of the zzso zzso The zzso strain was obtained by the same zzso but a zzso zzso in position 315 of the zzso gene was zzso The strains were tested with ten zzso zzso and the zzso were selected by zzso zzso Representative zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more potent in the zzso strain than the zzso strain, and the number of zzso colonies were dose zzso Under the same conditions, the zzso test was more sensitive than the Ames zzso Other types of compounds such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B1 zzso were not as zzso to these new zzso The method is quite promising for studying certain specific zzso zzso but more chemical zzso should be tested to validate its zzso and zzso in general zzso
