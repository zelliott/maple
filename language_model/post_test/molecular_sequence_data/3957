The zzso zzso c zzso of zzso zzso consists of four zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise the zzso zzso complex required for the reduction of zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso On the other hand, the functional role of zzso IV zzso of the zzso zzso was not obvious, although we previously suggested that it is involved in the signal zzso zzso controlling photosynthesis gene expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso Here we go on to demonstrate that zzso IV protects the core complex, in the presence of zzso from zzso degradation by a zzso zzso In the absence of zzso we suggest that the presence of zzso leads to the loss of zzso from the core complex, which zzso the zzso zzso into a zzso form, perhaps by altering its zzso Under zzso conditions the absence of zzso appears to affect the zzso zzso most zzso It was further demonstrated, using a series of zzso deletion derivatives of zzso that the minimum length of zzso required for stabilization of the core complex under zzso conditions is the zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso
