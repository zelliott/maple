zzso are the zzso zzso for several infectious pathogens that affect zzso However, the control of mosquitoes through zzso and zzso zzso has proved difficult in the zzso We hypothesized that, by virtue of their reported vertical inheritance among zzso group II zzso - a class of small coding zzso acids zzso - may form a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso are a zzso zzso Depending on the function of the protein zzso within the IV zzso the highly mobile class of group II zzso or zzso is zzso into two: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to be the ancestors of zzso zzso Our aim in this study was to find evidence for the highly zzso conservation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

In zzso targeted sequence alignments were conducted across a zzso zzso database zzso zzso 59 zzso 201 zzso and the zzso using three zzso zzso sequence tags zzso as zzso queries zzso and zzso of zzso zzso origin and zzso of zzso zzso zzso At a zzso of E zzso 10, A & D zzso 100, default zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso identity, no hits were found on any of the zzso bacterial zzso Eleven zzso and 15 zzso hits obtained on the zzso zzso database were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but none of zzso zzso Twenty and 221 low score zzso zzso zzso hits were found at zzso ends of genes and zzso in the human zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed these to be possible relatives of human zzso zzso We advance two models for the application of zzso zzso as precursors for developing molecular zzso for zzso and as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to enhance targeted zzso 

We offer evidence to support the zzso conservation of zzso zzso among lower zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may therefore constitute a unique zzso for zzso species that may be exploited in molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso may possibly permit synthesis of zzso zzso that could be used to achieve zzso zzso
