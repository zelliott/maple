A gene zzso a cyanide zzso was cloned from an aggressive isolate of zzso zzso the fungus which causes zzso disease of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso the breakdown of hydrogen cyanide to a less toxic compound, zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of cyanide zzso in zzso zzso is zzso and zzso identical to cyanide zzso from two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene is present as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso in both aggressive and zzso zzso although there is a restriction zzso length zzso between these two isolate groups for this zzso The cyanide zzso promoter contains four putative target sites for zzso zzso factors, proteins that regulate nitrogen metabolism and other zzso zzso of cyanide zzso in an aggressive zzso zzso isolate is induced strongly by zzso zzso zzso of the gene is zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso can zzso the reaction product, zzso as a sole source of zzso
