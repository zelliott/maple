zzso cell zzso have proposed roles in allergic inflammation and host defense against zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso are known to be zzso but the nature and extent of diversity at these zzso have not been fully zzso 

We sought to compare functional and zzso zzso zzso zzso and establish zzso in human zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were determined by means of direct sequencing in zzso individuals from zzso populations of European, zzso Chinese, and Japanese zzso zzso were predicted, validated in parent-child zzso and compared between zzso 

We identify a new zzso zzso zzso zzso carried by zzso and zzso of individuals of European and African ancestry but zzso of Asian zzso zzso models predict that zzso is zzso Our zzso zzso shows that zzso and zzso zzso in each population are zzso Strong linkage zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso yields 2 major and 5 minor zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and the newly discovered zzso are common, causing the number of inherited active genes to range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 4, with major differences between populations in the proportion of individuals inheriting 2 versus 4 active zzso African and Asian populations are especially enriched in genes zzso functional and zzso zzso zzso Strong linkage of zzso and zzso and pairing of zzso zzso with functional zzso in observed zzso protect human subjects from zzso zzso and indeed from inheritance of fewer than 2 active zzso
