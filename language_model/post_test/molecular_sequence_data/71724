The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso super family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular cloning were performed on total zzso from 12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels and zzso activities in zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso after partial zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso for mouse zzso contained a single large open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso and a predicted zzso of zzso The zzso acid sequence of mouse lens zzso was zzso zzso to rat lens zzso As in zzso mouse lens zzso showed a unique N zzso and deletion of the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was the dominant zzso in young mouse zzso zzso was zzso and the lens nucleus contained the highest specific activity of zzso and very little zzso zzso zzso in lens soluble proteins was activated by addition of calcium and caused limited zzso of zzso even in the presence of large amounts of zzso domain I from the natural zzso inhibitor zzso Loss of zzso protein accompanied aging of mouse zzso zzso may be responsible for a major portion of zzso zzso occurring during normal lens development and zzso or during cataract formation in young zzso
