The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso binds to the surface of zzso cells and is involved in zzso zzso cellular zzso To identify and locate the zzso zzso domain, we enriched the zzso protein band by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso A zzso gene zzso was obtained by zzso using zzso DNA as template and zzso derived from the zzso sequence of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene zzso encodes for 206 zzso acid zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso region of a mature zzso with zzso identity to the reported zzso zzso zzso This gene zzso was expressed in a bacterial system for zzso production and functional zzso zzso against the native zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso referred to as zzso confirming its relationship with the zzso zzso The zzso protein was bound to the surface of zzso cells and zzso with the native zzso for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso located on the zzso surface, and inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that this gene zzso encodes for the putative zzso domain zzso of zzso located at its zzso zzso
