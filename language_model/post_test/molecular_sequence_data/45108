A high prevalence of zzso protein zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso should be taken into account when treating zzso media in zzso 

To evaluate the prevalence of zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso protein 3 zzso among children with zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were collected from pediatric acute zzso media patients with or without zzso media with zzso at the clinics of the Department of zzso and Neck zzso zzso Medical University Hospital and 6 affiliated hospitals in zzso zzso between January 1999 and December zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by a zzso dilution method according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso gene zzso were evaluated by means of a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was also identified by means of zzso 

zzso zzso strains having the zzso gene were identified in 16 zzso zzso zzso strains were identified in 279 zzso zzso There were 242 zzso strains zzso with zzso in the variable zzso locus of zzso 35 zzso strains zzso with zzso in the highly zzso locus of zzso and 2 zzso strains zzso with zzso in zzso that produced zzso zzso strains producing zzso without zzso in zzso were identified in 14 zzso zzso zzso of zzso strains to zzso were zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the zzso strains was the lowest zzso zzso The proportion of zzso strains increased rapidly during zzso and then decreased in zzso In contrast, the proportion of zzso strains increased in zzso
