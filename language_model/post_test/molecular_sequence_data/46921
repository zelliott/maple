The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains some 200 copies of the zzso repeat zzso zzso Among several unique features of this zzso zzso is transcribed in both directions leading to the formation of partially overlapping plus strand and minus strand zzso The synthesis of minus strand zzso is controlled by the zzso a zzso DNA sequence located at the zzso of zzso A nuclear protein zzso binds to the zzso via interaction with two almost zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso drugs zzso and zzso which bind to A zzso zzso DNA sequences in the minor groove, zzso efficiently for the binding of zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was isolated and a zzso domain was mapped to a zzso zzso region of the zzso A zzso motif involved in the binding of A zzso zzso DNA by high mobility zzso proteins zzso zzso was identified in the deduced zzso protein zzso and exchange of a consensus zzso zzso for zzso within the zzso zzso box abolished the interaction of zzso with the zzso The current data support the theory that zzso binds to the zzso by detecting its long-range DNA zzso and interacting with A zzso T base pairs in the minor groove of zzso zzso zzso zzso
