zzso proteins play significant roles in numerous cellular zzso Here, we introduced a novel zzso zzso probe zzso as an zzso agent to simultaneously enrich and incorporate isotope label to zzso zzso By taking advantage of the quantitative capability of this zzso probe, we devised an affinity profiling strategy to zzso characterize zzso interactions at the entire zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso sites derived from zzso labeling was effectively minimized through the comparison of the labeling behaviors of zzso zzso with the use of low and high zzso of the zzso zzso A total of 258 previously known zzso proteins from zzso of zzso and zzso cells were validated with this affinity profiling zzso Additionally, we demonstrated that this novel quantitative zzso profiling strategy is particularly useful for unveiling previously zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso For example, our profiling results revealed zzso as a new zzso site in zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins without documented zzso GO were predicted to be zzso proteins on the basis of our quantitative affinity profiling zzso We also uncovered, for the first time, the zzso capability of human zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and validated the zzso capacity in zzso binding with an independent zzso The zzso approach described in the present paper should be generally zzso for the quantitative assessment of zzso proteins in zzso samples from cells and zzso
