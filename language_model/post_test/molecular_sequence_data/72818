Human zzso zzso zzso was used to screen a rat skeletal muscle zzso library which led to the isolation of a full-length zzso zzso the rat zzso The derived zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity with the human zzso with major differences being restricted to the zzso targeting zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso rat liver zzso zzso zzso corresponded to that derived from the zzso following 30 zzso acids of targeting zzso This confirms that zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays a crucial role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a single sized zzso zzso was shown by Northern zzso to be present in liver, heart, skeletal muscle and zzso
