The primary structure of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences of the tropical green zzso zzso zzso was zzso The complete zzso sequences were obtained using zzso zzso designed from known zzso consensus zzso acid sequences from the temperate species zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso deduced from the coding region consisted of 72 zzso acids with 21 zzso zzso and 9 zzso motifs corresponding to Type I zzso class of other zzso Two different zzso sequences coding for the same zzso were zzso Each putative gene contained a unique zzso and two unique zzso located at the same zzso zzso The promoters for both genes were different in length and both contained metal responsive elements and active zzso zzso The structures of the zzso clones were compared with those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
