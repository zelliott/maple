We previously identified zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso which function in the cholesterol zzso pathway, as zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso were established as zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso while zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Here we report a more detailed characterization of the rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso of various laboratory rat strains revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not specific to the zzso strain, but are widely prevalent in other laboratory rat zzso Meanwhile, zzso was not found in any rat strains zzso It was also found that functional zzso zzso are present in the zzso upstream regulatory zzso The zzso strain had a higher potential for expression of zzso transcripts than zzso and zzso under conditions where cholesterol synthesis is zzso zzso was less efficient than zzso and zzso in suppressing zzso zzso in circumstances when cholesterol synthesis should be zzso These findings not only imply that there is a genetic zzso for cholesterol zzso in laboratory rats, but also point to the possibility that rat strains with different zzso zzso exhibit different responses to measures intervening in cholesterol zzso
