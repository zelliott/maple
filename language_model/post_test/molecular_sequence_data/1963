zzso zzso from the zzso zzso are among the best species for understanding early zzso development and for studying basic cell biological zzso zzso and in particular the zzso zzso zzso is also ideal for functional zzso zzso the behavior of genes in this accessible model system will have a significant and beneficial impact on the understanding of similar genes in other zzso zzso Here we describe the analysis of zzso zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso from four early zzso zzso From these, we have deduced a set of unique expressed sequences zzso approximately 20,000 clusters and 16,000 zzso Furthermore, we developed a zzso method to identify clones that contain the complete coding sequence and describe the creation for the first time of a set of approximately zzso such zzso the full-length zzso clone zzso The entire zzso set is cloned in a zzso expression zzso and is flanked by zzso promoters for in zzso transcription, allowing functional experiments to be carried out without further zzso We have created a publicly available database containing the FL clone set and related zzso data zzso and we make the FL clone set publicly available as a resource to accelerate the process of gene discovery and function in this model zzso The creation of the unique set of expressed sequences and the FL clone set pave the way toward a large-scale systematic analysis of gene zzso gene zzso and gene function in this zzso zzso
