zzso degrees of zzso DNA zzso zzso have been observed in nuclear transfer zzso zzso and zzso but the mechanisms leading to this condition are zzso We have generated a clone of 12 bovine zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso using nuclear donor cells, recipient zzso and recipient zzso with defined zzso zzso to study zzso interactions and the origins of zzso zzso zzso were reconstructed from zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso type A and recipient zzso collected from three different maternal lineages with zzso zzso zzso type B, zzso zzso zzso type C, or zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the control region zzso of zzso zzso zzso ranged from 6 to 11 zzso and differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from 45 to 50 zzso zzso were recovered from recipient zzso with zzso zzso zzso type B on Day 80 after nuclear transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel analysis of the zzso by zzso chain zzso restriction zzso length zzso failed to detect nuclear donor zzso in 11 investigated zzso of 10 viable fetuses and in DNA samples of two fetuses in zzso (one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso A more sensitive analysis of 1801 zzso clones with zzso zzso derived from zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso fetus detected no or very low levels of zzso zzso However, the analyses detected considerable amounts ( approximately zzso and zzso of recipient zzso zzso in blood samples from two zzso Our data do not suggest a zzso advantage of zzso nuclear donor cell zzso in bovine zzso clones produced with zzso from domestic forms of the same or a different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the recipient animal in the circulation of two fetuses points to leakage of the zzso barrier, mimicking zzso
