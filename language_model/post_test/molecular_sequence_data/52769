zzso zzso C zzso is the zzso switch for contraction in heart muscle and a potential target for drugs in the therapy of zzso heart zzso This zzso protein consists of two zzso connected by a central zzso each lobe contains two zzso zzso The regulatory zzso lobe of zzso unlike that of skeletal zzso C zzso contains only one functional zzso and does not open fully upon the binding of zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso with three bound zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso the zzso complex displays a fully open zzso lobe similar to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso bound to a zzso zzso of cardiac zzso I zzso zzso The closing of the lobe is zzso hindered by one of the three bound zzso Our results provide a structural basis for the zzso effect of zzso and reveal the details of a distinctive zzso mechanism for zzso regulation by zzso C in cardiac zzso
