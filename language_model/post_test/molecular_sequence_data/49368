The identification of a second zzso zzso zzso provides an explanation for zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether introduction of zzso zzso zzso would alter the functional properties of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso cells contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso concentration zzso and caused the zzso zzso of inward currents recorded at zzso zzso Both actions of zzso were antagonized by zzso The zzso zzso relationship of zzso cells was indistinguishable from that of the related zzso cell zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso also elevated zzso and activated inward zzso zzso was less zzso than zzso as an zzso of zzso receptors in zzso cells and did not significantly increase zzso The zzso induced increase in zzso did not involve zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The introduction of the zzso zzso by transient zzso of zzso cells caused zzso to become less potent as an zzso of zzso receptors and altered the zzso of zzso activated currents so that they resembled currents zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso also abolished the zzso induced zzso increase seen in zzso zzso zzso These data are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso cells predominantly express zzso zzso receptors that become zzso zzso receptors upon introduction of the zzso zzso zzso
