zzso is a novel, zzso zzso that stimulates cellular cholesterol zzso with high potency similar to native zzso on a zzso zzso zzso we investigated structural features of the zzso that zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acids arranged in reverse order or with individual zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso dependent cholesterol zzso similar to zzso zzso neither the presence of specific positively charged zzso nor their specific arrangement along the length of the zzso was necessary for zzso cholesterol zzso Similarly, peptides composed of all zzso acids zzso cholesterol zzso zzso indicating a zzso component was not required for promotion of cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso of two or more positively charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso 14, zzso however, greatly reduced the ability of zzso to mediate cellular cholesterol zzso This was accompanied by a loss of zzso structure upon zzso indicating the secondary structure of individual zzso strands was important for stimulating cholesterol zzso Surprisingly, peptides with removal of two or more positively charged zzso retained the ability to bind zzso and adopt an zzso zzso These data indicate that the propensity of a zzso zzso to form an zzso zzso is not sufficient to mediate cellular cholesterol zzso zzso stimulation of cholesterol zzso requires that zzso retain zzso structure upon zzso
