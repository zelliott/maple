The major cell wall zzso of zzso is zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is essential for the physiology of these zzso zzso zzso the zzso donor of zzso zzso of zzso is zzso through a series of unique zzso steps, the last one being the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso which is believed to proceed via a sequential zzso zzso Two proteins from zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso have been shown to zzso this zzso in an in zzso zzso The present study addressed the exact function of these proteins through the zzso of the corresponding zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the analysis of their in zzso effects on AG zzso We showed that zzso is essential, whereas zzso is zzso zzso of zzso led to a zzso possessing an AG that contained half the zzso and zzso and less zzso linked to AG but more zzso zzso compared with the parental zzso A candidate gene that may zzso a protein functionally similar to zzso was identified in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso While the deletion of zzso had no effect on AG zzso of the zzso the gene could complement the zzso zzso of the AG of the zzso zzso strongly supporting the concept that the two proteins play a similar function in zzso zzso with this, the zzso gene appeared to be essential in the zzso zzso A detailed zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso could zzso with 52 other proteins belonging to the zzso a group of closely related zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso to zzso involves three zzso that zzso two distinct steps, each being essential for the viability of the bacterial zzso
