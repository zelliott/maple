zzso and molecular data demonstrate that zzso transport in kidney and zzso is regulated by specific zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the terminal inner zzso collecting duct permits very high rates of regulated zzso zzso transport and results in the delivery of large amounts of zzso into the deepest portions of the inner zzso where it is needed to maintain a high zzso zzso for concentrating the urine zzso The zzso zzso in zzso permits these cells to lose zzso rapidly as they ascend through the ascending zzso zzso thereby preventing loss of zzso from the zzso zzso lost from the zzso would decrease concentrating ability by decreasing the efficiency of zzso exchange, as occurs in individuals who lack the Kidd zzso The recent cloning of zzso for these two zzso zzso has begun to yield new insights into the mechanisms underlying acute and long-term regulation of zzso transport and should permit exciting new insights in the zzso This review focuses on the zzso and zzso evidence that established the concept of zzso zzso the subsequent cloning of zzso for zzso zzso and the recent zzso studies into the regulation of zzso zzso We also propose a new systematic nomenclature and a new structural model for zzso zzso
