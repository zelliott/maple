In order to further zzso the role of zzso in the retention zzso of zzso and proteins in zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso the zzso properties of four different zzso have been studied as a function of temperature (over the range zzso degrees zzso and column residence time (over the range zzso zzso The role of the zzso structure was also investigated by comparing results obtained with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the same porous zzso Comparative zzso relationships were determined from an examination of the influence of temperature on a number of zzso parameters including the zzso contact area, the affinity constant and the experimental band zzso The results demonstrated that variations in temperature can be used to affect significant changes in selectivity between the different zzso despite their very high degree of sequence zzso These observations have permitted specific zzso acid zzso and in particular those zzso encompassing the region zzso to be proposed to be directly involved in the zzso contact area of the insulin zzso Overall, the analysis of the changes in various zzso parameters in response to variation of the zzso acid zzso temperature and other experimental parameters provides a powerful tool to zzso the structural basis for the zzso stability and the role of zzso on the retention zzso of zzso and proteins in zzso
