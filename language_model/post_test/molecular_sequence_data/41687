zzso zzso from algae are considered to be a potentially viable source of zzso and thereby renewable energy, but at the moment very little is known about the zzso zzso in these zzso Here we compare what is currently known in zzso zzso species, in particular the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso the last zzso of de zzso zzso zzso Several studies in plants and zzso have shown that there are two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the same reaction but have no clear sequence zzso Instead, they have differences in functionality and spatial and zzso expression zzso zzso searches of zzso zzso zzso reveal that most algae have multiple copies of putative zzso whereas other zzso have single zzso zzso whether these putative zzso are indeed functional and whether they zzso significantly different zzso to zzso cells will be vital for future efforts to genetically modify algae for zzso zzso
