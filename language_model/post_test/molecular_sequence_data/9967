The zzso repertoire on both H chain zzso of normal and zzso B lineage cells were analyzed by zzso zzso The zzso H chains were tested for their capacity to form a zzso cell zzso In bone zzso zzso zzso genes were found zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells and in a newly identified early zzso zzso zzso H zzso zzso cell population of normal zzso Only half of the zzso H chains expressed in these cells have the capacity to form a zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes was found suppressed on the productive but not on the zzso zzso rearranged zzso of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso B zzso More than zzso of the zzso H chains expressed in zzso cells can form a zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso cell zzso in normal mice and the B cell zzso in zzso mice mediate a shift in the zzso zzso
