The zzso family is one of the most abundant and widely distributed groups of zzso zzso regulators in zzso Six open reading frames in the zzso of the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso were predicted to zzso zzso zzso All six of the predicted zzso genes were individually zzso and zzso from five of them were successfully zzso Plant disease response zzso revealed that one, whose product belongs to the zzso zzso and has been named zzso is involved in the hypersensitive response zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso could repress its own zzso level through binding to its promoter zzso indicating an zzso feedback zzso mechanism for zzso zzso zzso reporter and zzso zzso chain reaction analyses revealed that zzso positively and zzso affects the expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes in host plant and standard media, zzso zzso expression of the key zzso regulator, zzso in the zzso zzso could bypass the requirement of zzso for the induction of zzso HR, suggesting that zzso regulates the expression of zzso genes that zzso the type III zzso system via zzso
