zzso zzso is a new two-dimensional representation that characterizes the disposition of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In this research, the zzso and zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso are zzso on the zzso zzso according to zzso repeat pattern zzso zzso Their zzso zzso clearly demonstrate that the zzso with same repeat letters are laid on same side of the spiral zzso where most zzso zzso are positioned at a and zzso and most zzso zzso are localized on zzso zzso zzso f and g polar position zzso The zzso zzso of a zzso zzso can be represented by the combination of two zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso complex structures can also be assembled by using two pairs of their zzso zzso Furthermore, by comparing the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso is suggested to be zzso By analyzing the zzso zzso of the zzso complex structure, most affected zzso of zzso by the interaction with zzso are proposed at positions zzso zzso e and g of the zzso zzso These findings are consistent with our previous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso structures may provide novel insights into the interaction mechanisms between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
