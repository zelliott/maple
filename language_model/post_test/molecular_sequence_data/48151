A novel zzso protein has been identified and shown to be an zzso This zzso which was isolated from human zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso cell zzso has robust zzso zzso zzso activity that is strongly inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso indicating a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso the zzso activity of this zzso zzso is strongly inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which are suggested to be zzso zzso The demonstration of a single zzso protein that binds both zzso or zzso and zzso provides strong support for the zzso zzso having an apparent mass of 12 zzso and it is suggested that the protein might be called zzso for zzso zzso zzso binding zzso When an internal zzso zzso derived from zzso was zzso a sequence also present in human zzso 10 was identified, suggesting a zzso zzso for the zzso While zzso zzso it was found that it is zzso with specific proteins that include a protein zzso and a zzso zzso The latter is indicated to be zzso zzso 2A zzso It is suggested that zzso promote the assembly of zzso complexes that often include a protein zzso or a zzso zzso or zzso
