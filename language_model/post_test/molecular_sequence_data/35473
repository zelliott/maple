Root hairs are zzso long zzso zzso of specialized zzso cells, and are important for zzso and water zzso and interaction with the soil zzso Here we characterized two zzso cellulose zzso D zzso zzso zzso and zzso the most probable zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are strongly expressed in roots, including in the root zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that these two proteins are located not only in the polarized plasma membrane of root hair tips, but also in zzso apparatus of the root hair and zzso zzso zzso of these two zzso genes in the zzso zzso was able to rescue most of the defects caused by disruption of zzso including root hair zzso changes, altered cell wall zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso cellulose zzso Taken together, our results provide evidence indicating that zzso and zzso are functionally zzso with zzso and support a role for zzso and zzso specifically in zzso cellulose production in zzso root hair zzso The results presented here also suggest that at least part of the mechanism of root hair formation is zzso between zzso and woody zzso
