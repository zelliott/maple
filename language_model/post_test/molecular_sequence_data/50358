CD and zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with an affinity similar to that exhibited with the tightest binding zzso zzso Using the available crystal structures of zzso and alpha zzso a model has been built for the interaction of zzso and alpha zzso and subjected to potential energy zzso In the model, there is a bend in the central zzso of zzso similar to that suggested by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso fits zzso into the cavity formed by the bent zzso zzso with each of its two zzso making zzso interactions with each of the two zzso zzso situated at the terminal zzso of zzso The complex is further stabilized by numerous polar and zzso interactions on the rims of the zzso Our model is compared with two other similar models previously reported for the zzso complexes with other zzso peptides and zzso about the mode of zzso binding to target proteins are made, which have wide relevance to the function of zzso By zzso a similar model is predicted for a zzso zzso
