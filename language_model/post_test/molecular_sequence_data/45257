zzso of inward zzso zzso zzso channels by internal pH is believed to occur when large zzso zzso on each of the four zzso zzso the zzso path at the zzso end of the inner zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether closure of the channel at this point involves zzso of the inner zzso at one or both of two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso that have been proposed as putative zzso zzso for zzso zzso Replacement of these zzso inner zzso zzso by less flexible zzso did not abolish gating but shifted the apparent zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for zzso and to zzso zzso zzso for zzso When both zzso were zzso the effect was zzso shifting the zzso by zzso pH units to zzso zzso zzso for the double zzso zzso At this zzso the double zzso would remain completely closed under zzso zzso In contrast, when the zzso at zzso was replaced by a zzso the zzso was shifted in the opposite direction from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for zzso Although zzso zzso at zzso and zzso made it significantly easier to open the channel, they were not an absolute requirement for pH gating in zzso In addition, none of the zzso zzso produced more than small changes in either the zzso or excised single-channel zzso which, in this channel, argues against changes in the selectivity zzso The putative pH sensor at zzso zzso to zzso was also zzso zzso of this zzso to an zzso zzso did not abolish pH zzso but shifted the zzso into an acid range from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso similar to pH gating in zzso Hence zzso cannot function as the exclusive pH sensor for the channel, although it may act as one of multiple pH sensors, or as a link between a zzso sensor and the channel zzso zzso also zzso differently with the two zzso zzso zzso of the double zzso zzso was indistinguishable from zzso alone, whereas gating of zzso was midway between the alkaline zzso of zzso and the acid zzso of zzso Finally, closure of zzso zzso zzso and zzso all required the same zzso zzso at the zzso end of the inner zzso zzso Hence in zzso and zzso channels, closure occurs by zzso zzso of the zzso path by four zzso side chains zzso at the zzso bundle zzso This is facilitated by the zzso zzso on zzso but pH gating in zzso does not absolutely require zzso hinges in this zzso
