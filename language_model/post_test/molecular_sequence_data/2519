zzso is a major zzso protein that occurs in a soluble and a zzso form and is the only known constituent common to the zzso plaques of both kinds of adhering zzso the zzso and the intermediate zzso Using a partial zzso clone for bovine zzso we isolated zzso zzso human zzso determined its zzso zzso and deduced the complete zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso was zzso by in zzso zzso and translation and identified by its zzso with authentic zzso in two-dimensional gel zzso The identity was further confirmed by comparison of the deduced sequence with the directly determined zzso acid sequence of two fragments from bovine zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence showed the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be unrelated to any other known zzso highly zzso between human and bovine zzso and characterized by numerous changes between zzso and zzso zzso Only one kind of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in most zzso but an additional zzso zzso zzso was detected in certain human tumor cell zzso This longer zzso may be represented by a second type of zzso zzso which contains an zzso of 297 zzso in the 3' zzso zzso
