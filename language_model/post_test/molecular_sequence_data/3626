zzso agents exert their zzso effects in many cell types via binding to specific zzso receptors zzso zzso couple to zzso zzso channel zzso to form zzso zzso zzso channels zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and also provide the binding sites for zzso and other pharmacological zzso Our previous work demonstrated that the exposure of zzso cells zzso to zzso generated profound effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso metabolism and induced heightened cell zzso in association with zzso zzso Because these responses likely resulted from the binding of zzso to a zzso zzso we subsequently documented zzso binding to zzso and the gene expression of several zzso zzso zzso From these data, we zzso that zzso expressed the components of a zzso zzso and sought to establish their presence in primary zzso 

To obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was zzso DNA sequences were established by the fluorescent dye termination zzso Gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso was examined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Northern zzso zzso proteins were identified by zzso of zzso proteins from zzso zzso with zzso zzso directed against zzso 

zzso cloning yielded two zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso whose open reading frames translated proteins of zzso and 1535 zzso zzso Using zzso specific to each zzso the presence of a unique, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The sequence of this zzso zzso zzso shares identity with the recently cloned rat zzso zzso but, in comparison to zzso is truncated by 12 zzso at the zzso where it contains a unique insert of 16 zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso demonstrated zzso proteins of 108 and 170 zzso in zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso studies showed abundant gene expression of zzso thereby establishing gene expression of both components of zzso 

Based upon zzso to vascular smooth muscle cells zzso there are at least two putative zzso zzso that most likely represent zzso comprised of either zzso or zzso in complex with zzso Our results define the zzso zzso as the possible first link in a chain of cellular events that culminates in zzso contraction and altered zzso zzso metabolism following exposure to zzso In addition, our results serve as the basis for the future zzso of the zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso and the study of zzso regulators of zzso cell zzso
