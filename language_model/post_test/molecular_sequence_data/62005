zzso zzso zzso approaches for characterizing proteins from complex zzso samples of zzso zzso of total mass are zzso zzso identifications from zzso zzso of whole zzso extracts were enabled by zzso sensitivity zzso zzso for individual zzso achieved using zzso zzso capacities of approximately zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso using zzso approximately 20 zzso zzso flow rate at the optimal linear zzso of approximately zzso zzso coupled zzso with a zzso sample extraction and a zzso zzso zzso interface to a zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso zzso zzso measurement coverage improved as sample size was increased from as little as zzso zzso of zzso It was found that a zzso sample provided zzso coverage of all zzso open reading frames for the zzso zzso zzso consistent with previous results for a specific culture zzso The estimated detection dynamic range for detected proteins was zzso An improved accurate mass and zzso zzso time two-dimensional data analysis methodology, used to both speed and increase the confidence of zzso zzso enabled identification of 872 zzso from a single zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity provides a basis for extending zzso studies to smaller cell populations and potentially to a single zzso zzso Application with zzso trap zzso zzso allowed protein identification from 50 zzso zzso zzso of zzso samples zzso approximately 100 times larger than zzso zzso corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately 7 zzso for individual zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso trap zzso provided a much lower zzso measurement coverage and dynamic range for a given analysis time and sample zzso
