zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso are common in patients with zzso zzso disease and may play a role in disease zzso We have prepared zzso G zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display zzso libraries from the cervical zzso zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso patients and from the zzso of 1 zzso After selection with zzso zzso human zzso up to 10 high affinity zzso zzso clones from each tissue source were analyzed zzso No zzso zzso zzso were detected in the patient with the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the clones showed restricted heavy and light chain zzso similar to that in previously published zzso zzso This was despite the substantially larger sizes of the initial libraries, the use of zzso zzso tissue to generate libraries, and the analysis of the repertoire in patients with zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso There was overall similarity in sequences obtained from zzso zzso and zzso libraries, with higher levels of zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso inhibited binding of serum zzso zzso from five patients by zzso These data together with those from previous reports indicate that although there is no unique zzso gene zzso there is the zzso presence of certain variable regions in the high affinity zzso zzso zzso
