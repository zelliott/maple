The zzso zzso genes composed of zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso lineages play an important role in zzso and zzso identity in previously studied flowering zzso We investigated the diversification of the zzso and zzso zzso genes of eight species in five zzso zzso families: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a four zzso acid deletion in the K domain, which was found in all previously reported zzso zzso zzso exists in a zzso zzso of zzso but not in six zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso lineages in zzso The results of molecular zzso analyses were not inconsistent with this zzso The zzso and zzso zzso from zzso share a sequence of five zzso acids in the zzso region of zzso zzso Using the zzso tree and likelihood methods, the divergence time between the zzso and zzso lineages was estimated as somewhere between immediately after to several tens of millions of years after the split between zzso and extant zzso Estimates of the age of the most recent common zzso of all extant zzso range from approximately zzso zzso depending on the trees used and assumptions zzso
