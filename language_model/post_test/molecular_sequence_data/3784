The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets to various zzso locations in zzso cells for various zzso The zzso zzso heavy chain zzso contains the zzso binding and zzso binding sites for motor function, whereas the intermediate chain zzso is implicated in the in zzso targeting of the zzso zzso any targeting event, it is not known whether the zzso has to form a complex with the HC for targeting or whether the zzso can target to a site independently of the zzso In the zzso fungus zzso zzso the zzso HC is localized to the ends of zzso near the zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that our newly identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso is also localized to zzso ends and is required for zzso zzso to zzso ends in living zzso With the combination of two zzso an HC zzso function zzso and the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso that retains its function, we show that the zzso zzso to zzso ends also requires zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso complex formation is important for zzso end zzso In addition, we show that the HC zzso is not apparently altered in the deletion zzso of zzso a zzso protein that interacts directly with the zzso domain of the zzso Our study suggests that, although zzso association is important for the targeting of zzso to zzso ends, other essential zzso such as zzso may interact with the targeted zzso complex to produce full motor activities in zzso
