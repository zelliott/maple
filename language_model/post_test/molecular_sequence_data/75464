zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that are expressed in the liver of zzso zzso treated rabbits were isolated, and their zzso sequences were zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame for a zzso protein and is a full-length counterpart of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1984) zzso 23, zzso The zzso insert has a sequence for a protein whose primary structure is zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso 1, though this zzso lacks the sequence zzso the zzso 110 zzso The overlapping clones zzso and zzso together zzso an zzso form of zzso zzso though the zzso five or more zzso are missing in the composite zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein is more strongly zzso by zzso aromatic zzso and zzso than by zzso in contrast to the case of the zzso and zzso zzso A comparison of the primary structures of eight forms of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are expressed in the liver of zzso rabbits showed that 149 out of zzso zzso acid zzso are zzso in these zzso zzso The eight forms can be assigned to three rabbit zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was also shown that the members of the rabbit zzso zzso can be further classified into three zzso on the basis of their sequence zzso
