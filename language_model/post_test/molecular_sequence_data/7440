To correlate structural data on zzso of human zzso zzso with their interaction with the zzso we have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso I and II represent zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso III is a mimic for the zzso site in alpha zzso and zzso IV represents a zzso zzso zzso data showed that peptides I, II and III were zzso of the zzso In contrast, zzso IV was not acted upon by the zzso zzso zzso data on the peptides showed that the peptides assume ordered structures in water and zzso In the latter zzso peptides I and III bound zzso and zzso while zzso II bound zzso but not zzso zzso IV did not bind either zzso in this zzso Together with the kinetic data, the results suggest that the zzso zzso segments in collagen and zzso zzso of zzso could interact with zzso and the zzso to form a zzso zzso This, in turn, would imply a zzso role for zzso in zzso action in addition to the solely structural role ascribed so far to this zzso
