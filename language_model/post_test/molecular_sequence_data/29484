zzso regulator zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso expression of genes for zzso degradation zzso zzso as a zzso or an zzso depending on the levels of the zzso zzso and of its own zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso Here the DNA binding properties of the zzso protein are described in terms of the location of the binding sites and the affinity to these zzso Native zzso was zzso after zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso It is a zzso in zzso The binding site in the zzso zzso region is located between the two divergent promoters covering 45 zzso which includes three perfect zzso zzso A zzso binding site downstream of zzso is covered by zzso across two zzso sequence zzso The affinity of zzso for the zzso binding sites is zzso higher zzso constant zzso zzso zzso than the affinity for the site downstream of zzso zzso 8 zzso The binding of zzso was tested after modifications of the zzso binding zzso zzso of any external sequence repetition still allowed for specific binding of zzso but the affinity was significantly reduced, suggesting an important role for all three sequence repetitions in gene zzso The involvement of DNA zzso in the regulatory process is suggested by the observed strong intrinsic zzso displayed by the zzso zzso zzso
