The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso fungus that displays an in zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to study the zzso of zzso zzso during this unique zzso phase, we developed a method to harvest in zzso zzso zzso cells from infected zzso zzso zzso The infected zzso was collected just prior to insect death and subjected to zzso zzso which allowed for separation of the zzso zzso in zzso cells from remaining insect zzso Total zzso was extracted from the harvested zzso cells and used to construct a zzso library that is representative of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated and led to the cloning of two zzso zzso One of these zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso during infection, and identification of a signal zzso suggested that the zzso is zzso in the host zzso Although its activity and role have yet to be zzso the zzso zzso zzso appears as a likely candidate for being involved in zzso zzso zzso The identification of this novel, zzso zzso also suggests that random sequencing from our in zzso zzso library may be a valuable step towards identifying biologically active zzso produced in zzso by zzso zzso
