In the presence of ample zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso to give a zzso zzso leader zzso zzso of zzso leader zzso has been shown to depend on zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso region just upstream of the 3' zzso zzso The small size of zzso leader zzso and its strong dependence on zzso zzso zzso for zzso make it a suitable zzso for analyzing the requirements for zzso zzso target site zzso zzso leader zzso with zzso changes around the zzso zzso target site were more stable than zzso zzso leader zzso showing that sequences on either side of the zzso site contribute to zzso zzso zzso An analysis of zzso zzso from these zzso suggested limited zzso zzso processing from the native 3' zzso zzso leader zzso were designed that contained zzso or zzso zzso zzso targets elsewhere on the zzso The presence of an additional zzso zzso zzso site resulted in faster zzso zzso depending on its zzso zzso of a zzso tail containing 7 A zzso caused zzso of zzso leader zzso Surprisingly, addition at the zzso end of a strong stem loop structure that is known to stabilize other zzso did not result in a longer zzso leader zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso site may be zzso zzso In the course of these experiments, we found evidence that zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by a zzso zzso
