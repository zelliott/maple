The zzso associated with zzso processing zzso is a key component of the cellular immune zzso As a member of the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso TAP zzso zzso to zzso the transport of peptides from the zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso TAP is composed of zzso and zzso each containing a zzso domain and a zzso domain zzso Here we investigated the role of the ABC signature motif zzso on the functional zzso of the zzso which contain a zzso zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso in zzso fully abolished zzso zzso However, TAP complexes with equivalent zzso in zzso still showed residual zzso transport zzso To zzso the origin of the asymmetry of the zzso of zzso we further examined TAP complexes with exchanged zzso zzso the zzso with two zzso zzso showed the highest transport rate whereas the zzso with two zzso zzso had the lowest transport rate, demonstrating that the ABC signature motifs control zzso transport zzso All single site zzso and zzso showed similar activities in zzso or zzso zzso zzso that these zzso affect the zzso activity of zzso In addition, these results prove that the zzso of the zzso is not essential for TAP function but rather zzso together with other zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso in both zzso zzso
