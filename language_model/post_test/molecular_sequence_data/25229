Human zzso heavy chain constant region zzso genes constitute a typical zzso family, usually zzso zzso genes on the zzso of zzso 14 zzso In this region, deleted and duplicated zzso have been reported to exist with considerable zzso Their origin is the result of either unequal zzso or looping out zzso In this paper, we report the characterization of a new type of zzso involving the zzso zzso in a subject who also carries a larger deletion of a previously described type on the second zzso Employment of several methods zzso chain reaction, standard Southern zzso zzso field gel zzso zzso zzso to analyze these deleted zzso has resulted in a level of accuracy in their characterization that has not been achieved in previous zzso The site of zzso responsible for the zzso deletion was restricted to a zzso region 3' of the zzso zzso this rules out any possible involvement of the S regions in the zzso zzso The usefulness of the various techniques in the characterization of the deletions is also discussed, together with possible future applications in the zzso
