zzso B virus zzso gene expression is mainly regulated at the zzso initiation zzso The viral X protein zzso is a zzso zzso targeting zzso for the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso Here we report a novel zzso nuclear target designated zzso zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso is a novel cellular nuclear protein containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso finger, a domain shared by many proteins that play roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso via the zzso region containing the zzso zzso At the functional level zzso increases zzso zzso in a zzso manner suggesting a role for this interaction in the virus life zzso Interestingly, zzso collaborates with zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also observed in tumor necrosis factor zzso cells suggesting that zzso functional collaboration localized downstream to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso recruits and zzso a novel putative zzso zzso to regulate zzso The implication of zzso interaction in the development of zzso zzso is zzso
