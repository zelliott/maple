The conservation of zzso functions exerted by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso suggested that zzso with related functions are present in zzso zzso Our zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso belong either to zzso or to zzso zzso Among the 13 zzso families, 9 have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso reported zzso Among the zzso zzso sequences were not found, and the zzso sequences formed at least five distinct zzso zzso Two are significantly related to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso whereas three display some zzso to the zzso zzso groups 1 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Intermediate zzso genes zzso 3 to 8 and zzso did not have clear zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not found zzso linked within a zzso range and displayed specific expression patterns in the adult zzso During zzso zzso was expressed as an early gene whatever the zzso whereas zzso was zzso later during head but not foot zzso Finally, zzso expression was zzso in the adult head once it was fully zzso These results suggest that the zzso genes related to anterior zzso genes are involved at different stages of zzso zzso However, the zzso information defining the zzso axis in zzso cannot be correlated strictly to that characterizing the zzso axis in zzso or zzso
