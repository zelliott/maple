To investigate the extent to which in zzso zzso zzso might reflect the intrinsic zzso of active zzso genetic and zzso zzso were used to zzso the DNA target zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The results reveal the critical importance of zzso immediately zzso of the targeted C for the specificity of all three zzso studied zzso zzso and zzso At position zzso zzso showed a marked preference for zzso AID for zzso and zzso a strong preference for zzso Furthermore, AID and zzso showed distinct dependence on the zzso at position zzso with zzso being zzso by AID and zzso by zzso Most if not all activity of the zzso zzso on free zzso could be attributed to low-level contamination by host zzso The target preference of zzso supports it being a major but possibly not sole contributor to zzso zzso without making it a dominant contribution to general zzso sequence zzso The specificity of AID as deduced from the genetic zzso (which relies on zzso of zzso of zzso zzso agrees well with that deduced by zzso et zzso using an in zzso zzso although we zzso that major intrinsic zzso hotspots in zzso V genes in zzso might reflect zzso sites of AID action being generated by zzso DNA targets located on opposite DNA zzso The target specificity of AID also zzso with the spectrum of zzso observed in B zzso zzso The possibility of zzso involvement in zzso human zzso is hinted at by zzso differences in the zzso of zzso transitions in zzso zzso Thus, the patterns of zzso in zzso and zzso owe much to the intrinsic sequence preferences of the zzso family of DNA zzso analogous biases might also contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
