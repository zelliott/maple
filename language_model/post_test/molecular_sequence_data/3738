To better understand the molecular signaling events leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome zzso and multiple organ failure zzso changes in gene expression profiles after burn injury were investigated by differential zzso zzso mice were subjected to zzso total body surface area zzso zzso burn and various zzso were harvested at multiple time points after zzso zzso differential display revealed that zzso transcripts similar to the envelope sequence of zzso AIDS zzso virus were rapidly and zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analyses confirmed the transient zzso of zzso sequences similar to those of the zzso zzso In addition, the presence and induction of the zzso envelope transcripts of these zzso zzso zzso including a novel double spliced message, were identified after burn zzso These data suggest that the zzso efficiency of the integrated zzso DNA and zzso of defective zzso zzso sequences may be affected by zzso signals, such as burn zzso The elevated expression of these zzso zzso zzso sequences may affect the zzso activities of the zzso genes at the integration sites and may be a cause of altered local and systemic immune responses to zzso zzso
