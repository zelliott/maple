Previously, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain expressed in zzso coli was shown to retain its zzso zzso Here, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a number of putative zzso repeats was further zzso The zzso zzso zzso although expressed as a soluble form in a zzso zzso coli strain zzso was found to be highly sensitive to zzso zzso Interestingly, the addition of calcium zzso in a zzso range into the zzso preparation significantly prevented the zzso Moreover, levels of zzso degradation were dependent on calcium zzso zzso an important role for zzso sites in the zzso zzso for structural zzso zzso modeling of the repetitive blocks in the zzso zzso supports that this zzso protein folds into a parallel zzso structure with calcium zzso acting as a structural stabilizing zzso
