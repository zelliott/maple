zzso identification of the transmitted virus and sequences evolving from it could be instrumental in zzso the transmission of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and in developing vaccines, drugs, or zzso to prevent zzso Here we describe an experimental approach to analyze zzso zzso genes as intact genetic units amplified from plasma zzso zzso by zzso amplification zzso followed by direct sequencing of zzso DNA zzso We show that this strategy zzso in zzso artifacts caused by zzso zzso zzso and template zzso provides an accurate representation of the zzso zzso in zzso and has an overall error rate (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso of less than 8 zzso zzso zzso this method to the analysis of virus in plasma from 12 zzso subjects from whom samples were obtained within 3 months of zzso we show that transmitted or early founder viruses can be identified and that molecular pathways and rates of early zzso diversification can be zzso Specifically, we show that 8 of the 12 subjects were each infected by a single virus, while 4 others acquired more than one zzso that the rate of virus evolution in one subject during an zzso period spanning zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso per site per day; and that evidence of strong zzso selection can be seen in zzso and overlapping Rev sequences based on zzso zzso of zzso zzso We also compared the results of the zzso approach with those of zzso bulk zzso amplification methods performed on the same patient samples and found that the latter is associated with excessive rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso template zzso and cloning zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso other viral zzso and even full-length viral zzso responsible for productive clinical infection can be identified by zzso analysis of plasma virus sampled at intervals typical in large-scale vaccine trials and that pathways of viral diversification and immune escape can be determined zzso
