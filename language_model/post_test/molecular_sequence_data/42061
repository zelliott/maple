A novel, sensitive zzso test is described for zzso of the initial number of zzso B virus zzso zzso amplified in zzso The viral zzso are amplified together with a synthetic internal standard zzso to correct for the zzso of the efficiency zzso One of the two zzso is zzso and the amplified zzso of zzso and IS zzso are bound to zzso zzso plates for quantitative zzso The ratio of zzso to IS DNA is determined for each sample by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso detection is zzso zzso and accurate with a dynamic range from approximately zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso The initial number of zzso zzso in a clinical sample is interpreted from the signal ratio zzso by using a standard curve, obtained from zzso of known quantities of synthetic zzso templates with zzso The zzso zzso 15 viral zzso from 10 zzso of serum, and its dynamic range was up to five orders of zzso After the amplification step, the zzso takes zzso 2 zzso and the method is zzso to zzso
