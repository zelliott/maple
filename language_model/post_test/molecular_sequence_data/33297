zzso zzso zzso is an emerging pathogen whose mechanism of replication is poorly zzso zzso the presumed zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso acts in combination with the zzso zzso zzso to zzso viral zzso We have solved the crystal structure of zzso 1 to 304 of zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso This structure reveals that each zzso of zzso shares a fold common to zzso zzso Like human zzso zzso zzso forms a head-to-head zzso in the form of a C zzso with its zzso face containing a number of basic zzso that are predicted to be important for DNA zzso However, there are several differences with related zzso especially in zzso that extend from each zzso into the center of the C clamp and in the zzso that connect the two zzso of each zzso which may be important for determining zzso mode of binding to DNA and to zzso Using the crystal structures of zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso in complex with DNA and initial experiments testing the effects of zzso of zzso DNA synthesis by peptides derived from zzso we suggest a model for how zzso might form a zzso complex with zzso and zzso The structure and the model suggest interesting similarities and differences in how zzso functions relative to structurally similar zzso
