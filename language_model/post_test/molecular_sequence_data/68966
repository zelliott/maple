We studied a zzso zzso B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso cell population that produces zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso In contrast to common zzso B cell zzso this zzso leukemia cell population displays zzso diversity in its expressed zzso V zzso similar to that noted for zzso B cell zzso zzso Also, in contrast to common B cell zzso these leukemia cells rapidly undergo cell death hours after being placed in tissue zzso We find that addition of zzso zzso human zzso enhances significantly the survival of these cells in zzso zzso cell survival also could be enhanced by zzso zzso or zzso presented on zzso gamma zzso zzso L cells, but not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso human zzso We find that zzso acts directly on the leukemia B cells to inhibit zzso This effect could be zzso by zzso the leukemia zzso surface zzso receptors with immobilized zzso zzso specific for human zzso zzso but not by immobilized zzso of irrelevant zzso In contrast to most zzso zzso this leukemia B cell population does not have evidence of zzso gene zzso Also, in contrast to zzso zzso and most B cell zzso these cells do not express zzso amounts of zzso Finally, although capable of zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso does not induce expression of zzso in these zzso leukemia zzso We zzso that the lack of zzso expression may render these leukemia cells particularly dependent upon the survival zzso derived from surface zzso zzso zzso This state may represent an early stage in zzso possibly accounting for the zzso diversity observed in the zzso V genes expressed by certain zzso B cell zzso and zzso
