The major zzso gene product from pigeon zzso was cloned from zzso zzso and zzso by chain zzso The sequence of zzso includes an open reading frame which yields a zzso which highly similar to zzso zzso II zzso zzso Like the other zzso the deduced protein zzso consists of a zzso repeating structure which has a zzso core characteristic of a large group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso protein which is the proper size for zzso zzso zzso comparison of the sequences of zzso and human zzso II shows that the only substantial sequence zzso is a domain zzso zzso acids between zzso 20 and 40 which includes a zzso zzso site in the human zzso along with other zzso of possible zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso are regulated by zzso in other zzso and, that the sequences of the avian form and the zzso form may have selectively zzso to yield different regulatory zzso
