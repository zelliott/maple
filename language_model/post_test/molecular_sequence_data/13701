Hunter syndrome is characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso A large number of zzso in the gene have been zzso We describe here the development of a limited primer method for the identification of zzso In the reaction mixture designed for the limited primer extension, one or two zzso from the four necessary zzso are added as zzso zzso and another zzso which is zzso is added as the zzso zzso The absence of one or two of the zzso limits the length of primer zzso and the low concentration of the zzso zzso causes an zzso effect and results in a zzso pattern upon zzso of the products thus making it possible to distinguish zzso and normal zzso We have studied three novel zzso in zzso IX, zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso gene by the limited primer extension zzso
