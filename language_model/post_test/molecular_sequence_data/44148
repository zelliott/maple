zzso blood zzso cells zzso from three adult male zzso monkeys zzso zzso were transformed by human zzso zzso virus type I zzso by zzso with lethally zzso human zzso zzso Three permanent monkey zzso lines producing zzso were obtained and zzso Six weeks after zzso zzso was observed in three of three monkeys zzso with zzso transformed T cells and in two of three monkeys receiving zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in their zzso at various times after zzso with the highest zzso load and zzso zzso being found in monkeys infected with zzso zzso Monkeys zzso with zzso zzso cells did not zzso and zzso zzso was detected only zzso in their zzso To determine whether in zzso and in zzso zzso infection of zzso monkey cells led to a selection of zzso viral zzso comparative sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso between ex zzso monkey zzso zzso the zzso and zzso cells was done and no significant differences were zzso The zzso zzso which is naturally free of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, thus appears to be a suitable model for evaluating zzso candidate vaccines and for studying the zzso of zzso
