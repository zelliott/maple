To determine whether zzso zzso coding for zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are produced in human zzso zzso 

Total cellular zzso was isolated from three specimens of normal human zzso tissue and complementary DNA was zzso The zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso were used to amplify the sequences of interest from the complementary zzso Hot zzso and zzso zzso were used to demonstrate that the expected amplification products were zzso 

Data demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are produced in human zzso zzso 

These results and the previous identification of basic zzso growth factor in the zzso zzso suggest that basic zzso growth factor has zzso or zzso functions in zzso zzso More study is needed to determine whether the corresponding proteins are produced and, if so, what functions are regulated by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
