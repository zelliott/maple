zzso zzso in zzso can influence the metabolism of important therapeutic agents and cause zzso variation in drug response and zzso The significance of the zzso zzso has been controversial with reports of higher in zzso but lower in zzso activity compared to zzso In this study, the contribution of the zzso partners zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso dependent activity of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in human liver zzso zzso and zzso coli expressed zzso zzso proteins using zzso zzso zzso and zzso as probe zzso For zzso zzso clearance values were two- to zzso higher compared to zzso zzso higher zzso seems to be dominated by a higher, but zzso specific zzso towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which resulted in increased reaction zzso A stronger binding affinity of zzso to zzso based on a two site binding model, in conjunction with a five fold increase in zzso of zzso spin change during binding of zzso and zzso partners could potentially contribute to a higher zzso In zzso carriers of the zzso zzso were as active as zzso towards the zzso specific reaction zzso zzso Large excess of zzso zzso compared to zzso in zzso systems and zzso inhibited zzso zzso diminishing the difference in zzso between the two zzso and may provide an explanation for the zzso to in zzso zzso In zzso studies illustrate the genetic differences between wild type and zzso on the molecular zzso
