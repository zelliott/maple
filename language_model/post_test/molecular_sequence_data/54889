The large zzso of the U2 auxiliary factor zzso recognizes the zzso tract zzso located adjacent to the 3' zzso site to facilitate U2 zzso zzso While zzso is considered essential for zzso zzso its requirement for zzso on a zzso level has not been zzso Using zzso sequencing, we performed zzso profiling for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that zzso show a range of zzso defects in the zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso conditions inhibit zzso of some zzso others are spliced apparently zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso have stronger zzso zzso sites and higher zzso zzso Most importantly, features that contribute to zzso zzso of an zzso unexpectedly reside in its zzso 30 zzso These include the zzso zzso site, a zzso at position 7, and the zzso zzso zzso point sequence zzso A differential requirement zzso to zzso for zzso may also apply to other general zzso factors zzso zzso Our combined results indicate that zzso zzso is a common phenomenon and that varied zzso features support the existence of zzso aspects of zzso zzso
