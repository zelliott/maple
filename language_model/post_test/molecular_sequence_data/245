A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from a zzso aromatic zzso zzso enriched from a zzso sample collected from the Indian zzso The isolate was zzso zzso zzso by means of a polar zzso moderately zzso and capable of reducing nitrate to zzso Growth was observed at zzso of zzso % and at temperatures of zzso degrees zzso The strain was unable to degrade zzso 80 or zzso The dominant fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso % of the zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : 1) zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso levels of similarity between strain zzso and type strains of recognized species in the family zzso were all less than zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from zzso related zzso based on differences in several zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso
