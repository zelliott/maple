The emergence of zzso cells in zzso virus zzso zzso is associated with two zzso genetic zzso namely the zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene and the zzso of zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso In order to determine the role of these genetic zzso on the proliferation and differentiation control of zzso we expressed zzso and the temperature sensitive zzso zzso in avian primary zzso zzso We show that enforced expression of zzso in zzso obtained from bone zzso cells by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the execution of the differentiation program normally induced in these cells in response to zzso and insulin and following zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso is without effect on the ability of these cells to differentiate into zzso However, expression of zzso in zzso zzso obtained from bone zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso alpha and zzso was found to relieve these cells from their absolute zzso alpha requirement for long term zzso This zzso is dependent upon the expression of the zzso form of zzso as it is not observed at a temperature at which zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso Our results show that each of the genetic zzso which characterize zzso zzso cells affect in a distinct manner the proliferation and differentiation control of primary zzso zzso
