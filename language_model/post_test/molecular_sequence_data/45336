The differential gene zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to changing zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso using arbitrarily primed zzso zzso zzso primer sets were used to scan two different zzso pools derived from cultures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso fragments were identified, zzso and zzso Six out of the 43 fragments were confirmed to be truly zzso transcribed in terms of changing zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the six gene fragments showed highest identities zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were up regulated in zzso zzso while the other two zzso and zzso contained more abundant transcripts in zzso zzso The data suggested that strategies involved in controlling protein zzso protein folding and/or trafficking, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and substance transporting were used for salt adaptation in zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns of the six genes in response to transient stress shocks including salt shock zzso zzso shift to zzso cold shock (15 degrees C shift to 0 degrees zzso and zzso pressure shock zzso zzso shift to 50 zzso were further zzso zzso zzso the putative zzso zzso protein was indicated to be involved in adaptation of all the stresses zzso
