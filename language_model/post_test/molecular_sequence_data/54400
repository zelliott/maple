A sequence around the start zzso of the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso folds into a zzso motif in which the initiation site is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the protein to its own zzso at the hairpin prevents the production of zzso through a zzso feedback zzso zzso of the zzso hairpin by other zzso has been proposed as a strategy to reduce zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells require high zzso activity to maintain the production of zzso as a building block for DNA zzso The crystal structure of a model zzso zzso that represents the zzso site of the zzso has been zzso While zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso adopts a hairpin structure in solution, even at high zzso zzso an zzso zzso of two zzso zzso strands was obtained in the zzso The zzso zzso contains an unusual zzso motif that also occurs in the zzso state of the human zzso decoding site zzso
