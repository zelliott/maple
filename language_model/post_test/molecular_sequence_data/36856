A zzso zzso 200,000, which has the biological activity of the zzso zzso channel, was isolated from a zzso line of mouse zzso cells, zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso in zzso yield by methods used to purify zzso which included zzso labeling of the cells with zzso and binding of the radioactive zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso has biological activity of zzso zzso flux when zzso into artificial zzso zzso This activity was shown to depend on the presence of zzso acid since treatment of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso abolished the response to zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso derived by zzso zzso of the zzso were characterized by affinity to immobilized zzso and contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a ratio of zzso Most of the zzso were zzso as shown by binding characteristics to immobilized zzso with and without zzso The structure of the zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The Con zzso fraction contains zzso group on the zzso antenna and an zzso groups on the zzso zzso An zzso group is zzso to the zzso core zzso zzso
