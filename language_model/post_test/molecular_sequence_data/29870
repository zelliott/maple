zzso zzso has been used to delete 2 zzso zzso from a flexible zzso region between zzso 40 and 46 of human zzso zzso zzso kinetic studies show that the zzso values for the deletion zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the pH rate profile are virtually identical to that of the wild zzso In contrast, the zzso value of the zzso zzso is decreased zzso The results suggest that the loop region may play a role in the zzso efficiency but not necessarily in the binding of zzso Agents such as zzso zzso and zzso at zzso which show zzso effects on the zzso human zzso zzso have little or no effect on the deletion zzso Competitive zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso against zzso zzso fragments generated from human zzso zzso show that the binding of zzso zzso and methotrexate, either in zzso or in zzso complexes with the zzso zzso causes a striking reduction in the binding of the zzso Compared with wild type, the binding of these zzso with the deletion zzso zzso causes much less zzso zzso less) in the binding of all three zzso The altered properties of the zzso zzso can be explained on the basis of a need for the flexible loop zzso for zzso protein unfolding during zzso and also for zzso changes induced by zzso zzso thus zzso the effects of zzso zzso
