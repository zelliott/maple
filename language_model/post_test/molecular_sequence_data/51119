A full length zzso whose corresponding zzso is zzso during the mouse embryonic brain development was zzso The zzso contains a single long open reading frame which could zzso a protein with relative molecular mass of 41 zzso The predicted gene product contains long stretches of zzso towards the zzso followed by a zzso rich zzso The zzso probe detected a number of zzso species in Northern zzso zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso from adult mouse zzso indicated that heart and zzso expressed this gene (named zzso at relatively high levels, while lower levels of zzso were detected in a number of other zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in embryonic zzso and zzso cell lines, but not in zzso The zzso zzso to zzso DNA from several zzso species in Southern zzso analysis indicating zzso conservation of this zzso The interesting pattern of expression of the zzso gene during mouse brain development and the structure of its putative protein product indicate that this gene may play an important biological role in the development of mouse central nervous zzso
