We present zzso zzso of the 3' zzso region sequence of the human insulin zzso gene and identification of four functional zzso zzso responsible for zzso processing of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human insulin zzso zzso zzso The insulin zzso gene contains five putative zzso sites zzso located zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso base pairs zzso downstream from the zzso initiation zzso All putative zzso sites are flanked by upstream zzso rich and downstream zzso rich regions which regulate zzso stability and zzso zzso zzso Also, two zzso zzso structures have been zzso To determine its role on gene zzso a reporter gene was constructed containing various lengths of the insulin zzso 3' zzso and zzso zzso into zzso 7 zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream from the zzso zzso initiation zzso inhibited zzso expression by 5-6 zzso Further downstream addition of zzso zzso of the insulin zzso 3' untranslated region enhanced gene expression by zzso These studies provide evidence that the insulin zzso 3' untranslated region can zzso gene zzso
