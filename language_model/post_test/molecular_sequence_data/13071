We have expressed and characterized human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso By zzso analysis, zzso and zzso were shown to be localized predominantly in the particulate and soluble zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity equivalent to that of zzso The existence of zzso and zzso zzso was also confirmed in the particulate and zzso zzso of the cell zzso respectively, from the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso The ratio of zzso activity to zzso was similar for the two forms of the zzso The specific activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable to those of zzso from other zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso form from a zzso zzso the molecular mass of the zzso was approximately 54 zzso on zzso gel zzso without zzso The zzso activity of zzso significantly decreased on dialysis against buffer without zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso to the zzso readily increased in the zzso activity to the original zzso Taken together, these results suggest that human zzso functions as both zzso and zzso forms having equivalent zzso activity, which are localized in the particulate and soluble zzso respectively, and that the latter form exhibits its activity as a zzso zzso
