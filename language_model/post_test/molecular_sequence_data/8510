The zzso zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso is the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Previous studies have defined the role of zzso acid zzso 4 in binding to zzso zzso zzso at this zzso have generated peptides spanning a wide range of affinities for the zzso In the present study, we have tested the zzso of three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso by administering these to mice zzso in the absence of zzso zzso mice treated with the high affinity zzso zzso and zzso prior to zzso became less susceptible to zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso whereas those given the low affinity zzso zzso were only moderately zzso T cell zzso as assessed by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a direct correlation between the level of disease zzso and T cell zzso In treatment studies, zzso and zzso were also shown to be effective when given on the first day of disease zzso zzso of T cells, when measured by proliferation in zzso however, became more resistant to zzso when soluble peptides were administered close to the day of zzso zzso studies revealed that tolerance could be achieved in primed mice but that this takes time to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
