Mass spectral libraries are collections of mass zzso curated specifically to facilitate the identification of small zzso zzso and short zzso One of the most comprehensive zzso spectral libraries is curated by zzso and contains upward of half a million zzso zzso dominated by human and model organisms including budding zzso and zzso While motivated primarily by the technological goal of increasing sensitivity and specificity in spectral zzso we have found that the zzso spectral library constitutes a surprisingly rich source of biological zzso In this zzso we show that zzso of these published libraries while applying strict empirical thresholds yields many characteristics of protein zzso In particular, we demonstrate that the size and increasingly comprehensive nature of these libraries, generated from zzso zzso enables zzso from the presence but zzso also from the absence of zzso for individual zzso We illustrate implicit biological trends that lead to significant absence of zzso accounted for by complex zzso modifications and overlooked zzso zzso We conclude that many subtle biological signatures such as genetic zzso regulated zzso and zzso modifications are exposed through the systematic mining of spectral collections originally compiled as zzso zzso zzso
