Many viral fusion proteins are primed by zzso zzso near their fusion zzso While the coronavirus zzso spike zzso protein is known to be zzso at the zzso boundary, this zzso site is not closely linked to a fusion zzso However, a second zzso site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso zzso domain zzso Here, we investigated whether this internal zzso of zzso exposes a viral fusion zzso We show that the zzso immediately zzso to the zzso zzso zzso site zzso are very highly zzso across all zzso zzso studies of these zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso fusion and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a critical role for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in membrane zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso zzso had little or no effect on membrane zzso zzso analyses of synthetic peptides corresponding to the proposed zzso fusion zzso also showed an important role for this region in membrane fusion and indicated the presence of zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso within zzso exposes a novel internal fusion zzso for zzso zzso which may be zzso across the zzso
