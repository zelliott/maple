Two novel zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from hot springs in zzso and zzso counties of Yunnan province in zzso zzso The strains were zzso zzso occurring zzso or in zzso Growth of strain zzso was observed between 30 and 75 zzso zzso 50 zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso while the temperature range for strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso and the pH range was zzso zzso pH zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso the two strains were shown to be related most closely to zzso zzso The zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso major fatty acids zzso and zzso also supported the affiliation of strains zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strains zzso and zzso from zzso species with zzso published zzso zzso zzso and zzso therefore represent two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
