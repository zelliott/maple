A method for analyzing differences in the folding mechanisms of proteins in the same family is zzso Using only information from the zzso acid zzso contact maps derived from the zzso average distances are zzso These zzso referred to as average distance maps zzso are applied to the folding of zzso zzso The results reveal that the zzso of these zzso reflect the differences in the detailed folding zzso Further possible applications of the present method are also zzso
