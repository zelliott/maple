zzso sequences zzso the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso C beta 2 of the zzso zzso of bovine zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso and analyzed for promoter activity and zzso initiation zzso A region of zzso zzso upstream the translation zzso zzso was amplified from zzso DNA by zzso zzso chain zzso In primer extension reactions and zzso protection zzso zzso C (at position zzso T zzso and G zzso were found to serve as zzso initiation sites of the zzso zzso products and zzso zzso were zzso upstream of the reporter gene zzso zzso to test for promoter zzso zzso were zzso zzso into a Chinese zzso zzso cell line which was shown to express zzso C beta 2 zzso The zzso sequence upstream the C beta 2 zzso does have promoter zzso The region from position zzso to zzso proved sufficient to drive efficient zzso of the reporter zzso The promoter is AT rich zzso does not contain a zzso box within 50 zzso upstream of the first initiation site and possesses putative binding sites for several zzso factors such as zzso and a zzso zzso
