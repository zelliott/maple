zzso migration is a key process in development, zzso and zzso Nevertheless, the control over basic cellular mechanisms directing cells into zzso behavior zzso is largely zzso Here, we report on the identification of a minimal set of parameters the regulation of which zzso proper zzso and cell zzso zzso primordial germ cells rendered zzso by zzso of Dead end, a negative regulator of zzso function, were used as a platform for identifying processes restoring zzso We have defined zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso properties as factors whose proper regulation is sufficient for restoring cell migration of this cell zzso Tight control over the level of these cellular features, achieved through a balance between zzso function and the action of the zzso protein Dead end, effectively zzso zzso primordial germ cells into polarized cells that actively migrate relative to cells in their zzso
