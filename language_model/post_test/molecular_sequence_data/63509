We have isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso a new human zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has a novel zzso region of 85 zzso acids that differs from those of the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso zzso region has zzso substantially from the corresponding zzso in the rat and other zzso consistent with rapid evolutionary change in this region of the zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso localized predominantly in the zzso but zzso zzso of the zzso was associated with membrane zzso zzso zzso was exquisitely sensitive to zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with 1600 zzso for zzso but was less sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with 61 zzso for zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and brain, a pattern that differs from the tissue expression of other human zzso zzso and also from that of rat zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso could be detected in discrete regions of human brain, including the zzso spinal zzso and cerebral zzso The unique tissue distribution of zzso combined with the evolutionary divergence of its zzso suggest that this zzso may have a specific function in regulating zzso levels in human skeletal muscle and zzso
