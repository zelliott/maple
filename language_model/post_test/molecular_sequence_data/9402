Over 100 zzso zzso were isolated from oily sludge and zzso soil from zzso oil field in north zzso Sixteen of the bacterial zzso produced zzso and reduced the surface tension of the growth medium from 71 to zzso zzso zzso after 72 h of zzso These bacteria were used to treat oily sludge and the recovery efficiencies of oil from oily sludge were zzso The oil recovery efficiencies of different zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso isolate zzso was found to be the most efficient strain and the three zzso zzso water and zzso were separated automatically after the sludge was treated with the culture medium of zzso Based on zzso zzso characteristics and molecular zzso isolate zzso was identified as zzso zzso The zzso produced by isolate zzso was zzso and analyzed by high performance liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso There were four zzso zzso representing four different zzso A zzso
