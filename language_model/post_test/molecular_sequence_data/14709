zzso cooling and substantial zzso activity since the late zzso have had a pronounced influence on the evolutionary history of the zzso of New zzso South zzso However, many species have recently experienced dramatic range reductions due to habitat fragmentation and the introduction of zzso predators and zzso These anthropogenic impacts have been particularly severe in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso endemic to the region, is one of the most critically endangered zzso in New zzso We use zzso DNA sequence data to investigate the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso examine its population genetic structure, and assess the level of genetic diversity in the individuals in the captive breeding zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso from its closest relatives in the zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso of the Southern zzso However, there is evidence for past zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the northern zzso zzso zzso The remnant populations in eastern zzso and western zzso are estimated to have zzso in the zzso with no zzso shared between these two zzso This divergence accounts for zzso of the genetic diversity in the zzso Within both regions there is strong genetic structure among zzso although shared zzso are generally evident between adjacent zzso Although substantial genetic diversity is present in the captive population, all individuals originate from the eastern region and the majority had zzso that were not evident in the zzso managed populations at zzso zzso Our data indicate that eastern and western populations should continue to be regarded as separate management zzso zzso of the genetic diversity of the breeding stock will act to inform the captive management of the zzso zzso and contribute to a key recovery action for the zzso
