zzso for indexing zzso and for fast and zzso searching for structures similar to a query structure have important applications such as protein structure and function zzso protein zzso and drug zzso In this paper, we developed a new method for zzso the local feature zzso of protein zzso Each zzso is represented by a triangle, and the correlation between a set of zzso is described by the distances between zzso atoms and the angles between the zzso of planes in which the zzso zzso The zzso local feature zzso are zzso using a zzso zzso For all query zzso zzso trees can be used effectively to retrieve the zzso matches, which are then chained to obtain alignments with database zzso Similar proteins are selected by their alignment score against the zzso Our results shows zzso accuracy up to zzso and zzso at the zzso and class level according to the zzso zzso and shows that on average zzso out of 10 proteins from the same zzso are obtained among the top 10 zzso These results are competitive with the best previous zzso
