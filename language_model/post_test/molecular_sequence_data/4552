The zzso zzso complex zzso zzso has been shown to be required for the synthesis of precursor zzso an intermediate in the zzso zzso zzso The locus was isolated by zzso walking a physical distance of zzso pairs from the zzso gene and defines a single transcript that zzso most zzso a zzso protein with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affecting the zzso domain, zzso zzso in the zzso domain, and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso have greatly reduced levels of precursor Z compared with the wild zzso The zzso domain is similar at the zzso acid level to the zzso coli zzso gene product, while zzso is similar to the zzso coli zzso product, with both zzso coli products zzso by different zzso In the wild type, precursor Z levels are zzso times higher in zzso cells than in those grown on zzso and there is an approximately parallel increase in the zzso pair transcript following growth on zzso suggesting nitrate induction of this early section of the zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of several zzso has identified zzso critical for the function of the zzso In the zzso section of the zzso zzso of three zzso acid zzso into a domain thought to bind an zzso zzso leads to a zzso zzso as judged by complete loss of activity of the zzso nitrate zzso More specifically, a zzso has been characterized in which zzso replaces zzso 345, one of several zzso zzso probably involved in binding the zzso This supports the proposition that these zzso play an essential zzso zzso An zzso of seven zzso acids between zzso zzso 139 and zzso zzso leads to a zzso zzso suggesting a zzso change affecting the zzso activity of the zzso region zzso A single base pair deletion leading to an in frame stop zzso in the zzso region, which causes a zzso zzso effectively zzso the last 20 zzso acid zzso of the zzso indicating that these zzso are necessary for zzso zzso
