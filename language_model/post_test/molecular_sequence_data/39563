zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins zzso by a large gene family, divided on the basis of sequence identity into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso classes are present only in zzso zzso appear to be ubiquitous in plants and are involved in zzso zzso and stress response, but little is known about the precise role of zzso in normal plant physiology and during zzso and zzso stress zzso Two zzso representing the two plant classes zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso and the corresponding proteins were zzso Both zzso were able to zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso but they were inactive as zzso towards zzso zzso zzso showed activity towards zzso zzso zzso and an activity as zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was not active as zzso zzso and towards zzso zzso analysis was used to evaluate the expression of the two genes in response to treatment with zzso and zzso zzso low and high zzso Our results reveal that zzso is induced by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso and after exposure to low zzso In contrast, zzso seems not to be influenced by the treatments zzso
