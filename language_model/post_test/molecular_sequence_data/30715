zzso a molecular species of zzso which is a member of zzso zzso peptides of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso hormone activity, was zzso The A- and zzso of zzso containing four and two zzso zzso respectively, were first zzso separately by solid phase chemistry using zzso zzso Then they were coupled by zzso removal of two different protecting groups at the zzso zzso for zzso formation of zzso bridges to give zzso in zzso zzso The synthetic zzso was shown to have zzso and biological properties identical with those of natural zzso
