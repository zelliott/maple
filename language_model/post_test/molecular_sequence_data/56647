Media zzso by compound zzso rat mast cells generated zzso zzso zzso zzso when incubated at zzso pH with bovine serum zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The generation of zzso zzso zzso was time (after 3 h the concentration of zzso was 20 zzso temperature, and pH dependent and was prevented by omitting zzso by using media zzso by zzso mast cells, or by zzso of mast cells with zzso zzso an inhibitor of mast cell zzso The amount of zzso generated increased zzso with the number of mast cells zzso and varied directly with the concentration of zzso zzso After removal of the media from zzso mast cells, the remaining cell zzso retained its ability to generate zzso for up to 8 zzso zzso of mast cells by either zzso or substance zzso or of zzso cells by zzso serum, also produced zzso media that generated zzso The amount of zzso formed by various zzso media or by zzso cell zzso was dependent upon the concentration of zzso zzso Including the zzso zzso zzso prevented the formation of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed four zzso of zzso The major one zzso with synthetic zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso can be generated by zzso mast cells incubated in the presence of zzso They suggest that a zzso zzso zzso by the mast cell is able to cleave zzso to yield zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
