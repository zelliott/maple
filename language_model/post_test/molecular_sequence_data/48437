In this study we performed a systematic sequence analysis of 6 zzso genes zzso zzso I, zzso zzso II, zzso zzso III, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 66 zzso men suffering from zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso men zzso and fertile men zzso from zzso zzso A total of 72 zzso zzso in blood cells zzso DNA were zzso 63 of them were previously identified and reported in the human zzso DNA database ( zzso ) and 9 were zzso We also detected in 3 zzso patients a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso that was not found in any of zzso zzso and fertile zzso This zzso substituting the zzso at position 61 to zzso in a zzso zzso acid in the zzso functional domain of the zzso zzso a reduction of the zzso index (from zzso to zzso and a decrease of the protein zzso structures number (from 39 to zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso
