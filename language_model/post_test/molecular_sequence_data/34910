zzso bacteria zzso are the only biological sinks for methane zzso zzso of zzso is known to decrease overall zzso zzso but the effect on zzso is zzso The objective of this work was to characterize the zzso community and activity in two zzso different pristine zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso and their counterparts that were drained in zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso but zzso zzso receive additional water and nutrients only from zzso The sites were sampled in August 2003 down to 10 zzso below the water table zzso and zzso were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by gas zzso zzso to characterize zzso zzso The zzso community structure was characterized by zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and sequencing methods using partial zzso and zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso rates were measured from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso above zzso at the pristine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), but the rates decreased to almost zero in the vicinity of zzso In the pristine zzso zzso the highest zzso rate at zzso zzso was lower than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but in contrast to the zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed at zzso and 10 zzso below zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso rates to maximum values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso site, zzso From the total of 13 zzso zzso bands found in the study, 11, 3, 6, and 2 were observed in the pristine zzso and zzso and their drained counterparts, zzso According to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pattern, the zzso community of the pristine zzso differed from the other zzso The majority of partial zzso sequences belonged to type I zzso whereas the partial zzso bands that were observed only in the zzso sites formed a distinct group relating more to type II zzso This study indicates that zzso and zzso zzso differ in zzso activity and community structure, and both these factors are affected by zzso
