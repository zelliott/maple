zzso was shown to be a highly zzso gene which can be accurately typed for by sequencing zzso Most zzso zzso typing protocols described so far are based on analysis of sequence data of zzso 2 and zzso Nonetheless, zzso 1, 4 and 5 also contain zzso zzso which contribute to the zzso of the zzso zzso Ten zzso contain zzso positions in zzso 1, 4 and 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we describe a reliable zzso zzso typing strategy for sequencing zzso 1, 4 and 5, which is an extended protocol of our previous zzso zzso A panel of 16 individuals, carrying 27 different zzso was typed for zzso 1, 4 and 5 to check the newly designed zzso No zzso dropout or preferential amplification was noticed in these zzso The panel was also zzso in order to check the known zzso present in zzso 1, 4 and zzso For zzso 5 the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso with the published zzso In addition, zzso 1, 4 and 5 were zzso typing typed in 28, 17 and 59 individuals, zzso Two new zzso were detected which contain zzso positions outside zzso 2 and 3, zzso and zzso The unknown sequence data of zzso 1, 4 and 5 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The described high-resolution zzso typing protocol for sequencing zzso 1, 4 and 5 will be a valuable tool to study the zzso locus for zzso outside zzso 2 and 3 and for identification of the presently known zzso zzso with zzso positions in these zzso
