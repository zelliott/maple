zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a unique zzso in which zzso bacteria produce the zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso the host strictly requires zzso to zzso In this study, we show that the zzso bacteria possess a type III zzso system zzso which has a crucial role in the maintenance of the zzso zzso defective in type III zzso show reduced zzso survival and fail to elicit zzso of the zzso Furthermore, genes coding for zzso components are zzso during zzso of the bacterial zzso with their zzso This is the first report on a zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso represents a zzso of a zzso of yet zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso from plant zzso zzso In a control experiment, we demonstrate that under laboratory conditions, zzso production was not required for establishment of the symbiotic zzso
