zzso zzso zzso channels and is widely used in clinical practice to treat cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso for zzso are located on segments zzso zzso and the selectivity filter of the pore forming zzso zzso of zzso The aim of the present study was to clarify the location of the zzso binding site making use of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso currents through zzso channels were recorded using the patch clamp method in the whole cell zzso zzso was zzso and applied to the zzso side (via the patch zzso or to the zzso side of the membrane (by bath zzso 

zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso when applied to the zzso side of the membrane in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso at 300 zzso and induced only a low level of zzso zzso block (16 zzso zzso at 300 zzso when applied to the zzso side of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso that have previously been shown to reduce the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso also had reduced sensitivity to zzso applied zzso 

The data show that zzso block of in zzso by zzso occurs by interaction with a binding site accessible via a zzso route from the zzso side of the zzso
