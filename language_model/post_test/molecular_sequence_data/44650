zzso zzso is a component of the zzso system in zzso and plays key roles in both the assembly of a functional complex with zzso proteins and shuttling an electron from zzso to molecular zzso To determine the role of predicted zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso we zzso peptides corresponding to the regions and tested whether they affected zzso generation in the zzso system obtained from human zzso Among twelve peptides tested, six zzso four of which zzso to previously zzso regions, inhibited zzso generation in the zzso zzso All of the active peptides were effective when added to the system before zzso with sodium zzso zzso Four zzso including two peptides corresponding to two newly identified regions, inhibited the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The extent of zzso on zzso of these components varied depending on the zzso zzso
