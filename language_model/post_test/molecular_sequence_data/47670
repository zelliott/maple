Few data are available on population genetic structure in zzso species, and little of the available data allows direct comparison of the genetic structures of species having different life zzso Here we use zzso sequence data to describe the genetic structure of a zzso zzso and compare results to published data on other zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso Its life cycle and local ecology should result in small effective population sizes and restricted gene zzso As predicted, zzso zzso shows much lower zzso diversity within populations and over the species as a whole, and has a much more strongly subdivided population structure, than zzso of mobile zzso zzso From data such as these we can begin to zzso about the effects of life cycle variation on genetic structure in different zzso zzso
