Previous work indicates that one zzso of the zzso protein zzso binds to a DNA target zzso of 17 zzso We systematically zzso every zzso in a synthetic zzso target with the three possible alternatives and then tested binding of zzso and of these 51 DNA targets to zzso by quantitative gel shift analysis in the presence of zzso We found that every substitution of the zzso bases reduces zzso binding tenfold or more: zzso zzso zzso zzso at other bases have little or no zzso In the absence of zzso we observed a zzso reduction of binding of zzso to zzso We have designated the zzso zzso sequence the zzso and the zzso sequence the zzso We zzso DNA targets containing either two A or two zzso with the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso binds both targets in the presence of zzso in a gel zzso In the absence of zzso zzso binds only to the double zzso We then tested various zzso zzso proteins in the same zzso zzso and zzso bind to the double zzso but not to the double zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso binds to the double zzso but not to the double zzso in the presence of zzso but not in its zzso The implications of these results for the mechanism of zzso induction by zzso are zzso
