zzso zzso is an essential gene in zzso zzso best known for the zzso dominant zzso zzso and its effects on wing zzso Animals zzso or zzso for zzso are viable and exhibit loss of wing margin tissue and associated zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso when zzso to wild type, will also produce animals exhibiting loss of wing margin zzso However, animals zzso for zzso exhibit a zzso lethal zzso comparable to animals zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is a partial zzso of the zzso locus with a single zzso zzso region and two distinct 3' zzso zzso zzso between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that only one DNA zzso caused by the zzso of a zzso zzso element into the coding regions of the zzso transcript, appears capable of generating zzso zzso Due to the zzso zzso the protein product is predicted to be prematurely truncated and lack an zzso zzso region along with the zzso and zzso zzso found within the normal zzso zzso zzso The loss of these protein zzso apparently contributes to the zzso nature of this zzso
