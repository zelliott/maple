zzso often zzso zzso surfaces bathed in zzso fatty acids zzso Resistance of zzso to zzso and other zzso zzso agents has been attributed to the zzso zzso pump system and a zzso undefined zzso This alternative resistance mechanism has been suggested to mediate zzso resistance to zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso We have now identified this alternative zzso resistance system in zzso and report that it bears significant similarity to the zzso zzso pump possessed by zzso coli and the zzso pump of zzso zzso We termed the zzso version of this zzso pump zzso zzso acid zzso to signify its involvement in zzso resistance expressed by zzso and to distinguish it from the zzso or zzso pumps that zzso bacterial zzso to zzso agents and certain zzso Although the zzso system in zzso was found to provide resistance to zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso its function was dependent on the zzso outer membrane zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso linked zzso and zzso genes was positively associated with the presence of the zzso zzso regulatory protein that normally zzso the expression of zzso Thus, the data presented zzso suggest that, while the zzso and zzso systems act independently to mediate resistance of zzso to zzso zzso zzso agents, their capacity to export these agents is dependent on the same outer membrane protein zzso and their expression may be zzso controlled by the same zzso regulatory protein zzso
