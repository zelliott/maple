All zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Edwards, zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine the importance of these zzso in zzso the zzso zzso or zzso in zzso I and II of rat zzso zzso zzso were individually zzso to zzso or zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1981) zzso 20, zzso was zzso to zzso Each zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to apparent zzso zzso kinetic analyses of the wild type and zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a decreased zzso of approximately zzso compared to wild zzso However, no significant change in the zzso values for either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results strongly suggest that these zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso are involved in either the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso zzso and/or the release of the zzso zzso product from zzso zzso zzso The conservation of these zzso acid zzso in different zzso from several species suggests that these zzso play a similar role in other zzso zzso
