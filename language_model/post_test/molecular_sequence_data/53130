A balanced zzso zzso zzso with schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso is the zzso event and that it directly zzso gene zzso We previously reported a dearth of genes in the zzso region of zzso 11 and it is therefore unlikely that the expression of any genes on this zzso has been affected by the zzso By contrast, the corresponding region on zzso 1 is gene dense and, not one, but two novel genes are directly disrupted by the zzso These genes have been zzso named zzso 1 and 2 ( zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes a large protein with no significant sequence zzso to other known zzso It is predicted to consist of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain which has the potential to form a zzso by interaction with another, as yet, unidentified zzso Similar structures are thought to be present in a variety of unrelated proteins that are known to function in the nervous zzso The putative structure of the protein zzso by zzso is therefore compatible with a role in the nervous zzso zzso apparently specifies a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso an arrangement that has been observed at other zzso where it is thought that the zzso zzso is involved in regulating expression of the sense zzso Altogether, these observations indicate that zzso and zzso should be considered formal candidate genes for zzso to psychiatric zzso
