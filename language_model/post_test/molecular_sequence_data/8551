The zzso method for zzso zzso zzso the zzso of targets in zzso zzso We have encountered difficulties using the original method for the zzso of DNA cloned into zzso zzso which is possibly due to the presence of regions of secondary structure that cannot be efficiently copied by the zzso zzso We report a modification of the zzso method using the zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowing an increase in reaction zzso The modified method is functional with the zzso family of zzso
