zzso can be used to identify zzso and zzso expressed zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library screened for zzso zzso in the adult nervous system of zzso zzso was found to selectively bind to all zzso regions and to synaptic zzso of motor zzso In Western blots of zzso brains the zzso recognizes two proteins of 32 and 34 zzso Using this zzso we have isolated seven zzso clones that derive from two zzso zzso zzso zzso of a gene located at zzso on zzso zzso The two zzso code for two zzso proteins of zzso and 223 zzso zzso respectively, which are identical except for their zzso and a central deletion of 21 zzso acids in the second zzso Both contain a zzso string of 11 zzso zzso In zzso zzso to frozen head sections detects expression of this gene in zzso and zzso zzso The 32 and 34 zzso brain proteins that presumably are localized predominantly in synaptic terminals of zzso and most if not all zzso may zzso to two zzso zzso proteins as they are of similar molecular weight and share an zzso binding site for zzso zzso
