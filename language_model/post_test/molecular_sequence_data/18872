zzso zzso is a zzso protein modification that is zzso in all zzso of zzso The initial transfer of a zzso zzso zzso onto zzso zzso is zzso by the integral membrane protein zzso zzso The previously reported structure of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso revealed a partially zzso external loop zzso whose role in zzso was zzso We identified a new and functionally important sequence motif in zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose aromatic side chain is essential for zzso A synthetic zzso containing the zzso motif can partially but specifically rescue in zzso activity of zzso zzso lacking zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that disengagement of the structurally ordered part of zzso is an essential step of the zzso reaction, probably by allowing zzso binding or zzso zzso Our findings define two distinct zzso roles of zzso in zzso zzso These functions, exerted by the two halves of zzso are independent, because the loop can be zzso by specific zzso with only slight reduction in zzso
