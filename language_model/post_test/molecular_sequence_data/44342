zzso zzso of sulfur zzso acid metabolism in zzso is dependent on a zzso factor, the zzso factor 1 zzso and on two specific zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso belongs to the basic zzso zzso protein family while zzso and zzso are two basic zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that in cell zzso the three factors are found in a high molecular weight zzso By using mobility shift zzso we report here that the in zzso zzso of the zzso complex on zzso can be obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso I protection experiments confirm that the zzso complex is formed over the zzso zzso The experiments also show that both zzso and zzso bind to DNA only in the presence of zzso Moreover, zzso is shown to enhance the zzso activity of zzso Analysis of zzso gene regulation reveals that its expression requires zzso Thus the zzso activity of zzso allows the establishment of a positive regulatory zzso The results thus provide evidence of a new functional relationship between zzso and zzso proteins and demonstrate that the association of such factors may serve to discriminate between the different zzso sequences found in the zzso
