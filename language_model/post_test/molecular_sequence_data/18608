Recently, Tomato spotted zzso virus zzso zzso protein zzso has been identified zzso as an zzso zzso zzso for Tomato spotted zzso zzso zzso The observation that zzso from two natural zzso zzso had lost zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso suggested a link between the two zzso To test this, a large set of zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso strains zzso ), zzso acid zzso in zzso from zzso strains zzso domain deletions and zzso Testing these zzso for their ability to suppress green fluorescent protein zzso zzso and to trigger a zzso hypersensitive response zzso revealed that the two functions can be zzso Changes in the zzso domain were found to be zzso for both activities and indicated the importance of this domain, additionally supported by domain swapping between zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the closely related zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso functionality could not simply be transferred between zzso Although deletion of the zzso domain rendered zzso completely zzso only a few zzso zzso in the zzso affected both zzso zzso of a zzso motif zzso zzso rendered zzso completely dysfunctional for zzso and zzso activity, and indicated a putative interaction between zzso and zzso 1 zzso and its importance in zzso zzso and viral counter zzso against zzso zzso
