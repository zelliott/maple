Mouse zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hybrid of zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso sequences zzso The zzso zzso zzso insert of zzso clone zzso consists of the zzso sequence zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso regions, and zzso tail (19 zzso while zzso clone zzso contains a partial zzso zzso zzso insert from zzso zzso 55 to the zzso zzso Seven silent zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 285 and zzso as well as a single zzso change in the 3' zzso region, were found between these different strains of zzso The predicted sequence of zzso zzso zzso excluding initiation zzso was confirmed by sequencing and/or compositional analyses of a total of 103 zzso zzso acids from zzso peptides of mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the mouse coding region for zzso zzso B shows zzso identity with that of the human zzso and only eight of the 139 zzso differences resulted in zzso acid zzso at zzso 10, 13, 14, 17, 52, zzso 236 and zzso The rates of zzso zzso at synonymous and zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso The rates of synonymous zzso for zzso zzso genes A zzso and B (heart) are considerably higher than the average rate zzso from human and zzso zzso The rates of zzso zzso for zzso zzso genes A zzso and B zzso particularly the latter, are highly zzso The rates of synonymous and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso gene are about the same as the average rates for zzso zzso A zzso tree of zzso zzso zzso protein sequences is zzso In agreement with the previous results, this analysis further indicates that zzso zzso gene zzso off earlier than did zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
