Chemical zzso with zzso oxygen species generated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a method to map the structure of zzso equilibrium protein folding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Fox, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso The chemical structure of protein zzso products and the mechanism of backbone zzso for this class of zzso have been zzso Here, we report the nature of zzso backbone zzso of a small model zzso The zzso zzso was attached to a partially zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso through a mixed zzso zzso zzso was initiated by addition of the iron zzso zzso Chemical analysis of the novel zzso products revealed an zzso zzso zzso probably initiated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique appears to be suitable for the analysis of zzso protein states such as the molten zzso
