This paper describes genetic zzso of zzso found in blood samples from 31 zzso people who visited the Counseling and Testing AIDS Center of zzso de zzso Tropical in zzso zzso zzso the main city in Brazil's Amazon Basin, is also the closest urban connection for more than 100,000 Indians living in the rain forests of this zzso Although to date there is no evidence of increased zzso of zzso infection among the indigenous population, our understanding of both the prevalence and nature of the epidemic in the region as a whole is zzso From the 31 samples analyzed by zzso sequencing, we found almost equal proportions of zzso strains belonging to zzso B zzso zzso 16; zzso and zzso F zzso zzso 15; zzso a finding that differs from results from previous studies conducted in urban areas of zzso zzso We also observed the presence of the zzso zzso sequence in the critical zzso crown of the zzso zzso loop in the zzso zzso B samples zzso Among these samples, we also found 14 mosaic zzso zzso in which different combinations of zzso B, C, and F were identified between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso infections linked to the urban epidemic in zzso zzso The genetic diversity and the prevalence of mosaic zzso among the zzso in our study confirm an integral role of zzso in the complex Brazilian zzso
