zzso shifts are essential for the development of persistent zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso occurring sequence variations in the zzso zzso region zzso of the virus could lead to changes in protein expression levels, reflecting selective forces on the zzso The extreme zzso end of the zzso zzso containing signals essential for zzso is followed by an internal zzso entry site zzso essential for protein translation as well as zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso and has a complex zzso secondary structure consisting of several zzso This report analyses the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso clinical isolate and found a number of sequences differing from the consensus zzso The consensus zzso as well as a major zzso located in zzso zzso of the zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso molecules in human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to disrupt the stem structure, showed slightly lower translation efficiency but was severely impaired in the colony formation of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, during selection of colonies supporting autonomous zzso zzso emerged that restored the base pairing in the zzso zzso of these altered zzso confirmed that these second site zzso were more efficient in colony zzso In conclusion, naturally occurring zzso in the zzso zzso zzso can lead to changes in their replication zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso evolution was observed in zzso under the selective pressure of the zzso zzso
