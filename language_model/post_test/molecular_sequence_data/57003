A variety of zzso and zzso clones for the zzso of mouse muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso The zzso gene for zzso M zzso exhibits multiple zzso start sites that are identical in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and zzso The gene is composed of 10 zzso and includes a zzso zzso located in the zzso untranslated zzso Two zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso are produced from zzso in zzso and zzso zzso these transcripts are zzso throughout the coding region and differ only in the length of the 3' untranslated zzso We have mapped the zzso site of the zzso zzso to the middle of zzso 10; the zzso zzso zzso further 3' at the end of a mouse B2 zzso In zzso mice an additional B2 zzso and related zzso zzso alter the sequence of zzso zzso 10 and are accompanied by an increase in the quantity of the zzso transcript and a decrease in the abundance and size of the longer transcript, from zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso for sequences contained in zzso 10 reveals that the zzso 3' gene structure is shared by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene structure is shared by zzso zzso zzso zzso and several strains of laboratory zzso These results suggest that zzso in zzso mice was derived from zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of the other examined laboratory strains was derived from zzso zzso
