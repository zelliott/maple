The combined use of molecular and structural biology techniques has proved very efficient in zzso zzso relationships in zzso zzso Our present understanding of this family of zzso is based on two main unifying zzso zzso division into two different classes, corresponding to two different modes of zzso binding and attachment of the activated zzso acid to the last zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso by two different zzso mechanisms and two structural zzso with completely different zzso and zzso the modular organization into separate and additional zzso that we are just beginning to zzso zzso analysis zzso very nicely existing zzso zzso and genetic results and makes them more general, leading to verifiable zzso
