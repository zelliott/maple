zzso of the zzso group plasmids is zzso regulated by the interaction between zzso primer zzso II and zzso zzso zzso The binding is dependent on alternative zzso II zzso formed during the transcription, and effectively zzso the primer function within some time zzso In this paper, the folding pathways for the wild type and copy number zzso of zzso zzso II are studied using simulations by a genetic zzso The simulated pathways reveal a transient formation of a zzso structure, which is stabilized by copy number zzso The folding zzso of the proposed zzso transitions is calculated using a model of a zzso zzso process with elementary steps of zzso stem formation or zzso The approximation shows that the lifetime of the zzso structure is relatively long and is considerably increased in the zzso resulting in a delay of the formation of the stable zzso II structure, which is the most sensitive to the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Thus the effect of copy number zzso can be interpreted as a zzso of the time window of effective zzso due to an increased time spent by the zzso II in the zzso zzso The implications of zzso zzso in zzso functioning are zzso
