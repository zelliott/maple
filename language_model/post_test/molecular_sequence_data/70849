We cloned the zzso sequences that zzso to a previously described group 1 late zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene had structural and zzso features that depart from those of other group 1 Lea zzso An zzso was present at a zzso position but showed a much larger size zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter was strictly zzso and it originated from at least two close initiation zzso The zzso accumulated from stages of zzso that preceded seed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was moderately zzso by zzso zzso acid treatments, in immature seeds but not induced in zzso We observed unprecedented changes in Lea zzso zzso associated with seed zzso the homogeneous tissue distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was characteristic of immature zzso evolved later in zzso to an zzso distribution within the zzso with preferential zzso zzso in the cells of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also showed that, in sunflower zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoter could be zzso activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the significance of these results regarding hypotheses of regulation and function of plant genes from the same zzso
