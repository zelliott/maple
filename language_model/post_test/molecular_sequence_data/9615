Using zzso fluorescent zzso we studied the effects of zzso zzso membrane active peptides of the A- and zzso on membrane domain zzso In zzso zzso systems composed of zzso of zzso and zzso both types of peptides associated with the fluid zzso While binding with high affinity to fluid zzso peptides were unable to penetrate into the zzso membrane in the gel zzso If trapped zzso by cooling from the fluid phase, peptides zzso from the gel membrane on the time scale of several zzso While the geometrical shape of the zzso peptides determines their interactions with zzso with zzso phase zzso the shape zzso mechanism by itself is unable to induce lateral phase separation in a fluid zzso zzso interactions are capable of inducing lateral domain formation in fluid zzso Both peptides had affinity for zzso lipids which resulted in about zzso enrichment of zzso lipids within several zzso of the zzso zzso but there was no long-range order in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in fluid zzso zzso was accompanied by only a small increase in zzso surface and a decrease in polarity in the membrane zzso zzso zzso interactions were also capable of modulating existing domain composition in the course of the main phase transition in zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso
