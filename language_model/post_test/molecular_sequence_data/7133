zzso zzso an integral membrane protein of small synaptic zzso is specifically zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso B, D, zzso and G is thought to play an important role in the zzso and/or fusion of synaptic zzso with the zzso zzso Potential zzso sites for various zzso are present in zzso zzso We have studied whether zzso is a zzso for protein zzso that are present in nerve terminals and known to zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso can be zzso within the same zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso associated with synaptic zzso This zzso reaction occurs rapidly and involves zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso to zzso a zzso zzso II zzso activity zzso with synaptic zzso is able to zzso zzso selectively on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso reaction is markedly zzso by zzso a zzso known to activate zzso and to inhibit zzso and protein zzso zzso The results show that zzso is a potential zzso for protein zzso involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and open the possibility that zzso of zzso plays a role in modulating the molecular interactions between synaptic zzso and the zzso zzso
