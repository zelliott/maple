We have determined the DNA sequence of the unique long zzso region and the repeat long zzso region in the zzso of zzso 1 zzso strain of zzso disease virus zzso a member of the zzso zzso With this information, the complete zzso sequence of zzso is now zzso The entire zzso zzso is predicted to be about 174 zzso in size, with an organization of zzso typical of a zzso The zzso sequence contains zzso zzso and has a base composition of zzso G + zzso A total of 67 zzso were identified completely within the zzso region, among which 55 are zzso to genes zzso by zzso zzso zzso Twelve of them are unique with presently unknown zzso The sequence of zzso reported here together with those published earlier reveal the major structural features of the zzso Virtually all of the zzso zzso by zzso are specific to zzso I of zzso These zzso are likely to contribute to some of the unique biological properties of zzso Among the proteins zzso by zzso zzso are zzso a zzso family of zzso factor implicated in transformation and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso and zzso two zzso with undefined zzso There is also a putative zzso gene zzso that has zzso in zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso and in various avian zzso An additional unique feature of zzso is the presence of long terminal repeat remnant sequences of avian zzso zzso zzso These remnant sequences are derived from the zzso region through ancestral insertions by zzso virus zzso
