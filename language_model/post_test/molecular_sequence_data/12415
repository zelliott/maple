We developed a system based on zzso zzso that allows a precise comparison of zzso zzso under zzso zzso In addition, the influences of two different, naturally occurring promoters were examined for each zzso zzso The system comprised two separately cloned DNA fragments, each the size of zzso zzso Both fragments zzso an zzso gene originating from clinical zzso but with different zzso The structural genes were made identical by zzso zzso Other zzso were then introduced into both fragments by means of zzso zzso resulting in the zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid exchange of zzso acid at position 235 for zzso in zzso resulted in the highest resistance zzso zzso differing from zzso by the exchange of zzso at position 201 for zzso and previously described as indistinguishable from zzso was shown to cause slightly higher resistance to zzso and lower resistance to zzso zzso and zzso than zzso The point zzso in zzso with the zzso replacement at the unusual position 31, previously considered almost zzso proved to increase resistance to zzso but reduced the zzso of all other zzso tested when compared with those for zzso For all clones harboring zzso zzso resistance was increased by a stronger promoter, in some cases masking the effect of the point zzso itself and demonstrating the importance of regulatory mechanisms of zzso
