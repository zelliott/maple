To study the processing of putative zzso precursors the expression of specific zzso transcripts derived from a full-length zzso clone of zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso was examined in a rabbit zzso zzso zzso This study revealed that the zzso protein produced by a zzso zzso that lacks the zzso coding region was efficiently processed by mainly zzso zzso at three different sites into three sets of proteins of zzso + zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso Further zzso of the zzso protein into zzso and zzso has not been observed in this in zzso zzso The zzso protein can be further processed by an zzso zzso reaction via two alternative zzso either into zzso zzso + zzso and zzso proteins or into zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be released from the zzso zzso + zzso precursor either directly or via the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein is present in zzso plant cells indicating that the in zzso observations may hold true in zzso
