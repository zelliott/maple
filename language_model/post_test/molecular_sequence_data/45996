zzso of protein zzso zzso 16 zzso inclusion during zzso represents a zzso important zzso switch that increases zzso affinity for zzso and zzso Previous studies showed that negative regulation of zzso zzso is zzso by the binding of zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso proteins to zzso elements in the zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso proteins in zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso This article demonstrates that positive regulation of zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso or zzso two closely related zzso factors that possess identical zzso recognition zzso zzso experiments with human zzso revealed highly selective binding to the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were able to bind the zzso zzso elements in the zzso zzso downstream of zzso and both could activate zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso achieved with two different zzso sequences resulted in decreased zzso zzso Moreover, zzso experiments demonstrate mouse zzso express zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso Recent experiments show that zzso is present in the zzso zzso sequence of many zzso alternative zzso and we propose that the Fox family of zzso enhancers plays an important role in alternative zzso switches during differentiation in zzso zzso
