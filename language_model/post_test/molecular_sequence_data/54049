The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso is characterized by two distinctive zzso features: there are seven large zzso tandem repeats in the control region, and the sequence for the putative origin of replication of the L strand can potentially fold into two alternative secondary structures (one including part of the zzso The new sequence data were used to assess the zzso position of zzso and to gain insights into the origin of living zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of two data zzso combining zzso genes and the other combining zzso zzso supported a zzso + zzso zzso and, zzso zzso of modern zzso These two data sets could not further resolve relationships among the zzso zzso and zzso but strongly supported zzso affinities of zzso zzso relationships among a larger set of species of zzso zzso and zzso were estimated with a zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso analysis of this latter data set also recovered zzso of living zzso and favored a zzso + zzso zzso zzso However, zzso support was only moderate at these zzso This is likely due to an extensive zzso rate zzso in the zzso data set and the narrow window of time in which the three main groups of living zzso were zzso
