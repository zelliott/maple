zzso fatty zzso proteins zzso are small and highly zzso zzso proteins that bind zzso fatty acids and other zzso zzso We have zzso as a model for studying zzso zzso cell zzso the zzso and zzso expression of zzso fatty zzso protein zzso gene during zzso zzso zzso After molecular cloning of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in the zzso tube around day 3 zzso By day 4, highest level of zzso transcript is encountered in the zzso zzso zzso From day 5 zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the anterior zzso and its zzso expansion, slightly expressed in the esophagus zzso and zzso while no zzso could be detected in the zzso zzso zzso the regional differentiation of the zzso precedes first feeding and complete zzso zzso zzso expression in the anterior zzso of the fed larvae is correlated with an zzso storage of zzso droplets in the zzso and the massive synthesis of very zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso early during zzso gut zzso the anterior fat absorbing to zzso cells of the zzso This gene could be used as a marker for screening for zzso that affect the events of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gut looping zzso
