Using a combination of two-dimensional gel zzso zzso protein mapping and mass zzso zzso analysis, we have established zzso reference maps of zzso zzso zzso tissue culture zzso The cultures were generated from single zzso which provided a relatively homogeneous cell zzso We used these to analyze protein expression at the zzso stages of zzso zzso which is the earliest zzso embryonic zzso Over zzso proteins could zzso be resolved over a zzso range of zzso Three hundred and twelve protein spots were extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso gels and analyzed by zzso laser zzso of flight zzso analysis and tandem zzso zzso This enabled the identification of 169 protein spots representing 128 unique gene products using a publicly available expressed sequence tag database and the MASCOT search zzso These reference maps will be valuable for the investigation of the molecular events which occur during zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso reference maps and supplementary materials will be available and updated for public access at zzso
