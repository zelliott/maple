zzso zzso are involved in regulating chain termination of fatty acid zzso in plant zzso Previously, zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso seed tissue has been shown to have a high preference for zzso zzso Here, zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso protein sequence data have been used to isolate two zzso zzso clones from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively and differ in the length of their 3' zzso zzso Both zzso contain open reading frames of zzso zzso acids which zzso for 42 zzso zzso zzso rape zzso has an apparent molecular weight of 38 zzso on zzso and these zzso therefore zzso for precursor forms of the zzso This latter finding is consistent with the expected zzso location of fatty acid zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows zzso zzso size to be zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso genes to be highly expressed in seed tissue zzso with the most active phase of storage zzso zzso There is some sequence zzso between the two zzso zzso but overall they are highly zzso sharing zzso identity at the DNA level and zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso Some sequence zzso was also observed between the deduced and directly determined zzso protein zzso zzso with the observed sequence zzso was Southern zzso data showing zzso zzso zzso to be zzso by a small zzso zzso
