zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso indigenous to Thailand was zzso to apparent zzso by three steps of column zzso using Resource zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Its molecular mass was determined to be 35 zzso and the zzso to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso cloned into zzso was zzso in zzso coli as zzso fusion zzso The zzso MPH was zzso to zzso by a single step, using zzso zzso affinity column, with the molecular mass identical to that of the native zzso The zzso zzso had the specific activity of about zzso unit zzso protein and the yield of about zzso a zzso increase in recovery compared to that of the native zzso The optimal temperature and pH were zzso and zzso zzso The MPH was stable, with its activity unchanged for 48 h at zzso and reduced to 50% after 5 h and to zzso after 48 h at zzso The zzso activity remained zzso after zzso h at pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the concentration of 1 zzso enhanced the zzso while sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso The zzso also showed cross zzso with other zzso within the zzso group, and the kinetic parameters for individual zzso were zzso Since MPH from zzso zzso has wide potential applications in zzso and detection of zzso compounds, this study provides important basis for its future zzso
