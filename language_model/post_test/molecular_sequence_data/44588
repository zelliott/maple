The zzso genes are predicted to zzso an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso necessary for zzso export for zzso in bacterial zzso c zzso The recent discoveries of zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in plant zzso zzso suggest this is a highly zzso zzso in zzso and some zzso with the zzso and zzso proteins zzso the zzso zzso zzso genetic analysis in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to show that the zzso and zzso genes are part of an zzso linked to the zzso zzso To facilitate analysis of this zzso strains with zzso deletions in each zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific to the zzso and zzso proteins were zzso We directly demonstrate that this zzso is present in the zzso membrane as an zzso zzso The zzso and zzso but not zzso proteins are necessary for the binding and stability of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso In addition we show that the zzso protein zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso export complex is distinguished by the presence of four zzso zzso and represents a unique zzso of ABC zzso
