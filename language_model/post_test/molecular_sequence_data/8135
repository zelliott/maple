Chicken B cell development takes place in a separate organ, the zzso of zzso which provides the zzso stem cells, a zzso specialized for B cell zzso zzso chicken can be used as a model to study specifically the molecules and interactions which control the development of the B cell zzso In this work, we studied zzso zzso and function of beta 1 zzso on maturing B cells and zzso zzso The expression of beta 1 zzso on B cells increases during the embryonic development and beta 1 zzso cells can be found both in the zzso and the zzso throughout the zzso zzso The binding zzso show that the attachment of B cells to zzso is zzso by beta 1 zzso zzso to zzso embryonic zzso is zzso whereas zzso binding takes place in an increasing manner during further embryonic zzso After zzso zzso appears to be the main binding site for B zzso However, the zzso of beta 1 zzso which takes part in the zzso of B cells to zzso and to zzso is not crucial for the zzso of cells into the zzso in a cell transfer zzso Our results indicate that the interaction of beta 1 zzso with their zzso is zzso regulated in the zzso and suggest that B cell maturation may be partially controlled by this zzso
