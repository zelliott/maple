From bacteria to zzso zzso that generate premature termination zzso have been shown to result in the reduction in the abundance of the corresponding zzso In zzso cells, more often than not, the reduction happens while the zzso is still associated with the zzso Here, it is reported that zzso in the alcohol zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso that generate premature termination zzso lead to reduced levels of zzso and nuclear zzso zzso it has been found that the zzso tails of zzso zzso and zzso that carry a premature termination zzso are longer than in the zzso zzso The more zzso terminal the zzso is, the longer is the zzso tail of the zzso These findings suggest that the integrity of the coding region may be required for accurate zzso 3' end zzso
