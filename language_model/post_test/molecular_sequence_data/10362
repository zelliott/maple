zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of two identical 60 zzso zzso each of which contains one c and one zzso zzso zzso This zzso a soluble component of the zzso chain that uses nitrate as a source of energy, can be induced by the addition of nitrate to the bacterial growth zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso zzso to zzso oxide zzso in zzso both zzso zzso and zzso are efficient electron donors in this zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso which controls the rate of the production of toxic zzso oxide zzso and ultimately regulates the release of NO into the zzso 

The structure of the zzso form zzso of oxidized zzso was solved at zzso A resolution, using molecular replacement with the coordinates of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso as the starting zzso Although the zzso zzso are almost identical in both zzso structures, the c domain of zzso is more like the classical class I zzso fold because it has zzso and zzso as zzso zzso instead of zzso and zzso present in zzso In addition, the zzso loop, which was displaced by zzso of the zzso zzso segment, is back to normal in our zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have little sequence zzso In zzso this zzso segment of one zzso crosses the zzso interface and wraps itself around the other zzso zzso of this segment is hydrogen bonded to an hydroxide zzso sixth zzso of the zzso Fe, whereas the equivalent zzso in zzso zzso is directly bound to the zzso 

Two zzso of zzso c and zzso differ between the two known zzso structures, which accounts for the fact that they have quite different zzso and kinetic zzso The unexpected zzso by the zzso segment of zzso is comparable to that of zzso zzso or zzso zzso previously observed in other systems and may explain the observed zzso between zzso of zzso zzso In spite of having similar sequence and fold, the different kinetic zzso and the spectral features of zzso and zzso are tuned by the zzso stretch of zzso A further example of this may come from another zzso from zzso zzso which has an N zzso very different from that of the two above mentioned zzso
