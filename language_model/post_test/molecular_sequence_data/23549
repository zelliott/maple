During infection, bacterial pathogens zzso a type III zzso system to inject zzso into the zzso of a target cell where they disrupt the defense system of the host zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of zzso endemic in Southeast Asia, has a type III zzso system that encodes a novel member of the zzso protein zzso family, zzso zzso outer protein zzso Our studies revealed that zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso activity that is extremely potent and requires an intact zzso site to abrogate signaling pathways in a manner distinct from that of other zzso zzso We observed that zzso efficiently zzso the zzso signaling pathways but not the zzso zzso in zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso a growth arrest zzso and also blocks zzso zzso signaling zzso Our observations provide insight into the immense diversity of targets zzso by zzso zzso to manipulate zzso signaling zzso that are important for the response and survival of the host cell during infection and/or zzso
