To identify and analyze zzso sequences for zzso we have developed an in zzso system expressing short peptides as zzso zzso fusion proteins in the zzso host zzso zzso Using this approach, we show that a short zzso motif zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient as a signal for zzso even when fused to a zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso protein sequencing showed that the modification is a single zzso attached to zzso zzso This was further confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both this zzso and authentic zzso presents the zzso zzso zzso identified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in this zzso also yields a zzso fusion protein which is modified with single zzso zzso but not all of the zzso are zzso
