This is the first report of the structural studies of a novel zzso protein zzso obtained from the Himalayan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a type II zzso protein consisting of a toxic zzso zzso with an active site for zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with well defined zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution and refined to a zzso R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison of this structure with other type II zzso reveals the presence of distinct structural features in the active site of the zzso and in the zzso zzso site of the zzso The zzso of the side chain of zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso in the A zzso is zzso different from those observed in other zzso zzso indicating its unique zzso zzso The deletion of two important zzso from the zzso region after zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso results in a significantly different zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso site has also been identified in zzso The site is a shallow zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ from those observed in other type II zzso resulting in the distinct zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso
