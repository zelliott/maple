The complete zzso sequence of the zzso large zzso region was determined for two related zzso plants, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the large zzso of both plants, there were one or several tandem zzso of repeated sequences which account well for the length zzso of the zzso repeating zzso When the entire lengths of zzso and zzso zzso large zzso were zzso significant sequence similarity ranging from approximately 50 to zzso was observed, thus a close zzso relationship was zzso However, organization patterns of these zzso zzso were clearly different from each zzso The zzso zzso large zzso contained only one type of repeated sequence of about 175 zzso whereas the zzso contained five kinds of repeated zzso In addition, the initiation site for zzso was tentatively determined by zzso protection zzso
