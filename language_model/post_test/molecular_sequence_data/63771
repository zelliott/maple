We report that the zzso gene family of human zzso zzso zzso genes is likely to be in an early stage of its zzso Members of this gene family are zzso arranged on the X zzso only in human, zzso and zzso zzso and share a very high zzso zzso trees show that the zzso gene family began to duplicate after the split of human and zzso The estimated ages of the zzso events range from 4 million years ago to the zzso The zzso values between the zzso are significantly greater than 1, indicating that the zzso rate is higher in coding regions than zzso regions of the zzso which suggests that the zzso gene family is under positive zzso These findings indicate that the zzso gene family may be a newly formed gene family undergoing rapid functional zzso
