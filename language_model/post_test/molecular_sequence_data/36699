Nearly two decades ago, it was observed that cells infected with zzso zzso virus zzso acquired an zzso zzso binding zzso The properties of the viral zzso zzso zzso have now been characterized by several zzso The zzso binding activity appears on the surface of the infected cell prior to formation of progeny zzso The zzso induced by zzso has been identified as the zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso forms a complex with a second zzso zzso zzso the zzso binds zzso with higher zzso zzso virus zzso which is closely related to zzso has also been shown to induce an zzso Like the zzso zzso the zzso specified by zzso possesses characteristics common to viral zzso zzso encodes two zzso zzso and zzso which are the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso have many properties common to cell surface zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, extensive zzso analyses of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso did not uncover regions of zzso to the human cellular zzso receptors for zzso
