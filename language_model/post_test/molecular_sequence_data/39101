zzso are traditionally classified as either zzso or zzso on the basis of their respective zzso activities on zzso zzso which is generally zzso more efficiently only by the zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso II structure, it was proposed that the zzso tunnel of zzso permitted the zzso zzso of zzso whereas the corresponding zzso would display open zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Knowles and Jones zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso family 6 contains both zzso and zzso The structure of the zzso core of the family 6 zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been solved by molecular replacement with the known zzso zzso zzso II as the search zzso zzso at the sequence level, this zzso exhibits the highest sequence similarity to family 6 zzso and displays just one of the loop deletions traditionally associated with zzso in this zzso However, this zzso shows no activity on zzso zzso but a high activity on soluble zzso which is typical of an zzso The three-dimensional structure reveals that the deletion of just a single loop of the active site, coupled with the zzso zzso change in a second zzso loop, zzso open the zzso tunnel to reveal a zzso zzso
