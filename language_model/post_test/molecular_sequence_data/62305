The development of airways zzso in allergic zzso mice is controversial and appears to correlate with the number of times that the original 129 zzso zzso founder strain has been crossed to the zzso zzso In this investigation, we compared allergic responses in founder zzso mice crossed for either 5 zzso or 10 zzso generations to zzso zzso Whereas allergic zzso zzso mice developed airways zzso tissue zzso elevated zzso and pulmonary expression of zzso zzso these processes were attenuated in zzso zzso mice treated with an zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso These data showed that zzso was more effective in regulating allergic responses in zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism associated with these zzso we show by restriction and sequence analysis that zzso zzso mice express the zzso form of zzso and zzso zzso mice express the zzso zzso Despite the near identical predicted molecular mass of these zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice zzso with a slower zzso mobility than zzso from zzso zzso mice, suggesting more extensive zzso modification of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso has been demonstrated to disrupt zzso zzso of zzso and increase the zzso rate of the zzso zzso zzso these data show that zzso in zzso which have been shown to affect the interaction with zzso correlate with the ability of zzso to regulate allergic responses in zzso zzso
