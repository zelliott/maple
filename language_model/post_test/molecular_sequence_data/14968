To gain insight into the evolution of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso we analyzed two pairs of duplicated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not accumulate in a quadruple zzso for these four zzso demonstrating that they zzso the full complement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We were thus able to zzso definitively the activity of each zzso in zzso based on the zzso of selected double and triple zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene pairs are primarily responsible for zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, but exhibit some overlapping activities, most notably in zzso of the zzso of zzso Surprisingly, triple zzso containing only zzso or zzso activity produced 74 and zzso of the zzso zzso level, indicating that zzso can efficiently zzso both the zzso and zzso of zzso and that zzso also has low activity toward the zzso of zzso The modes of functional divergence for the gene pairs appear zzso with the zzso zzso being strongly zzso but zzso zzso with different in zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso that show significant expression divergence in zzso zzso By zzso the evolutionary history and zzso zzso of each extant zzso with the zzso responses of various zzso zzso to high light stress, we propose two likely scenarios for the evolution of zzso zzso in plants from ancestral zzso
