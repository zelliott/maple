zzso Lake is a unique saline and alkaline zzso formed by meteor impact in the zzso zzso in India around 52,000 years zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the cycling of carbon in this unusual environment, zzso probing zzso was carried out using the zzso compounds zzso methanol and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analyses performed with heavy zzso DNA retrieved from zzso zzso confirmed the enrichment and zzso of active zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed using zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso genes and functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified as the zzso active zzso in zzso methanol and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene amplification in the zzso zzso heavy fraction also indicated that zzso metabolism in zzso Lake sediments may not be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Many gene sequences retrieved in this study were not affiliated with extant zzso or zzso These sequences may represent zzso zzso novel zzso or zzso organisms that may have been zzso on zzso zzso or zzso This study represents an essential first step towards understanding the relevance of zzso in the soda lake sediments of an unusual impact crater zzso
