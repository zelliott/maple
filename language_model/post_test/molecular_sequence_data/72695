We report the zzso molecular zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso from whole organisms with zzso zzso zzso phase zzso into the zzso zzso zzso phase, and zzso by zzso liquid zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso protein was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso expression library and identified by using affinity zzso generated against the zzso native zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence included a zzso signal zzso zzso a putative leader zzso II zzso site, indicating that the zzso protein was a zzso Based on significant zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso protein to zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso we have designated this zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso zzso zzso to have a putative functional zzso A zzso form of the zzso zzso was zzso as a fusion protein in zzso coli zzso and was used to zzso rabbits to generate specific zzso zzso analysis with zzso serum recognized zzso zzso zzso protein D, and conversely, zzso to zzso zzso protein D recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso conservation between these zzso zzso to zzso also identified native zzso as a constituent of zzso outer membrane zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso with zzso serum revealed the presence of zzso related proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further sequence analysis both upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso showed additional zzso of zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso
