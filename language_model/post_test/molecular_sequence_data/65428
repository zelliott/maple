zzso zzso are generally zzso into zzso zzso for cell zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso is found on the cell surface of zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso and binds tightly to the zzso zzso To zzso zzso strain A1 forms a zzso pit on the cell surface and concentrates the zzso in the zzso zzso is a candidate zzso that recognizes zzso zzso and controls pit zzso To improve our understanding of the structure and function of zzso we determined the crystal structure of truncated zzso zzso at zzso A zzso This, to our knowledge, is the first structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso an zzso rich in zzso that forms the zzso and zzso regions and a zzso rich in zzso that constitutes the central zzso The zzso is structurally similar to the D1 domain of zzso zzso zzso while the zzso is structurally similar to the finger domain of the zzso T4 zzso protein that is important for zzso interactions between zzso and a long or short tail zzso zzso from the deletion zzso analysis suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions are thought to constitute zzso extending from the zzso On the basis of the size and surface charge, the zzso in extended zzso is proposed as an zzso binding site of zzso zzso similarity in the zzso suggests that the zzso is involved in the proper zzso and/or orientation of zzso on the cell zzso
