zzso are zzso that thrive in environments with very high zzso of zzso Although the salt reliance and physiology of these zzso have been widely investigated, the molecular working mechanisms of their zzso under salty conditions have been little zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso showed a range of zzso activity towards the zzso of zzso zzso with different zzso chains zzso zzso zzso with the highest activity being observed for zzso zzso consistent with the basic character of an zzso The optimal zzso activities were found to be at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso M or zzso zzso zzso M and at around 45 degrees zzso Interestingly, the zzso activity showed a clear zzso against changes in salt zzso At the ambient temperature of 22 degrees C, zzso systems working under the optimal salt zzso were very stable against zzso zzso in temperature increased the activity but reduced its zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic light scattering zzso and small angle zzso scattering zzso were deployed to determine the physical states of zzso in zzso As the salt concentration increased, zzso revealed substantial increase in zzso sizes, but CD zzso revealed the zzso retention of the zzso structure at the salt concentration matching the optimal zzso These observations were supported by zzso analysis that revealed the highest proportion of zzso and zzso around the optimal salt zzso although the zzso larger zzso showed a trend of increasing size with salt zzso consistent with the zzso zzso 

The solution zzso structure and activity relation also matched the highest proportion of zzso zzso and zzso Given that all the solutions studied were structurally zzso it is important for future work to understand how the zzso solution zzso affected its zzso
