We have isolated and characterized the zzso region of the rice zzso gene zzso which contains 793 zzso of sequence upstream of the zzso zzso initiation site, 58 zzso of the first zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the first 8 zzso zzso zzso of the second zzso It was found that the zzso region of zzso is an efficient gene regulatory region for driving the zzso expression of foreign genes in transgenic zzso In zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso zzso gene expression in transgenic rice plants is high in zzso and zzso zzso It was demonstrated that a zzso upstream sequence of the zzso translation initiation zzso contains all of the zzso regulatory elements necessary for high-level zzso expression in transgenic rice zzso zzso promoter activity was significantly enhanced by the deletion of a zzso segment from the central region of the first zzso The zzso to zzso region of the zzso zzso regulates zzso expression in zzso To identify regulatory elements within the zzso promoter, zzso zzso of the promoter region were made and fused to zzso The results showed that the region from zzso to zzso was sufficient for promoter zzso In addition, two zzso expression zzso for use in zzso transformation were developed to promote the high-level expression of foreign zzso
