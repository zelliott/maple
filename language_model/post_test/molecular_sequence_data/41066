Several different segments of the zzso zzso repeat coiled zzso have been constructed using zzso zzso modification of composite peptides and inducing zzso by adding zzso zzso These zzso act as receptors in zzso zzso with corresponding zzso labeled zzso zzso The zzso coordination complex zzso zzso zzso upon zzso and reversal of zzso by a small zzso inhibitor can be used to obtain the zzso zzso A total of 10 zzso pairs targeting zzso zzso segments of the coiled zzso were constructed, with zzso zzso of different lengths and binding zzso The result is a suite of zzso for exploring binding in the zzso to zzso range to any desired region of the coiled zzso including the zzso pocket zzso extended regions on either side of the pocket, or a region associated with zzso resistance zzso These zzso are zzso ready, and could be used to discover novel compounds binding along various regions of the zzso coiled zzso zzso They were used to evaluate a zzso low molecular weight fusion zzso resulting in the finding that the zzso bound specifically to the zzso and attained its potency from a low zzso
