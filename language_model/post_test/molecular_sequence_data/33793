zzso zzso zzso are receiving more and more attention not only as an abundant class of zzso but also as regulatory structural elements zzso located in zzso A key feature of zzso function is its zzso zzso methods were developed early for folding and prediction of zzso structure with the aim of assisting in functional zzso With the discovery of more and more zzso it has become clear that a large fraction of these are highly zzso Interestingly, a large part of the structure is comprised of regular zzso and zzso zzso base zzso This and the increased amount of available zzso have made it possible to employ zzso methods for zzso zzso The field has moved from folding prediction of single sequences to zzso screens for zzso in zzso sequence using the zzso structure as the main characteristic zzso Whereas early methods focused on zzso folding of single zzso comparative analysis based on structure preserving changes of base pairs has been efficient in improving zzso and today this constitutes a key component in zzso zzso Here, we cover the basic principles of zzso folding and touch upon some of the concepts in current methods that have been applied in zzso screens for de zzso zzso structures in searches for novel zzso genes and regulatory zzso structure on zzso We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different strategies and how they can complement each zzso
