The immediate upstream region of the mouse zzso 2 zzso gene harbors a strong zzso zzso This zzso contains most, if not all of the sequence elements necessary for the T cell specific induction of the zzso gene by the zzso zzso zzso and the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso studies with zzso extracts obtained from induced and zzso zzso T cells revealed numerous recognition sites for potential zzso zzso Five of these sites are also recognized by the zzso zzso cell factors zzso and zzso Other sites including two zzso two zzso sequence motifs and two copies of the zzso motif are recognized by zzso specific zzso The latter motif is highly zzso between several zzso genes and is therefore designated as a T cell element zzso In zzso T cells, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an activity similar to that of the entire zzso zzso whereas in B and zzso cells, the zzso is inactive as is the zzso zzso These data indicate the involvement of the zzso and its recognition zzso in the cell type specific induction of the zzso gene during T cell zzso
