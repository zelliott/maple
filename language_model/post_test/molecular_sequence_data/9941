zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with a doubling time of zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso was zzso with various restriction zzso previously determined to not cut within the zzso zzso zzso zzso or with a combination of these zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso a restriction zzso that cuts twice within the zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were resolved zzso and zzso with a zzso DNA zzso containing the 3' zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only a single DNA zzso in these zzso zzso to the probe, indicating that there is a single zzso copy of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso and thus only a single copy of the zzso zzso
