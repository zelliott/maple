A zzso zzso zzso which is shed into the culture medium by the zzso stage of the zzso and detected in blood of acutely infected mice was cloned and zzso We designate this zzso shed acute phase zzso zzso Five protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 160 to 200 zzso were detected by zzso of plasma from infected mice and in zzso of cultured zzso upon reaction with zzso against zzso A serum obtained from a patient acutely infected with zzso disease revealed a similar set of zzso in zzso of cultured zzso when tested by zzso zzso seems thus to be a major shed protein during the acute period of the zzso Twenty-six of 28 zzso from human acute cases of zzso disease tested reacted with zzso zzso only zzso of zzso from chronic cases of the disease contained zzso levels of zzso against zzso zzso from rabbits infected with six different zzso strains all contained zzso against zzso zzso against zzso are zzso 15 days after the manifestation of acute zzso disease symptoms in humans and 15 days zzso in zzso from mice and zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso clone zzso the 3' end of the zzso gene revealed the presence of 14 zzso arranged zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso region that is very zzso precedes the stop zzso Due to its early appearance it might be possible to design diagnostic zzso which are based on zzso for identification of recently infected cases of zzso zzso
