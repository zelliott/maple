Human zzso zzso remains one of the most common opportunistic infections causing disease following stem cell zzso despite the availability of zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to further aid in zzso chronic viral zzso and subsequent disease by restoring viral immunity through the transfer of zzso T cells from transplant donors to their zzso Our study zzso the production and zzso of a zzso zzso protein containing two of the most zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the generation of zzso zzso T zzso In doing so, a zzso zzso zzso protein was generated using a zzso zzso cell expression system and soluble zzso protein was subsequently zzso using zzso affinity zzso under stringent conditions to obtain a highly pure zzso The ability of the zzso zzso protein to elicit a functional T cell zzso immune response was demonstrated by the vigorous zzso and expansion of zzso zzso zzso T zzso This zzso zzso protein can potentially generate a multitude of zzso zzso T cells, providing a better alternative to using costly overlapping peptides or zzso zzso for expansion of T cells for use in adoptive zzso zzso
