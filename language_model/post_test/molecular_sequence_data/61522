There is now considerable evidence to suggest the zzso zzso zzso has limited genetic zzso However, the extent of this and its significance to the fitness of the zzso population, both in the wild and zzso is the subject of some zzso This reflects the difficulty associated with establishing a direct link between low zzso at biologically significant zzso and deleterious aspects of zzso in this, and other, zzso Attempts to study one such region, the zzso zzso zzso zzso are hampered by a general reliance on cloning and sequencing which is expensive, zzso subject to zzso zzso and always likely to underestimate true zzso In this study we have applied reference zzso zzso analysis zzso to determine the zzso zzso of 25 zzso This technique was zzso zzso and less prone to zzso chain reaction zzso sequence zzso associated with zzso Individual zzso were shown to have up to three zzso zzso A total of five zzso were identified zzso and zzso distributed among four zzso Fifteen zzso were zzso three were zzso six were zzso and one was zzso zzso analysis of zzso suggested it was a zzso of zzso and zzso Generation of new zzso is difficult to document, and the clear demonstration of such an event is zzso This study confirms further the limited genetic zzso of the zzso at a biologically significant zzso zzso will facilitate large-scale studies that will be needed to correlate genetic diversity at such zzso with population fitness in the zzso and other zzso
