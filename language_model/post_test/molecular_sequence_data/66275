The cloning of zzso and an examination of the tissue distribution of zzso zzso 3 zzso were carried out in the Japanese black zzso zzso zzso The cellular zzso of zzso zzso was examined by in zzso zzso and zzso during zzso in the zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso The partial zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso identical to rat zzso and stingray zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were exclusively expressed along the late portion of the zzso zzso to the anterior part of the zzso duct of zzso larvae zzso stages zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso but not in the external zzso in the larvae at the zzso differentiation stage zzso stage zzso In the adult, zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso but not in the zzso and zzso zzso In juvenile and adult zzso zzso zzso was observed at the zzso membrane of the initial parts of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso via zzso occurred in the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso This is the first study to indicate zzso expression during zzso in zzso
