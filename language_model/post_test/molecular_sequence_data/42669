A zzso chain zzso zzso zzso procedure zzso was used to study the genetic diversity of intermediate host snails within the zzso zzso zzso differentiation was detected between two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Evidence is presented demonstrating the potential of zzso markers for zzso populations of zzso zzso from different countries zzso zzso zzso and Ivory zzso or from the same country zzso zzso may be also used to identify offspring from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a cost-effective and routine method for genetic studies of snails zzso zzso and for the evaluation of diversity between snail zzso
