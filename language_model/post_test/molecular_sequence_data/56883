Parallel simultaneous synthesis of fifty linear peptides has been carried out in order to compare in detail two promising zzso of simultaneous multiple zzso synthesis zzso the zzso zzso method, utilizing zzso zzso zzso and synthesis on zzso zzso fabric zzso The basic set of experiments, which zzso identical zzso strategy for both approaches, shows that the peptides zzso on cotton are superior in purity to those zzso using T zzso In experiments utilizing zzso strategy in T bags, the zzso of peptides were higher than in the case of peptides zzso in T bags by zzso strategy, and comparable with the zzso achieved in synthesis performed on zzso The lower yields on cotton are caused by mechanical losses in the given experimental zzso
