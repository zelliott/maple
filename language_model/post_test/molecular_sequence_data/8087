zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is representative of the large, zzso zzso that act on zzso zzso or zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso has been solved to zzso A resolution using zzso zzso in combination with density modification zzso group zzso a zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso unit; zzso zzso zzso zzso The refined zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso restraints with a 4 zzso zzso and zzso to zzso A resolution zzso Six zzso related by zzso symmetry compose the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso of zzso zzso can be described in terms of five sequential folding zzso The zzso domain, zzso 1 to zzso consists of a zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso Two wing zzso of each zzso project inward towards the center of the zzso and contribute to zzso zzso The zzso domain, zzso 108 to zzso consists of short zzso separated by a loop that fills in the zzso zzso The third domain, zzso 161 to zzso is an zzso domain containing a seven stranded zzso that resembles the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The fourth domain, zzso zzso to zzso resembles the zzso domain of the zzso zzso but is significantly larger due to zzso The remaining zzso domain, zzso zzso to zzso is organized into multiple zzso zzso and seven zzso that help form a deep channel leading to the zzso zzso
