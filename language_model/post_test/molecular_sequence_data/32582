The zzso zzso activated zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso immune zzso differentiation and cell zzso There is also strong evidence for a function in zzso and tumor zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso In the present study, we have used zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso mice to determine by zzso and zzso analysis the contribution of zzso to the protein profile of zzso Thirty-one zzso expressed proteins of different functional categories were zzso For at least two proteins a role in zzso and/or tumor zzso has previously been reported: while the calcium zzso zzso zzso was expressed at lower levels in zzso zzso cells, expression of the cellular zzso binding protein 1 zzso was zzso zzso and zzso gene expression patterns observed in different experimental settings in zzso and in zzso confirmed the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the expression of a defined set of proteins is altered in zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso mice, that this is due to zzso gene regulation, and that the altered expression of these proteins is consistent with the tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
