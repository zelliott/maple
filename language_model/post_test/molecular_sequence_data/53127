zzso zzso type 2 zzso is caused by expansion of a zzso tract in zzso a protein of unknown zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso binding protein 1) which binds to the zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso was predominantly expressed in muscle and zzso By zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both localized to the trans zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in the zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso in a pattern similar to that seen for zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated enrichment of zzso in the same zzso as zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed an zzso motif that is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso had striking zzso with a human zzso zzso zzso of unknown function and at least two copies of zzso zzso are found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related proteins appear to form a novel gene family sharing zzso zzso
