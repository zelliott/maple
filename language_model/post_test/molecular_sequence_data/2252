Using zzso zzso zzso protection, and Northern zzso analysis, we showed that insulin gene expression occurs in zzso zzso fetal zzso zzso throughout the last half of rat fetal zzso The zzso product of the ancestral rat insulin II but not the duplicated rat insulin I gene was present in high copy number, and its abundance was regulated during zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso before pancreatic zzso membrane insulin zzso content greatly exceeded that in zzso until the last 2 days of gestation when content in each tissue became zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurred at the same sites used in zzso but initiation of zzso occurred at multiple sites in zzso zzso of zzso maintained in culture produced approximately 10 zzso of zzso zzso membrane zzso Over a zzso period, approximately 50 times more insulin accumulated in medium than that present in zzso at the time of zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso is a source for insulin during fetal development and that the mechanisms regulating insulin gene expression in this tissue differ from those in pancreatic beta zzso
