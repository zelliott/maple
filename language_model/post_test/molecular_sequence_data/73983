A zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso zzso type zzso was isolated from the production water of Beatrice oil field in the North Sea zzso zzso The cells were straight to bent rods (1 to 5 by zzso to zzso zzso which stained gram zzso zzso zzso obtained energy from the reduction of zzso zzso zzso and nitrate in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The isolate grew zzso at 60 degrees C zzso range for growth, 50 to 65 degrees zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso range for growth, 0 to zzso zzso The DNA base composition was 34 zzso G + zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene indicated that strain zzso is a member of the domain zzso The closest known zzso is the moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso value, zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso and zzso traits that do not allow its zzso as a member of any previously described zzso therefore, we propose that this isolate should be described as a member of a novel species of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
