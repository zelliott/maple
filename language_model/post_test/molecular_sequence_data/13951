To test the theoretical possibility of zzso zzso between zzso C virus zzso zzso and zzso we combined a zzso line probe zzso zzso with a zzso zzso system and zzso 183 zzso previously zzso as type zzso or zzso and originating mainly from Western zzso Eight percent of these were found to be wrongly zzso Based on this method, 3 additional zzso of type 1 were discovered zzso zzso selected European type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested with a similar type 2 zzso zzso They were unexpectedly found to belong to zzso zzso in the majority of zzso Among serum samples originating from zzso Asia, several additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected which had zzso sequence motifs indistinguishable from zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso comparisons in the zzso zzso region, zzso into types, zzso and zzso was obtained in zzso of all cases by using the zzso border value of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and evidence for a 10th major type of zzso was zzso Combination of all available zzso sequence data from the zzso zzso region and the zzso zzso and zzso regions provided evidence for the existence of 10 types, including 50 zzso Previously, extensive studies involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated the importance of zzso zzso in zzso treatment and progression of chronic liver zzso The zzso described expansion in the number of zzso types and zzso should help improve diagnosis, treatment and possibly prophylaxis of zzso C liver zzso
