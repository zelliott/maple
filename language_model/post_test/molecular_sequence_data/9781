Two reverse zzso zzso zzso have been developed for the detection and differentiation of rabbit zzso disease virus zzso and European brown zzso syndrome virus zzso two closely related zzso In order to select highly specific zzso comparative analysis was performed with a large number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Regarding these data, zzso were selected from similar regions of the zzso genes to amplify a zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso and a zzso of 265 zzso from the zzso of zzso In sensitivity studies, as few as 10 copies of cloned viral zzso fragments were detected in each zzso zzso and no cross amplification was observed between the two zzso The diagnostic value of the zzso was confirmed with clinical material by testing fresh and zzso zzso liver and zzso specimens from a large number of geographically and temporally distant zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso provide highly specific and sensitive, novel means of direct detection of the two zzso In addition, by detecting the viruses in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso facilitate retrospective zzso and zzso zzso For example, the identification of zzso in PET specimens collected in the 1970s indicates that this virus appeared in the zzso populations several years before the first reports of European brown zzso syndrome during the zzso
