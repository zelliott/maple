We addressed the relationship between the origin and evolution of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and disease outcome in zzso infected infants by studying the zzso regions of viral zzso in samples obtained from five zzso mothers at delivery and obtained zzso over the first year of life from their infected zzso two of whom zzso zzso rapidly progressed to having zzso zzso analyses disclosed that the zzso sequences from each zzso pair clustered together and were clearly distinct from those of the other zzso Within each pair, the child's sequences formed a zzso group, indicating that a single zzso initiated the infection in both rapid and slow zzso Plasma zzso zzso levels increased in all five infants during their first months of life and then declined within the first semester of life only in the three slow zzso zzso zzso increased over time in all zzso but no differences in the pattern of zzso evolution in terms of potential viral zzso were zzso The numbers of synonymous and zzso zzso varied during the first semester of life regardless of viral load, zzso count, and disease zzso zzso during the second semester of life the rate of zzso zzso was higher than that of synonymous zzso in the slow zzso but not in the rapid zzso thus suggesting a stronger host selective pressure in the zzso In view of the proposal that zzso genetic evolution is driven mainly by host immune constraints, these findings suggest that while the immune response to zzso might contribute to regulating viral levels after the first semester of life, it is unlikely to play a zzso role in the initial viral decline soon after zzso
