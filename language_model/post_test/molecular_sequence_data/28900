We describe here the functional characterization of the putative zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is most similar to zzso of zzso zzso A zzso region is present in the zzso half of the zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of other organisms that includes the zzso binding zzso A role for the zzso gene of zzso zzso in zzso was demonstrated by its zzso The zzso activity of a zzso fusion of the zzso promoter to zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that the activity of zzso the zzso factor that regulates zzso was zzso zzso with these results, an increased amount of zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by Western zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso of zzso by zzso the activity of zzso zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso with the alternative zzso factor zzso was demonstrated by utilizing the zzso zzso zzso Three putative consensus zzso recognition sites and one zzso site were found in the zzso upstream zzso However, analysis of the zzso fusion of the zzso promoter to zzso in different zzso backgrounds showed that the zzso promoter was not entirely dependent on either zzso or zzso A transcript was detected by primer extension that was 8 zzso downstream of the consensus zzso zzso Thus, a system for the control of zzso synthesis by zzso exists in zzso zzso that is different from that in the enteric bacteria and seems to be most similar to that of zzso zzso where both zzso and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso
