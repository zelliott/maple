Members of the zzso crab family, zzso are among the most abundant and common zzso in zzso zzso However, their identification based on zzso characteristics often leads to incorrect species recognition due to a lack of zzso factors and the existence of sibling (or zzso zzso For these reasons, we used DNA zzso for zzso zzso using zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso However, several nuclear zzso zzso zzso were amplified from zzso zzso zzso 1990, using universal zzso zzso zzso The zzso were characterized in six zzso with zzso sequence divergence from zzso zzso a higher zzso substitution ratio than true zzso and the formation of an independent zzso in zzso In a zzso tree, the origin of the zzso would be expected to incorporate into the nucleus at an ancestral zzso of zzso and they zzso more slowly in the nucleus than zzso in the zzso This evolutionary process may have resulted in the higher binding affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso than zzso In the present study, we performed long zzso for the amplification of zzso in zzso zzso We also present evidence that zzso can introduce serious ambiguity into DNA zzso including overestimating the number of species in zzso These results may help in conducting zzso studies using zzso genes from organisms living in zzso zzso zzso
