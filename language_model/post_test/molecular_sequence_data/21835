Gas phase zzso are increasingly used to study the structure of proteins and zzso A challenge to the mass zzso is to preserve the structure of the system of interest intact and zzso from solution into the gas zzso Small peptides are very flexible and can present a number of zzso in zzso In this work we examine zzso a 26 zzso acid zzso that forms the active component of honey bee zzso zzso is zzso and has been shown to form an zzso zzso structure by X-ray zzso zzso zzso et zzso The zzso zzso Data Bank, zzso and to be zzso in high zzso of zzso Here we use zzso mobility mass zzso molecular dynamics and zzso zzso to probe its structure in the gas phase and specifically interrogate whether the zzso form can be zzso All low energy calculated structures possess some zzso In our experiments we examine the zzso following zzso from solutions with varying methanol zzso Ion mobility gives collision cross sections zzso that compare well with values found from molecular zzso and from other reported structures, but with zzso results regarding the effect of zzso There is only a slight increase in zzso with charge, showing minimal zzso driven zzso zzso supports preservation of some zzso content into the gas phase and again shows little difference in the exchange rates of species sprayed from different zzso The zzso + zzso species has two exchanging populations both of which exhibit faster exchange rates than observed for the zzso + zzso zzso One interpretation for these results is that the time spent being zzso is sufficient for this zzso to form a zzso in the zzso zzso environment of a zzso
