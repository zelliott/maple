The structural zzso of DNA is a vital aspect of its biological zzso However, it has become increasingly apparent in recent years that DNA zzso is a complicated, zzso phenomenon that includes not only zzso zzso structures but dynamic effects as well, including influences of zzso and sequence zzso In order to address some of these additional factors that govern DNA zzso we have used T4 zzso zzso to investigate zzso in a series of DNA sequences containing the zzso motif in different sequence contexts including various zzso zzso with zzso We present evidence for zzso in zzso and zzso motifs in the presence of zzso levels of zzso and show that these motifs curve through similar but zzso directed zzso angles under these zzso strength zzso Although these two sequence motifs appear to bend similarly, our results suggest significant differences in zzso and stability of zzso between zzso We also show that under the same experimental conditions, the zzso sequence element possesses unusual zzso flexibility and that this appears to be associated with the central zzso zzso The results underscore the need to include sequence context and specific zzso effects as well as a dynamic basis in more complete zzso models for functionally related DNA zzso
