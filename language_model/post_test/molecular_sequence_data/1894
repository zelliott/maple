We report the isolation of 24 novel zzso of zzso viruses from a surgically removed zzso of a patient with Hodgkin's zzso The sequence analysis of our 24 zzso revealed the remarkable zzso of zzso virus zzso not only from the same patient but also from the same biopsy zzso These zzso belong to four zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso sequence analyses revealed five distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The limited variation in sequence identity of the other zzso defines the latter as zzso of four of these zzso A group of 6 zzso (the zzso zzso revealed a reorganization of open reading frame 1 zzso leading to one larger and a varying number of smaller zzso The zzso difference of the full-length zzso was less than zzso A variation of 69 to zzso in zzso acids of a second group of 8 zzso (the zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso region of zzso indicating the existence of a zzso These zzso differed by less than zzso in the remainder of their zzso zzso An alignment of these zzso with 79 previously reported zzso virus zzso permits the proposal of zzso virus zzso and species within the family zzso in zzso to a previous proposal for the zzso zzso zzso
