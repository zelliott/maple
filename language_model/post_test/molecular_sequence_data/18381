The first zzso interaction in zzso development is zzso zzso during which a signal from the vegetal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso equatorial zzso Recently, a number of zzso zzso zzso which may be responsible for this interaction, have been zzso Examples of these zzso include members of the zzso growth factor family as well as members of the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso In addition to these zzso factors, several new sources of zzso activity have been zzso One of the most potent of these is the zzso zzso leukemia cell line zzso Even at high zzso zzso medium from zzso cells zzso isolated zzso animal pole regions to form a variety of zzso cell zzso In this paper we show by several criteria, including zzso zzso acid sequencing, Northern zzso and various functional zzso that the zzso is zzso zzso zzso are known to zzso the release of zzso hormone from cultured anterior zzso cells and to cause the differentiation of two zzso cell zzso Our results, along with recent data from other laboratories, indicate that these molecules may also act in early development in the formation of the zzso
