Numerous sequences analogous to resistance zzso genes exist in plant zzso and could be involved in resistance zzso The aim of this study was to identify a large number of zzso zzso sequences related to R genes and also to test the zzso of specific zzso tools for studying zzso Different consensus zzso were compared for their efficiency in amplifying zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso of R zzso zzso zzso were subsequently designed to zzso the different zzso and we tested their efficiency in three species related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Among 29 zzso at least one-third were zzso zzso zzso were mapped on 10 of the 19 zzso zzso linkage zzso The high zzso within these sequences permitted discrimination of each zzso within a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso amplified zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the sequences appear to be poorly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a precise tool for studying zzso zzso These sequences represent interesting markers that could be correlated with resistance traits in zzso zzso or related zzso zzso
