zzso proteins zzso a zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso domain to zzso new zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain is inhibited through an unknown mechanism by zzso binding of the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso 

Here we report the crystal structure of a complex between DID and zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 also called zzso or zzso The structure shows a zzso zzso (4 zzso + 4 zzso in which the zzso sites on the zzso domain are zzso zzso However zzso data suggest the full-length zzso is a zzso in solution (2 zzso + 2 zzso Based on the crystal structure, we have generated possible zzso models and found that zzso of all of these models are incompatible with binding to zzso filament but not to zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the minimal functional zzso unit in the zzso domain, termed the bridge element, can be inhibited by isolated zzso zzso zzso data on the zzso system revealed that at least one of the two zzso sites on the bridge element is accessible to zzso zzso in the inhibited zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso in the native zzso zzso involves zzso hindrance with the zzso zzso Although the structure of a full-length zzso would be required for clarification of the presented models, our work here provides the first structural insights into the mechanism of the zzso zzso
