The class II genes of the major zzso complex are a family of genes whose expression is regulated zzso in cells of the B lineage and by zzso in many other cell zzso Using the approach of in zzso zzso which allows for the examination of zzso interactions within intact cells, we demonstrated a transition from unoccupied to occupied to once again unoccupied class II promoters in cell lines representing the zzso zzso of B zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells led to increased promoter occupancy of the DR alpha and DR beta promoters at the same sites that are zzso bound in mature B zzso No zzso binding site was zzso Additionally, an zzso element in the DR alpha gene displayed preferential binding in B zzso These results demonstrate that changes in the zzso of the class II genes are associated with changes in factor binding at the promoter in zzso Moreover, given the ubiquity of class II promoter binding zzso these results suggest that throughout B cell development and upon zzso zzso the accessibility of class II promoter DNA is subject to zzso
