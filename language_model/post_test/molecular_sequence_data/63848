zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso upon other zzso zzso Although the life cycle of zzso has been extensively investigated, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were isolated from zzso strain zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the selected zzso zzso retained their ability to prey on host cells grown zzso and in a zzso A zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso zzso that were impaired in their ability to attack zzso were zzso zzso zzso sites were determined using arbitrary zzso chain zzso Ten zzso zzso zzso mapped to genes predicted to be involved in mechanisms previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were further examined for their ability to reduce zzso 

In this study we describe a new method for zzso genes that are required for zzso zzso zzso Focusing on mechanisms that were previously attributed to be involved in zzso we demonstrate that zzso systems are required for zzso of bacterial zzso Furthermore, genes identified in this study suggest that surface gliding zzso may also play a role in zzso of zzso consistent with zzso occupying a zzso zzso We believe that the methodology presented here will open the way for future studies on the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso interaction and a greater insight of the biology of this unique zzso
