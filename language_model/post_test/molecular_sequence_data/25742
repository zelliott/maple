zzso zzso containing one or two zzso zzso attached to zzso or zzso were used as zzso to investigate the effect of zzso structure on the activity of crude preparations of zzso zzso beta zzso from pig stomach and pig and rat zzso zzso and of a partially zzso zzso preparation from rat zzso zzso liquid zzso used to separate zzso products revealed that zzso zzso with an zzso group at the zzso end and a zzso zzso or an zzso group at the zzso end were resistant to zzso in crude zzso The activity of beta zzso varied with the sequence and length of the zzso portion of the zzso the presence of protecting groups, the attachment site of zzso and the number of zzso zzso in the zzso The presence and position of Pro had little effect on zzso zzso zzso groups near the zzso unit zzso with zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso in many of these zzso have been shown to assume similar rigid zzso the variation in zzso activity indicates that the beta zzso recognizes both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and pig zzso zzso zzso contain beta 3- and beta zzso that zzso respectively zzso core 3 zzso beta zzso zzso and core 4 zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso These zzso also showed variations in activity with different zzso zzso these effects did not parallel those observed with beta zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
