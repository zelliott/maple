We studied the zzso of a zzso torso model created without the use of magnetic resonance imaging in the inverse problem of zzso 

Three types of zzso zzso torso models were created, with different degrees of adjustment of the outer surface to patients, whereas the heart and lung models remained zzso The torso models were used in the inverse zzso of small areas with zzso changes from simulated difference integral zzso zzso The zzso error zzso was evaluated as the distance between the centers of the modeled and the zzso found area with zzso zzso 

The mean zzso was zzso zzso with the standard torso zzso After adapting the torso shape, the mean zzso was zzso zzso whereas after adapting both, the shape and zzso positions, the mean zzso was zzso zzso 

If torso imaging is not available, a torso model with adapted shape and zzso positions gives only slightly less accurate zzso
