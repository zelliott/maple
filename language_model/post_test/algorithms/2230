There are three signal zzso in which zzso data zzso can be performed, namely time domain, frequency domain and zzso zzso The present paper deals with the frequency domain method of zzso using fast zzso zzso The zzso has been tested on the third set of the zzso database zzso A performance evaluation has been made using two important zzso namely zzso ratio and percent zzso difference besides visual zzso Further, in order to know the clinical acceptable quality of the reconstructed signal peak, boundary and zzso zzso were made both on the reconstructed and the original signal of the same record for zzso The visual examination reveals that most of the noise in the original signal had been filtered out during the zzso This amounts to reduction of zzso noise to a considerable zzso The experimental observations show that a zzso ratio of 8 is feasible while ensuring clinical zzso
