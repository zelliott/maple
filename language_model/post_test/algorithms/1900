zzso zzso of the zzso radiation is key to improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing anterior zzso lobe zzso for the treatment of zzso focal zzso Current commercial zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various zzso zzso We present an zzso imaging zzso that can accurately zzso the zzso radiation during zzso The zzso is driven by a near real-time zzso zzso image registration zzso that uses both anatomical and fractional zzso zzso and zzso zzso The proposed zzso is implemented on zzso processing units and we perform a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso radiation to the zzso space in under 3 zzso making the proposed zzso suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of zzso zzso The method was validated using both a zzso phantom and clinical data using zzso and zzso images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of zzso focal zzso and shows strong correlation between the observed zzso visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the zzso zzso We also validate the zzso using zzso zzso zzso from a small cohort of zzso This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical zzso
