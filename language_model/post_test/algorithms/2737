This study was to assess the diagnostic value of strain index zzso for zzso real-time tissue zzso zzso on zzso zzso from benign zzso in the prostate peripheral zzso 

83 patients suspected of having prostate cancer zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in the prostate peripheral zone detected by zzso were set as the regions of interest zzso for strain ratio zzso measurement zzso The moderate texture zzso without zzso were set as the reference zzso for zzso measurement zzso Then, zzso zzso of total zzso zzso and local zzso zzso were zzso and the diagnostic values of zzso and zzso on zzso benign from zzso zzso were assessed zzso 

The range of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in benign zzso zzso while the range of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in benign zzso zzso There was significant difference of zzso values between the benign and zzso zzso zzso At the zzso value of zzso zzso yielded the highest sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso for discriminating zzso from benign zzso The capability of zzso in the diagnosis of zzso improved with the increase of zzso zzso 

zzso is one of the elasticity parameters obtained easily by zzso it can provide more information in the differentiation of prostate peripheral zone zzso
