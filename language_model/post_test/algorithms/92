For many classes of zzso the relationship between zzso function and zzso zzso remains zzso To gain insights into this relationship, we zzso an inverse approach in which we zzso model zzso with realistic zzso and zzso channel zzso (of zzso and zzso to perform a zzso zzso In this study, the desired function is zzso zzso zzso have to respond zzso to the arrival of two zzso in a different zzso zzso There is a single free zzso in this function, zzso the time lag between the arrivals of the two zzso zzso varying this zzso allowed us to map one axis of function space to structure zzso Because the function of the zzso model zzso is known with zzso their thorough analysis provides insights into the relationship between the zzso functions, zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we discuss issues of zzso in nervous zzso
