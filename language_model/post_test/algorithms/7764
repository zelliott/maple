zzso X-ray sources are commonly used for therapy planning, and knowledge of their spectral distribution is important for accurate dose zzso There are many methods that could provide reasonable zzso of zzso X-ray zzso when very accurate zzso data or at least very good set of initial guesses of the zzso are zzso We present here a novel method, which can be used for accurate zzso spectral reconstruction without any prior knowledge of spectral zzso the method performs well even when the available transmission data are affected by zzso The method is based on a search for a smooth function that zzso the differences between measured and calculated zzso zzso The zzso is compared with well-known existing zzso using computer simulated data, both zzso and containing added random zzso zzso The reconstructed zzso are subsequently used to calculate the transmission through 50 zzso of bone, muscle or fat zzso It is shown that the relative errors in dose calculations, using the zzso reconstructed via this method, are significantly smaller than those obtained via well-established reconstruction zzso zzso Value zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the novel zzso might be practical for routine zzso therapy X-ray source zzso
