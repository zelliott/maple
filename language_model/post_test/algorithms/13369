zzso the genetic structure of populations is becoming an increasingly important aspect of genetic zzso One of the most frequently used methods is the calculation of zzso using an Analysis of zzso zzso zzso However, this has the drawback that the population hierarchy has to be known a zzso zzso the population structure is often based on the results of a zzso zzso Here I show how these two steps, zzso and calculation of zzso can be combined in a single zzso I do this by showing how the zzso framework is theoretically related to the widely used method of zzso zzso and can be used for the zzso of populations into zzso zzso were used to show that the method performed very well both under random mating and under zzso zzso However, when the migration rates were high, the results were better under random mating than under zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two summary statistics were tested for zzso the number of zzso Overall, zzso showed the better performance, but zzso is better for detecting whether any significant structure is zzso The results show that the zzso zzso zzso is useful for zzso population genetic zzso Programs to perform the zzso can be downloaded from zzso
