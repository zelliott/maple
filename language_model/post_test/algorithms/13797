It is shown that time frequency signal analysis could be a useful technique in detecting late zzso zzso In particular, the zzso the zzso distribution and the zzso transform have been applied to zzso signals from patients with sustained zzso zzso Comparisons of the three zzso reveals that much better time zzso is achieved by the zzso zzso Moreover, it is concluded that a separation between healthy subjects and patients could be obtained based upon time frequency zzso
