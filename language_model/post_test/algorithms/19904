In diffusion zzso the reconstruction of the full Ensemble Average zzso zzso provides new insights in the diffusion process and the underlying zzso The reconstruction of the signal in the whole zzso is still extremely challenging zzso It requires very long acquisition zzso and robust reconstruction to cope with the very low zzso at large zzso Several reconstruction methods were proposed recently, among which the zzso Polar zzso zzso expansion, a promising basis for signal zzso Yet the reconstruction in SPF is still subject to noise and zzso of the zzso In this work, we present a method for the reconstruction of the diffusion zzso in the whole zzso with a special focus on continuity and optimal zzso We derive a modified zzso Polar zzso zzso basis, zzso and compatible with zzso for the reconstruction of a signal with continuity zzso We also derive the expression of a zzso zzso operator in the basis, together with a method based on generalized cross validation for the optimal choice of the zzso Our method results in a noticeable dimension reduction as compared with zzso Tested on synthetic and real data, the reconstruction with this method is more robust to noise and better preserves fiber directions and zzso
