Recently, zzso constraints have been widely exploited in many computer vision problems such as zzso zzso Under linear projection models, feature points associated with multiple bodies reside in multiple zzso Most existing zzso zzso can segment objects undergoing independent zzso However, zzso among the correlated motion zzso will lead most previous zzso zzso to erroneous zzso To overcome this zzso in this paper, we formulate the problem of zzso grouping as zzso of multiple zzso from a zzso data zzso A novel and robust zzso is proposed to capture the zzso of the multiple zzso structure and to find the zzso of objects by zzso the feature points into these zzso zzso no matter whether they are independent or zzso In the proposed method, an zzso zzso which is a zzso coordinate frame, is associated with each data point indicating the zzso preferred zzso zzso Based on the similarity between the zzso novel mechanisms of zzso evolution and voting are zzso By filtering the zzso due to their structural zzso the zzso zzso will zzso Compared with most existing zzso zzso that cannot correctly segment correlated motions, such as motions of articulated objects, the proposed method has a robust performance in both independent and correlated motion zzso A number of controlled and real experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed zzso However, the current approach does not deal with transparent motions and motion zzso of different zzso
