In this work, we investigated the zzso dependence of the rotating frame zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation rate zzso when using zzso zzso full passage zzso or zzso zzso zzso Phantom and in zzso zzso were performed to validate theoretical predictions of the dominant relaxation mechanisms existing during zzso full passage zzso when using different settings of the frequency offset relative to the zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso values of total zzso and zzso were measured in zzso from the human brain at 4 zzso When the zzso pulse power was limited to safe specific zzso rates for humans, simulations revealed a strong dependence of zzso and zzso values on the frequency offset for both zzso interactions and zzso exchange zzso By contrast, theoretical and experimental results showed zzso zzso and zzso values to be practically zzso within the large zzso of the bandwidth of the zzso pulse where complete inversion was zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso values of the zzso zzso of total zzso (at zzso zzso were almost doubled when compared with those of the zzso zzso of zzso (at zzso zzso in spite of the fact that these zzso were in the flat region of the inversion band of the zzso full passage zzso We conclude that differences in zzso zzso and zzso values of human brain zzso are not a result of their chemical shifts, but instead reflect differences in zzso
