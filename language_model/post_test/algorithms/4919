zzso models are now available to represent the sewer network, wastewater treatment plant and receiving water as an integrated zzso These models can be combined with zzso methods to improve overall system performance through optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proven to be a powerful method in developing optimal control zzso however, the intensive zzso requirement of these methods zzso a limit on their zzso This paper explores the potential of surrogate zzso in zzso zzso of urban wastewater systems with a limited number of model zzso A surrogate based method, zzso is combined with an integrated urban wastewater model to solve real time control zzso This method is compared with the popular zzso II, by using performance zzso the zzso zzso additive zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative results show that zzso is an efficient and effective method in zzso optimal control strategies for multiple objective control problems with a small number of zzso It is suggested that zzso can greatly improve zzso efficiency in the zzso zzso process, particularly for complex urban wastewater zzso
