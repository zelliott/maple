We recorded human auditory cortical activity during the perception of long, changing acoustic signals and analyzed information provided by dynamic neural population measures over a large range of time intervals zzso 24 zzso zzso Participants listened to musical scales that were zzso modulated at a rate of zzso zzso generating an zzso zzso zzso brain zzso the auditory zzso response zzso The zzso generated energy at the zzso zzso rate that was recorded using zzso As in previous work, the timing zzso of this response varied with stimulus carrier frequency over the entire course of zzso tone sequences zzso zzso of carrier zzso The length of the time zzso over which phase was calculated was systematically zzso significant phase tracking was regularly observed at analysis intervals of zzso zzso in zzso The right auditory zzso exhibited better phase tracking performance than the left at analysis intervals of zzso zzso and frequency dependent phase delays were consistently larger than those predicted by cochlear zzso Based on these empirical data, a model of the neural populations responsible for phase tracking suggests that it is produced by a zzso ( approximately zzso of the cells generating the zzso
