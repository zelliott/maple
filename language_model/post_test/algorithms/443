zzso realistic organic materials is a challenging zzso The human eye is an important part of zzso communication which, consequently, requires specific modeling and rendering techniques to enhance the realism of virtual zzso We propose an zzso method for zzso both iris zzso and scattering features in order to generate convincing images of virtual zzso In this regard, we develop a technique to zzso iris zzso We model the zzso of the human iris as an irregular multilayered zzso We then approximate the scattering features of the captured zzso Finally, we propose a real-time rendering technique based on the subsurface texture mapping representation and introduce a zzso refraction function as well as a zzso function, which accounts for the light interactions at the zzso zzso
