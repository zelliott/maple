zzso and zzso binding by zzso zzso substances zzso extracted from seven environmental bacterial strains were investigated as a function of zzso The study was carried out by using a zzso method in the stripping mercury dropping zzso zzso mode which is able to determine zzso metal in solution containing soluble zzso such as zzso The results obtained provide evidence for the presence of a zzso edge for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso model gives information on the mechanisms involved through the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of exchanged zzso This model shows that zzso exchange with metals is not the only mechanism involved in metal zzso by bacterial zzso The position of the zzso edge zzso and the zzso zzso zzso show that zzso displays a greater affinity for zzso than zzso For a given metal, the seven zzso investigated did not display differences regarding the binding zzso This work suggests that a wide range of products of bacterial species isolated from activated sludge exhibit similar binding zzso for zzso or zzso which may potentially simplify the zzso of the distribution and the zzso of metals in zzso natural zzso
