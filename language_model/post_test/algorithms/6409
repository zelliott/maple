zzso is an essential step in zzso data mining and zzso For zzso zzso data, the primary purpose of zzso is removing the zzso bias across different slides within an experimental group or between multiple zzso The locally weighted zzso zzso procedure has been widely used for this purpose but can be comparatively time consuming when the zzso becomes relatively zzso In this study, we applied zzso zzso a new smoothing method for recovering a zzso function from data that is supposed to outperform other methods in many cases, such as zzso or local zzso fitting, to zzso two zzso zzso zzso Relative to the zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso not only produced reliable zzso results but also ran much zzso The computing speed represents one of the most important advantages over other zzso especially when one is interested in analyzing a large zzso experiment involving hundreds of zzso
