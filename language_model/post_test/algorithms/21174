The zzso basis of zzso in the zzso of evoked neural responses has been of interest for zzso We describe a method to identify white matter pathways that may contribute to zzso zzso in the timing of neural zzso We investigated the relation of the zzso of peak visual responses in zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso to fractional zzso zzso in the entire brain as measured with diffusion zzso imaging zzso in eight healthy young zzso This method makes no assumptions about the anatomy of white matter zzso Visual responses were evoked during a zzso paradigm and were zzso to arrival at a zzso zzso The zzso of the peak visual response was zzso related to zzso in bilateral zzso and right lateral frontal white matter adjacent to cortical regions that zzso early visual zzso These relations suggest that zzso properties of white matter affect the timing of early visual zzso This preliminary report demonstrates a zzso unbiased method to relate the timing information from zzso experiments to the zzso properties of white matter measured with zzso
