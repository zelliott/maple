In this paper, a novel zzso technique for corresponding points using a zzso zzso based mean shift zzso is zzso We proposed a zzso based probability zzso using different spatial zzso For a given point on reference image, its corresponding register point is found along the search trajectory generated by zzso zzso zzso between two windows centered at the points on the register and reference zzso The zzso are further eliminated by analyzing statistical information on the zzso of the candidate register zzso zzso on various zzso medical images show that the proposed method is feasible and zzso
