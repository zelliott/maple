zzso The relative roles of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participating in zzso metabolism have been studied in zzso using humanized zzso zzso zzso systems expressing either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was incubated with each expression system at 37 degrees C, and its zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso values for zzso formation were estimated for zzso and zzso The zzso values for the zzso formed were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso These parameters could not be measured for other zzso since zzso zzso formed were below the zzso detection zzso zzso zzso studies using specific zzso against zzso or zzso revealed that zzso zzso levels decreased when the amount of added zzso or zzso zzso increased, with zzso zzso yielding a greater zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso based on the in zzso zzso values, which were calculated from the zzso respective zzso and zzso values, project that well over zzso of in zzso zzso is due to zzso These results support an important role for zzso in human zzso zzso and a minor role for zzso
