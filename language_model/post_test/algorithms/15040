To implement and zzso evaluate a therapeutic zzso for the treatment of zzso status zzso with zzso zzso 

Eight consecutive patients with zzso status zzso were mechanically zzso Their zzso and central zzso blood pressures were continuously monitored by zzso vascular zzso These patients were also continuously monitored by a zzso video electroencephalogram zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso and a continuous infusion of 1-2 zzso was zzso If zzso continued, the infusion was increased every 15 zzso by 1-2 zzso If zzso stopped and/or burst suppression was zzso the patients continued to receive that dose for 48 zzso and were then weaned by zzso of 1-2 zzso every 15 zzso 

The patients' ages ranged from 17 days to 16 zzso and they had various underlying zzso In five of the eight patients, zzso of zzso occurred before achieving burst suppression on zzso in two patients, zzso occurred during burst suppression, and in one patient, no response before or during burst suppression was zzso The zzso zzso doses required to achieve zzso of zzso and/or burst suppression, whichever came first, ranged from zzso zzso with a mean of 14 zzso 6 zzso The patients maintained stable cardiovascular function while receiving the zzso dose of zzso and did not require zzso zzso 

zzso infusion, as per our described algorithm, is effective in terminating zzso status zzso This treatment is not associated with cardiovascular instability, even at doses resulting in burst zzso In the majority of cases, zzso of zzso occur before burst suppression is achieved on zzso
