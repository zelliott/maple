To develop a method for identifying the beginning and ending records of zzso in the automated medical records of the General zzso Research Database zzso 

Women's records from 1991 to 1999 were searched for codes from 17 pregnancy marker and 7 pregnancy outcome zzso Using the retrieved records, all possible pregnancy zzso combinations were formed per zzso For each zzso the difference in days between record event dates was zzso Restrictions were applied to select the combination with the earliest pregnancy marker mapped to the first outcome for each zzso zzso of the zzso identified multiple zzso per woman when zzso The zzso was evaluated by analyzing time between marker and outcome event dates of mapped zzso and by analyzing zzso pregnancy markers and zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were zzso zzso by general practitioner zzso visit codes as the earliest pregnancy marker and zzso by laboratory or procedure zzso zzso zzso to one per woman aged zzso years yielded zzso zzso zzso mapping success was greater than zzso zzso the zzso by weeks from earliest pregnancy marker to outcome and by pregnancy marker category showed two zzso in the zzso 2-3 weeks and 33 zzso 

zzso codes and time into zzso provides a useful tool for pregnancy identification in databases whose size prohibits the audit of printed zzso zzso of our zzso confirmed a high degree of mapping success and a sensible time distribution from pregnancy marker to zzso
