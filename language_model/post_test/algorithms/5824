The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of reduced zzso sampling rates on the zzso of a moving zzso puncture needle and to demonstrate the feasibility of zzso imaging in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

All experiments were performed in an open zzso zzso zzso MR images of a moving puncture needle were taken with different zzso sampling rates from zzso in zzso zzso The needle was submerged in a zzso basin and was zzso in motion with a zzso zzso sequence with an initial acquisition rate of zzso s per zzso An apparatus operated by a zzso unit enabled needle rotation and ensured zzso needle zzso The median forward zzso of the needle tip was 2 zzso To evaluate the depiction of the needle, artifact diameter of the needle, zzso ratio zzso and needle tip profiles zzso were zzso 

The needle position was determined with an zzso error of 3 zzso and a zzso error of zzso zzso with respect to the zzso orientation and the theoretically calculated zzso No significant correlation was found between the zzso and zzso A reduction of zzso update rates caused neither a significant reduction of zzso nor a significant increase in artifact diameter or blurring of the needle zzso 

The application of zzso imaging with update rates of greater than zzso is sufficient for the MR guidance of interventions with an zzso ratio zzso of the surrounding tissue and a target accuracy of zzso zzso zzso imaging can increase zzso resolution while ensuring zzso spatial resolution and image quality of the depicted zzso
