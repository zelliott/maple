A method to predict zzso field output factors zzso of zzso open beams for the zzso 41 linear accelerator has been zzso The procedure is similar to the zzso method but the zzso quantities corresponding to circular fields zzso zzso are calculated from one-dimensional zzso In this case the one-dimensional zzso are defined as zzso field zzso where one side remains constant and equal to the maximum field zzso The circular quantities are zzso obtained by inversion of the zzso equation which relates both the one-dimensional zzso and the circular zzso Two one-dimensional zzso were used to take into account the asymmetry between the zzso and y zzso systems zzso exchange zzso The resulting pair of circular functions zzso to the zzso and y zzso systems, zzso They contain all the information relative to head, air, and medium zzso scatter and, consequently, there is no need to account for the geometry of the head or fitting zzso Using the zzso method, the zzso for any zzso field can be calculated by zzso the obtained circular zzso To improve results, a procedure is given to account for corner zzso zzso zzso agree with data to within approximately zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed method is thus clinically acceptable for routine zzso Furthermore, the circular function calculation zzso could be extended to other zzso zzso
