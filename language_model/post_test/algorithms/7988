An innovative zzso technique has been developed to obtain optical zzso zzso of thin film zzso This technique is based on the zzso effect induced by zzso expansion of a zzso The thin and transparent zzso contacts a sample and when the sample is heated by zzso heat flows into the zzso The zzso expansion on sample side of the zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso Main advantage of this method is adaptable to measure any sample structure and this can be used for quality monitoring in thin film devices such as solar cells and optical zzso
