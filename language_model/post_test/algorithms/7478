zzso local changes to the airway wall surfaces from zzso zzso images is important in the study of diseases such as chronic zzso pulmonary zzso Current approaches segment the airways in the individual time point images and subsequently zzso per airway generation or perform branch matching to assess regional zzso In contrast, we propose an integrated approach zzso the time points simultaneously using a zzso zzso space and zzso optimal surface zzso The method combines information from all time points and zzso are matched locally at any position on the resulting zzso Visual inspection of the scans of 10 subjects showed increased tree length compared to the state of the art with little change in the amount of false zzso A large scale analysis of the airways of 374 subjects including a total of 1870 images showed significant correlation with lung function and high zzso of the zzso
