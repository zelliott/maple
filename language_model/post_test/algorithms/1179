As the ultimate source of genetic variation, spontaneous zzso is essential to evolutionary zzso zzso studies over several decades have revealed the dependence of evolutionary consequences of zzso on specific zzso properties, including zzso zzso rates, zzso and the effects of newly arising zzso on individual zzso zzso The recent resurgence of empirical effort to zzso these properties for diverse organisms has not achieved zzso zzso which have been obtained by methods that assume zzso are zzso in their effects on zzso are zzso Both because a general approach must allow for occurrence of zzso zzso even if these are rare, and because recent evidence demands it, we present a new method for zzso zzso zzso For the distribution of zzso effects, we retain zzso assumption of the gamma distribution, to take advantage of the flexibility of its zzso Because the conventional gamma is one zzso restricting it to zzso effects, we include an additional zzso zzso as an amount it is displaced from zzso zzso is accomplished by zzso chain zzso Carlo maximum zzso Through a limited set of simulations, we verify the accuracy of this zzso We apply it to analyze data on two zzso fitness components from a zzso zzso study of a Columbia zzso of zzso zzso in which 40 lines sampled in three generations were zzso zzso For these traits, U zzso zzso with zzso of zzso effects broadly spanning zero, such that roughly half the zzso reduce zzso zzso One evolutionary consequence of these results is lower extinction risks of small populations of zzso zzso than expected from the process of zzso zzso A comprehensive view of the evolutionary consequences of zzso will depend on zzso accounting for zzso as well as zzso zzso
