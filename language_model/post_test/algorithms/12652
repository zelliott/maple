In this paper, a new zzso map zzso based adaptation procedure is proposed to address the multiple watchman route problem with the restricted visibility range in the zzso domain zzso A watchman route is represented by a ring of connected zzso weights that zzso in W, while obstacles are considered by approximation of the shortest zzso The adaptation procedure considers a coverage of W by the ring in order to attract zzso toward uncovered parts of zzso The proposed procedure is zzso verified in a set of environments and several visibility zzso Performance of the procedure is compared with the zzso approach based on solutions of the art gallery problem and the consecutive traveling salesman zzso The experimental results show the suitability of the proposed procedure based on relatively simple supporting geometrical structures, enabling application of the zzso principles to watchman route problems in zzso
