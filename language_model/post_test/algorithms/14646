In order to obtain an accurate and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso image, zzso data need to be corrected for random zzso zzso zzso and Compton scattering of photons in the zzso and detector efficiency response or zzso The accuracy of these corrections strongly affects the quality of the PET zzso There is evidence that zzso zzso PET reconstruction is less sensitive than zzso reconstruction to inconsistencies between zzso data and zzso The purpose of this study is to analyze and discuss such experimental zzso In this work, inconsistent correction data zzso zzso absence of scatter correction and mismatched zzso zzso are introduced in experimental phantom zzso Both zzso and zzso reconstructed images are analyzed to examine the effect of flawed zzso The behavior of zzso reconstruction in respiratory artifacts, a very common example of inconsistency in the data, is studied in patient zzso zzso reconstruction is less sensitive to mismatched zzso zzso erroneous zzso and poorly estimated scatter zzso Such zzso depends strongly on the time resolution of the zzso PET zzso In particular, the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso correction inconsistencies is discussed, using a simulation of a simple model of respiratory zzso We expect new generations of PET zzso with improved time resolution, to be less and less sensitive to poor quality zzso scatter and zzso zzso This not only reduces artifacts in the PET image, but also opens the way to less stringent requirements for the quality of the CT image zzso either the equipment cost or the dose to the zzso and for the zzso protocols zzso or zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reconstruction can be beneficial in zzso such as zzso where a direct zzso measurement is not available and zzso correction can only be zzso
