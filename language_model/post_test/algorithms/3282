In this paper, the dynamics of elementary cellular zzso rule 42 is investigated in the zzso symbolic sequence zzso Rule 42, a member of zzso class II which was said to be simply as periodic before, actually defines a chaotic global zzso that is, rule 42 is zzso mixing on its global zzso and possesses the positive zzso zzso zzso rule 42 is chaotic in the sense of both zzso and zzso Meanwhile, the characteristic function and the basin tree zzso of rule 42 are explored for some finite length of zzso strings, which reveal its zzso zzso The method presented in this work is also zzso to studying the dynamics of other rules, especially the 112 zzso rules of the elementary cellular zzso
