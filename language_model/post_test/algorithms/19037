The propensity of four representative zzso of zzso zzso to bind an excess electron has been studied at the zzso zzso While isolated zzso zzso does not support stable zzso zzso in the gas phase, all considered neutral zzso of zzso form zzso stable zzso The type of an zzso zzso state, zzso the zzso zzso bound, or mixed zzso zzso depends on the internal hydrogen zzso pattern exhibited by a particular zzso The most stable zzso results from an electron attachment to the neutral zzso zzso The formation of this zzso is associated with a zzso zzso transfer triggered by electron attachment and the internal rotation around the zzso zzso The zzso electron affinity of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso while its vertical detachment energy is zzso zzso Our results are compared with the zzso spectrum zzso of zzso measured recently by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained for the most stable zzso structure matches well with the experimental electron binding energy region of maximum zzso A further understanding of DNA damage might require experimental and zzso studies on the systems in which zzso zzso are engaged in hydrogen zzso
