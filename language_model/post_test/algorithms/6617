zzso The influence of two different calculation zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso on dose distribution, as well as the zzso zzso zzso of the planning target volume zzso and the zzso at risk was analyzed for zzso of lung zzso 

zzso Between zzso and zzso three-dimensional treatment planning was done in ten patients with lung cancer zzso zzso zzso The zzso the zzso lung zzso and the zzso lung zzso were defined in each zzso CT slice zzso thickness 1 zzso zzso zzso for three-dimensional zzso technique were calculated using a zzso and a zzso algorithm, zzso zzso was in accordance with zzso zzso The zzso were analyzed relating the zzso zzso median and mean dose to the volumes of interest zzso 

zzso Median zzso amounted to zzso zzso Minimum dose within the zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso algorithm, only zzso of the zzso was included by the zzso zzso whereas zzso was included when the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Median volume of zzso amounted to 1 zzso zzso Mean dose to zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Median volume of zzso within the zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Median volume of zzso amounted to 1 zzso zzso Mean dose to zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Volume of zzso within the zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso The zzso and zzso calculation zzso result in different dose zzso in case of lung zzso Particularly the minimum dose to the zzso which may be relevant for tumor control, is significantly lower for zzso Since it is generally accepted that the zzso zzso describes secondary particle transport more exactly than zzso models, the use of the latter should be critically evaluated in the treatment planning of lung zzso
