A group of zzso muscles alternating with another group is a common element of motor control, including locomotor pattern zzso This study used computer simulation to investigate human zzso with each muscle assigned at times to a zzso zzso were generated by applying patterns of muscle zzso to a musculoskeletal model that includes the dynamic properties of the muscles, the limb zzso and the crank zzso zzso et zzso showed that zzso pedal reaction forces, and limb and crank zzso recorded during zzso start-up zzso could be zzso with two signals controlling the zzso of four muscle groups (1 group alternating with another to form a zzso Here a zzso control also is shown to replicate steady zzso However, simulations show that three signals controlling six muscle groups zzso 3 zzso is much more zzso zzso such that a wide variety of forward and backward zzso tasks can be executed zzso We found the zzso functions necessary for zzso and how these functions can be executed by the muscle zzso Specifically, the phasing of two pairs with respect to limb extension and zzso and the transitions between extension and zzso do not change with zzso zzso One pair of groups zzso hip and knee zzso alternating with their zzso zzso generates the energy required for limb and crank propulsion during limb extension and zzso zzso In the second pair, the ankle zzso transfer the energy from the limb inertia to the crank during the latter part of limb extension and the subsequent limb zzso zzso The zzso alternate with the zzso The phasing of the third pair (the zzso thigh zzso reverses with zzso zzso In forward zzso the hamstring is excited during the zzso transition and in backward zzso during the opposite zzso In both cases zzso propel the crank zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and propels the crank zzso through the zzso With three control signals, one for each pair of groups, different cadences (or power zzso can be achieved by adjusting the overall zzso drive to the pattern generating zzso and different zzso goals zzso smooth, or energy-efficient zzso zzso or zzso zzso by adjusting the relative zzso levels among the muscle zzso These six muscle groups are suggested to be elements of a general strategy for zzso control, which may be generally zzso to other human locomotor zzso
