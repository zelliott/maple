We zzso propose the multiple zzso transition zzso method zzso an zzso by which to estimate the stationary probability distribution from independent multiple molecular dynamics simulations with different zzso zzso to the potential of mean force calculation in combination with the umbrella sampling method are zzso First, the performance of the zzso is examined in the case of zzso Compared with the weighted zzso analysis method zzso the zzso has an advantage with respect to the reasonable evaluation of the stationary probability distribution even from zzso zzso This method is then applied to zzso zzso zzso
