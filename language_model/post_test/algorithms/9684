The purpose of the present study was to understand the effect of zzso variables of zzso zzso drug delivery systems zzso on the rapid dissolution of a model drug, zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso design was used to explore the main and interaction effect of several independent zzso variables including the amount of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso and dissolution percentage of zzso after 5 zzso and 30 zzso zzso were the dependent zzso A mathematical relationship, zzso zzso - zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso - zzso - zzso - zzso + zzso - zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained to explain the effect of all factors and their zzso on the dissolution of zzso at 5 zzso zzso zzso was then performed to maximize dissolution percentage of zzso at 5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was predicted to dissolution zzso of zzso at 5 zzso when zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A new batch was prepared according to the zzso zzso and the observed and predicted values of zzso were in close zzso In conclusion, the zzso experimental design allowed us to understand the effect of zzso variables on the rapid dissolution of zzso from zzso and zzso the zzso to obtain a rapid drug dissolution at 5 zzso
