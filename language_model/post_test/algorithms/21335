The ultrasound zzso zzso in known to increase with frequency in soft biological tissue within the diagnostic frequency zzso The frequency dependent zzso zzso is an important zzso in clinical tissue zzso especially in liver, and in zzso quantitative zzso zzso But, because of the random spatial variation in the zzso signal zzso the zzso zzso becomes very large, making it difficult to estimate the zzso slope from the zzso ultrasound zzso In this paper we suggest a new ultrasound zzso zzso based on the zzso log spectral zzso The proposed zzso process consists of Wiener zzso Kalman zzso and median filtering in this zzso The simulation results and experimental results with tissue equivalent zzso zzso show that combination of the above zzso yields a considerably reduced zzso zzso compared with the conventional zzso
