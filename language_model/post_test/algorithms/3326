A new method is proposed for zzso the equations of motion of an elastic zzso In the standard zzso and zzso zzso the zzso equations of motion are zzso in space and time, but it is then difficult to ensure that the zzso structure of the exact equations is zzso Here we zzso the zzso itself, expressed as a line integral over the zzso of the zzso This discrete representation of the zzso filament can then be integrated by one of the explicit zzso zzso frequently used in molecular zzso The model systematically zzso the zzso partial differential zzso but has the same level of zzso complexity as molecular dynamics and is zzso zzso tests show that the zzso is much more stable than a zzso zzso and can be used for high aspect ratio zzso such as zzso
