The purposes of this study were to validate a natural language processing program for extraction of recommendation features, such as recommended time frames and imaging technique, from electronic zzso reports and to assess patterns of recommendation features in a large database of zzso zzso 

This study was performed on a zzso reports database covering the years zzso From this database, 120 reports with and without recommendations were selected and zzso Two zzso independently classified these reports according to presence of recommendations, time frame, and imaging technique suggested for follow-up or repeated zzso The natural language processing program then was used to zzso the reports according to the same criteria used by the zzso The accuracy of zzso of recommendation features was zzso The program then was used to determine the patterns of recommendation features for different patients and imaging features in the entire database of zzso zzso 

The natural language processing program had an accuracy of zzso zzso for identifying the imaging technique recommended by the zzso for further zzso zzso of recommended time frames in the reports with the 88 recommendations obtained with the program resulted in 83 zzso accurate zzso and five zzso inaccurate zzso zzso of CT were most common zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by those for zzso zzso In most zzso zzso of the reports with imaging recommendations, however, zzso did not specify the time zzso 

zzso determination of recommended imaging techniques and time frames in a large database of zzso reports is possible with a natural language processing zzso Most imaging recommendations are for zzso but more accurate zzso zzso
