We simulate an zzso model that represents both the zzso and zzso of digital organisms with zzso zzso We show how open-ended growth of complexity arises from the zzso of genetic evolution operators with respect to changes in the complexity, and that the dynamics which emerges shows zzso indicative of a zzso critical zzso The mechanism is analogous to the development of the cascade in fluid zzso
