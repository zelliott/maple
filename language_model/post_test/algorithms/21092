A good understanding and characterization of the dose response relationship of any new compound is an important and ubiquitous problem in many areas of scientific zzso This is especially true in the context of pharmaceutical drug development, where it is mandatory to launch safe drugs which demonstrate a clinically relevant zzso zzso a dose too high may result in unacceptable safety problems, while selecting a dose too low may lead to ineffective zzso zzso finding studies thus play a key role in any drug development program and are often the zzso for large zzso zzso In this overview paper we focus on definitive and zzso dose finding studies in Phase II or III, reviewing relevant statistical design and analysis zzso In particular, we describe multiple comparison procedures, modeling approaches, and hybrid methods combining the advantages of zzso An outlook to zzso dose finding methods is also zzso We use a real data example to illustrate the methods, together with a brief overview of relevant zzso
