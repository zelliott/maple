MR zzso measures the displacement induced by the zzso radiation force and provides the location of the focal spot without significant heating zzso zzso maps obtained with MR zzso provide an indirect zzso of the acoustic beam intensity at the zzso This measure is essential for dose zzso prior to focused ultrasound treatments zzso and zzso focusing procedures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the latter case, the beam correction is achieved by maximizing the displacement at zzso A significant number of serial MR zzso images are required and thus, a partial zzso updating method, such as zzso appears as a method of zzso The purpose of this work is to demonstrate via simulations and experiments the efficiency of the zzso technique combined with a two-dimensional zzso MR zzso pulse zzso The method was implemented in an ex zzso calf brain taking advantage of the a zzso knowledge of the focal spot zzso The coincidence of the zzso axis with the longest axis of the focal spot makes the best use of the zzso Our approach rapidly provides the focal spot zzso with zzso and with a substantial increase to the zzso ratio, while reducing ultrasound energy needed during zzso zzso focusing zzso
