The purpose of the present study was to investigate oxygen mass transfer in the human carotid zzso focusing on the effects of the wall compliance and flow field on the zzso variation and spatial distribution of the oxygen wall zzso Details of unsteady zzso oxygen transport were examined zzso using a zzso model of the human carotid zzso and realistic blood flow zzso zzso reveal that zzso flow separation at the outer zzso carotid wall can significantly alter the flow field, oxygen tension field, and oxygen wall flux zzso At the outer wall of the zzso the Sherwood number, zzso zzso oxygen wall zzso takes on significantly lower values than at other sites due to the zzso of transport rates by zzso flow away from zzso More specifically, the lowest value of zzso was zzso approximately 6 (in the zzso which is much lower than the value of the zzso oxygen consumption rate zzso number, zzso in the zzso wall tissue zzso At the inner wall of the zzso zzso approximately 170 is far above the expected value of zzso This implies that flow separation on the outer wall of the zzso provides a very strong fluid mechanical barrier to oxygen zzso whereas at the inner wall of the zzso the mechanism of transport is controlled by the wall consumption zzso
