The purpose of this study was to obtain a zzso zzso release tablet that has a zzso release lag zzso When zzso is used as an zzso drug, administration time control is zzso A zzso release tablet is one of the effective approaches to modified release to reduce daily administration zzso In this study, a zzso release tablet of zzso was formulated by zzso acid dry coating around the core tablet including zzso The model zzso which had different content ratios of zzso in the zzso layer, were characterized by a dissolution zzso The results showed that the release lag time was generated with fast release zzso Various lag time controls of zzso were zzso from 60 to 310 zzso on average, by variation of outer layer zzso From an analysis of the relation between lag times and outer layer zzso the key ingredient for zzso of lag time was found to be zzso zzso To analyze the lag time generation zzso water penetration for tablet was zzso The results indicated that the penetration depth was zzso to the square root of time and the lag time formation mechanism was simple water penetration through the zzso of zzso acid to the tablet zzso The results also showed that the Washburn equation could be used to design the lag time of the zzso release tablet in this zzso In conclusion, novel release control technology using zzso acid was appropriate to obtain a zzso zzso release tablet that has well regulated lag zzso
