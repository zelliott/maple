zzso integration is a method to analyze umbrella sampling zzso It zzso zzso changes from zzso obtained from molecular zzso While it can be formulated on the full sampled zzso they are generally zzso by normal zzso This is equivalent to the zzso of a power series of the free energy with respect to the reaction coordinate after the zzso term or by a zzso of a zzso zzso Here, expressions for additional terms in the power series are zzso They can be calculated from the central moments of the zzso This extension allows to test the approximations in zzso
