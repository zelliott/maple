zzso of zzso and expression of zzso receptors have been reported in the zzso zzso tissue in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are putative zzso targets, and changes in tear film and zzso surface have also been zzso Our aim was to characterize the zzso profile of tears in patients with zzso disease zzso with and without zzso 

zzso samples were collected from 54 eyes of GO patients (age zzso zzso 18 eyes of zzso patients (age zzso zzso and 24 control eyes (age zzso zzso Patients underwent zzso examination including Clinical zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso normal zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by multiplex zzso array and release values were zzso 

The release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in GO patients compared to controls zzso There was a zzso increase of zzso zzso No significant differences were found in zzso release between the GO and zzso zzso In the GO group, significant positive correlation was found between zzso and the release of zzso and zzso into tears zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso release was significantly higher in GO than in zzso patients and was increased in both the zzso and GO groups compared to zzso 

zzso zzso balance has been observed in tears of GO zzso zzso of zzso into tears might be a useful indicator of disease activity in zzso
