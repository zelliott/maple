We carry out zzso second harmonic interference experiments using thin films of an organic dye as zzso optical zzso While the measured difference of zzso index between the fundamental and second harmonic zzso follows the theoretical expectation for air in a wide spectral region, anomalous zzso is observed when the second harmonic light lies in the zzso band of the zzso The sensitivity of the technique to small zzso index variations may prove useful for sensing applications as well as for testing models of light zzso in zzso zzso and absorbing zzso
