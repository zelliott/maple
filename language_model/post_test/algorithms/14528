zzso fish form zzso territories in a river during a zzso zzso zzso We build a cost-benefit theory to describe the breakdown and formation of zzso In the early stage of a growing season, all fish hold territories at low zzso Once all territory sites are occupied, excess fish become zzso When fish density further increases, a phase transition zzso all the territories suddenly break down and fish form a zzso In contrast, when the fish density is zzso territories are suddenly formed from the zzso Both theory and experiments demonstrate that zzso should exhibit a historical effect: the breakdown and formation processes of territory are largely zzso In particular, the theory in formation process predicts a specific fish behavior: an zzso territory zzso that tries to have a small territory emerges just before the formation of zzso
