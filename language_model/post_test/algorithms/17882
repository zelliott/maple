In linguistic collective decision, the main objective is to select the best alternatives using linguistic evaluations provided by multiple zzso This paper presents a collective decision model, which is able to deal with complex linguistic zzso In this decision model, the linguistic evaluations are represented by linguistic expressions which are the logic formulas obtained by applying logic zzso to the set of basic linguistic zzso The zzso of each linguistic expression is implicitly captured by a semantic similarity relation rather than a fuzzy set, since each linguistic expression determines a semantic similarity distribution on the set of basic linguistic zzso The basic idea of this collective decision model is to convert the semantic similarity zzso determined by linguistic expressions into probability zzso of the corresponding linguistic zzso The main advantage of this proposed model is its capability to deal with complex linguistic evaluations and partial semantic overlapping among neighboring linguistic zzso
