This paper explores how different zzso feature spaces might be represented in cortical zzso subject to continuity and zzso zzso Spaces explored included products of circular variables (such as zzso products of linear dimensions zzso zzso features (such as spatial zzso and products of zzso zzso zzso were generated using the zzso algorithm, with uniform or zzso stimulus zzso A zzso zzso was always assumed to be zzso zzso were run with and without zzso For uniform input zzso coverage uniformity zzso 1991 zzso zzso 65 zzso was used to measure how well the map was able to represent the feature zzso For zzso zzso a weighted measure of coverage uniformity was zzso Good coverage could be achieved for up to five or six zzso variables but was substantially worse for a similar number of zzso distributed zzso zzso For zzso maps of zzso stimuli with zzso zzso the distribution of receptive field zzso and the distribution of total activity evoked on the zzso matched the stimulus distribution zzso For zzso maps of zzso distributed zzso features there was an approximately linear relationship between the area of a map devoted to a specific feature and the probability of occurrence of the feature during zzso zzso from uniform zzso often led to improved zzso
