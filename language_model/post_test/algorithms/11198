This research is aimed at analyzing and improving automatic zzso error detection in a second zzso Dutch zzso spoken by adult non-native learners of Dutch are used as a test zzso A first study on Dutch zzso by zzso learners with different zzso revealed that vowel zzso errors are relatively frequent and often concern subtle acoustic differences between the realization and the target zzso In a second study automatic zzso error detection experiments were conducted to compare existing measures to a metric that takes account of the error patterns observed to capture relevant acoustic zzso The results of the two studies do indeed show that error patterns bear information that can be zzso employed in weighted automatic measures of zzso zzso In addition, it appears that combining such a weighted metric with existing measures improves the equal error rate by zzso percentage points from zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso algorithm, to zzso
