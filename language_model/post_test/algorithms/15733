We propose a new method of studying the correlation between zzso spike zzso This technique is based on the analysis of relative phase between two point zzso Relative phase here is defined as the relative timing difference between two spike trains zzso by the associated zzso zzso of one zzso This phase measurement is intended to reveal the relative timing relationship between spike trains at different firing zzso We apply this method to a zzso example and an example from two zzso zzso spike trains of a behaving zzso The results are compared with classical zzso zzso We show that the technique can avoid some of the limitations of zzso methods, reveal certain statistical zzso that cannot be shown by cross zzso and provide information as to the direction of influence between two spike zzso
