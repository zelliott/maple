An innovative zzso model for salient objects detection is zzso The model is based on the exploitation of the zzso property of images by means of zzso directional zzso The generalized zzso zzso and the discrete zzso transform zzso zzso are selected for this zzso An zzso map of an input image can be obtained by calculating the zzso zzso via local zzso zzso zzso the statistical property of the power spectrum of the zzso map on zzso scale, we find the power law is also appropriate for zzso zzso zzso a zzso map can be derived from the zzso residual zzso zzso objects are detected using a seeded region growing zzso Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are zzso The corresponding results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed zzso
