zzso zzso is emerging as an alternative approach for zzso zzso that can be preoperatively mobilized into the zzso We present our zzso zzso zzso series for all palpable zzso zzso regardless of their mobility into the zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed all patients who underwent zzso zzso during a zzso zzso Data collected included zzso and zzso zzso position, mobility of the zzso into the zzso preoperatively or with the patient under general zzso zzso of zzso zzso operative times and zzso 

A total of 88 zzso zzso were treated using single zzso incision zzso Mean patient age was zzso zzso Of the zzso 74 zzso could be zzso down to the zzso preoperatively and 14 zzso could zzso Of the 14 immobile zzso 8 were zzso and 6 were in the superficial zzso zzso zzso zzso was successful in all 74 zzso that were mobilized into the zzso zzso However, 6 of 14 zzso zzso that could not be moved to the zzso were effectively managed by a single zzso zzso while 8 zzso required an additional groin incision for successful zzso No complications were observed during a mean followup of zzso zzso 

zzso using a zzso approach is a viable alternative for palpable zzso zzso that can be preoperatively mobilized into the zzso zzso zzso that are palpable but cannot be moved to the zzso can be managed by the zzso approach alone in zzso of cases or with an additional groin incision in zzso
