This paper presents a new automatic feature extraction technique and a neural network based zzso method for recognition of rotating zzso The image processing technique extracts global features of an image and converts a large size image into a one-dimensional small zzso A special advantage of the proposed technique is that the extracted features are the same even if the original image is rotated with rotation angles from 5 to zzso or rotated and a little bit zzso The proposed technique is based on simple zzso zzso fuzzy sets and neural zzso The proposed approach is very easy in zzso and it has been developed in zzso on a Sun zzso The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach performs successfully on a variety of small as well as large scale rotated and distorted zzso
