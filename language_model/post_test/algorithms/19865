Available zzso zzso zzso sets for zzso infusion zzso were derived from populations with normal zzso The performance and accuracy of the models devised by zzso and colleagues and Scott and colleagues were evaluated in a population including zzso obese zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso and colleagues' model was administered to 10 obese and six non-obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso The initial zzso target concentration was 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso were sampled from zzso onset to 220 zzso after its zzso zzso software calculated predicted zzso zzso Data were zzso with a zzso zzso model zzso version zzso including calculations of the median performance error zzso and the median absolute performance error zzso Scott and colleagues' model was evaluated zzso 

Using zzso and colleagues' model, zzso and zzso zzso for the whole population were zzso and zzso zzso With Scott and colleagues' model, zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso We created a zzso model with zzso as the zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and colleagues' zzso set underestimated the predicted zzso in our zzso population, but its bias and accuracy were acceptable for clinical zzso Scott and colleagues' model was zzso The zzso model seemed to be more accurate during the infusion and for high zzso but it needs to be validated in a larger zzso
