We propose a system that is capable of detailed analysis of eye region images in terms of the position of the zzso degree of zzso zzso and the shape, complexity, and texture of the zzso The system uses a zzso eye region model that zzso the fine structure and motion of an zzso The structure parameters represent structural individuality of the eye, including the size and color of the zzso the zzso zzso and complexity of the zzso the zzso of the zzso below the eye, and the zzso of the zzso reflection on the zzso The motion parameters represent movement of the eye, including the zzso position of the upper and lower eyelids and the zzso position of the zzso The system first registers the eye model to the input in a particular frame and zzso it by adjusting the structure zzso The system then tracks motion of the eye by zzso the motion parameters across the entire image zzso Combined with image stabilization to compensate for appearance changes due to head motion, the system achieves accurate registration and motion recovery of zzso
