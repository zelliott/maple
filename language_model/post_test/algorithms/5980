The development of a zzso precise and accurate zzso method for the determination of zzso in tuna fish samples is zzso The method is based on the use of isotope dilution zzso with electron impact zzso a widespread technique in routine testing zzso A certified spike containing zzso zzso was used for the isotope dilution of the zzso After extraction of the zzso from the sample, zzso was zzso using sodium zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso were sampled from the zzso for 15 zzso For isotope zzso the molecular zzso zzso was used in the SIM zzso Five molecular zzso were zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The detection at masses corresponding to zzso was used to correct for m + 1 contributions of zzso from the organic groups attached to the mercury atom on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso masses with simple mathematical zzso and the concentration of zzso was calculated on the basis of the corrected zzso isotope zzso The zzso zzso spike was applied, with satisfactory results, to the determination of zzso in the certified reference material zzso zzso The method was successfully applied to the determination of zzso in tuna fish samples, and the obtained results were included in the zzso zzso exercise, organized by the Institute for zzso Materials and zzso zzso zzso zzso with excellent agreement between our results and the average obtained by the other zzso
