A visible atmospheric optical depth of zzso was measured by the Spirit zzso at zzso crater and by the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso depth decreased by about zzso to zzso per zzso through both zzso primary zzso The vertical distribution of atmospheric dust at zzso crater was consistent with uniform zzso with a measured scale height of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cross section weighted mean radius was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso of visible optical depths with zzso optical depths shows a zzso optical depth ratio of zzso zzso zzso for comparison with previous monitoring of infrared optical zzso
