A project that originated with the aim of documenting the implications of dropouts for tests of significance based on general linear mixed model procedures resulted in recognition of problems in the use of zzso zzso for this zzso In responding to suggestions and zzso we have further analyzed simulated clinical trial data with realistic zzso structure, using alternative error model zzso different approaches to the use of zzso to model dropout patterns, and different ways to include the critical time variable in the mixed zzso zzso emphasize the sensitivity of the zzso tests of significance for GROUP and TIME zzso GROUP equal slopes hypothesis to less than optimal modeling of the error zzso zzso Even with the zzso recommended best available modeling of the error structure, model zzso that made use of the zzso statement did not maintain conservative test sizes when zzso were required to model dropout data zzso Random zzso models that employed the zzso statement did permit appropriate zzso controls, but the tests of significance for treatment effects were lacking in zzso After examining a variety of alternative zzso model zzso it is concluded that none provided both Type I error protection and power comparable to that of simple zzso analysis of zzso zzso procedures for confirming the presence of true treatment effects in controlled clinical zzso Other issues examined in this article concern treating baseline scores as both zzso and initial repeated measurement to which a linear means model is zzso failure to take advantage of the zzso of repeated zzso on time in modeling time as an zzso zzso zzso and fitting linear zzso models to zzso response zzso
