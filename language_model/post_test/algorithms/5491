The aim of this work is to evaluate zzso accuracy of a new treatment zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso array zzso Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, zzso zzso is able to enhance dynamic zzso arcs with zzso planned zzso zzso plans for various sites zzso and zzso were constructed and after that these plans were zzso for the zzso zzso array with zzso Carlo zzso and zzso zzso zzso dose zzso in zzso zzso zzso All zzso of these zzso plans were performed with 6 zzso zzso beams of a zzso accelerator zzso zzso zzso using the zzso device without and with an insert containing an zzso zzso zzso of the absolute dose zzso measured and calculated in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso at the cylinder of the zzso zzso array for zzso plans gives good agreement, even for the zzso dose difference and 2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso calculations significantly differ from the zzso zzso so that the zzso zzso is found to be superior to the zzso zzso in the calculation of the zzso zzso One of the drawbacks of the zzso calculations in zzso zzso zzso is the too large arc step size of zzso Use of a finer angular resolution may improve the zzso results zzso
