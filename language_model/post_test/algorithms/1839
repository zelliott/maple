zzso zzso treatment requires the fast and zzso identification of zzso zzso We evaluated a modified protocol for the rapid identification of clinical zzso zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we evaluated a simplified extraction procedure using 54 clinical zzso zzso Second, we validated a new protocol with this simplified extraction procedure and lower identification threshold by zzso 167 zzso with either zzso or conventional identification zzso zzso analysis with both the standard and short extraction procedure yielded identical identification results, although the zzso were lower with the zzso With the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a correct identification as compared to conventional identification zzso A total of 135 out of the zzso zzso correct identifications showed zzso above zzso which we considered as the minimum zzso for secure species zzso The rapid identification of clinical zzso zzso is crucial in patient zzso The zzso technique using a short extraction procedure can be an alternative for the zzso standard zzso although the zzso will be zzso The identification of clinical zzso zzso with the modified protocol is a practical and accurate alternative for conventional identification zzso If the isolate shows a zzso below zzso the standard extraction procedure should be zzso
