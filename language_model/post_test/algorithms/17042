zzso measures of the zzso of an zzso method are defined as zzso the zzso zzso of a method is the square root of the mean of the square of the zzso of the response curve from a straight line, where the straight line is chosen to minimize the zzso The zzso zzso is defined as the zzso zzso divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum zzso zzso These definitions may be used to develop practical criteria for zzso that are still zzso zzso of the zzso requires a method of zzso In this article, we use zzso zzso to demonstrate calculations, but the definition of zzso also zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso
