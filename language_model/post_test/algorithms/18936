zzso zzso comparative molecular field analysis zzso and comparative molecular similarity zzso analysis zzso were undertaken for a series of zzso zzso derivatives to correlate zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso structural properties of 22 known zzso zzso models with considerable internal as well as external zzso ability were zzso The relevant zzso zzso zzso for modeling each protein zzso zzso zzso zzso activity were selected by genetic zzso zzso and multiple linear zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso space brings different zzso for each zzso zzso and suggests the atomic properties relevant for the zzso to interact with each zzso active zzso zzso and zzso were developed with a focus on zzso ability using zzso zzso zzso zzso produced significantly better results for all zzso The results indicate a strong correlation between the zzso activity of the modeled compounds and the zzso and zzso donor fields around zzso
