An important prerequisite for the zzso Care Model is to be able to zzso in a zzso simple and inexpensive way, the population with a chronic condition that needs proactive and planned zzso We investigated if a set of administrative data could be used to identify patients with zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease in a Danish zzso 

Seven general practices were asked to identify patients with known zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease in their zzso For the zzso patients zzso zzso we used administrative data on hospital admissions for zzso diagnoses, redeemed prescriptions for zzso drugs and zzso function tests combined to develop an zzso that identified the highest proportion of patients with zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease with the fewest criteria zzso We tested nine different zzso combining two to four zzso The simplest zzso with highest positive zzso value identified zzso patients zzso zzso with possible diagnosis of zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease in five general zzso The doctors were asked to confirm the zzso The same zzso identified zzso patients whom were asked to confirm their diagnosis zzso zzso 

In population A the chosen zzso had a positive zzso value of zzso and three criteria: a) discharged patients with a chronic zzso diagnosis at least once during the preceding 5 years; or b) redeemed prescription of zzso at least twice during the preceding 12 zzso or c) at least two zzso performed at different dates during the preceding 12 zzso In population B the positive zzso value was zzso zzso and the sensitivity zzso zzso when the zzso were added to where doctors agreed with the zzso For the zzso respondents in population C, the positive zzso value was zzso zzso and the sensitivity zzso zzso 

An zzso based on administrative data has been developed and validated with sufficient positive zzso value to be used as a tool for identifying patients with zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso Some of the identified patients had other chronic zzso zzso The zzso should mostly be regarded as a tool for identifying chronic zzso and further development of the zzso is zzso
