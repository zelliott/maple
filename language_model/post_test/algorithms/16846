Single channel noise reduction has been well investigated and seems to have reached its limits in terms of speech zzso improvement, however, the quality of such schemes can still be zzso This study tests to what extent novel zzso processing schemes might improve performance in particular for zzso noise zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso were compared to a state-of-the-art zzso minimum statistics zzso A speech zzso test, preference rating, and listening effort zzso were zzso Additionally, three objective quality measures for the zzso background, and overall zzso were zzso For a better comparison of all zzso particular attention was given to the usage of the similar zzso gain zzso 

The zzso investigation was performed with zzso zzso zzso 

The results revealed that the zzso zzso and the auditory zzso zzso did not affect speech zzso whereas the zzso zzso slightly decreased zzso In terms of zzso quality, both zzso zzso perform better than the zzso condition and the reference in particular for highly zzso noise zzso 

Data support the hypothesis that zzso zzso are promising for improving performance in zzso noise zzso
