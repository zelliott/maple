To determine whether bovine zzso given in cases of severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso improves zzso 

zzso study with 19 patients, followed by a zzso zzso comparison of zzso with a standardized treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso at 48 zzso secondary zzso zzso at 2, 4, 12, and 24 zzso survival, survival without rescue, days on zzso zzso analyzed by analysis of zzso to identify patients who might benefit from zzso 

zzso study in 19 reference centers for zzso 

Children after the 44th zzso week and under 14 years old, admitted for at least 4 zzso zzso for zzso zzso and without heart failure or chronic lung zzso In the zzso study 35 patients were zzso 20 were zzso to the zzso group and 15 to the zzso zzso zzso recruitment of patients led to a preliminary end of this zzso 

Administration of 100 zzso bovine zzso zzso under continuous ventilation and zzso as soon as the zzso ratio dropped to less than 100 for 2 h (in the pilot study increments of 50 zzso as long as the zzso did not increase by zzso A second equivalent dose within 48 h was zzso 

In the pilot study the zzso increased by a mean of 100 at 48 h zzso A higher zzso ratio was observed in the zzso group 2 h after the first dose zzso from baseline zzso zzso at 48 h there was a trend towards a higher ratio zzso from baseline zzso zzso The rate of rescue therapy was significantly lower in the zzso zzso zzso criteria were not affected by a second zzso dose zzso A significant difference in zzso in favor of zzso at 48 h was found in the zzso with an initial zzso ratio higher than 65 and in patients without zzso zzso zzso therapy in severe zzso improves zzso immediately after zzso This improvement is sustained only in the zzso of patients without pneumonia and that with an initial zzso ratio higher than 65
