We analyze the three-dimensional structure of proteins by a computer program that finds regions of sequence that contain module zzso defining a module as a segment of zzso chain bounded in space by a specific given zzso The program defines a set of zzso zzso that have the property that if an zzso were to be placed into each zzso region, the protein would be dissected into a set of zzso all less than the specified zzso We test a set of 32 zzso all of ancient origin, and a corresponding set of zzso zzso positions, to ask if there is a statistically significant excess of zzso positions within the zzso zzso For zzso zzso a standard size used historically, we find such an zzso with P zzso zzso This correlation is neither due to a compositional or sequence bias in the zzso regions nor to a surface bias in zzso zzso Furthermore, a subset of 20 zzso which can be zzso identified as old, lies even more explicitly within the zzso regions, with P zzso zzso Thus, there is a strong correlation between zzso positions and three-dimensional structural elements of ancient proteins as expected by the zzso zzso We then study a range of module diameters and show that, as the diameter varies, significant zzso of correlation appear for module diameters centered at zzso zzso and zzso zzso These preferred module diameters roughly zzso to predicted zzso sizes of 15, 22, and 30 zzso Thus, there are significant correlations between zzso zzso and a zzso pattern of the lengths of zzso zzso which is the prediction of the zzso zzso of zzso
