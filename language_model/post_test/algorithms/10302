We developed a potential distribution model for the tropical rain forest species of primates of southern zzso the black zzso monkey zzso zzso the zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso and the zzso monkey zzso zzso To do so, we applied the maximum zzso zzso from the ecological niche modeling program zzso For each species, we used occurrence records from scientific collections, and published and unpublished sources, and we also used the 19 environmental coverage variables related to zzso and temperature from zzso to develop the zzso The predicted distribution of zzso zzso was strongly associated with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter zzso whereas the potential zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were strongly associated with zzso during the zzso quarter zzso and zzso zzso The potential distribution of zzso zzso is broader than that of the zzso zzso The areas with the greatest probability of presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are strongly associated with zzso zzso whereas the presence of zzso zzso is more strongly associated with the presence of rain zzso Our most significant contribution is the identification of areas with a high probability of the presence of these zzso species, which is information that can be applied to planning future studies and then establishing criteria for the creation of areas to zzso conservation in zzso
