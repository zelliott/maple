The zzso based on phantom and zzso scatter factors for high energy zzso beams is deduced using a phase space zzso The phantom scatter factors zzso depend on the field size and shape at the level of the phantom and are generally considered independent of the zzso details used to form the desired field provided the effect of contaminant electrons can be zzso As demonstrated in this work, this zzso leads to the zzso of the Clarkson method in irregular zzso However, for a given field formed with a zzso zzso it is not a zzso clear that the variations of zzso radiation due to secondary zzso setting do not affect the phantom scatter correction zzso In fact, the zzso radiation has a lower mean energy than that of zzso zzso and this radiation can reach points well outside the radiation field increasing the zzso phantom zzso Besides, transmission through the blocks contributes to phantom zzso zzso for a given zzso field, the associated phantom scatter dose, per unit of zzso in air on the central zzso should in principle increase when enlarging the secondary zzso zzso To confirm this, zzso zzso data for 6 zzso photons were measured at 10 zzso depth in water, reducing with zzso blocks several fields formed with the secondary zzso In particular, when a 30 zzso 30 zzso zzso field is reduced with blocks to a 7 zzso 7 zzso field, the dose per unit of zzso in air is zzso higher than that of the square zzso field zzso the given block zzso Our calculations indicate that in this case the block transmission accounts for only zzso of this zzso showing that the remaining effect is due to zzso zzso As a concluding remark, this work contributes to a better understanding of the classical Clarkson method for irregular fields giving, zzso a formal interpretation of the commonly used zzso
