The secondary structure of six bovine lens protein zzso zzso zzso three beta and one zzso are examined in solution and in solid forms for the first time using zzso zzso Films of the nuclear and cortical regions of the bovine lens are also zzso The structure is zzso estimated from the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso profile achieved by zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso zzso All the protein zzso fold predominantly in a zzso sheet structure with little or no zzso zzso in solution or in zzso solid zzso These proteins also retain their zzso zzso zzso in the cellular zzso environment of the zzso in conformity with the structure obtained for all the zzso species examined to zzso Despite structural zzso zzso data indicate subtle structural differences within each class of the zzso probably due to presence of several minor zzso zzso high amounts of turns zzso zzso observed in the zzso may have a fundamental implication in stabilizing the zzso structure of the uniquely zzso vital for the transparency of the zzso These proteins in solid zzso undergo a major structural change, induced primarily by zzso interactions which zzso them in a zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso procedures has proven to be an effective tool to obtain structural information of proteins in solution, as solid zzso or in a complex biological zzso such as zzso zzso
