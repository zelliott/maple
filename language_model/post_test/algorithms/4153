This paper develops a method for zzso detection of breast zzso boundaries by combining the snake evolution techniques with statistical texture information of zzso We propose an efficient image energy function in zzso based on image features, zzso textural features and four zzso zzso The zzso results were evaluated by using area error zzso The image features were evaluated zzso by using the zzso ratio and zzso dimension zzso In our study, standard zzso zzso and zzso are indicated as being the most relevant image zzso
