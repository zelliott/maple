High zzso parallel sequencing, zzso has recently emerged as an appealing alternative to zzso in identifying zzso expressed genes zzso between biological zzso However, there still exists considerable zzso on gene expression zzso and zzso results between the two zzso The objective of this study was to compare parallel zzso zzso and zzso data generated on zzso zzso treated zzso colon cancer cells with an additional simulation zzso 

We first performed general correlation analysis comparing gene expression profiles on both zzso An zzso zzso zzso model was subsequently applied to assess zzso and fixed biases between the two zzso Then several existing zzso designed for zzso identification in zzso and zzso data, were applied to compare the zzso zzso with respect to zzso lists, which were further validated using zzso zzso on selected zzso zzso analyses were subsequently conducted using zzso zzso Analysis zzso 

zzso and zzso correlation zzso between the zzso and zzso data each exceeded zzso with zzso overlap of genes on both zzso The zzso zzso model indicated the existence of both fixed and zzso biases between the two zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the SAM and zzso zzso zzso achieved the highest zzso overlap rate in zzso results from both experimental and simulated zzso zzso method exhibited a better control on the false discovery rate than zzso on the simulated zzso although it performed slightly inferior to zzso in the sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso data, confirmed the expected reversal of zzso gene suppression after treating zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways were identified by both zzso and zzso data, 152 pathways by zzso data only, and none by zzso data zzso 

These results suggest that zzso has advantages over zzso in identification of zzso with the most consistent results generated from zzso and SAM zzso The zzso zzso model reveals both fixed and zzso biases between zzso and zzso This may explain in part the lower zzso overlap in zzso lists compared to those in zzso zzso
