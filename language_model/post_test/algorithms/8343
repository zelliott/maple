A hypothetical model of the zzso zzso protein of human zzso virus zzso is proposed that is derived from the known structure of the influenza TM protein zzso This model is consistent with computer zzso of predicted protein structure and with known properties of TM proteins determined by sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso It is zzso to a wide variety of zzso TM proteins differing widely in overall molecular zzso
