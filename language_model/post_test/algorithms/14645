The partial zzso zzso for molecular dynamics and zzso Carlo simulations samples a wide range of an important part of the potential zzso Although it is a strong technique for structure prediction of zzso the choice of the partial potential energy has not been zzso In order to find the best choice, partial zzso molecular dynamics simulations of an zzso zzso in explicit water zzso were performed with 15 trial choices for the partial potential zzso The best choice was found to be the sum of the zzso zzso and zzso potential energies between zzso zzso In this case, the partial zzso simulation sampled all of the zzso zzso states of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and C states and visited these states most zzso Furthermore, backbone zzso angles zzso and zzso rotated very zzso It is also found that the most important term among these three terms is the zzso potential energy and that the zzso term also helps the simulation to overcome the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso simulation sampled all of the six states, but visited these states fewer zzso Conventional zzso simulation sampled only four of the six zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
