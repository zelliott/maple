A new modification of the dynamic zzso zzso zzso delivery technique for zzso therapy zzso is zzso This technique enables the tracking of a target moving through zzso translations in a zzso trajectory in the zzso eye zzso The accuracy of the delivery versus that of deliveries with no tracking and of zzso tracking techniques is zzso with clinically derived zzso beams zzso Leaf zzso calculated in the zzso frame were zzso synchronized assuming regular target zzso This allowed the leaves defined in the zzso frame to simultaneously follow the target motion and to deliver the required zzso without violation of the leaf zzso zzso The leaves are synchronized until the zzso of the leaf position at every instant is less than a calculated zzso The delivered zzso in the zzso frame was calculated with a simple zzso zzso The new zzso tracking technique was compared with the delivered zzso produced by zzso deliveries and by zzso tracking deliveries for 33 clinical zzso For the clinical zzso zzso to a maximum zzso of 200 zzso the zzso difference between the desired and the delivered zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the case of a zzso delivery, zzso zzso zzso zzso for the case where only the primary component of motion was corrected and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso tracking zzso The residual error is due to zzso and sampling zzso The zzso tracking delivery technique requires an increase in the delivery time evaluated as between 0 and 50% of the zzso delivery time for each beam with a mean increase of zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso tracking zzso delivery technique allows an zzso zzso to be delivered to moving targets with increased accuracy and with acceptable increases in delivery zzso When combined with real-time knowledge of the target motion at delivery time, this technique zzso improved target zzso relative to zzso deliveries and allows zzso margin zzso
