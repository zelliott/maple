The zzso of activated muscles may stabilize a loaded joint by preventing zzso from causing large zzso and injuring the zzso Here the elbow muscle recruitment patterns were compared with the zzso loaded vertically (a potentially unstable zzso zzso zzso and with horizontal zzso zzso healthy subjects were studied with the zzso vertical and zzso and the elbow zzso approximately 90 zzso In the first experiment zzso zzso recorded activity of zzso zzso and zzso muscles for joint zzso produced zzso by voluntarily exerting a horizontal force zzso zzso by voluntarily flexing and extending the elbow while the zzso was loaded vertically with zzso The relationship between the zzso and the zzso generated was zzso by the linear zzso slope and zzso zzso In a second experiment a vertical load increasing zzso with time up to zzso was zzso In experiment 1 the zzso relationships for biceps and zzso had an intercept about zzso of maximum voluntary effort greater with the vertical compared to the horizontal force, the inverse was found for zzso but the zzso slopes for both zzso and zzso muscles were not zzso In experiment 2 there were 29 trials with minimal elbow displacement and all the three muscles activated on the order of zzso of maximum zzso to stabilize the zzso 19 trials had small elbow extension and 14 trials small zzso requiring altered muscle forces for zzso 7 trials ended in large unstable displacement or early termination of the zzso An analysis indicate that the observed levels of muscle zzso would only provide stability if the zzso short-range zzso was at the high end of the published range, hence the elbow was marginally zzso The stability analysis also indicated that the small elbow extension increased stability and zzso decreased zzso
