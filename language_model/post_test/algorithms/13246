Two methods for volume flow calculation from images of methane leakages to the atmosphere are zzso The images contain zzso gas concentration zzso path length zzso information, and are processed with a block matching method and a theoretical zzso field zzso zzso from known methane flow in two laboratory zzso and one unknown real leakage from a gas processing plant are compared with the image processing zzso The methods are generic and can be implemented in common infrared systems for gas zzso This work provides a new tool for zzso and reporting volume flow emissions from gas processing plants to the zzso
