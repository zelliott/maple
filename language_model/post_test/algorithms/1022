The role of cooperative interactions between individual structural regulatory units zzso of thin filaments (7 zzso zzso : 1 zzso : 1 zzso zzso on zzso zzso force was zzso Native zzso C zzso was extracted from single, zzso rabbit zzso zzso and replaced by zzso of zzso rabbit skeletal zzso zzso and zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso that disrupt zzso coordination at zzso sites I and II zzso Control experiments in zzso indicated that, in the absence of zzso both zzso and zzso bind with similar apparent affinity to zzso thin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 100 % zzso did not develop zzso zzso In zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso force increased in a greater than linear manner with the fraction of zzso This suggests that zzso binding to functional zzso can spread zzso beyond the seven zzso of an zzso into zzso units, and the data suggest that this functional unit zzso size is up to zzso zzso As the number of zzso was zzso zzso sensitivity of force zzso decreased zzso The slope of the zzso relation (the Hill zzso zzso also decreased when the zzso mixture contained zzso 50 % zzso With 15 % zzso in the zzso mixture, zzso was reduced to zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with 100 % zzso indicating that most of the cooperative thin filament zzso was zzso The results suggest that cooperative zzso of skeletal muscle zzso occurs primarily through spread of zzso to zzso zzso along the thin filament (via zzso zzso zzso
