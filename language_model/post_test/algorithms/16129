We describe a zzso zzso method for using zzso zzso data to zzso population structure and assign individuals to zzso We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be zzso each of which is characterized by a set of zzso zzso at each zzso zzso in the sample are assigned zzso to zzso or jointly to two or more populations if their zzso indicate that they are zzso Our model does not assume a particular zzso process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic zzso provided that they are not closely zzso zzso of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to zzso studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and zzso zzso We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of zzso , seven zzso zzso in an example using zzso data from an endangered bird zzso The software used for this article is available from zzso approximately zzso zzso
