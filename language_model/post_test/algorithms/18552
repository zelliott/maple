Multiple zzso variables are commonly used in medical and zzso research to measure specific aspects of human health and zzso To analyze such data, models have been developed considering these zzso variables as imperfect indicators of an zzso zzso status of health or zzso In this article, the zzso class zzso model is used to model the relationship between zzso a zzso class variable (the zzso status of health or zzso and the observed indicators zzso variables from a zzso The Cox model is extended to zzso a zzso class variable as predictor of zzso while using information about zzso class membership available from multiple zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is employed to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, and standard errors are calculated based on the profile likelihood, treating the zzso baseline hazard as a nuisance zzso A zzso method for model checking is zzso It allows for zzso investigation of the assumption of zzso hazards across zzso zzso It may also be used for checking other model zzso such as no additional effect of the observed indicators given zzso zzso The usefulness of the model framework and the proposed techniques are illustrated in an analysis of data from the Women's Health and Aging Study concerning the effect of severe mobility disability on zzso for elderly zzso
