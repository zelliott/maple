In this paper, a spatial zzso model is proposed to locate sensors for detecting zzso patterns of special nuclear material zzso zzso In order to ship the nuclear materials from a source location with zzso production to a target city, the smugglers must employ global and domestic logistics zzso This paper focuses on locating a limited set of fixed and mobile radiation sensors in a transportation network, with the intent to maximize the expected information gain and minimize the zzso error for the subsequent nuclear material detection zzso A Kalman zzso framework is adapted to assist the zzso in zzso the zzso information gain and zzso flow zzso zzso
