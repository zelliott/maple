In this paper we are concerned with elastic image zzso Usually, elastic approaches assume constant material parameters and result in a smooth displacement zzso However, a constant choice has its shortcomings for images with varying elastic properties, like bones and soft zzso The proposed method allows for zzso varying material zzso 

The proposed zzso registration scheme is based on a zzso of the template zzso Individual material properties can be assigned to each segmented zzso The proposed variable elastic zzso leads to a displacement field which is adapted to the locally chosen material zzso 

The capability of this approach is demonstrated by a synthetic and by real-life examples in two zzso For all examples the proposed method is compared to a conventional scheme where the material parameters are zzso in the entire image zzso 

A method for zzso registration which supports zzso varying elastic properties such as zzso or Young's zzso in certain image regions is zzso It allows for registration results to be more realistic compared to conventional zzso Also, for a particular structure, an zzso preservation of volume or shape can be zzso
