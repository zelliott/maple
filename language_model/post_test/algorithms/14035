zzso examinations of neurotransmitter systems in the brain have to be comparable between zzso to generate a comprehensive data pool, zzso for zzso zzso zzso effects on quantitative evaluations and corresponding methods for compensation, however, have been insufficiently zzso Previous studies have shown that quantitative results may vary significantly according to the imaging equipment used, thereby affecting clinical interpretation of the zzso The aim of this study was to determine correction factors for common zzso combinations based on zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso phantom to compensate for the effects of different zzso zzso zzso The latter may serve as a model for human studies of the zzso zzso 

The zzso and background chambers of a commercially available phantom zzso zzso were filled with zzso zzso zzso encompassing specific zzso ratios from zzso to zzso This setup was zzso with the following four zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 fitted with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and Philips zzso 3,000 fitted with zzso zzso zzso using zzso protocols for acquisition and zzso All scans were automatically zzso to a zzso template of the phantom and zzso using a zzso volume of interest zzso map based on a CT scan of the zzso All zzso ratios calculated by zzso were compared with the true ratios calculated from the zzso in a well zzso zzso analyses were performed and recovery correction factors between measured and true ratios zzso 

The relation between true and measured ratios could be sufficiently described by a linear zzso for each zzso combination without relevant improvement when using zzso zzso zzso zzso The recovery correction factors and standard errors were zzso for the Philips zzso 3,000, zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso Percentage recovery ranged from zzso to zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso zzso phantom with various imaging devices revealed linear correlations between measured and true zzso zzso Based on these findings, adjustment of quantitative results between different equipment seems possible, provided that zzso reconstruction and evaluation are adequately zzso The use of identical evaluation methods in phantom and patient studies zzso shape, size and location of the zzso might allow transfer of the calculated correction factors from phantom to studies of the zzso system in zzso
