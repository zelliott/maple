This paper presents a zzso zzso model of colon for collision detection and zzso of the colon zzso for zzso zzso The prevailing marching cubes zzso for zzso surface construction can provide a high resolution mesh of triangular elements of the colon zzso from CT zzso But a well organized mesh structure reflecting the geometric information of the colon is essential to fast and accurate zzso of contact between the zzso and zzso and the corresponding reflective force in the zzso zzso The colon is modeled as zzso arrangement of triangular elements with its surface along the zzso of the zzso All the zzso are zzso according to the zzso angle along the zzso so that the zzso around the viewpoint can be found zzso The zzso zzso colon model has zzso triangular elements compared to zzso of the model constructed by the marching cubes zzso
