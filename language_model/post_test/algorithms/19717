A method is described for the refinement of rough protein models based on finding a selection of structural fragments that match the zzso Unlike most zzso methods, these are not necessarily zzso in the sequence and form a zzso zzso that covers most of the zzso The zzso positions of the fragments are then used as a target for the model atoms to generate a revised model which is used as the basis of a subsequent pattern definition and zzso The method was shown to improve the recognition of the native fold in a series of zzso largely as a result of improved secondary structure zzso
