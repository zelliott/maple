zzso zzso and its hybrids are very important for the cellulose and paper industry mainly due to their low zzso content and frost zzso However, rooting of zzso of this species is recalcitrant and zzso zzso application is often necessary for good root zzso To date one of the most accurate methods available for gene expression analysis is quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso however, reliable use of this technique requires reference genes for zzso There is no single reference gene that can be regarded as universal for all experiments and biological zzso Thus, the identification of reliable reference genes must be done for every species and experimental zzso The present study aimed at identifying suitable control genes for zzso of gene expression associated with zzso rooting in zzso zzso zzso 

By the use of two distinct zzso zzso and zzso we have assessed gene expression stability of zzso candidate reference genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The candidate reference genes were evaluated in zzso rooted in zzso in presence or absence of zzso along six zzso spanning the process of zzso zzso Overall, the stability profiles of these genes determined with each one of the zzso were very zzso Slight differences were observed in the most stable pair of genes indicated by each program: zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso Both programs identified zzso and zzso as the most variable zzso To validate these results and select the most suitable reference zzso the expression profile of the zzso gene was evaluated in relation to the most stable candidate genes indicated by each zzso 

Our study showed that expression stability varied between putative reference genes tested in zzso zzso Based on the zzso relative expression profile obtained using the genes suggested by the zzso zzso and zzso were considered as the most suitable reference genes for expression studies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for use as controls in zzso related to this zzso These findings will enable more accurate and reliable zzso of zzso results for gene expression studies in this economically important woody plant, particularly related to rooting and zzso zzso
