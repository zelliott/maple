To develop a novel zzso zzso based on a previous population zzso zzso model with zzso forecasting to facilitate zzso zzso 

Using information on zzso and zzso zzso zzso level, dose and international zzso ratio zzso of zzso time, individual zzso zzso clearance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in 50% of zzso zzso parameters were determined by zzso forecasting for 45 Japanese zzso Maintenance doses were described by multiple linear zzso using individually estimated zzso parameters and zzso zzso The zzso of the model and a comparison with other dosing methods were evaluated by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 

The plasma concentration of zzso and zzso were accurately predicted from individual zzso zzso The following final zzso model for maintenance dose was zzso maintenance dose zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso giving a strong correlation between actual and predicted maintenance doses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and a superior zzso performance compared with other dosing zzso On the other hand, the predictability without actual zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was comparable to other dosing zzso 

A novel algorithm, based on the population zzso model combined with zzso zzso gave precise predictions of maintenance dose, leading to individualized zzso zzso
