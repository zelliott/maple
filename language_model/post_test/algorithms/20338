An alternative to experimental high zzso screening is the virtual screening of compound libraries on the zzso In absence of a detailed structure of the zzso zzso candidate molecules are compared with a known reference by mutually zzso their skeletons and scoring their zzso Since molecular shape highly depends on the adopted zzso an efficient zzso screening is performed using a zzso zzso A comprehensive zzso library has been compiled from crystal data stored in the Cambridge zzso zzso For molecular comparison a strategy is followed considering shape associated zzso properties in space such as zzso occupancy, zzso zzso and potential zzso zzso shape is zzso by a set of zzso functions not necessarily located at the atomic zzso The zzso is performed in two steps: first by a global alignment search operating on multiple rigid zzso and then by zzso relaxing the best scored hits of the global zzso A zzso similarity scoring is used to allow for a comparison of molecules with rather different shape and zzso The approach has been implemented on a cluster of parallel zzso As a case study, the search for zzso binding to the zzso zzso is zzso
