zzso zzso models are useful tools for studying complex dynamics such as chronic zzso zzso models explicitly define zzso of waiting times, giving an extension of continuous time and homogeneous zzso models based implicitly on exponential zzso This paper develops a zzso model adapted to complex medical zzso zzso We introduced a hazard function of waiting times with a U or inverse U zzso zzso These zzso were specifically selected for each zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was also selected for each zzso We applied this method to the evolution of zzso infected zzso We used a sample of zzso patients followed up at the hospital in zzso zzso
