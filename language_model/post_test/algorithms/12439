zzso is limited of how zzso and zzso zzso in fertile women are associated with achieving zzso 

From 1996 to 1998, we enrolled 347 textile workers without hormone treatment in zzso China, who provided daily urine and data upon stopping zzso for up to 1 year until clinical zzso zzso zzso was zzso to detect conception and early pregnancy zzso We compared urinary zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso clinical zzso 63 early pregnancy losses and 272 zzso cycles from 347 women and also in 94 clinical pregnancy and 94 zzso cycles from the same zzso 

Using generalized zzso equations and relative to zzso clinical pregnancy cycles, zzso was lower in 272 zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso On average, daily zzso was 18 zzso zzso lower in zzso cycles than in clinical pregnancy zzso Relative to 94 clinical pregnancy cycles, zzso was lower in 94 zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso from the same women zzso difference in daily zzso was 20 zzso zzso The odds of zzso less than the 10th zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in early pregnancy loss cycles zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than in clinical pregnancy cycles in the early zzso zzso Compared with clinical pregnancy cycles, zzso zzso were lower in zzso cycles during the zzso phase, but this analysis lacked power for multiple zzso 

zzso zzso varied from cycle to cycle, and higher zzso was associated with achieving clinical zzso
