zzso zzso zzso transplant candidates present a group at high risk for acute and chronic zzso The probability of finding compatible donors for these recipients is significantly lower in comparison to those who have low zzso zzso As a consequence, these patients spend longer time on the waiting list and become zzso to zzso The results of final cross match zzso are critical for making a decision about whether such a candidate receives an organ or zzso The degree of donor and recipient zzso zzso predicts the results of zzso The goal of this study was to expand a variety of acceptable zzso zzso zzso for high zzso kidney recipients using the zzso zzso This strategy focuses on the fine structural features of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or triplets zzso which are located in zzso coils of zzso molecules and are available to zzso We analyzed serum samples from zzso highly zzso recipients zzso zzso or zzso zzso The level of zzso was detected using zzso Class I zzso zzso This group of transplant candidates included thirteen recipients who demonstrated negative results of final zzso zzso and zzso who were zzso zzso The application of the zzso zzso based on the zzso class I donor and recipient typing allowed us to detect the total number of zzso as well as the number of zzso zzso in both zzso negative and zzso positive groups of zzso zzso greater numbers of both total and highly zzso zzso have been emerged in the group of zzso positive zzso Furthermore, the results of this analysis have shown a high degree of probability of positive zzso if the number of highly zzso zzso was zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We did not observe overlapping between zzso specificity and permissible zzso zzso detected using the zzso zzso Thus, the number of highly zzso zzso can serve as a reliable zzso value for final zzso results in highly zzso zzso transplant zzso The zzso zzso appears to be the proper strategy to find donors for high zzso zzso
