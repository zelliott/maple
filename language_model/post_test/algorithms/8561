We use spatial generalized linear mixed models zzso to model zzso spatial variables that are observed at sampling locations in a continuous zzso In many applications, prediction of random effects in a spatial zzso is of great practical zzso We show that the minimum zzso error zzso prediction can be done in a linear fashion in spatial zzso analogous to linear zzso We develop a zzso Carlo version of the zzso zzso zzso for maximum likelihood zzso of model zzso A zzso of this approach is that it also produces the zzso estimates for the realized random effects at the sampled zzso This method is illustrated through a simulation study and is also applied to a real data set on plant root diseases to obtain a map of disease severity that can facilitate the practice of precision zzso
