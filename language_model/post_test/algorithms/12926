We propose a zzso design process which aims at reducing aberrations in parallel three-dimensional direct laser writing zzso One principle of the approach is to zzso the zzso power of zzso while retaining the degree of zzso This reduces focal distortion caused by chromatic zzso We address associated problems such as the zero zzso order and aberrations induced by a potential zzso index mismatch between the immersion medium of the microscope objective and the fabrication zzso zzso from fabrication in zzso fused zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
