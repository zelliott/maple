The effects of zzso on the structure of rabbit muscle zzso zzso were studied by small angle zzso zzso The radius of zzso zzso decreases by about 1 A in the presence of the zzso zzso but increases by about the same magnitude in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso With increasing pH or in the absence of zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso there is a zzso difference in zzso between two alternative zzso zzso distribution analysis indicates that, under all experimental conditions which increase the radius of zzso there is a pronounced increase observed in the probability for zzso distance between 80 and 110 zzso These small angle zzso scattering results indicate a zzso and zzso of the zzso when it zzso between its active and inactive zzso Using the zzso coordinates of zzso cat muscle zzso zzso a length distribution profile was zzso and it matches the scattering profile of the inactive zzso These observations are expected since the zzso were grown in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Levine, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 134, zzso zzso results from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso and Lee, zzso (1984) zzso 23, zzso are totally consistent with each zzso With the aid of computer zzso the crystal structure has been manipulated in order to effect changes that are consistent with the zzso change described by the solution scattering zzso The structural manipulation involves the rotation of the B domain relative to the A domain, leading to the closure of the zzso between these zzso These zzso resulted in the generation of new sets of atomic zzso zzso which were zzso in calculations, the result of which compared favorably with the solution zzso
