The degradation of three zzso compounds, zzso zzso and zzso by zzso process was divided into three zzso the initiation phase, the fast phase and the termination zzso Compared with the initiation phase, the degradation of zzso compounds, the consumption of zzso and the generation of zzso accelerated dramatically in the fast zzso At the end of the fast phase, about zzso zzso compounds were zzso After then, the degradation rate slowed down sharply due to the lack of zzso The enhancement in the fast phase was caused by the role of some zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which were identified to reduce zzso to zzso zzso The fast degradation of zzso compounds promoted the formation of zzso thus the concentration of zzso increased, and vice zzso A reaction zzso describing the role of the zzso zzso was zzso
