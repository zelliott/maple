zzso models have been developed to predict fatigue during functional electrical zzso but the zzso accuracy at different muscle lengths is zzso The objectives of our study were to: zzso zzso determine the relationship between knee extension angle (20 degrees, 40 degrees, 65 degrees, and 90 zzso and fatigue of the zzso muscles, and zzso predict that relationship using a mathematical zzso A computer-controlled zzso sent trains of zzso to surface zzso on the zzso of five subjects while forces were measured at the zzso A zzso mathematical model was zzso One component accounted for force, and the other accounted for zzso The model was fit to the data, and parameters were identified at 90 degrees zzso The fitted zzso zzso value was zzso The model was used to predict fatigue at the remaining angles, and the zzso zzso values were zzso zzso at least zzso of the zzso in the zzso was explained by the zzso The force model is explicitly dependent on angle, and the fatigue model is explicitly dependent on zzso therefore, the dependence of fatigue on knee angle was zzso
