We report a zzso based study of zzso quantum transport in chemically doped zzso zzso with a zzso up to 10 zzso The occurrence of zzso states related to zzso zzso results in mobility gaps as large as 1 zzso driven by strong zzso zzso zzso zzso This phenomenon opens new ways to overcome current limitations of zzso devices through the fabrication of chemically doped zzso zzso with sizes within the reach of conventional zzso
