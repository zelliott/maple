Rapid category zzso as discovered by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the human visual system can detect object categories in natural images in as little as 150 zzso To gain insight into this phenomenon and to determine its relevance to naturally occurring conditions, we degrade the stimulus set along various image dimensions and investigate the effects on zzso To investigate how well modern-day computer vision zzso cope with zzso we conduct an analog of this same experiment with state-of-the-art object recognition zzso We discover that rapid category detection in humans is quite robust to naturally occurring zzso and is zzso by a zzso interaction of visual zzso In contrast, modern-day object recognition zzso are not as zzso
