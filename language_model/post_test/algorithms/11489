A novel method for the rapid determination of zzso and zzso in Chinese zzso of zzso origin by means of visible and near infrared zzso zzso was zzso zzso data of 114 Chinese zzso samples were acquired in the 325 to zzso zzso wavelength range using a zzso zzso The reference values of zzso and zzso of the samples were determined by high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso least squares zzso models were established using the zzso analyzed by different zzso zzso The effective zzso were selected by successive projections zzso zzso and employed as the zzso of zzso back zzso neural networks zzso multiple linear zzso zzso and least zzso zzso machine zzso zzso The best results were achieved by zzso models established with the zzso smoothing zzso zzso zzso where the r and zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso determination and zzso and zzso for zzso determination, zzso The results show that zzso zzso powerful capability for the rapid determination of zzso and zzso contents in Chinese zzso
