The capability to predict zzso wear of knee replacements is a valuable zzso analysis tool for implant zzso Traditionally, time-consuming experimental tests provided the principal means of investigating zzso Today, zzso models offer an zzso However, the zzso of these models has not been demonstrated across a range of designs and test conditions, and several different formulas are in contention for zzso wear rates, limiting confidence in the zzso power of these zzso zzso This study zzso and zzso simulates a wide range of experimental wear tests using fast zzso zzso models with extant wear prediction zzso to assess the performance of current zzso wear prediction zzso The number of tests zzso gives a broader, more general assessment of the performance of these zzso tools, and provides better estimates of the wear zzso used in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows a range of alternative zzso to be zzso zzso most zzso zzso models perform zzso the zzso wear model appears to offer the best zzso power amongst existing wear zzso However, the range and zzso of experimental data leaves considerable uncertainty in the zzso More experimental data with reduced zzso and more detailed reporting of studies will be necessary to corroborate these models with greater zzso With simulation times reduced to only a few minutes, these models are zzso suited to zzso zzso of zzso or zzso studies (which are essential if zzso assessment tools are to begin addressing the degree of variation observed clinically and in zzso zzso
