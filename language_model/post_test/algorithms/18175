Sound zzso is known to be a complex phenomenon, combining zzso information processing, zzso zzso and zzso Here we present a zzso model that addresses the question of how an zzso could learn to zzso sound sources without any a zzso neural representation of its zzso transfer function or prior experience with auditory spatial zzso We demonstrate zzso that the experience of the sensory consequences of its voluntary motor actions allows an zzso to learn the spatial location of any sound zzso Using examples from humans and zzso zzso our model shows that a zzso zzso can learn the auditory space based solely on acoustic zzso and their relation to motor zzso
