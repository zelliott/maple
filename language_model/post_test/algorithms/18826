This paper proposes a zzso zzso field with a special zzso an explicit partition zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is an original zzso Moreover, the explicit expression of the partition function enables the development of an zzso zzso convex zzso zzso The method is fully zzso and produces an estimate in the sense of the zzso mean, zzso calculated by means of a zzso zzso chain zzso The approach is particularly effective and the zzso zzso of the method is shown on a simple simulated zzso
