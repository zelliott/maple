zzso X-ray scattering is related to the electron density distribution by a zzso zzso and therefore a window into the microscopic structures of biological zzso Current techniques of scattering rely on zzso zzso from highly zzso X-ray beams produced from zzso light zzso Imaging of the distribution of scattering provides a new contrast mechanism which is different from zzso zzso but is a lengthy process of zzso or line scans of the beam over the zzso Here, we describe an imaging technique in the spatial frequency domain capable of acquiring both the scattering and zzso zzso in a single zzso We present first results obtained with conventional X-ray zzso This method zzso a grid between the X-ray source and the zzso object, so that the zzso image contains a primary image and a grid harmonic zzso The ratio between the harmonic and primary images is shown to be a pure scattering zzso It is the zzso of the electron density distribution at a specific zzso We tested a number of samples at zzso zzso zzso distance, and found the scattering images to be distinct from the zzso images and reveal new zzso This technique is simple to zzso and should help broaden the imaging applications of X-ray zzso
