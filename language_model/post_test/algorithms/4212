X-ray differential zzso zzso zzso zzso is a powerful physical and zzso analysis zzso In practical applications, there are often challenges for zzso due to insufficient data caused by zzso bad or missing detector channels, or limited scanning angular zzso They occur quite frequently because of experimental constraints from imaging hardware, scanning zzso and the exposure dose delivered to living zzso In this work, we analyze the influence of incomplete data on zzso image zzso Then, a reconstruction method is developed and investigated for incomplete data zzso It is based on an zzso iteration reconstruction technique, which zzso the image total variation and permits accurate zzso imaging with less zzso This work comprises a zzso study of the method and its experimental zzso using a zzso measured at the zzso zzso of the storage ring zzso III equipped with a zzso zzso The zzso and experimental results demonstrate that the presented method can handle incomplete zzso It will be of interest for a wide range of zzso applications in medicine, biology, and zzso zzso
