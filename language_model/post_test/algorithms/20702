It is well known that the quantitative potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso relies on the ability to compensate for resolution, zzso and scatter zzso Reconstruction zzso which are able to take these effects into account are highly demanding in terms of computing zzso The reported work aimed to investigate the use of a parallel zzso computing platform for zzso reconstruction taking into account an accurate model of the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso with an accurate model of the variable system response was zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso parallel architecture of a zzso zzso zzso zzso parallel zzso The system was organized to make it easily accessible even from low-cost zzso zzso through standard zzso zzso A complete brain study of 30 zzso slices could be reconstructed from a set of 90 zzso projections with ten zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in 9 zzso corresponding to an actual zzso factor of zzso This work demonstrated the possibility of exploiting remote zzso computing and networking resources from hospital sites by means of low-cost zzso using standard communication protocols without particular problems for routine zzso The achievable zzso factors allow the assessment of the clinical benefit of advanced reconstruction techniques which require a heavy zzso burden for the compensation effects such as variable spatial resolution, scatter and zzso The possibility of using the same software on the same hardware platform with data acquired in different laboratories with various kinds of zzso zzso is appealing for software quality control and for the evaluation of the clinical impact of the reconstruction zzso
