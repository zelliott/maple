For the zzso of minimally invasive zzso performed direct zzso access zzso zzso a surgical planning tool which enables the surgeon to define landmarks for zzso zzso identify the necessary anatomical structures and define a safe zzso trajectory using patient image data (typically zzso zzso zzso or cone beam zzso is zzso To this end, a dedicated zzso software planning system for the planning of zzso procedures that addresses current deficiencies has been zzso 

zzso and robust anatomical zzso is achieved through the zzso of semiautomatic zzso zzso zzso registration is achieved via an automated zzso zzso detection zzso and functionality for the interactive definition of a safe drilling trajectory based on zzso drill positioning uncertainty calculations was zzso 

The accuracy and safety of the presented software tool were validated during the zzso of eight zzso procedures performed on zzso zzso The plan for each ear was completed in less than 20 zzso and no damage to vital structures occurred during the zzso The integrated zzso detection functionality enabled final positioning zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of this study demonstrated that the proposed software system could aid in the safe planning of a zzso tunnel within an acceptable zzso
