zzso in bone tissue engineering require an understanding of cellular and tissue level behavior of zzso zzso zzso indicate that in the absence of an zzso material, zzso zzso may be based on signals that promote cell activity resulting in the formation of a zzso zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the formation of zzso three-dimensional zzso cell zzso in zzso and to characterize zzso the cell zzso A new correlation based automated tracking method is evaluated in order to zzso the processing parameters and to identify statistical parameters that characterize the cell zzso zzso suggest that the zzso development of the mean distance of the cells to the center of gravity may be described by an exponential function, thus providing a characteristic time constant as a quantitative measure of cell zzso zzso 2013 zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso
