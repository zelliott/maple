In electron zzso resonance zzso distance zzso between zzso attached spin labels in soft matter are obtained by measuring their zzso zzso The analysis of these distance zzso can be misleading particularly for broad zzso because the most probable distance deviates from the distance between the most probable label zzso The current manuscript studies this effect using zzso generated spin label positions, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental data of a model zzso An approach involving Rice zzso is proposed to overcome this zzso
