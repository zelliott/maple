The objective of this study was to develop a family of zzso models to describe in a strictly quantitative manner the zzso zzso transport of drugs in zzso 

Two structurally different zzso models describing the in zzso transport during zzso and one zzso model describing the in zzso transport in zzso period are zzso These models are based on the mass transfer from the donor compartment to the zzso compartment via the skin as an intermediate zzso In these models, zzso zzso transport is characterized by 5 zzso 1) kinetic lag time zzso 2) zzso flux during zzso zzso 3) skin release rate constant zzso 4) the zzso rate constant of the zzso driving force from the skin to the zzso compartment zzso and 5) passive flux in the zzso period zzso The developed models were applied to data on the zzso transport in human stratum zzso in zzso of zzso after zzso with zzso zzso saline pH zzso (PBS) and after zzso with zzso zzso as well as the zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH 5 zzso 

All of the proposed models could be fitted to the transport data of zzso zzso and zzso groups both during the zzso and in the zzso zzso The incorporation of zzso zzso failed to improve the fitting performance of the zzso This might indicate a negligible contribution of zzso driving force to the mass transfer in the direction from the skin to the zzso zzso although it plays an important role in loading the skin with the zzso The estimated values of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were identical zzso zzso zzso to the values obtained with the diffusion lag time zzso Moreover, time required to achieve zzso flux can be estimated based on the zzso zzso and the zzso value of zzso zzso In addition, zzso of drug molecules in the skin is reflected in a reduction of the value of the zzso zzso 

The developed in zzso models demonstrated their strength and consistency to describe the drug transport during and zzso
