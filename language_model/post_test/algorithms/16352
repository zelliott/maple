This article presents an investigation into the development of a zzso optimal chemotherapy control model to reduce the number of cancer cells after a number of fixed treatment cycles with minimum side zzso zzso models for cancer chemotherapy are designed to predict the number of zzso cells and control the zzso growth during zzso This requires an understanding of the system in the absence of treatment and a description of the effects of the zzso In order to achieve zzso optimal control model, we used the zzso integral and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso used as series) controllers based on Martin's model for drug zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zzso optimal chemotherapy control model used to investigate the cancer zzso The proposed control schemes are designed based on the optimal solution of three objective functions, which include zzso zzso zzso cell killing, for zzso minimum zzso and zzso tolerable drug zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso is used to find suitable parameters of controllers that zzso among design objectives considered in this zzso The results of the different optimal scheduling patterns of the proposed models are presented and discussed through a set of zzso Finally, the observations are compared with the existing models in order to demonstrate the merits and capabilities of the proposed zzso zzso zzso It is noted that the proposed model offers best performance as compared to any models reported zzso
