In many interesting cases, the reconstruction of a correct zzso is blurred by high zzso rates and/or horizontal transfer zzso As a consequence, a divergence arises between the true evolutionary distances and the differences between pairs of zzso as zzso from available data, making the zzso reconstruction a challenging zzso zzso this divergence translates in a loss of zzso of the actual distances between zzso In zzso reconstruction methods, two properties of additive distances have been extensively exploited as zzso criteria to drive zzso zzso On the one hand, a local property of zzso that is, sets of four zzso in a tree, the zzso zzso on the other hand, a recently proposed formula that allows to write the tree length as a function of the distances between zzso zzso zzso Here, we introduce a new reconstruction scheme that exploits in a unified framework both the zzso condition and the zzso zzso We zzso in particular, a new general class of zzso zzso Local Search zzso which reduces in a limit case to the zzso of zzso zzso When tested on artificially generated zzso our zzso zzso zzso zzso scheme significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso in cases of zzso from zzso due to high rate of back zzso A significant improvement is also observed with respect to the zzso zzso in the case of high rate of horizontal zzso
