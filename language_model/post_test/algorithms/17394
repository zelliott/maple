zzso return of facial motor function and zzso continue to be long-term zzso in some patients with Bell's zzso The aim of this report is to describe a prospective study in which a zzso surgical zzso of the facial nerve was performed in a population of patients with Bell's zzso who exhibit the zzso features associated with poor zzso In addition, management issues related to Bell's zzso including zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the natural history, zzso testing, and efficacy of surgical strategies are zzso 

A zzso prospective clinical trial was designed utilizing zzso zzso and voluntary zzso zzso to identify patients with Bell's zzso who would most likely develop poor return of facial function, as suggested by Fisch and zzso Patients who displayed zzso features of poor outcome, zzso zzso on zzso testing and no voluntary motor unit zzso zzso within 14 days of onset of total paralysis, were offered a surgical zzso of the facial nerve through a middle zzso zzso surgical exposure, including the zzso segment, zzso zzso labyrinthine segment, and zzso zzso Control subjects were those who displayed similar zzso features and time zzso 

zzso who did not reach zzso zzso on zzso within 14 days of paralysis all returned to zzso grade I zzso zzso zzso or II zzso zzso 6) at 7 months after onset of the zzso Control subjects zzso not to undergo surgical zzso when zzso zzso on zzso and no motor unit zzso on zzso were identified had a zzso chance of developing a poor outcome at 7 months after onset of paralysis zzso grade III or IV zzso zzso zzso A group with similar zzso and zzso findings undergoing middle zzso facial nerve zzso exhibited zzso grade I zzso zzso zzso or II zzso zzso 17) in zzso of the zzso An exact zzso test confirmed that the surgical group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a good outcome zzso grade I or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in combination with voluntary zzso successfully identified patients who will most likely return to normal from those who had a greater chance of long-term zzso from Bell's zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso significantly improves the chances of normal or zzso return of facial function in the group that has a high probability of a poor zzso zzso zzso must be performed within 2 weeks of onset of total paralysis for it to be zzso
