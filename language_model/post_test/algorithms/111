Some disorders such as circulatory disease and zzso zzso cause many problems to peripheral blood flow zzso zzso frequent measurement of the blood flow condition is bound to contribute to precaution against those disorders and to control of conditions of the zzso We propose a convenient means of blood flow volume measurement at peripheral part, such as zzso zzso of this measurement is based on heat transfer characteristics of peripheral part containing the blood zzso Transition response analysis of skin surface temperature has provided measurement model of the peripheral blood flow zzso We developed the blood flow measurement system based on that model and evaluated it by using artificial finger under various temperature conditions of ambience and internal zzso The evaluation results indicated that proposed method could estimate the volume of the fluid regardless of temperature condition of zzso Finally we applied our system to real finger testing and have obtained results correlated well with laser zzso blood flow meter zzso
