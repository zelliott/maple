A partial zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed and the lengths of zzso fragments which zzso to a labeled probe are measured using gel zzso We give an efficient zzso that takes as input this experimental data and proposes one or more candidate zzso Each solution zzso the location of each restriction site and specifies the zzso of each zzso zzso experiments can then be designed to select the correct solution from this small set of zzso The zzso works well even when the experiment gives zzso values for the zzso
