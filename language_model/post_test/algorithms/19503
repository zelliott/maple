The point spread function zzso of a pinhole zzso plays an important role in determining the resolution and characterizing the sensitivity of the accepted photons from a given point in the image zzso The focus of this paper is to derive an zzso expression for the zzso of two different types of focusing pinhole zzso that are based on zzso zzso double cones and zzso zzso double zzso zzso focusing pinhole zzso used in zzso zzso were designed using zzso double cones, as they were easier to zzso In this work, a novel focusing zzso consisting of zzso double cones was designed and its properties were studied in detail with respect to zzso zzso based zzso The main advantage of determining the zzso is the fact that they can be used to accurately model the zzso during the zzso thereby improving the resolution of the reconstructed zzso The zzso of the focusing zzso based on zzso cones were found to be almost shift zzso for low and medium energy photons zzso 200 zzso This property is very advantageous as zzso such as zzso reconstruction can be used for resolution recovery thereby drastically reducing the reconstruction zzso However, the zzso of focusing zzso double cones zzso for higher energy photons were found to be zzso and hence need to be zzso more accurately during the zzso On the other hand, the zzso for the zzso cone based zzso were found to be zzso for all energy zzso However, due to the smaller acceptance angle used, the number of penetration photons was found to be far less than that observed for zzso zzso This results in a smaller zzso making zzso cone based zzso preferable for high-resolution small animal imaging, especially where very small pinhole diameters are zzso The zzso derived zzso for both zzso were validated using a zzso based zzso Carlo approach and found to agree well with a mean square error of less than zzso
