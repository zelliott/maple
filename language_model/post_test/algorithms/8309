To determine whether the slopes of the single beat zzso pressure zzso ratios are sensitive to changes in loading conditions in humans, 16 patients without cardiac disease were studied with simultaneous zzso left zzso pressures and zzso contrast zzso under control conditions and during zzso and zzso zzso Left zzso volumes were calculated with use of a zzso rule algorithm, wall thickness was obtained zzso and both zzso zzso and zzso stresses were zzso frame by zzso The zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were calculated using a single beat from each loading condition assuming a zero zzso zzso Mean left zzso zzso pressure increased zzso during the zzso infusion and decreased zzso during the zzso infusion compared with control zzso less than zzso for zzso Despite these changes in left zzso zzso pressure, heart rate was eliminated as a zzso variable by right zzso zzso and mean zzso rate of change of left zzso pressure zzso and rate of change at developed pressure 40 zzso zzso zzso per zzso values did not differ zzso Mean single beat zzso zzso ratios also did not differ significantly among the three loading zzso In contrast, mean single beat zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso at zzso they increased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso during the zzso infusion zzso less than zzso for zzso and they decreased during the zzso infusion to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso less than zzso and p less than zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
