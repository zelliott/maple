Diabetes zzso may result in impaired cardiac zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso We aimed to investigate the zzso zzso in cardiac zzso and zzso capacity and loading conditions as well as mechanical efficiency in the evolution of zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso diabetic zzso Adult male zzso rats were zzso into control and zzso diabetic zzso zzso zzso studies were done at 8, 16, and 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum theoretical flow zzso were assessed by zzso techniques, and zzso zzso and mechanical efficiency were assessed by a zzso zzso zzso In contrast to early occurring and persistently depressed zzso zzso progressively increased with time but was decreased at 22 zzso zzso injection, which temporally correlated with the changes in cardiac zzso The favorable loading conditions enhanced stroke volume and zzso whereas zzso zzso attenuated the cardiac mechanical efficiency in diabetic zzso The changes in zzso and zzso are zzso during the progression of zzso dysfunction in the diabetic zzso In conclusion, our study showed that depressed zzso and cardiac mechanical efficiency, occurring preceding overt zzso heart failure, are two major zzso of deteriorating cardiac performance in diabetic zzso
