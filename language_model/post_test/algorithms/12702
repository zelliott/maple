Gene zzso analysis was developed to explore gene zzso at the expression level from a systems perspective, and differential zzso analysis zzso which examines the change in gene expression correlation between two conditions, was accordingly designed as a complementary technique to traditional differential expression analysis zzso Since there is a shortage of zzso tools, we implemented in an R package zzso five zzso methods for identification of zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso including three currently popular methods and two novel zzso described in a companion zzso zzso can serve as an zzso tool to facilitate differential zzso zzso
