zzso technologies create the necessity to mine large amounts of gene zzso from diverse zzso and to integrate the resulting zzso Most zzso can be interrogated only via Web, for a single gene at a time, and query results are generally available only in the zzso zzso Although some zzso provide batch retrieval of data via zzso this requires expertise and resources for locally zzso the zzso 

We developed zzso a tool aimed at researchers without extensive zzso skills or resources, which exploits zzso templates to easily mine selected zzso from different zzso zzso and zzso and structures results in an automatically updated zzso Using zzso results from a model system of zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively gathered relevant zzso from various zzso zzso highlighted significant biological characteristics and supported a global approach to the understanding of complex cellular zzso 

zzso is freely available for zzso use at zzso
