Academic medical zzso face the need to care for patients with complex medical conditions, educate zzso and conduct research, all with increasingly constrained zzso The adoption of new therapeutic technology presents challenges and opportunities in each of these zzso Severe zzso remains a major cause of morbidity and zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso human activated protein C reduces mortality in patients with severe zzso but trial data indicate that the benefit of the drug is confined to the more seriously ill patients, while the risk of bleeding complications can be zzso The cost of the drug is approximately zzso zzso per treated zzso zzso of this product into routine care has produced unique challenges concerning clinical decision making, safety and zzso 

To describe one hospital's multidisciplinary approach to the adoption of this new zzso 

Before activated protein C was approved for use, Brigham and Women's Hospital zzso convened a working group to formulate clinical guidelines zzso This new agent did not fit into an obvious therapeutic category but cut across multiple clinical disciplines requiring the involvement of several hospital departments in developing zzso As new data on efficacy emerged during the US zzso review of the drug, the working group had to devise a method for using the available information to assist clinical decision making while placing appropriate restrictions on the use of activated protein zzso The goal was to make accurate information available to guide ordering zzso decision making zzso 24 hours a zzso 

The committee developed a zzso policy for activated protein C that provided guidance on patient selection, zzso and risk zzso zzso computer-based order entry screens were developed to guide physicians through a complex set of clinical criteria to ensure appropriate evidence-based zzso A careful review of zzso is required as a second zzso To risk zzso patients in accordance with the trial subset analyses and the zzso zzso guidelines, ordering physicians are guided in calculating an zzso II zzso zzso and zzso Health zzso score for the zzso Physicians from several specialties are available for advice and consultation on patients with difficult or controversial zzso zzso two-thirds of completed orders passed the clinical zzso an additional zzso of patients did not meet the medication criteria but received the drug after the attending physician requested an override of the zzso 

The zzso approach to activated protein C used an innovative multidisciplinary approach and zzso order entry to guide clinical use of a new agent with substantial clinical zzso risks and zzso This approach provides a model for strategies to deal with other new and complex medical zzso
