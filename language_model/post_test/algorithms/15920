The measurement of the Reynolds stress zzso or at least of some of its zzso is a necessary step to assess if the turbulence associated with the flow near prosthetic devices can damage blood zzso Because of the intrinsic three zzso of zzso in general, a zzso zzso should be used to measure directly the components of the Reynolds stress zzso However, this can be practically zzso especially in zzso therefore, it is interesting to investigate the possibility of characterizing the turbulent flows that may occur in the circulatory system with the zzso data that a less complete equipment zzso a zzso ultrasound zzso can zzso From the general expression of the Reynolds stress zzso the highest zzso stress can be zzso as well as the Reynolds normal stress in the main flow zzso The relation between these two zzso which is an issue already addressed in previous works, can thus be rigorously formulated in terms of some characteristic parameters of the Reynolds stress zzso the principal normal stresses and the angles that the directions that define them form with the main flow zzso An experimental zzso of the ratio of the two zzso zzso for the flow across zzso valves, investigated by means of two-dimensional laser zzso zzso will illustrate the limitations of the zzso approach zzso the maximum load on blood zzso
