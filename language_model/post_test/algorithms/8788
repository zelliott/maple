zzso of injured or unusual zzso structures in medical imagery is a problem that has continued to elude fully automated zzso In this paper, the goal of zzso and consistent interactive zzso is transformed into a control synthesis zzso A nominal level set partial differential equation zzso is assumed to be zzso this zzso system achieves correct zzso under ideal conditions, but does not agree with a human zzso ideal boundary for real image zzso zzso the state and dynamics of a level set zzso via the accumulated user input and an zzso system leads to desirable zzso zzso The input structure is designed such that a user can stabilize the boundary in some desired state without needing to understand any mathematical zzso zzso of the technique is illustrated with applications to the challenging zzso of a zzso zzso in magnetic resonance and a shattered zzso in zzso zzso
