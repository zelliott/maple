We report on zzso zzso characteristic and energy transfer of zzso zzso glass zzso by zzso upon zzso of a conventional zzso zzso laser zzso The zzso strength zzso spontaneous zzso transition probabilities and zzso lifetime of zzso have been calculated from the zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso of zzso has been observed with increasing zzso doping up to zzso zzso The energy transfer zzso of the forward zzso is approximately 17 times larger than that of the backward zzso energy zzso Our result indicates that the maximum gain of zzso zzso assigned to the transition of zzso of zzso might be achieved from the zzso glass at the concentration of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The high gain zzso and quantum efficiency zzso along with the large value of the product of the zzso zzso zzso and the measured zzso lifetime zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso glasses might find potential applications in efficient zzso zzso
