This study evaluates the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso type 5 zzso zzso in rats using the PET zzso zzso and zzso models that are based on an input function, which is derived from a reference zzso Seven rats underwent dynamic PET scans zzso zzso after zzso injection of zzso zzso analyses zzso binding potential zzso ) determined by calculating zzso the simplified reference tissue model zzso and zzso its zzso simplified version zzso zzso zzso reference tissue model zzso and zzso its zzso version zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso images were generated representing zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with low to acceptable zzso ranging from 5 to zzso and zzso scores zzso correlation zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso model that showed lowest overall zzso was the zzso In contrast, the use of the zzso was associated with significantly lower zzso zzso zzso of zzso images revealed no significant bias between test and zzso zzso and is therefore suitable to compare groups at zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso imaging is zzso and reliable for PET studies of the cerebral zzso in zzso
