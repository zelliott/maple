This work presents a self-aware diabetic patient software agent for representing a human diabetic zzso To develop a zzso zzso and self-aware patient agent, we extend the original seminal work of zzso et zzso zzso in creating a mathematical model of human blood zzso levels in three zzso zzso We incorporate the zzso and unpredictable effects of daily zzso zzso The zzso model is extended into the period of zzso zzso zzso awareness of their own conditions is zzso zzso results are zzso assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of lifestyle management, such as adjusting the amount of food zzso meal schedule, intensity of exercise and level of zzso In this work we show through the simulation that the average blood zzso can be reduced by as much as 51% due to careful lifestyle zzso zzso monitoring blood zzso is also zzso zzso The simulation results show that the average blood zzso is further dropped by zzso with the assistance of blood zzso zzso In addition, the blood zzso is perfectly controlled in the target range during the simulation period as a result of joint efforts of lifestyle management and self monitoring blood zzso This study focuses on demonstrating how human patients' behavior, specifically lifestyle and self monitoring of blood zzso affects blood zzso controls on a daily zzso This work does not focus on the zzso interaction of an individual human zzso Our conclusion is that this self-aware patient agent model is capable of adequately representing diabetic patients and of evaluating their dynamic zzso It can also be incorporated into a zzso system by introducing other zzso components so that more interesting insights such as the zzso quality, cost and performance can be zzso
