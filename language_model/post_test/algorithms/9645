This paper proposes a technique to improve zzso zzso Network zzso prediction accuracy using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A hybrid system consists of two stages with the first stage containing two zzso The first ANN predictor is a zzso zzso network trained with error zzso and the second predictor is a functional link zzso These two zzso are combined in the second stage using zzso zzso in a linear and zzso zzso The proposed method is applied to problem of predicting daily natural gas zzso The performance of ANN zzso and combination methods are tested on real data from four different gas zzso The experimental results show that the proposed particle swarm zzso zzso results in more accurate prediction compared to using single ANN zzso zzso accuracy improvement of the proposed zzso zzso have been shown using hypothesis zzso
