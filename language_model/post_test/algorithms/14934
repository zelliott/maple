In this paper, we study the problem features that may cause a zzso genetic zzso zzso difficulty in zzso to the true zzso zzso Identification of such features helps us develop difficult test problems for zzso zzso zzso test problems are constructed from zzso zzso problems, thereby allowing known difficult features of zzso problems (such as zzso isolation, or zzso to be directly transferred to the corresponding zzso zzso In addition, test problems having features specific to zzso zzso are also zzso More importantly, these difficult test problems will enable researchers to test their zzso for specific aspects of zzso zzso
