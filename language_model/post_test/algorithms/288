zzso models predict that zzso crowding can increase protein folding stability, but depending on details of the models zzso how the zzso state is zzso the level of stabilization predicted can be very zzso In this study, we represented the native and zzso states zzso with zzso sampled from zzso molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature and high temperature, zzso We then designed an efficient zzso to calculate the allowed zzso zzso when the protein zzso is placed inside a box of zzso That a fraction of zzso of the protein zzso is zzso because of volume exclusion by the zzso leads to an increase in chemical potential, given by zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso between the native and zzso states predicts the effect of crowding on the folding free zzso Even when the zzso occupied zzso of the solution volume, the stabilization reached only zzso zzso for zzso zzso The modest stabilization predicted is consistent with experimental zzso Interestingly, a mixture of different sized zzso was found to exert a greater effect than the sum of the individual species of zzso The stabilization of crowding on the binding stability of zzso and zzso based on zzso modeling of the zzso was similarly zzso These findings have profound implications for zzso crowding inside zzso
