This paper deals with contact currents that may occur when the human body is in contact with two zzso at different electrical zzso zzso an zzso device and the zzso Actually, any device must comply not only with electromagnetic zzso and safety requirements, but also with specific electromagnetic field exposure recommendations in order to prevent health hazards for the occupational and general public zzso Since the contact currents depend on the applied zzso and on the human body zzso this last zzso has been measured for several zzso in a broadband frequency range, from 40 zzso to 110 zzso From the measurement results, a new equivalent circuit of the human body zzso is derived by using a zzso zzso This equivalent circuit is very easy and can be adopted for compliance tests against contact zzso
