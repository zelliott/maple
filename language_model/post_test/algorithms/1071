The effectiveness and limitations of medical image processing using analog and digital methods are zzso Several types of errors introduced during the image processing are zzso For the analog optical zzso zzso errors are introduced by the zzso effect and lens zzso For the digital zzso zzso errors are introduced by the zzso effect and the band zzso To compare the results obtained by the two techniques, a set of zzso images was processed both zzso and zzso The former was achieved by an optical system containing a large zzso zzso lens and the latter by a personal computer using a zzso transform zzso The veracity of both the optical and digital zzso zzso is zzso Our results indicate that the optical method has high speed due to parallel zzso High veracity can be achieved in high frequency regions by using an optimal optical zzso In comparison, the digital method has the advantages of high processing precision and zzso but has low processing zzso The comparison of the two different techniques presented in this article can provide a basis for selection of the processing method in different clinical zzso Even with today's fast computers, the optical method is still suitable for many clinical zzso The best choice lies in an zzso zzso
