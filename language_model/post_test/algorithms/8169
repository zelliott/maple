To compare the predicted risk of coronary heart disease zzso and incident zzso zzso zzso using zzso score equations with the observed rate of zzso in Mexican zzso 

zzso study that included 1 zzso men and women aged 35 to 64 years without zzso at zzso zzso zzso was defined by zzso or death zzso The predicted risk of fatal zzso zzso zzso and both was calculated using zzso score zzso zzso to observed risk ratio of zzso was zzso 

There were 34 incident zzso cases and 24 zzso deaths zzso follow-up zzso zzso The score equations overestimated the prediction of incident zzso and zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and incident zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso score overestimated incident zzso and zzso death risk in zzso however, other studies are needed to confirm our results for zzso the score for Mexican zzso
