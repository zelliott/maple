One of the most important projects in the zzso is the systemic identification of biological zzso The almost of studies for network identification focused on the improvement of zzso efficiency in large-scale network zzso of complex system with zzso relations and few attempted have been done for answering practical problem occurred in real biological zzso In this study, we focused to evaluate zzso performance of our previously proposed method for zzso biological network on simple network zzso 

We evaluated the network zzso accuracy and efficiency of our previously proposed network zzso algorithm, by using 6 kinds of repeated appearance of highly significant network motifs in the regulatory network of zzso coli proposed by zzso et al and zzso et zzso and 2 kinds of network motif in zzso zzso proposed by Lee zzso zzso As a result, our method could reconstruct about zzso of interactions in network motif from zzso data zzso zzso the introduction of zzso data of zzso disrupted model could remarkably improved the performance of network zzso 

The results of network zzso examination of zzso coli network motif shows that our network zzso zzso was able to apply to typical zzso of biological zzso A continuous examination of zzso well established network motif in biology would strengthen the zzso of our zzso to the realistic biological zzso
