An improved approximate zzso zzso is presented and applied to characterize surface zzso zzso zzso In most previous experiments using zzso dynamic analysis, this certain processing was often confronted with the problem of insufficient data points and noisy circumstances, which led to unsatisfactory zzso Compared with zzso dimension as well as the standard zzso the improved zzso can extract information underlying zzso signals more efficiently and zzso The method introduced here can also be applied to other zzso and noisy zzso zzso
