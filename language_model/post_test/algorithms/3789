An approach to zzso for total skin electron therapy zzso is discussed using the currently accepted zzso zzso zzso zzso The methodology incorporates water phantom data for absolute zzso and plastic phantom data for efficient reference zzso The scheme is simplified to include the zzso mode conversion and provides support for its use, as it becomes more available on newer linear zzso Using a zzso modified Stanford technique, one may follow the process for accurate determination of absorbed zzso
