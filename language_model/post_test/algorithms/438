zzso zzso is an extension of the standard k zzso zzso zzso that identifies zzso zzso zzso In order to overcome the cluster zzso problem associated with this method, we propose the global kernel zzso algorithm, a deterministic and incremental approach to zzso zzso Our method adds one cluster at each stage, through a global search procedure consisting of several executions of kernel zzso from suitable zzso This zzso does not depend on cluster zzso identifies zzso zzso zzso and, due to its incremental nature and search zzso locates zzso solutions avoiding poor local zzso Furthermore, two modifications are developed to reduce the zzso cost that do not significantly affect the solution zzso The proposed methods are extended to handle weighted data points, which enables their application to graph zzso We experiment with several data sets and the proposed approach compares favorably to kernel k zzso with random zzso
