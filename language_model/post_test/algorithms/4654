The discovery of new targets that are sufficiently robust to yield marketable zzso is an enormous zzso Conventional target identification approaches are zzso which require heavy experimental workload and comprehensive domain zzso In this work, we propose that a zzso property of zzso zzso zzso can be explored to facilitate the zzso scale target screening in the zzso zzso 

A Support zzso zzso zzso zzso was trained to recognize target and zzso protein sequences compiled from the zzso Target zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences are zzso by their zzso transition and distribution features of zzso and zzso kernel function was used in zzso zzso 

zzso with a fine-tuned kernel zzso records zzso zzso zzso of sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to an overall target prediction accuracy of zzso zzso zzso 

Though zzso these results suggest that, similar to the zzso zzso for small zzso their binding partners, drug targets, also display shared features which are reflected in their sequences and can be captured by statistical learning zzso Further research on how to accurately and zzso measure the likeness of protein being a drug target is zzso Inspired by the progress of zzso zzso studies, advances in protein zzso statistical learning zzso and more comprehensive and accurate zzso data set from disease biology research may help to further define the zzso zzso property of zzso
