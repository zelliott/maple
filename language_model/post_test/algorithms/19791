Recent experimental results with humans involved in social dilemma games suggest that cooperation may be a contagious phenomenon and that the selection pressure operating on evolutionary dynamics zzso zzso is relatively zzso I propose an evolutionary dynamics model that links these experimental findings and evolution of zzso By assuming a small fraction of zzso zealous zzso I show that a large fraction of cooperation emerges in evolutionary dynamics of social dilemma zzso Even if defection is more lucrative than cooperation for most individuals, they often mimic cooperation of fellows unless the selection pressure is very zzso Then, zealous zzso can transform the population to be even fully cooperative under standard evolutionary zzso
