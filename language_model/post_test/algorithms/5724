The average value of the zzso selectivity zzso of randomly positioned zzso in a zzso separation is shown to equal the average fraction of zzso that are zzso as predicted by zzso theory zzso This equality is the basis for proposing a useful zzso specifically the average minimum resolution of zzso peaks, for the performance of comprehensive two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso this metric was zzso both without ancillary zzso information and with the assistance of such help, specifically zzso zzso zzso acquired during the zzso zzso are simulated with randomly positioned zzso over wide ranges of total number of peaks, zzso and zzso peak capacity, zzso zzso sampling time, and spectral zzso The specific version of the general zzso selectivity concept that is used zzso as zzso the relative precision of zzso when using the zzso zzso factor zzso method, a popular curve resolution zzso The SEL values of all zzso were zzso zzso and compared to the predictions of zzso In the absence of auxiliary spectral data, the zzso average minimum resolution required to separate two zzso in a zzso separation is zzso compared to resolution of zzso if no zzso assistance is zzso This was found to be valid over a wide range of conditions and is essentially independent of peak zzso With the assistance of the spectral data, the requisite minimum resolution substantially zzso that is, it zzso especially when peak crowding is zzso The requisite minimum resolution decreases even further, up to a limit, as the spectral diversity is zzso In contrast, the zzso average zzso correction factor is virtually independent of the presence of the additional spectral data, and additionally is about the same as calculated with zzso from the average number of zzso in closely analogous zzso The use of selectivity greatly increases the fraction of zzso that are zzso relative to the number of zzso zzso especially when spectral assistance is zzso The zzso of the zzso correction factor to either the use of selectivity or added spectral data zzso zzso of the corrected peak capacity in zzso comprehensive zzso zzso
