zzso zzso in the hydrogen bonds of two zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has been investigated using zzso zzso zzso The close proximity of the zzso zzso to the hydrogen bond zzso introduces zzso zzso zzso interactions into the zzso relaxation zzso This renders the zzso zzso zzso and introduces multiple spectral density components into the relaxation zzso zzso by zzso that are sums and differences of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso pulse sequences that measure the zzso relaxation and zzso rates we demonstrate how some of these multiple spectral density components can be separately zzso This leads to an accurate determination of the correlation times that zzso the zzso zzso zzso A broad spectrum of relaxation zzso is illustrated and explored in the chosen samples and the investigation is used to explore the theory and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cases where zzso interactions are zzso
