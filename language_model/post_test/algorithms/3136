zzso proteins zzso participate in various crucial processes in the zzso of the cells, and the identification and characterization of these proteins is of great zzso We present here a random forests zzso for identifying zzso among proteins with known zzso zzso First, clusters of zzso zzso regions zzso on the surface of proteins were detected using the zzso zzso earlier studies showed that these regions are typically the functionally important regions of zzso Next, we trained a zzso using features like the zzso potential, zzso zzso acid conservation patterns and the secondary structure content of the patches, as well as features of the whole zzso including its zzso zzso Using zzso zzso on a zzso of 138 zzso and 110 proteins that do not bind DNA, the zzso achieved a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso which is overall better than the performance of published zzso Furthermore, when we tested five different methods on 11 new zzso that did not appear in the original zzso only our method zzso all zzso The resulting zzso was applied to a collection of 757 proteins of known structure and unknown zzso Of these zzso 218 were predicted to bind DNA, and we anticipate that some of them interact with DNA using new structural zzso The use of complementary zzso tools supports the notion that at least some of them do bind zzso
