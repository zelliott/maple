The aim of this study was to introduce a new inferior zzso nerve zzso zzso repair method that does not require a nerve zzso 

The zzso was isolated after removal of a zzso cortical zzso The scarred area or zzso caused by the dental implant was excised with fresh cut ends and an zzso zzso If the excised gap was too wide for direct closure, the incisive nerve was intentionally zzso 5 zzso anterior to the mental zzso to obtain sufficient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso The nerve ends were then zzso directly by sliding the zzso nerve end to the zzso cut zzso After completing the nerve repair by using four 10-0 nylon zzso zzso the cortical window was zzso with a zzso and zzso 

Using this technique, 3 nerve repairs without a nerve graft were successfully achieved for gaps zzso zzso in zzso 

The great advantage of this technique is that a moderate nerve zzso can be zzso without a nerve graft when direct closure of the nerve segment is impossible without zzso
