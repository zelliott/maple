zzso zzso of the left atrium zzso wall from delayed enhancement zzso is challenging due to inconsistent contrast, combined with noise, and high variation in zzso shape and zzso We present a zzso method that is capable of zzso the zzso wall by computing an optimal zzso zzso This zzso is done on a set of zzso zzso constructed from an ensemble of segmented training images, and graph cuts on an associated zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a part of a zzso that has an associated set of learned intensity zzso When this mesh is zzso onto a test image, it produces a set of costs which lead to an optimal zzso The zzso mesh has an associated zzso directed zzso graph with edges that zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike previous zzso methods that impose hard constraints on the surface properties, the proposed method follows from a zzso zzso resulting in soft penalties on spatial variation of the cuts through the zzso The novelty of this method also lies in the construction of zzso zzso on complex shapes for choosing among distinct classes of base shapes for automatic LA zzso We evaluate the proposed zzso framework on simulated and clinical cardiac zzso
