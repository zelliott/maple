zzso neural signals have been reliably identified using both zzso and zzso zzso These consist of the zzso zzso a neural response zzso approximately zzso after a face is zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso face area zzso the zzso face area zzso and the superior zzso zzso zzso As most zzso studies examine these zzso processes zzso the relationship between the zzso neural response and zzso in the zzso zzso is still zzso In this study, we zzso measured zzso and zzso responses to upright faces, zzso faces, and objects to examine this zzso We introduce a method for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and correlation of the zzso variation in zzso neural responses with zzso zzso zzso For upright faces, zzso responses in the right zzso were zzso correlated with zzso zzso showing greater zzso on trials in which zzso zzso were larger (more zzso For zzso faces, a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso showing greater zzso on trials in which zzso zzso were smaller (less zzso This result points to the zzso as a crucial region for generating the zzso associated with face perception, and suggests that the zzso is additionally recruited for processing zzso faces, particularly on trials in which zzso is zzso Despite the different time resolution of zzso and zzso signals, our zzso zzso and zzso correlation method can reveal associations between zzso in zzso brain regions and neural processes at zzso associated with face zzso
