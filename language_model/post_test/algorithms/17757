In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso zzso is employed as an approximation for a given zzso curve within error bound and further renders offset which can be regarded as an approximate offset to the zzso zzso The errors between zzso and the zzso curve, the offset to zzso and the offset to the given zzso curve are also zzso A new zzso for constructing offset to the zzso curve is zzso
