Post zzso studies have shown volume changes of the zzso in psychiatric zzso With zzso magnetic resonance imaging this effect can now be investigated in zzso in zzso To benefit from the zzso resolution requires an improved zzso zzso The traditional anatomical landmarks of the zzso were refined using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso A detailed zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for zzso zzso images, and evaluated in a sample of 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were estimated in terms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso ensured zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso There were no significant volume differences between the zzso runs, zzso and zzso The estimated volumes of the zzso lie within the range of previous zzso and zzso zzso We present a zzso zzso for the manual zzso of the human zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Providing very high zzso and zzso zzso it zzso former procedures established at zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images and thus can serve as a gold standard for future automated zzso
