The brains of Long Evans shaker zzso rats, a model of zzso and their zzso matched controls were studied by zzso zzso diffusion imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso from the same zzso The les and the control brains were studied at different stages of maturation and disease zzso The mean zzso the probability for zero displacement and zzso were zzso from zzso data while the fractional zzso zzso and the zzso were zzso from zzso It was found that all zzso zzso detect the les pathology, at all stages of zzso while only some of the zzso zzso could detect the les zzso The zzso mean displacement was larger in the les group as compared with their zzso controls while the probability for zero displacement and the zzso were both lower all indicating higher degree of restriction in the control zzso Since all the zzso zzso were higher in the les brains as compared to controls, the less efficient zzso measure for discerning the les pathology was found to be the zzso Clearly, the most sensitive zzso zzso to the les pathology is zzso zzso the minimal zzso Since the zzso and zzso data were obtained from the same zzso despite the somewhat higher zzso of the zzso data compared to the zzso data, it seems that the higher diagnostic capacity of the zzso data in this experimental model of zzso originates mainly from the higher zzso weighting of the zzso zzso
