A novel methodology is proposed for food specifications associated with the origin of zzso The methodology was tested on honey samples collected within the zzso zzso zzso The data were sampled in various regions in Europe and zzso for the trace elements zzso The sampling sites were characterized by different geological origins, such as zzso zzso or zzso We have chosen 14 zzso B, zzso zzso A, K, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso due to their influence on the separation of samples regarding the geology of the sampling zzso A special architecture of an error zzso neural network, so called zzso type of neural network was used to project the data into a zzso zzso The data were fed into the zzso input layer and then transferred through the zzso hidden layer zzso to a zzso to the zzso output zzso The two hidden zzso representing the two coordinates of the projection plane enable us to map the samples used for training of the zzso zzso With the knowledge about the classes of individual samples we determine the clusters in the projection plane and consequently obtain the coordinates of the zzso zzso zzso of a particular zzso The clusters are characterized with an zzso shape borders spanning the length of up to zzso in each zzso Since the data were classified as regard to the zzso three main clusters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso origin of honey zzso The novel methodology proposed for food specifications was demonstrated on a reduced set of samples, which shows good zzso of all three classes in the projection plane, and on the third class of the original data zzso
