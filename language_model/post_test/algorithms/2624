Despite the zzso of the interior of cells, zzso motor proteins are able to deliver zzso rapidly and reliably throughout the zzso We zzso that motor proteins may be adapted to operate in crowded environments by having molecular properties that prevent them from forming traffic zzso To test this hypothesis, we zzso zzso traffic of zzso zzso motor zzso a highly zzso motor with long zzso time, along zzso in a total zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that traffic zzso characterized by an abrupt increase in the density of zzso with an associated abrupt decrease in motor speed, form even in the absence of other zzso zzso To determine the molecular properties that lead to zzso we altered the concentration of motors, their zzso and their rate of zzso from zzso zzso Traffic jams occurred when the motor density exceeded a critical value zzso zzso or when motor zzso from the zzso ends was so slow that it resulted in a pileup zzso zzso Through comparison of our experimental results with theoretical models and zzso simulations, we characterized in detail under which conditions zzso and zzso traffic jams form or do not zzso Our results indicate that transport zzso such as zzso may be zzso adapted to avoid the formation of traffic jams by moving only with moderate zzso and zzso rapidly from zzso zzso
