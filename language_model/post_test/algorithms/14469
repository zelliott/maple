We consider the problem of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches model the intensity field of zzso images as a zzso random field to take into account the local spatial zzso between the zzso Classical zzso zzso consists of also modeling the label field as a zzso random field to ensure that neighboring zzso zzso to the same texture class with high zzso zzso relaxation techniques are available which find the optimal label field with respect to the maximum a zzso or the maximum zzso mode zzso But, these techniques are usually zzso intensive because they require a large number of zzso to zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso framework by modeling two-dimensional zzso images as the zzso of two one-dimensional hidden zzso zzso models for the lines and the zzso zzso A zzso algorithm, which is similar to zzso decoding in the context of zzso codes, is obtained based on a factor graph zzso The proposed method estimates the unknown parameters using the zzso zzso
