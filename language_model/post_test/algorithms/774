zzso regulation is one of the most basic regulatory mechanisms in the zzso The zzso of multiple zzso zzso sequences and the advent of zzso experimental techniques have motivated the development of a large number of zzso methods for the detection of regulatory zzso The regulatory process is extremely complex and individual zzso zzso typically have very limited success in zzso zzso Here, we argue the importance of zzso multiple zzso zzso and present an infrastructure that zzso eight web services covering key areas of zzso zzso We have adopted the zzso integration technology and built a consistent input and output environment with a versatile zzso tool named zzso The infrastructure will allow for easy integration of gene regulation analysis software that is scattered over the zzso It will also enable bench biologists to perform an arsenal of analysis using cutting-edge methods in a familiar environment and zzso researchers to focus on developing new zzso without the need to invest substantial effort on complex zzso or zzso zzso is freely available to academic users and can be launched online at zzso provided that zzso Web Start has been zzso In addition, a zzso version of the program can be downloaded and run zzso It can be obtained at zzso
