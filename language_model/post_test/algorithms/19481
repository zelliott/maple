Since zzso stability is a global property of proteins that has to be zzso during evolution, the selective pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the zzso acids present at other zzso However, models of molecular evolution that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of zzso become zzso intractable if such correlations between sites are explicitly taken into zzso 

We introduce an evolutionary model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint on the conservation of structural zzso This model consists of a selection process, which depends on two zzso parameters that can be zzso from protein sequences without any fit, and a zzso process for which we consider various zzso It reproduces zzso the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native state is explicitly zzso and zzso We then compare the predicted zzso zzso acid zzso with those sampled from the zzso Data Bank zzso The parameters of the zzso model, whose number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the zzso The mean correlation zzso between predicted and observed zzso zzso acid zzso is larger than zzso zzso zzso for a zzso model with no free parameters and no genetic zzso In contrast, considering only the zzso process with no selection yields a mean correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso with three fitted zzso The zzso model that best fits the data takes into account increased zzso rate at zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso zzso with five zzso 

The effective selection process that we propose reproduces well zzso acid zzso as observed in the protein sequences in the zzso Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood calculations in zzso zzso Interestingly, in this approach the zzso process influences the effective selection process, zzso selection and zzso must be zzso in order to obtain effectively independent zzso This zzso between zzso and selection reflects the deep influence that zzso has on the evolutionary process: The bias in the zzso influences the zzso properties of the evolving zzso in agreement with comparative studies of bacterial zzso and it also influences the rate of accepted zzso
