zzso of the host cell zzso is the hallmark of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which links the zzso zzso to the zzso cell zzso zzso triggering formation of zzso zzso beneath adherent zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a recently discovered type III zzso system zzso protein which, following zzso binds and activates zzso syndrome protein zzso which in turn activates the zzso protein 2/3 complex leading to localized zzso of zzso In this study, truncated zzso and zzso derivatives were generated and tested in in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell infection zzso The zzso zzso acids zzso of the zzso binding domain zzso of zzso were identified as essential, although not zzso for zzso zzso interaction, zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso consists of a unique zzso domain and six zzso zzso Progressive deletions within the zzso of zzso revealed that zzso zzso are necessary and sufficient for its zzso while zzso acids zzso encompassing the zzso zzso signal and two zzso repeats, are sufficient for triggering zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and in in zzso zzso zzso zzso This study defines the modular domain structure of zzso and the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the host zzso zzso
