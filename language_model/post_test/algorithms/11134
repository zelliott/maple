This paper presents a novel method for the zzso of a parallel robot, which allows a more accurate zzso instead of a zzso based on nominal zzso It is used, as the main sensor with one camera installed in the robot hand that determines the relative position of the robot with respect to a zzso object fixed in the working area of the zzso The positions of the end zzso are related to the incremental positions of zzso of the robot zzso A zzso model of the robot is used to find a new group of zzso which zzso errors in the zzso zzso Additionally, properties of the zzso object and intrinsic camera parameters are zzso to model the projection of the object in the image and thereby improve spatial zzso Finally, several working tests, zzso and tracking tests are executed in order to verify how the robotic system zzso improves by using zzso parameters against nominal zzso In order to emphasize that, this proposed new method uses neither external nor expensive zzso That is why new robots are useful in teaching and research zzso
