zzso symmetry averaging for improving and extending an initial set of zzso can be crucial at an early stage of a protein structure zzso A method is described which detects the position of a proper rotation axis in a surprisingly poor zzso map and is fast enough to run through a large number of axis zzso It uses a simple zzso mask to define the searching unit, which is then shifted through the whole unit cell looking for the position with the highest correlation zzso between the interrelated zzso zzso weighting and averaging enhances the zzso zzso Examples of the application of this zzso are zzso The use of the local rotation axis for phasing is commented zzso A search of the zzso Data Bank showed that zzso of the unique crystal forms contain proper local zzso zzso which could have been located with the presented zzso
