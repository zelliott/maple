zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso green zzso dilution is applied zzso on the head to determine the cerebral zzso of zzso care zzso We applied zzso Carlo simulation for the analysis of a number of problems associated with this zzso First, the contamination of the optical density zzso signal due to the zzso tissue was zzso Second, the measured zzso signal depends essentially on the relative blood content (with respect to its zzso in the various zzso zzso To take this into account, we weighted the calculated zzso of the zzso distribution under baseline conditions within the different zzso with the changes and aberration of the relative blood volumes that are typically observed under healthy and zzso zzso Third, in case of zzso zzso dye zzso an zzso zzso replaces part of the blood such that a transient change of zzso in the brain zzso occurs that can be recorded in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that for an exchange fraction of zzso of the relative blood volume within the zzso zzso the zzso signal is determined from 64 to zzso by the gray matter and between 8 to zzso by the white matter zzso for a distance of zzso zzso
