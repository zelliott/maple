In programming motor acts, the brain must consider both internal and external noise zzso inherent variation in sensory estimates and changes within the zzso An interesting question in motor control is how reliable responses can be programmed in the face of noise and how these two noise sources zzso We study this by investigating the generation of sequences of zzso zzso to visual zzso First, eight normal subjects tracked targets that zzso at a pacing frequency zzso zzso that promoted zzso behavior, for 300 zzso When tracking this perfectly periodic zzso there was zzso in the timing of the zzso zzso zzso that was distributed around the zzso of the stimulus zzso zzso We used this inherent zzso to set the timing of subsequent zzso subjects completed three additional sessions in which the zzso of the stimulus timing (the zzso zzso had the same zzso zzso less zzso zzso or more zzso zzso zzso than the subject displayed when tracking the perfectly periodic zzso Despite changes in stimulus timing zzso zzso of the response timing zzso zzso was equal to the zzso of the stimulus plus zzso zzso zzso zzso when tracking a perfectly periodic zzso zzso the correlations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso this relationship is interpreted as a zzso between reliance on previous zzso performance zzso zzso and reliance on the current zzso
