zzso symbolic dynamics is based on zzso zzso Its tools include zzso zzso (in metric and zzso zzso forbidden patterns, and a number of mathematical results that make this sort of symbolic dynamics appealing both for zzso and zzso In particular, zzso symbolic dynamics is robust against zzso noise and can be implemented with low zzso cost, which explains its increasing popularity in time series zzso In this paper, we study the perhaps less exploited aspect so far of zzso zzso their zzso zzso In a first part, we revisit the concept of transcript between two symbolic zzso zzso it to N zzso and derive some general zzso In a second part, we use transcripts to define two complexity indicators of coupled zzso Their performance is tested with zzso and real world zzso
