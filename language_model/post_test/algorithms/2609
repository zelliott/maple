Unlike distinct species, closely related species offer a great challenge for zzso reconstruction and species identification with DNA zzso due to their often overlapping genetic zzso We tested a sibling species group of pine zzso zzso in China with a standard zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene and two alternative internal transcribed zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso Five different zzso zzso analysis methods zzso likelihood zzso zzso zzso close zzso zzso Minimum distance zzso and zzso method zzso representing commonly used methodology zzso and zzso zzso in the field, were applied to both zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrated clear zzso species zzso for three relatively distant related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as recovered by both single and multiple genes while the zzso relationship of three closely related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be resolved with the traditional zzso zzso Additionally, we find the standard zzso zzso zzso two nuclear ITS zzso whatever the methods zzso On average, the zzso zzso achieved a success rate of zzso while zzso and zzso obtained a success rate of zzso indicating ITS genes are less suitable for species identification in this zzso We propose the use of an overall success rate of species identification that takes both sequencing success and zzso success into account, since species identification success rates with zzso zzso system were generally zzso especially by zzso methods, where only successfully zzso DNA sequences were used to construct a zzso zzso zzso based methods, such as MD, zzso and zzso approaches, presented advantages over zzso methods by reporting the overall success rates with statistical zzso In addition, our results indicate that the most closely related species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be still in the process of incomplete lineage zzso with occasional zzso occurring among zzso
