Parallel transmission has emerged as an efficient means for implementing zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso To date, most theoretical and experimental work on parallel transmission zzso zzso pulse design is based on the zzso approximation to the Bloch zzso The zzso while zzso zzso is not an exact solution and leads to significant errors when zzso zzso are zzso zzso have been proposed to overcome the limitations of the zzso using zzso zzso zzso or optimal control zzso These methods, however, are based on further approximations to the Bloch equation or require the use of general purpose zzso that do not capitalize fully on the dynamics of the physical model at zzso In this article, a novel zzso for zzso parallel transmission pulse design is zzso The zzso relies on a zzso analysis of the Bloch equation and it depicts the relationship between the excited zzso its zzso from the target pattern and the desired zzso zzso and experiments are used to validate the proposed method on a 7 T zzso transmit zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso analysis zzso provides a fast and accurate approach for zzso zzso pulse design, especially when large acceleration factors and/or zzso zzso are zzso
