A methodology is described for screening zzso zzso zzso of peptides prior to database searching for protein zzso A software routine written in the zzso programming language was used to analyze data from previous zzso database searches and develop a set of statistical zzso that could be used to identify zzso not likely to yield useful results in a database zzso A second zzso program used an evolutionary zzso to zzso the criteria for each statistical zzso and generate a formula for determining spectral zzso This formula was used by a third zzso program to screen data sets from four independent liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso On the average, use of the screening program reduced the time required for a database search by 1/2 with little loss of useful information from the database search zzso
