zzso thermodynamics provides a powerful theoretical framework for zzso understanding and predicting the zzso properties of zzso The central quantity is the potential of mean force or effective energy as a function of zzso which consists of the zzso energy and the zzso free zzso The zzso energy can be reasonably described by molecular zzso zzso While the zzso free energy is more difficult to model, useful results can be obtained with simple zzso Such functions have been used to estimate the zzso energy contribution to protein stability and obtain insights into the origin of zzso functions of protein zzso such as the heat zzso With reasonable zzso of the various energy terms, one can obtain meaningful values for the contribution of one type of interaction or one chemical group to zzso Future developments will allow the zzso characterization of ever more complex biological zzso
