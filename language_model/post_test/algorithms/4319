To compare the relative cerebral blood flow zzso obtained by zzso zzso spin labeling sequence incorporated with zzso fast zzso zzso zzso with those by zzso zzso and zzso zzso dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso 

Thirty patients with various neurological diseases participated in this zzso In addition to zzso 15 patients received zzso and the others received zzso imaging on a 3 zzso zzso A cortical gray matter zzso to white matter zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratio were determined from each zzso zzso In addition, zzso of relative zzso zzso were obtained from each method for zzso 

zzso correlations of zzso ratios were found between zzso and the two zzso methods zzso The zzso resulted in zzso zzso ratios similar to zzso but significantly smaller than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio obtained by zzso was significantly smaller than those by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso , zzso The zzso of relative zzso maps obtained from zzso after applied spatial zzso agreed well with that from zzso 

This study suggested that zzso images obtained from zzso exhibited significant correlations with zzso with greater zzso weighting like zzso
