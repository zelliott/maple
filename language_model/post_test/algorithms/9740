Continuous zzso such as reaction and run times, and zzso zzso such as zzso responses, are recorded routinely in behavioral learning zzso Although both types of performance measures are often recorded zzso the two have not been used in combination to evaluate zzso We present a zzso model of learning in which the observation process has simultaneously recorded continuous and zzso measures of zzso We use these performance measures simultaneously to estimate the model parameters and the zzso cognitive state process by maximum likelihood using an approximate expectation zzso zzso zzso We introduce the concept of a zzso curve and zzso our previous definitions of the learning curve, the ideal observer curve, the learning trial and zzso comparisons of performance in terms of the new zzso We illustrate the properties of the new model in an analysis of a simulated learning zzso In the simulated data analysis, simultaneous use of the two measures of performance provided more credible and accurate estimates of the learning than either measure analyzed zzso We also analyze two actual learning experiments in which the performance of rats and of monkeys was tracked across trials by simultaneously recorded reaction and run times and the correct and incorrect zzso In the analysis of the actual experiments, our zzso gave a straightforward, efficient way to characterize learning by combining continuous and zzso measures of zzso This analysis paradigm has implications for characterizing learning and for the more general problem of combining different data types to characterize the properties of a neural zzso
