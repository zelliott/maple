To zzso the intensity of zzso magnetic stimulation zzso at the zzso pole, the zzso threshold is used as a measure of cortical zzso The zzso threshold zzso refers to the intensity of magnetic stimulation that zzso zzso flashes of light zzso on a proportion of zzso The existing zzso zzso procedures lack the accuracy and mathematical zzso of modern threshold zzso zzso We present an improved and automatic procedure for zzso the zzso which is based on the well-established zzso zzso zzso staircase zzso To validate the new zzso we compared it with another commonly used procedure for zzso the zzso We found that our procedure is more accurate, reliable, and rapid when compared with an existing zzso measurement zzso The new procedure is implemented in zzso and works automatically with the zzso zzso zzso using a convenient zzso user zzso The zzso program is freely available for zzso
