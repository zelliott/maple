This study aims to characterize zzso complexity, measured as the prediction error resulting from zzso zzso in healthy humans during zzso zzso 

zzso were recorded from 15 subjects with eyes closed zzso and eyes open zzso during the baseline condition and during zzso zzso stimulation zzso at 5, 10, and 15 zzso The mean squared prediction error zzso resulting from nearest neighbor local linear prediction was taken as complexity zzso zzso maps were generated zzso the zzso index over a zzso scalp zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that: zzso zzso shows good predictability in all conditions and seems to be well explained by a linear zzso process; zzso the complexity is lower with zzso than with zzso and increases significantly during zzso to a lesser extent during 10 zzso zzso zzso significant differences of zzso complexity are zzso between zzso and zzso scalp zzso 

Changes in zzso complexity during zzso can be successfully assessed using zzso zzso The observed modifications in the patterns of complexity seem to reflect zzso behaviors and suggest future zzso of the method in clinical zzso
