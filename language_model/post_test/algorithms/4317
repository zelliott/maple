To evaluate a method to enable zzso or zzso zzso phase contrast zzso acquisition during a single zzso using a highly zzso zzso acquisition ordering and temporally constrained image reconstruction with a zzso varying zzso zzso 

zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso ascending zzso were obtained at different acceleration factors using a view projection acquisition order zzso for temporally constrained reconstruction zzso Reconstruction of the sparse zzso data performed with zzso was compared to reconstructions using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso resulted in more accurate zzso zzso than zzso or zzso zzso In one zzso zzso of zzso in zzso data (16 views per cardiac zzso resulted in a peak zzso zzso within zzso of the value measured by zzso ultrasound while zzso the scan time to 13 zzso High zzso zzso zzso was also compared lower zzso more highly zzso zzso in three normal zzso 

zzso proved to be an effective method for reconstructing zzso zzso PC zzso Although zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso blurring was minimized by using appropriate constraint weights in addition to a zzso varying zzso zzso zzso allowed for the acquisition time to be reduced to the duration of a zzso while still resulting in accurate zzso zzso
