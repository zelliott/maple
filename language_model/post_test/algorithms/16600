The purpose of this study was to measure the errors introduced by regular zzso of zzso scanners and to minimize the effect of zzso error on standardized zzso value zzso 

Global zzso factors from 2 zzso scanners were recorded for zzso and zzso zzso comparing zzso protocols with modified protocols to evaluate error contributions due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using National Institute of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was less than zzso although there was a consistent zzso Global zzso zzso was reduced from zzso to zzso for scanner 1 and from zzso to zzso for scanner 2 when quality assurance and quality control procedures were applied to the zzso zzso When zzso were done using a zzso zzso the zzso for both scanners was reduced to approximately zzso 

zzso quality assurance and quality control procedures to scanner zzso reduces zzso but there is a still a residual zzso scanner zzso of zzso The procedures proposed here reduce the impact of operator error on scanner zzso and thereby minimize zzso zzso in standardized zzso value zzso
