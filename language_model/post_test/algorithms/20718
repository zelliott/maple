This paper presents a new class of zzso for zzso reconstruction of zzso maps from zzso transmission zzso We derive the zzso by applying to the transmission zzso a version of the zzso technique developed by De zzso for zzso zzso The new class includes the zzso ascent zzso zzso and zzso convex zzso for transmission zzso as special zzso The new zzso ascent zzso zzso in the class overcome several limitations associated with previous zzso 1) Fewer zzso are required than in the transmission maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso 2) The zzso zzso accommodate zzso constraints, unlike many zzso zzso 3) The zzso are easily zzso unlike the zzso zzso and perhaps zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso faster than the zzso algorithm, even on conventional zzso An example from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission scan illustrates the zzso
