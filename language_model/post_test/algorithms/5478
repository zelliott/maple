zzso blood gas zzso has an important role in the clinical assessment of patients with acute zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso Because of zzso zzso an alternative method is zzso We have trained and tested five artificial neural networks zzso with zzso blood gas zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso to predict zzso values in patients with zzso zzso and zzso blood samples were collected from 132 zzso Using the data of 106 patients, the zzso were trained and validated by zzso zzso zzso data from the remainder 26 patients was used for testing the zzso The ability of zzso to predict zzso values and to detect significant zzso was assessed and the results were compared with a linear zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso provide an accurate method for predicting zzso values from zzso values and detecting zzso in zzso
