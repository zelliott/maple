zzso is an important applied tool in drug discovery and development for the prediction and interpretation of drug zzso zzso information is used to decide whether a compound will be taken forwards and its zzso investigated in zzso After proceeding to human little to no use is made of these often very rich zzso We suggest a method where the zzso data are integrated into a whole body zzso based zzso zzso model and this model is then used for zzso population zzso parameters in zzso This approach offers a continuous flow of information from zzso to clinical studies without the need for different models or model zzso Additionally, predictions are based upon single zzso values, but making realistic predictions involves incorporating the various sources of zzso and zzso Currently, zzso zzso is undertaken as a zzso process: zzso zzso zzso of zzso parameters by either least squares zzso or maximum likelihood and zzso accounting for the existing zzso zzso and uncertainty by zzso zzso To address these issues a general zzso approach using zzso for zzso of zzso parameters in zzso models is zzso zzso applied to data in zzso this approach is further adopted for zzso to human, which allows retention of some parameters and updating others with the available human zzso While the issues surrounding the incorporation of uncertainty and zzso within prediction have been explored within zzso modeling methodology they have equal application to other areas of zzso as well as to zzso
