In this paper, we propose a method that selects a subset of the training data points to update zzso zzso The main goal is to conduct the prototypes to zzso at a more convenient location, diminishing zzso zzso The method selects an update set composed by a subset of points considered to be at the risk of being captured by another class zzso We associate the proposed methodology to a weighted norm, instead of the zzso in order to establish different levels of relevance for the input zzso The technique was implemented on a controlled experiment and on Web available data zzso
