Automatic prostate zzso in MR images plays an important role in prostate cancer zzso However, there are two main challenges: zzso Large zzso prostate shape zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso To address these challenges, we propose a new zzso prostate MR zzso method, with the main contributions lying in the following aspects: First, the most salient features are zzso from zzso based on a zzso zzso analysis zzso method, which aims to find a zzso feature zzso by simultaneously maximizing the zzso distance and minimizing the zzso zzso The projected features, instead of only zzso intensity, will be served as anatomical signature of each zzso Second, based on the projected features, a new zzso sparse label fusion framework is proposed to estimate the prostate likelihood of each zzso in the target image from the coarse zzso Third, a zzso zzso zzso zzso method is proposed to incorporate the most reliable zzso information identified by the prostate likelihood map to refine the zzso result from the fine zzso Our method is evaluated on a zzso weighted prostate MR image zzso consisting of 66 patients and compared with two state-of-the-art zzso zzso Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves the highest zzso zzso than other methods under zzso
