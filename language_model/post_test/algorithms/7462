zzso zzso is a challenging problem on which significant progress has been zzso zzso models zzso and zzso models zzso are two important categories of zzso based image zzso zzso Efforts have been made on zzso two types of models into one zzso However, previous methods are not designed for zzso multiple zzso simultaneously and zzso In this paper, we propose a hybrid zzso organ zzso approach by zzso zzso and zzso in a coupled zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso zzso models can be integrated with zzso Random Fields zzso such that multiple zzso evolutions are driven by a maximum a zzso zzso zzso It brings global and local deformation constraints into a unified framework for simultaneous zzso of multiple objects in an zzso We validate this proposed method on two challenging problems of zzso organ zzso and the results are zzso
