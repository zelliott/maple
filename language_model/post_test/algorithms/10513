zzso of a target object in the form of a closed curve has many potential applications in medical imaging because it provides quantitative information related to the target zzso size and zzso However, ultrasound image zzso for boundary zzso of the target object is a very difficult task because of its inherent zzso including uncertainty of the zzso boundary caused by zzso noise, relatively low zzso and low zzso Indeed, in automatic ultrasound image zzso conventional techniques with standard zzso often fail to reach the desired zzso in the form of a simple closed curve because of the weakness of edge detector functions in finding the likely target zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso model which has the property of encouraging a closed curve by deliberately controlling the curve zzso The new model may be combined with various fitting terms to enhance zzso zzso The key features of the proposed model are demonstrated in zzso zzso simulations and experiments show that the proposed model enhances the zzso ability for zzso the target boundary as a closed zzso
