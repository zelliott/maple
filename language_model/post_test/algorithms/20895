The shoulder is one of the most complex zzso of the human body, mainly because of its large range of motion, but also because of its active muscular zzso Actually, the numerous stabilizing muscles and degrees of freedom yield indeterminate zzso zzso To solve this zzso most models use reverse dynamics with a simplified zzso joint, preventing therefore the natural zzso zzso In this paper, an zzso was specifically developed to solve the indeterminate problem by a feedback control of muscle zzso allowing the natural zzso zzso zzso was considered in the zzso plane, accounting for the three zzso parts and the rotator cuff zzso The major aim of this study was to validate the zzso algorithm, which was here restricted to zzso in order to compare the zzso solution to a known zzso zzso This comparison gave a relative error below zzso The joint reaction force was comparable to other models and the zzso translation was in agreement with in zzso or in zzso zzso
