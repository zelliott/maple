An zzso based on support zzso machines zzso the most recent advance in pattern recognition, is presented for use in zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso and normal zzso The in zzso zzso zzso used for development and evaluation of zzso diagnostic zzso were measured from 85 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 131 normal tissue sites from 59 subjects during routine zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the performance of the zzso An overall diagnostic accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for discriminating zzso zzso from normal zzso were achieved using a linear zzso zzso A diagnostic accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for detecting zzso were achieved with a zzso zzso zzso In a comparison with previously developed zzso using the same zzso and the principal component analysis zzso technique, the zzso zzso produced better diagnostic accuracy in all zzso In addition, we investigated a method combining zzso and zzso techniques for reducing the complexity of the zzso zzso
