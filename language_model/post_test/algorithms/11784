In order to take full advantage of the newly available public human zzso sequence data and associated zzso biologists require zzso tools that can accommodate the high frequency of alternative zzso in human genes and other zzso In this article, we describe techniques for presenting human zzso sequence data and zzso in an zzso zzso format, with the aim of providing developers with a guide to what features are most likely to meet zzso zzso These techniques include: one-dimensional semantic zooming to show sequence data alongside gene zzso zzso adjustable zzso visual zzso of translation frame to show how alternative transcript structure affects zzso zzso and display of protein zzso in the context of zzso sequence to show how alternative zzso impacts protein structure and zzso
