In cluster zzso trials zzso identifiable clusters rather than individuals are zzso to study zzso zzso data often consist of a small number of clusters with correlated observations within a treatment zzso Missing data often present a problem in the analysis of such trials, and multiple zzso zzso has been used to create complete data sets, enabling subsequent analysis with well-established analysis methods for zzso We discuss strategies for accounting for zzso when multiply zzso a missing continuous outcome, focusing on zzso of the zzso of group means as used in an adjusted zzso or zzso These analysis procedures are congenial to zzso be derived zzso a mixed effects zzso zzso however, this zzso procedure is not yet available in commercial statistical zzso An alternative approach that is readily available and has been used in recent studies is to include fixed effects for zzso but the impact of using this convenient method has not been zzso We show that under this zzso model the zzso zzso zzso is positively biased and that smaller zzso correlations zzso lead to larger zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressions for the bias of the zzso zzso are derived in the case of data missing completely at random, and cases in which data are missing at random are illustrated through zzso Finally, various zzso methods are applied to data from the Detroit Middle School zzso Project, a recent zzso zzso and differences in zzso are zzso
