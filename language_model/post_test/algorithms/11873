This study zzso a new quantitative zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso The zzso is not based on slices and provides fully zzso sampling and analysis independent of assumptions about the geometric shape of the left zzso 

zzso and zzso normal limits and thresholds for zzso zzso in 20 segments of the left zzso were developed for separate, zzso rest zzso zzso zzso in 36 patients with zzso zzso likelihood of coronary artery disease zzso zzso 1) and 159 patients with zzso abnormalities zzso zzso These thresholds were validated in 131 patients zzso 3) by comparison with expert visual zzso zzso for automatic zzso scores were developed and validated for groups 2 and 3, zzso The accuracy of zzso detection was assessed in 94 patients, who underwent coronary zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity for detection of stress and rest zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, for men and zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso specificity for stress and rest was zzso and zzso respectively, for men and zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso between automatic and visual scores was good (weighted K of zzso and zzso for stress and rest images, zzso zzso and specificity were zzso for the detection of zzso or zzso zzso For the detection of left anterior zzso left zzso and right coronary artery zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and specificity was zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The new quantitative zzso zzso approach is highly sensitive and specific for the detection and zzso of zzso provides accurate automatic scores for the assessment of regional zzso and overcomes the zzso limitations of previous quantitative zzso
