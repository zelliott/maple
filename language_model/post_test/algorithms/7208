A fundamental assumption embraced in conventional use of the zzso zzso immersion technique to measure zzso in solid materials is zzso The cited assumption relies on perfect and zzso zzso at the water to sample zzso a necessary condition that allows calculating the reflection zzso at any interface from elastic wave propagation zzso This zzso is then used to correct the measured signal and obtain the real zzso zzso of the sample under zzso In this paper, cases in which the perfectly cohesive zzso condition is not satisfied are zzso It is shown also that in those cases, the zzso of the conditions at the interface is always zzso This implies that the reflection zzso are unknown, even when density is zzso A new method of simultaneously measuring the reflection zzso for both exposed zzso that are normal to the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso is developed and is presented zzso The zzso of the new method is zzso as we demonstrate that the proper value of zzso is achieved independently of the continuously varying zzso conditions of these zzso zzso
