zzso zzso injection of drug is a common method for treating diseases of the zzso or zzso The stagnant nature of the zzso humor and surrounding tissue barriers creates concentration zzso within the zzso that must be accounted for when developing drug zzso The objective of this research was to study drug distribution in the zzso humor of the rabbit eye after an zzso injection, using a finite element zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected as model compounds due to available experimental zzso All required model parameters were known except for the zzso of these compounds through the zzso which was determined by fitting model predictions to experimental zzso The location of the zzso injection in the experimental studies was not precisely zzso therefore, several injection locations were considered, and zzso retinal zzso was determined for each zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso estimated by the model ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 0 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, depending on the assumed site of the zzso These zzso values were compared with values previously calculated from other models, and the limitations of the models are zzso zzso injection position was found to be an important variable that must be controlled in both experimental and clinical zzso
