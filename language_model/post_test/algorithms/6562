zzso sequence comparison methods are still in the early stages of development compared to those of zzso sequence zzso In this paper, we introduce a zzso measure of similarity between two biological sequences without zzso The method is based on the concept of comparing the zzso between two constructed zzso zzso 

The method was tested against six DNA zzso which are the zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso from zzso coli K-12 and from zzso zzso and one random sequence having the same base composition as zzso from zzso These results were compared with those obtained from zzso W zzso zzso and the chaos game representation zzso The method was further tested against a more complex set of 40 DNA sequences and compared with other existing sequence similarity measures zzso 

All zzso and computer codes written in zzso are available upon request from the first zzso
