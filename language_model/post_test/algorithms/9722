Wireless body area networks zzso offer many promising new applications in the area of remote health zzso An important element in the development of a zzso is the characterization of the physical layer of the network, including an zzso of the delay spread and the path loss between two zzso on the zzso This paper discusses the propagation channel between two zzso zzso at zzso zzso placed near a human body and presents an application for zzso design in order to zzso the energy consumption of different zzso zzso zzso are performed on real humans in a zzso environment, considering different parts of the body zzso In addition, path loss has been zzso investigated with an zzso correct model of the human body in free space using a 3-D electromagnetic zzso zzso loss parameters and zzso channel characteristics are extracted from the measurement and simulation zzso A zzso path loss model is presented for an antenna height above the body of 5 zzso and antenna zzso from 5 zzso up to 40 zzso A zzso analysis is performed and models are presented for the mean excess delay and the delay zzso As a zzso application, the proposed path loss models are used to evaluate the energy efficiency of zzso and zzso network zzso
