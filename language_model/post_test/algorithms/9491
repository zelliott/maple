An application that provides a flexible and easy to use interface to the zzso spectral simulation package is described that is targeted at investigations using in zzso MR zzso zzso The program makes available a number of widely used zzso localized MRS pulse sequences and zzso parameters for commonly observed tissue zzso enabling zzso to be simulated for any pulse sequence zzso and viewed in an integrated zzso The application is zzso with a database for storage of all simulation parameters and results of the zzso This application provides a convenient method for generating a zzso spectral information used in zzso spectral analyses and for visual examination of the effects of difference pulse sequences and zzso zzso
