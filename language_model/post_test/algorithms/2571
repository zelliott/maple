zzso zzso zzso is a method for quantitative assessment of zzso contraction and zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of zzso in fetuses and investigate fetal zzso properties in normal zzso 

Two hundred thirty pregnant women participated in the zzso Fetal zzso zzso were saved for zzso zzso zzso values for the global zzso peak zzso zzso strain zzso strain rate zzso and displacement zzso in the fetal heart were established using data from 62 right zzso zzso and 68 left zzso zzso Furthermore, the change of the motion zzso and zzso and deformation zzso and zzso in the course of the pregnancy was zzso zzso zzso was assessed in a total of 137 zzso The remaining 93 cases were zzso as there was no tracking zzso 

zzso fetuses exhibit a statistically significant increase in all motion parameters in both zzso with increasing zzso age zzso In contrast, the deformation parameters with advancing zzso zzso RV has a higher zzso V and zzso than zzso 

The increase in motion is attributable to fetal cardiac growth, whereas the decrease in deformation parameters indicates an zzso adaptation zzso RV appears to have a different relaxation pattern than zzso This study establishes a base for further zzso of zzso in fetal medicine and emphasizes a distinct zzso difference between RV and zzso zzso
