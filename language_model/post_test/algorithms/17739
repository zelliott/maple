zzso zzso zzso zzso is a technique that zzso the zzso zzso distribution within the body by using current and zzso zzso made on the body zzso It has been reported that the image reconstruction is distorted considerably when the boundary shape is considered to be more elliptical than circular as a more realistic shape for the measurement zzso This paper describes an alternative framework for determining the zzso region with a finite measurement precision for different zzso zzso in a body modeled by zzso cylinder zzso The distinguishable regions are compared in terms of modeling error for zzso zzso with elliptical and circular approaches for a zzso measurement boundary at the body zzso Since most objects investigated by zzso are zzso in shape, the zzso solution for the forward problem for the elliptical cross section approach is shown to be useful in order to reach a better assessment of the zzso region defined in a zzso zzso This paper is concentrated on centered zzso zzso in the elliptical boundary and an zzso solution for this type of forward zzso The zzso performance of elliptical cross section with zzso injected current patterns is examined for different parameters of elliptical zzso
