C zzso and N zzso are major causes of maternal and zzso morbidity and mortality in developing zzso To identify characteristics zzso of cervical infection, we examined pregnant women attending an zzso clinic in zzso zzso C zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and N zzso from 17 zzso cervical infection with either pathogen was present in 28 zzso Two characteristics were independently zzso of cervical infection by zzso zzso zzso the presence of either zzso zzso or induced zzso zzso relative risk zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and having more than one sexual partner during pregnancy, relative risk zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A screening zzso for cervical infection which tested women with one or both risk markers would have a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 51 to zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In countries where resources are zzso diagnostic zzso incorporating clinical signs and zzso characteristics may be useful in identifying pregnant women at high risk of cervical zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso are major causes of maternal and zzso morbidity in developing zzso 178 pregnant women attending an zzso clinic in zzso Kenya, were therefore examined in the attempt to identify characteristics zzso of cervical zzso zzso zzso was isolated from 14 zzso and zzso zzso from 17 zzso cervical infection with either pathogen was present in 28 zzso zzso zzso analysis found that the presence of either zzso zzso or induced zzso bleeding and having more than 1 sex partner during pregnancy were independently zzso of cervical zzso A screening program for cervical infection which tested women with 1 or both risk markers zzso have a sensitivity of zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso The authors conclude that countries with limited resources may use diagnostic zzso and incorporate clinical signs and behavioral characteristics to help identify pregnant women at high risk of cervical zzso
