We assume that each class of protein has a core structure that is defined by internal zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso contribute to the stability of the structure, are of primary importance to function, but do not determine the architecture of the core portions of the zzso zzso An zzso has been developed to supply a list of permitted sequences of internal zzso compatible with a known core zzso This list is referred to as the zzso template for that zzso In general the positions in the template are not zzso adjacent and are distributed throughout the zzso zzso The template is derived using the fixed positions for the zzso and zzso atoms in the test structure and selected zzso zzso The focus of this paper is on the use of two packing criteria: avoidance of zzso overlap and complete filling of available zzso The program also notes potential polar group interactions and zzso bonds as well as possible burial of formal zzso Central to the zzso is the zzso zzso zzso In an update of earlier studies by others, we show that 17 of the 20 zzso acids zzso Met, zzso and zzso can be represented adequately by 67 zzso zzso A list of zzso angles and their standard zzso is zzso The zzso zzso refined structures in the Brookhaven zzso Data Bank show similar mean zzso values, but have much smaller zzso than those of earlier zzso This suggests that a zzso library may be a better structural approximation than was previously zzso In using packing constraints, it has been found essential to include all hydrogen atoms zzso The zzso zzso representation is not zzso The permitted zzso sequences are severely restricted by the zzso plus zzso atoms of the test zzso Further restriction is introduced if the full set of atoms of the external zzso are held zzso the zzso zzso The zzso requirement has a major role in restricting the template zzso The preliminary tests reported here make it appear likely that templates prepared from the currently known core structures will be able to discriminate between these zzso The templates should thus be useful in deciding whether a sequence of unknown zzso structure fits any of the known core classes and, if a fit is found, how the sequence should be aligned in three dimensions to fit the core of that zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
