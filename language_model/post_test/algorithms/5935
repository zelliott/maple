We deal in this paper with an ongoing development of the zzso element zzso We present in outline new zzso line elements that are suitable to model general flow fields, zzso flow fields that possess a continuously varying zzso inflow or zzso These elements are constructed specifically to model the leakage through leaky layers that separate aquifers in leaky systems and to model transient zzso The leakage or release from storage underneath linear features is modeled precisely by the new zzso the zzso in leakage is matched exactly by the approximate zzso zzso are given for a problem involving leakage and for a case of transient zzso We note that the zzso elements can be used also to reproduce the effect of continuously varying zzso properties, zzso the zzso zzso or the zzso of the base of the zzso In the latter case, the elements would reproduce the rotation of the flow field caused by the variation in properties, rather than the divergence as for the case of zzso
