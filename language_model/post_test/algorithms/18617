zzso zzso remote sensing from satellites and ground stations has contributed zzso and zzso to the study of atmospheric chemistry, zzso and environmental zzso As user requirements are raised, in terms of the accuracy and the spatial resolution, a mechanically scanning zzso with a real zzso becomes zzso due to the requirement for a very large antenna zzso However, an zzso synthesis zzso radiometer presents a valuable zzso The work presented in this paper was devoted to high spatial resolution imaging, using the 37 zzso band zzso zzso developed by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso method was exploited for the imaging, which outperformed the conventional zzso zzso zzso We concluded that the high spatial resolution imaging of the brightness temperature of the atmosphere could be accomplished with an zzso radiometer equipped with the developed zzso zzso imaging zzso
