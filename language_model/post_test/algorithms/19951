In this paper, an improved cascade control methodology for zzso processes is developed, in which the primary zzso controller is implemented by neural networks trained by minimizing error zzso zzso The zzso of the tracking error can be estimated zzso by utilizing receding horizon window zzso The measurable disturbances in zzso processes are input to the zzso controller besides the sequences of tracking error in outer loop control system, zzso feedback control is combined with zzso control in the proposed zzso zzso The zzso condition of the neural networks is zzso The zzso procedures of the proposed cascade control approach are zzso Compared with the zzso controller using minimizing squared error zzso the proposed zzso controller using minimizing error zzso criterion may decrease fluctuations of the zzso steam zzso A simulation example shows the advantages of the proposed zzso
