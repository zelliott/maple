The population zzso rate zzso remains one of the most fundamental parameters in zzso zzso and evolutionary zzso However, its accurate zzso can be seriously compromised when working with error prone data such as expressed sequence zzso low coverage draft zzso and other such unfinished zzso This study is premised on the simple idea that a random sequence error due to a chance accident during data collection or recording will be distributed within a population zzso as a singleton zzso as a zzso site where one sampled sequence exhibits a unique base relative to the common zzso of the zzso Thus, one can avoid these random errors by ignoring the zzso within a zzso 

This strategy is implemented under an infinite sites model that focuses on only the internal branches of the sample zzso where a shared zzso can arise zzso a variable site where each alternative base is represented by at least two zzso This approach is first used to derive independently the same new zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as recently reported by zzso 1 for error prone zzso It is then used to modify the recent, full, zzso model of zzso and zzso 2, which incorporates various factors for experimental error and design with those for zzso and zzso These new methods are all accurate and fast according to evolutionary simulations and analyses of a real complex population zzso for the California zzso 

In light of these results, we recommend the use of these three new methods for the determination of zzso from error prone zzso In particular, we advocate the new maximum likelihood model as a starting point for the further development of more complex zzso models that also account for experimental error and zzso
