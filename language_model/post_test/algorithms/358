zzso liver dysfunction and zzso sludge are common problems in critically ill zzso No specific strategies have been described to prevent zzso and zzso sludge in the intensive care unit zzso We examined liver dysfunction and zzso sludge zzso in a large medical zzso zzso population and hypothesized that tight zzso control with intensive insulin therapy zzso reduces zzso and zzso zzso 

This study was a zzso zzso of zzso zzso (at least a fifth day) zzso patients out of a large zzso controlled trial zzso zzso zzso studying the effects of zzso on the outcome of medical critical zzso Patients were allocated to either zzso zzso zzso zzso or conventional insulin therapy zzso requiring insulin above a zzso of 215 zzso Different patterns of liver dysfunction were studied based on daily blood sample analysis, and zzso sludge was evaluated by zzso 

On admission, zzso was present in zzso of patients zzso zzso zzso increasing to zzso on d 10 zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso sludge on d 5 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference did not remain significant on d 10 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also lowered the cumulative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso liver dysfunction and zzso sludge are very common during prolonged critical illness but are significantly reduced by zzso
