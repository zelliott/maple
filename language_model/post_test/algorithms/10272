The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso human and environmental conditions on the mechanical properties zzso strength and zzso zzso tear strength zzso of maxillofacial silicone zzso 

zzso were zzso using zzso silicone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight groups were prepared (21 specimens in each zzso eight zzso eight zzso five zzso and zzso differently as follows zzso 1 through zzso Dry storage for 24 hours; dry storage in dark for 6 zzso storage in simulated zzso solution for 6 zzso storage in simulated zzso perspiration for 6 zzso accelerated artificial daylight aging under controlled moisture for 360 hours; outdoor zzso for 6 zzso storage in zzso zzso solution for 30 hours; and mixed conditioning of zzso storage and light aging for 360 zzso The conditioning period selected simulated a zzso being in service for up to 12 zzso zzso and tear test specimens were zzso and tested according to the International zzso Organization zzso standards zzso 37 and 34, zzso Shore A zzso test specimens were zzso and tested according to the American zzso for Testing and Materials zzso D zzso Data were analyzed with one-way zzso zzso and zzso zzso post hoc tests zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was also used for zzso strength and tear zzso 

zzso significant differences were evident among all properties zzso Mixed conditioning of simulated zzso storage under accelerated artificial daylight aging significantly zzso mechanical properties of the silicone zzso zzso zzso 

Mechanical properties of maxillofacial zzso are adversely affected by human and environmental zzso Mixed aging of storage in simulated zzso under accelerated daylight aging was the most degrading zzso 

zzso aging of silicone specimens in simulated zzso under artificial daylight for 12 months of simulated clinical service greatly affected functional properties of silicone zzso however, in real practice, the effect is modest, since zzso concentration is lower, and daylight is less zzso
