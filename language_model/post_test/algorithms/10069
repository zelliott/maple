zzso sensitivity of soil zzso zzso is an important zzso in modeling the effects of global warming on zzso carbon zzso Experimental studies of soil zzso have zzso indicated that zzso has high spatial zzso However, most zzso models still use a constant zzso in projecting future climate change and no spatial pattern of zzso values at large scales has been zzso In this study, we conducted an inverse modeling analysis to retrieve the spatial pattern of zzso in China at 8 zzso spatial resolution by assimilating data of soil organic carbon into a zzso zzso carbon model zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso values are zzso zzso and consistent to the values derived from soil zzso zzso The mean zzso values of different soil types range from zzso to zzso with the highest value in volcanic soil, and the lowest value in cold brown zzso zzso The spatial pattern of Q (10) is related to environmental factors, especially zzso and top soil organic carbon zzso This study demonstrates that inverse modeling is a useful tool in zzso the spatial pattern of zzso at large zzso with which being incorporated into zzso models, uncertainty in the projection of future carbon dynamics could be potentially zzso
