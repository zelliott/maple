zzso of the structural zzso of virus particles in electron zzso is a complex task, but desirable in connection with investigation of the maturation process and detection of changes in viral particle zzso in response to the effect of a zzso or zzso drugs being zzso zzso we have here developed a procedure for describing and zzso virus particle forms in electron zzso based on determination of the zzso characteristics of the projection of a given virus zzso The template for the virus particle is created on the basis of information obtained from a small training set of electron zzso and is then employed to zzso and zzso similar structures of interest in an unlimited number of electron zzso by a process of zzso 

zzso application of the method is demonstrated by the ability to locate three diverse classes of virus particles in transmission electron zzso of zzso infected with human zzso These results show that fast screening of the total number of viral structures at different stages of maturation in a large set of electron zzso a task that is otherwise both time-consuming and tedious for the expert, can be accomplished rapidly and reliably with our automated zzso Using linear deformation analysis, this novel zzso described here can handle zzso variations such as zzso and zzso allows evaluation of properties such as the size and orientation of a virus zzso 

Our zzso procedure represents a promising objective tool for comparative studies of the zzso assembly processes of virus particles using electron zzso in combination with our digitized image analysis zzso An automated method for sorting and zzso virus particles at different stages of maturation will enable us to zzso virus production in all stages of the virus maturation process, not only count the number of infectious particles released from zzso infected zzso
