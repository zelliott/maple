zzso of missing links of incomplete networks, such as zzso interaction networks or very likely but not yet zzso links in evolutionary networks like friendship networks in web society, can be considered as a zzso for further experiments or valuable information for web zzso In this paper, we present a local path index to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two zzso We propose a network model with zzso density and noise strength in generating zzso as well as collect data of six real zzso zzso zzso simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the local path index compared with two well-known and widely used zzso the common neighbors and the Katz zzso Indeed, the local path index provides competitively accurate predictions as the Katz index while requires much less CPU time and memory space than the Katz index, which is therefore a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of zzso zzso
