zzso repetitive protein sequences with a limited zzso acid palette are abundant in nature, and many of them play an important role in the structure and function of certain types of zzso However, such repetitive sequences often do not have zzso defined zzso zzso the identification of these zzso repetitive elements has proven challenging for existing zzso zzso Here we introduce a new zzso zzso zzso which uses zzso zzso methods borrowed from protein interaction studies to identify and characterize repetitive elements in zzso zzso Given their zzso we suggest that zzso represents a valuable resource for the study of typically neglected zzso zzso
