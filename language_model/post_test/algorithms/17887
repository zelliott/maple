In this paper, we present a general internal model zzso approach for motion skill learning at elementary and coordination zzso A unified internal model zzso is developed for describing discrete and rhythmic zzso Through analysis, we show that the zzso possesses zzso and spatial zzso which are defined as the ability to generate similar movement patterns directly by means of tuning some parameters of the zzso With zzso the learning or training process can be avoided when dealing with similar zzso The coordination is implemented in the zzso with appropriate phase shifts among multiple zzso under an overall zzso To facilitate the establishment of the zzso in this paper, we further explored zzso for detecting zzso of and phase difference between rhythmic movements, and neural network structures suitable for learning motion zzso Through three illustrative examples, we show that the human behavior patterns with single or multiple limbs can be easily learned and established by the zzso at the elementary and coordination zzso
