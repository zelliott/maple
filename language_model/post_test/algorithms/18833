zzso zzso is being evaluated as a candidate technology for zzso pathogen zzso We have investigated the impact of key experimental and background interference parameters on the bacterial species level identification performance of zzso zzso These parameters include zzso zzso zzso composition of water zzso and zzso aging in zzso The zzso zzso may be minimized by operating a zzso zzso continuous wave laser zzso at laser power zzso below zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso for zzso spores, and zzso zzso for zzso zzso coli zzso zzso In general, zzso spore zzso preparations may be zzso with higher laser power zzso than the equivalent zzso zzso zzso In order to evaluate the impact of background interference and zzso aging, we selected a zzso set zzso zzso zzso zzso organisms, zzso zzso zzso organisms, and proteins zzso zzso and constructed a zzso signature zzso that identifies at the species zzso zzso we evaluated the impact of tap water and storage time in water zzso on the zzso performance when characterizing zzso zzso spores, zzso spores, and zzso cell zzso In general, the measured zzso signatures of biological organisms exhibited minimal spectral zzso with respect to the age of a resting suspension and water zzso zzso The observed signature zzso did not substantially degrade discrimination performance at the zzso and species zzso In addition, zzso chemical imaging zzso was used to distinguish a mixture of zzso spores and zzso cells at the single cell zzso
