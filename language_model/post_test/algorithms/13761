This paper describes a zzso zzso zzso Design of zzso in zzso zzso for the statistical design of zzso engineering zzso The type of experiment that qualifies for this package involves a batch reaction zzso by a soluble zzso where the activity of the zzso zzso with zzso Assuming that both the zzso action and the zzso of the zzso obey known rate expressions, the present code is helpful in the process of obtaining estimates of the kinetic parameters by providing as output the times at which samples should be withdrawn from the reacting zzso Starting zzso design is used as a basis for the statistical zzso This zzso code is a powerful tool when fitting a rate expression to data because it increases the effectiveness of zzso by helping the zzso zzso obtain data points with the largest possible informational zzso
