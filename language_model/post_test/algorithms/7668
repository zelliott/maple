In this paper, we present a novel three zzso interactive medical image zzso method based on high level knowledge of training zzso Since the interactive system should provide intermediate results to an user quickly, insufficient low level models are used for most of previous zzso To exploit the high level knowledge within a short time, we construct a structured patch model that consists of multiple corresponding patch zzso The structured patch model includes the spatial relationships between neighboring patch sets and the prior knowledge of the corresponding patch set on each local zzso The spatial relationships accelerate the search of corresponding patch in test time, while the prior knowledge improves the zzso zzso The proposed framework provides not only fast editing zzso but the incremental learning system through adding the zzso result to the training zzso zzso demonstrate that the proposed method is useful for fast and accurate zzso of target objects from the multiple medical zzso
