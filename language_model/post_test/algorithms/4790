Despite the increasing number of published protein structures, and the fact that each zzso function relies on its three-dimensional structure, there is limited access to automatic programs used for the identification of critical zzso from the protein structure, compared with those based on protein zzso Here we present a new zzso based on network analysis applied exclusively on protein structures to identify critical zzso Our results show that this method identifies critical zzso for protein function with high reliability and improves automatic zzso approaches and previous network-based zzso The reliability of the method depends on the zzso diversity screened for the protein of zzso We have designed a web site to give access to this software at zzso In zzso a new method is presented that relates critical zzso for protein function with the most traversed zzso in networks derived from protein zzso A unique feature of the method is the inclusion of the zzso diversity of proteins in the zzso thus zzso a basic feature of the zzso relationship of zzso
