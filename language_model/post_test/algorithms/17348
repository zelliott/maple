An efficient method for gross motion simulation of human zzso dynamics under the action of external forcing and high acceleration environments is zzso The system is composed of a serial of linked rigid bodies simulating the skull, zzso and zzso These bodies are connected to each other by zzso springs and zzso representing the physical features of zzso ligaments, and zzso A systematic method for handling the geometry and zzso is used to develop the zzso The developed governing equations of the zzso system are useful for the development of zzso zzso zzso show excellent agreement between the model and the zzso The model is expected to be useful for efficient analysis of zzso dynamics during high acceleration environments and use with whole human body zzso The results of several examples are also zzso
