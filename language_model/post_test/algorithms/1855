Head movements can greatly affect swallowing zzso zzso In this paper, we implement a zzso approach to remove low frequency components associated with these zzso Our approach was tested using both synthetic and real zzso zzso signals were used to perform a comparative analysis of the zzso approach with other similar zzso Real data, obtained data from zzso healthy participants during various swallowing tasks, was used to analyze the processing accuracy with and without the zzso head motions removal zzso Specifically, we analyzed the zzso accuracy and the effects of the scheme on statistical properties of these signals, as measured by the zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis showed that the zzso technique achieves a superior performance in comparison to other existing zzso Additionally, when applied to real data, we improved the accuracy of the zzso process by achieving a zzso drop in the number of false zzso and a zzso drop in the number of false zzso Furthermore, the zzso trends in the statistical properties of these signals remained zzso as shown by the zzso analysis, but the strength of statistical persistence was significantly zzso These results clearly indicate that any future medical devices based on swallowing zzso signals should remove head motions from these signals in order to increase zzso zzso
