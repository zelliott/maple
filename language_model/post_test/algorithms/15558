The aim of this study was to evaluate properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to determine drug release mechanisms in the zzso zzso zzso with a wide range of properties were zzso using conventional zzso The interaction of spray dried zzso zzso zzso zzso with water was investigated using attenuated total zzso zzso transform zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso The in zzso performance of zzso zzso was assessed using a modified zzso kinetic zzso A modified Hansen zzso zzso approach was used to zzso the interactions with water and in zzso zzso In water or high zzso zzso zzso absorb water, lose relaxation energy and zzso The delay of the onset of zzso depends on the zzso and the amount of water zzso zzso follows first order zzso zzso and release of insulin from zzso zzso closely matches the degree of zzso The induction period depends on zzso interactions between the zzso and water while zzso is governed by polarity and hydrogen zzso Drug release from zzso zzso is, therefore, controlled by zzso of the zzso on contact with zzso The pulmonary environment was found to resemble one of high humidity rather than a liquid zzso
