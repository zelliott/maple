A novel database search zzso is presented for the qualitative identification of proteins over a wide dynamic range, both in simple and complex biological zzso The zzso has been designed for the analysis of data originating from data independent acquisitions, zzso multiple precursor zzso are fragmented zzso zzso used by the zzso include retention time, zzso zzso charge state, and accurate masses on both precursor and product zzso from zzso zzso The search zzso uses an zzso process zzso each iteration zzso increases the zzso zzso and sensitivity of the overall zzso Increased specificity is obtained by utilizing a subset database search approach, zzso for each subsequent stage of the search, only those peptides from zzso identified proteins are zzso zzso zzso and protein identifications are ranked and scored by their relative correlation to a number of models of known and zzso derived zzso attributes of proteins and zzso In addition, the zzso zzso decoy database techniques for automatically determining the false positive identification zzso The search zzso has been tested by comparing the search results from a zzso mixture, the same zzso mixture spiked into a complex biological background, and a variety of other zzso type protein digest zzso The method was validated independently by data dependent methods, while zzso relying on replication and zzso Comparisons were also performed with other commercially and publicly available zzso fragmentation search zzso The presented results demonstrate the ability to correctly identify peptides and proteins from data independent acquisition strategies with high sensitivity and zzso They also illustrate a more comprehensive analysis of the samples zzso providing approximately zzso more protein zzso compared to a more conventional data directed approach using the same identification criteria, with a concurrent increase in both sequence coverage and the number of modified zzso
