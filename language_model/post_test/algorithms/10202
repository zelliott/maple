A zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso method to evaluate human zzso zzso levels in a single zzso at 3 T using a commercial zzso system is zzso During a 10 s zzso water zzso and suppressed zzso were acquired by two phased array coils using a zzso time zzso zzso echo zzso sequence zzso to zzso zzso ratios were obtained in the zzso of 15 healthy volunteers, zzso zzso zzso These results agreed well with ratios obtained from averaged zzso acquired in seven multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso providing increased zzso ratio but requiring longer acquisition zzso Excellent correlation was found between the two methods zzso zzso zzso of zzso MRS for measuring zzso zzso levels in a short zzso was acceptable in five repeated zzso within the same subject zzso of zzso Thus, single zzso zzso zzso allows reliable and quick zzso of zzso lipids at 3 zzso
