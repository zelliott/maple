This study reports on the relationship between minute ventilation zzso and environmental variables of temperature zzso and pressure zzso during open water zzso The author conducted a total of 38 zzso involving either a light (20 zzso or a moderate (18 zzso level of physical zzso Within each of these groups, P and T taken together accounted for about two thirds of the zzso in the zzso zzso A very significant increase in zzso was observed as T decreased (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the magnitude of this increase at a given pressure level was similar in the zzso and the zzso data zzso A second order zzso particularly notable at lower temperature, was the decrease in zzso with increasing pressure under conditions of light zzso zzso functions of the from zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso - zzso where A, B, and zzso are adjustable zzso could accommodate both data sets over the whole range of T and zzso These results are the first obtained under actual diving conditions to provide evidence for interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso mechanisms by which these interactions occur would assist in appreciation of the limitations imposed on scuba divers by the environmental conditions as they affect their zzso zzso
