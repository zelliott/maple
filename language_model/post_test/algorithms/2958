zzso modeling is increasingly used to estimate the effects of altered treatment plans, especially for dose zzso The present article shows how much the zzso zzso zzso biologically equivalent dose zzso varies when individual parameters of the zzso formula are varied by zzso and by zzso 

zzso total doses zzso zzso zzso total doses zzso in zzso zzso for tumor control, acute zzso zzso and late complications were calculated using the zzso zzso formula with overall time: zzso zzso zzso (1 + zzso zzso - zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso where zzso is zzso zzso total dose zzso relative effectiveness zzso zzso zzso (1 + zzso zzso Each of the five zzso parameters in turn was altered by zzso and the altered zzso zzso the difference was finally divided by zzso zzso or zzso is obtained by dividing zzso by the zzso for zzso zzso using the appropriate zzso zzso 

Variations in tumor and acute zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso per zzso change in each zzso for conventional schedules, the largest variation being caused by overall zzso Variations in zzso zzso were zzso to zzso per zzso change in the only zzso zzso the zzso zzso For zzso body zzso schedules, variations were larger, up to zzso to zzso for tumor and zzso to zzso for late, per zzso change in zzso 

zzso occurs similar to that of equivalent uniform dose zzso for the same zzso Total dose, dose per zzso and zzso cause their major effects, as well zzso
