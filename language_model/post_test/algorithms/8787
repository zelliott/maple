zzso images, such as those routinely acquired in zzso practice, are difficult to analyze because multiple 3-D structures zzso at a single point in the zzso zzso zzso of particular superimposed structures may improve interpretation of these images, both by humans and by zzso This work therefore presents a general method to isolate and suppress structures in zzso projection zzso The focus is on zzso structures, which allows an intensity model of a structure of interest to be extracted using local information zzso The model is created from profiles sampled perpendicular to the zzso zzso containing other structures are detected and removed to reduce the influence on the zzso zzso zzso using blind source separation techniques, is applied to separate the structure to be suppressed from other zzso By zzso the modeled structure from the original image a structure suppressed image is zzso The method is evaluated in four zzso In the first experiment ribs are suppressed in 20 artificial zzso simulated from 3-D lung zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed method with blind source separation and zzso detection shows superior suppression of ribs in simulated zzso compared to a simplified approach without these zzso Additionally, the ability of three observers to discriminate between patches containing ribs and containing no ribs, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso reduced from zzso on original images to zzso on suppressed zzso In the second experiment zzso are suppressed in zzso chest zzso The effect of suppression on zzso visibility is evaluated using the zzso contrast and border response, showing a reduction of zzso and zzso zzso In the third experiment zzso extracted from CT were simulated close to the zzso in 100 chest zzso It was found that after suppression contrast of the zzso was higher than of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso than on original images zzso and zzso zzso In the fourth experiment zzso were suppressed in chest zzso The ability of three observers to discriminate between patches originating from 36 images with and 21 images without zzso as measured by the zzso reduced from zzso on original images to zzso on suppressed zzso We conclude that the presented method can markedly reduce the visibility of zzso structures in chest zzso and shows potential to enhance zzso
