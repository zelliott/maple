The potential of intensity modulated zzso zzso to improve the therapeutic ratio in prostate cancer by dose escalation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated using a simultaneous integrated boost zzso The prostate and zzso were outlined on CT images from six prostate cancer zzso zzso of zzso were transferred onto the CT images from prostate maps derived from sequential large block sections of whole zzso zzso zzso planned zzso dose zzso were created to irradiate the prostate to 70 zzso and all the zzso to 90 zzso A second plan was produced to escalate only the dominant zzso zzso to 90 zzso mimicking current imaging zzso These plans were compared with homogeneous prostate zzso to 70 zzso using zzso zzso zzso control probability zzso and normal tissue complication probability zzso for the zzso The mean dose to zzso was increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso if all the zzso were dose escalated zzso This corresponded to a mean increase in zzso of zzso depending on the zzso ratio of prostate cancer zzso and a mean increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso If only the zzso was dose zzso the zzso was increased by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso In the dose escalated zzso zzso plans, the highest zzso zzso was seen in patients with zzso in the zzso peripheral zone close to the anterior zzso wall, and the lowest zzso was seen with zzso in the lateral peripheral zzso The ratio of increased zzso to zzso may represent an improvement in the therapeutic ratio, but was dependent on the position of the zzso relative to the anterior zzso zzso zzso in prostate imaging and prostate zzso are required before clinical zzso would be zzso Clinical trials are required to confirm the clinical benefits of these improved dose zzso
