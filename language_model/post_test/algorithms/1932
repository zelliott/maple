The IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso has been recently proposed as zzso of skeletal muscle growth and a positive feedback between zzso and zzso was suggested to induce homogeneous growth signals along the whole spatial extension of such long zzso Here we develop two biologically justified approximations which we study under the presence of four different initial conditions that describe different zzso of IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso In first scenario the zzso of the feedback cascade was assumed to be mild or protein turnover considered to be zzso In turn, in the second scenario the zzso regulation was assumed to maintain defined levels of inactive zzso For both scenarios, we were able to obtain zzso formulas for growth signal progression in time and space and found that a zzso initial signal maintains its zzso shape, but gets zzso and zzso zzso zzso mathematical treatment of the reaction diffusion system revealed that diffusion filtered out high zzso of zzso periodic zzso signals suggesting that the muscle cell is robust against fluctuations in spatial zzso expression or zzso However, neither scenario was consistent with the presence of zzso travelling signal zzso Our study highlights the role of feedback zzso in zzso signal progression and results can be applied to studies in cell zzso cell differentiation and cell death in other zzso extended zzso
