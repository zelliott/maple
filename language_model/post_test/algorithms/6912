The development of an optical channel, a new zzso technique for evaluating the elasticity of biological cells, is described in this zzso Two types of zzso cells, zzso young and old cells, were examined via their introduction into a flowing zzso to which a laser beam was focused in the opposite zzso An zzso cell is trapped in a laser beam by a zzso force, moves in the downstream direction, and is then zzso at the beam zzso The change in shape was measured directly using a microscope equipped with a zzso zzso It is probable the main driving force for the cell deformation is a zzso stress generated by a medium flow, since an estimate of the zzso force suggests that it is too small to change the shape of an zzso The average values of the zzso of young and old cells were zzso and zzso zzso These values are in reasonably good agreement with values obtained using a zzso zzso The deformation was measured without any physical contact to the solid surface, and therefore, damage to cells such as these are zzso
