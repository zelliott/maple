We present a database search method that is based on zzso trees zzso The method is used to search a protein sequence database for zzso to a protein zzso In preparation for the search, a zzso tree is constructed from a given multiple alignment of the zzso During the search, each database sequence is temporarily inserted into the tree, thus adding a new edge to the zzso zzso between family and sequence is then judged from the length of this zzso In a comparison of our method to profiles zzso zzso two zzso of hidden zzso models zzso zzso and SAM zzso and to the family zzso search zzso method on 43 families from the zzso database based on minimum zzso counts zzso we found a considerable gain in zzso In zzso of the test cases, zzso showed a zzso of at most 50, whereas the two second best methods zzso and zzso showed this performance only in zzso zzso A similar impression holds for a large range of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso information can significantly improve the detection of distant zzso and justify our method as a useful alternative to existing zzso
