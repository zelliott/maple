To solve the problem of the zzso descent movement in zzso of the regional left zzso zzso zzso wall thickness zzso and wall zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for effectively assessing the regional wall motion of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed to calculate the zzso translation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in eight normal zzso The new zzso zzso thickness zzso data were reconstructed from the original zzso data, based on the zzso zzso translation of zzso zzso 

The mean zzso of six segments in the zzso section after correction was significantly different from that before correction in both zzso and zzso zzso The polar map also showed the significant improvement of the zzso of regional zzso and lack of zzso of zzso in the most zzso zzso slices after zzso 

The proposed technique demonstrated an important advantage to calculate the zzso in the most zzso zzso zzso zzso which was considered difficult to be achieved using zzso zzso
