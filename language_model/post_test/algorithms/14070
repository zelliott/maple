To demonstrate the feasibility of using a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso zzso to accelerate MR zzso zzso acquisitions in comparison to zzso PC zzso 

The sequence was implemented and compared with a conventional zzso sequence as the standard of reference in both zzso zzso and in zzso in the biceps of three healthy zzso For reconstruction of the elasticity zzso a local frequency zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso factors of zzso were zzso 

Phantom experiments demonstrated excellent consistency between zzso and zzso zzso in terms of wave zzso zzso and reconstructed zzso zzso Additionally, the in zzso zzso examinations showed an excellent correspondence to the zzso zzso Minor loss of wave zzso was observed at higher zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that a zzso sequence is suitable for accelerating zzso in nearly homogeneous zzso such as zzso It provides equivalent elasticity values in a significantly reduced scan time compared to a zzso zzso The maximum achievable zzso factor must be individually determined for the target zzso
