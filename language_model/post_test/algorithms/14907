zzso application of zzso to zzso in the motor zzso of cats during performance of a zzso zzso consisting of placing the paw on a support increased zzso zzso and facilitated zzso connections, resulting in increases in primary responses to electrical stimulation of the zzso region of the cortex, and which was independent of the first effect of suppression, which was seen only in relation to the zzso components of the zzso The functional significance of the differently directed effects of zzso application is indicated by the statistically significant changes in motor reaction times seen in some experiments, which were in the same direction as changes in zzso responses in the same zzso
