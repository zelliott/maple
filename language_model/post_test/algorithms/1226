A zzso efficient hybrid zzso zzso zzso model is presented for the analysis and synthesis of zzso ultrasound heating patterns through the human rib zzso In particular, a ray method is used to zzso the ultrasound fields from the source to the frontal plane of the rib zzso The zzso integration method is then employed to obtain the intensity pattern inside the rib zzso The solution of the zzso system is carried out by using the zzso inverse technique to zzso the desired heating zzso The proposed technique guides the fields through the zzso zzso between the solid ribs and, thus, minimal intensity levels are observed over the solid zzso This simulation model allows for the design and zzso of zzso zzso zzso systems for zzso zzso zzso surgery in the heart and liver through the rib zzso
