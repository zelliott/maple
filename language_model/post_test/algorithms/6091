zzso zzso zzso is a complex disorder influenced by numerous risk factors, and occurs frequently in zzso hospitalized zzso Because appropriate prevention with zzso is zzso we wanted to create an electronic tool to provide a simple risk assessment and suggest appropriate zzso 

To develop the risk zzso zzso rating of odds ratios was performed for 60 zzso zzso risk factors, using zzso methods that account for multiple risk factors in a single patient and their zzso For exposing risk factors, a single score was assigned to each set of factors, both medical zzso zzso and surgical conditions zzso zzso A zzso zzso model was used to integrate the risk scales into a zzso measure of overall zzso The zzso of the level of risk and the appropriateness of 11 different zzso approaches was assessed using the zzso appropriateness method and validated by expert opinion ratings zzso on sample case scenarios zzso 

zzso between the level of risk calculated by the risk zzso and that offered by expert opinion for individual surgical and medical clinical cases was high zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso the level of risk, compared with that offered by expert opinion, in zzso and zzso of surgical and medical cases, respectively, but the appropriate prophylaxis suggested was no zzso zzso agreement on the appropriateness of the prophylaxis recommendations was high zzso of zzso 

This computer-based electronic tool for individualized assessment of zzso zzso risk successfully identified both the perceived risk of zzso and the appropriate zzso approach for medical and surgical zzso
