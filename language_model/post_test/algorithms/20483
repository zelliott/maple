zzso zzso echo zzso magnetic resonance coronary zzso zzso during free zzso is now zzso However, the mean zzso zzso position zzso drifts over time, and this results in a reduction in scanning efficiency and increased artifacts due to the acquisition of data during periods of high zzso zzso To address these problems, a zzso monitoring program that follows the mean zzso over time has been zzso Fifteen subjects with zzso heart disease underwent continuous zzso monitoring of their zzso for 30 zzso Using these zzso zzso theoretical zzso scans were zzso Several zzso monitoring zzso were developed and compared with the simplest case (a stationary 5 zzso zzso acceptance window placed around the mean zzso as measured by zzso monitoring at the outset of the zzso An overall scan efficiency was zzso and the number of completed scans where the mean zzso lay within the zzso acceptance window was zzso Of the six zzso considered, the most effective one monitored the mean zzso and zzso placed the upper limit of the zzso acceptance window on this position for the subsequent zzso Using this zzso in comparison with the simplest stationary scenario, both scan efficiency zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the number of completed scans where the mean zzso lay within the zzso acceptance window zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of such a monitoring algorithm, in combination with zzso motion correction techniques, should improve overall scan efficiency while maintaining the zzso position at the top end of the zzso acceptance window, to reduce image zzso
