This paper considers the dynamics of a zzso zzso system for zzso zzso In particular, zzso of the system is zzso zzso is one of the concepts to describe the zzso zzso By using the method of an average zzso function, we have found a simple sufficient condition for zzso of the zzso That is, zzso of saturated boundary fixed points is enough for zzso of the system under some appropriate zzso or zzso properties for the population growth rate zzso zzso investigations show that for the system with population growth rate functions without such properties, the zzso of saturated boundary fixed points is not sufficient for zzso actually a boundary periodic orbit or a chaotic orbit can be attractive despite the existence of a stable coexistence fixed zzso This result implies, in particular, that existence of a stable coexistence fixed point is not sufficient for zzso
