Marine organisms are an increasingly important source of novel zzso some of which have already inspired or become new zzso In addition, many of these molecules show a high degree of novelty from a structural and/or pharmacological point of zzso zzso determination is generally achieved by the use of a variety of zzso methods, among which zzso zzso magnetic zzso plays a major role and determination of the zzso relationships within every new zzso is generally the most challenging part in structural zzso In this communication, we have chosen zzso acid as a model compound to perform a zzso chemistry study to predict zzso and zzso zzso chemical zzso The effect of two different zzso and zzso on the ability of zzso zzso functional zzso calculations to predict the correct zzso has been zzso
