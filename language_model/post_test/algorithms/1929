zzso of protein folding rate change upon zzso acid substitution is an important and challenging problem in protein folding zzso and zzso In this work, we have analyzed the relationship between zzso acid properties and folding rate change upon zzso Our analysis showed that the correlation is not significant with any of the studied properties in a zzso of zzso zzso Further, we have classified the zzso based on their locations in different secondary structures and zzso zzso For each category, we have selected a specific combination of zzso acid properties using genetic zzso and developed a prediction scheme based on zzso zzso models for predicting the folding rate change upon zzso Our results showed a zzso cross validation correlation of zzso between experimental and predicted change in protein folding zzso The correlation is zzso zzso and zzso respectively in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The method has been further tested with an extended zzso of zzso zzso and a blind zzso of 62 zzso and we observed a good agreement with zzso We have developed a web server for predicting the folding rate change upon zzso and it is available at zzso
