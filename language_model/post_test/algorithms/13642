Here we report the theory and experimental study of the zzso zzso behavior of a zzso used as a limiting pole in a closed bipolar zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso response of a zzso used in a closed bipolar cell can be zzso understood by considering the responses of both poles in their respective conventional zzso zzso In comparison to a conventional zzso cell, the zzso response of the bipolar cell has a similar zzso shape and limiting zzso however, the response is often slower than that of the typical zzso zzso This leads to a broader zzso and a decreased wave zzso which can be somewhat zzso causing the appearance that the process being studied is irreversible when it instead can be a result of the zzso of two zzso zzso We show that a large limiting current on the excess pole would facilitate the observation of a faster zzso response and that both zzso concentration and zzso area of the excess pole affect the wave zzso Both factors should be zzso in zzso experiments in order to obtain fast zzso responses on the main zzso of interest and to detect quick changes in zzso zzso
