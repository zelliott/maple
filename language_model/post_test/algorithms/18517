A study was undertaken to verify the accuracy of computer zzso on administrative data to identify hospital zzso The assessment was based on a medical records indicator that differentiated zzso conditions from zzso zzso 

The indicators for identifying potential hospital complications were applied to all secondary diagnoses to distinguish zzso from zzso conditions for all zzso zzso 

Of the 95 defined complication types, cases were found with secondary diagnoses that met the criteria for 71 different zzso zzso of these complications had one or more cases with the trigger diagnosis coded as an acquired zzso Thirty-five complications had at least 30 cases with acquired zzso Hospital complications add greatly to zzso for example, zzso zzso increased the hospital bill by more zzso added 13 hospital days to the stay, and increased hospital mortality by zzso 

Current complication zzso identify many cases where the condition was actually present on hospital zzso This fact, coupled with the known zzso in coding between institutions, makes comparisons between hospitals on many of the complications zzso Collection of the zzso flag significantly reduces the noise in monitoring complication zzso
