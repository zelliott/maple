The unattended nature of wireless sensor networks makes them very vulnerable to malicious zzso zzso how to preserve secure data collection is an important issue to wireless sensor zzso In this paper, we propose a novel approach of secure data collection for wireless sensor zzso We explore secret sharing and zzso zzso to achieve secure data collection in wireless sensor network with compromised zzso We present a novel zzso zzso which makes full use of the zzso functionality of wireless sensor networks, to improve the quality of data zzso The major advantage of the approach is that the secure paths are constructed as a zzso of data zzso The process of secure zzso causes little overhead to the sensor zzso in the zzso Compared with existing works, the zzso of the proposed approach are easy to implement and execute in zzso wireless sensor zzso According to the result of a simulation experiment, the performance of the approach is better than the recent approaches with a similar zzso
