The fields of molecular biology and computer science have cooperated over recent years to create a zzso between the cybernetic and zzso relationship found in cellular zzso to that of information and language found in zzso zzso Biological information frequently zzso its zzso through instruction or actual production of formal zzso Such information is called prescriptive information zzso zzso programs organize and execute a prescribed set of zzso Closer examination of this term in cellular systems has led to a zzso in its definition suggesting both prescribed data and prescribed zzso are constituents of zzso This paper looks at this zzso as expressed in both the genetic code and in the central dogma of protein zzso An example of a genetic zzso is modeled after the zzso and an examination of the protein synthesis process is used to differentiate zzso data from zzso zzso
