A physically based model for residential magnetic fields from electric transmission and distribution wiring was developed to zzso the Los Angeles study of childhood leukemia by London et zzso For this exposure model, magnetic field zzso were fitted to a function of wire zzso attributes that was derived from a zzso expansion of the Law of zzso and zzso The model parameters were determined by zzso zzso techniques, using wiring data, zzso and the geometric mean of the zzso magnetic field magnitude from zzso bedroom zzso taken at 288 homes during the zzso zzso The best fit to the measurement data was obtained with separate models for the two major utilities serving Los Angeles zzso This zzso predictions produced a correlation of zzso with the measured fields, an improvement on the zzso correlation obtained with the zzso zzso wire zzso For the leukemia risk analysis in a companion paper, the zzso model predicts zzso to the zzso geometric mean of the zzso magnetic fields in Los Angeles homes where only wiring data and distances have been zzso Since these input parameters for the exposure model usually do not change for many years, the predicted magnetic fields will be stable over long time zzso just like the zzso zzso If the geometric mean is not the exposure metric associated with cancer, this zzso technique could be used to estimate long-term zzso to zzso zzso metrics and other characteristics of the zzso magnetic field which may be cancer risk zzso
