According to the limitations of zzso threshold in zzso method, we approached a combining zzso of the stationary zzso transform with zzso zzso The stationary zzso transformation can suppress Gibbs phenomena in traditional zzso zzso and zzso filter is introduced at the high scale zzso zzso of the stationary zzso zzso It would remove baseline wander and keep the shape of low frequency and low zzso P wave, T wave and ST segment wave of zzso signal zzso That is important for analyzing zzso signal of other feature zzso
