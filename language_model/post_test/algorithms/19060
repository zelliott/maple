To adequately supply zzso with oxygen and zzso the formation of functional vascular networks requires generation of normal, healthy vessels and their arrangement into an effective network zzso While our knowledge about the development of single vessels significantly increased during the last years, mechanisms responsible for network formation are still poorly zzso This is probably due to the lack of suitable methods for zzso of structural properties of zzso zzso Previously we showed that cerebral blood flow is not increased in mice exhibiting a zzso to zzso higher density of normal and zzso zzso as a result of transgenic zzso of the human vascular zzso growth factor zzso Here we used vascular zzso casting and zzso zzso zzso combined with a new network analysis tool to characterize the vascular architecture in gray and white matter of these zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso leads to formation of additional zzso connected to higher order vessels rather than zzso of individual zzso into the existing vessel zzso This implies that the smallest zzso zzso zzso the final, stable result of zzso and subsequent zzso is not a single zzso but a complete zzso In conclusion, high-resolution zzso imaging combined with network analysis can substantially improve our understanding of vascular architecture, beneficial for the development of therapeutic zzso as a clinical tool for applications such as wound healing or treatment of zzso zzso
