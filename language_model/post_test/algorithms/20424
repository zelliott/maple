This qualitative study is intended to create awareness of zzso that are associated with zzso zzso A simple description of zzso reconstruction is used to explain how these zzso depend on the pitch and subject zzso and shows when these zzso are likely to impair the diagnostic value of the acquired zzso We scanned a cone and rod phantom with pitch 2, and used the acquired images to demonstrate how spiral data acquisition and zzso leads to zzso in the reconstructed zzso We then demonstrated the effects of various pitches in scans of a human zzso whereas the slice thickness was kept zzso Some patient studies are presented in order to show the possible clinical zzso zzso acquisition may cause geometric zzso and apparent zzso of homogeneous zzso We were able to link these zzso to the way in the acquisitions were done, and the reconstructions were zzso We have shown how these zzso can be anticipated in clinical zzso When areas of low contrast, surrounded by zzso or zzso structures, are scanned with a large pitch and viewed with a narrow window, spiral zzso may influence the diagnostic quality of the zzso These effects should be considered when choosing the zzso
