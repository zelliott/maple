To assess the types and numbers of cases, zzso age at specific prenatal diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy of the diagnosis of skeletal zzso in a prenatal population from a single zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective database review of type, prenatal and definitive zzso diagnoses and zzso age at specific prenatal diagnosis of all cases of skeletal zzso from a mixed referral and screening population between 1985 and zzso zzso diagnoses were grouped into zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso with zzso pediatric or pathological zzso or zzso correct ultrasound zzso zzso zzso found zzso to be a different one from that diagnosed zzso 

We included 178 fetuses in this study, of which 176 had a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of zzso zzso In 160 cases the prenatal diagnosis of a skeletal zzso was zzso two cases with skeletal zzso identified zzso had not been diagnosed prenatally, giving 162 fetuses with skeletal zzso in zzso There were 23 different zzso types of skeletal zzso The specific diagnoses based on prenatal ultrasound examination alone were correct in zzso zzso cases and partially correct in zzso zzso cases, zzso overall, zzso In 16 cases, skeletal zzso was diagnosed prenatally, but was not confirmed zzso zzso zzso 12 false zzso or the case was lost to follow-up zzso zzso zzso The following skeletal zzso were recorded: zzso zzso (35 diagnosed correctly zzso of 40 zzso osteogenesis imperfecta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a further zzso cases with rare or zzso skeletal zzso 

zzso diagnosis of skeletal zzso can present a considerable diagnostic zzso However, a meticulous zzso examination yields high overall zzso In the two most common disorders, zzso zzso and osteogenesis imperfecta zzso and zzso of all cases, respectively), typical zzso accounts for the high rates of completely correct prenatal diagnosis zzso and zzso zzso at the first diagnostic zzso
