The ability to rapidly map millions of zzso fragments to a reference zzso is crucial to many high zzso zzso zzso 

We propose an intuitive and efficient algorithm, titled extreme zzso of zzso zzso to rapidly map millions of zzso fragments to a zzso of any zzso By converting zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso can scan through zzso using bit shifting operation and achieve at least one order of magnitude speed increase over existing zzso zzso can map the 42 million zzso zzso on the zzso whole human zzso zzso zzso to the entire zzso in less than 6 CPU zzso 

In addition to the speed advantage, we found the probe mapping of zzso to substantially improve the final analysis results in both a zzso experiment on zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso experiment on whole human zzso zzso zzso Those improvements were confirmed by direct zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso can be further extended for application to other zzso zzso technologies for zzso zzso
