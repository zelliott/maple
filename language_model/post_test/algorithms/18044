The reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks from zzso gene expression data has been a challenging task in zzso Various approaches to this problem have been proposed, however, they do not take into account the zzso characteristics of the targeted networks while reconstructing zzso 

In this study, an zzso that explores the zzso zzso of networks was proposed based on the modification of a zzso zzso for network zzso The new zzso was evaluated with the use of both simulated and zzso gene expression zzso The results demonstrated that the proposed zzso zzso the original zzso zzso In addition, in comparison with the zzso Network approach, the results show that the proposed zzso gives much better recovery of the underlying network when sample size is much smaller relative to the number of zzso 

The proposed zzso is expected to be useful in the reconstruction of biological networks whose degree zzso follow the zzso zzso
