We present a study in the evolution of zzso behavior, specifically synchronization and zzso through digital evolution and group zzso In digital evolution, a population of zzso computer programs exists in a zzso zzso environment and is subject to zzso zzso and natural zzso Group selection links the survival of the individual to the survival of its group, thus encouraging zzso Previous approaches to engineering synchronization and zzso zzso have taken inspiration from zzso In the well-known zzso model, the only form of communication between agents is in the form of flash messages among zzso Here we demonstrate that populations of digital organisms, provided with a similar mechanism and minimal information about their environment, are capable of evolving zzso for synchronization and zzso and that the evolved behaviors are robust to message zzso We further describe how the evolved behavior for synchronization mimics that of the well-known zzso model for zzso synchronization in zzso In addition to discovering zzso behaviors for distributed computing systems, this result indicates that digital evolution may be used to further our understanding of synchronization in zzso
