In the automotive industry, electromagnetic variable reluctance zzso sensors have been extensively used to measure engine position and speed through a zzso wheel mounted on the zzso In this work, an application that already uses the zzso sensing unit for engine and/or transmission has been chosen to zzso this time, the indirect position of the electric machine in a parallel zzso Electric zzso zzso zzso A zzso sensor has been chosen to correct the position of the electric machine, mainly because it may still become critical in the operation of zzso to avoid possible vehicle failures during the start-up and zzso especially when the machine is used with an internal combustion zzso The proposed method uses zzso test and is zzso in a sense that it derives the compensation factors during the zzso operation and updates them in a timely zzso
