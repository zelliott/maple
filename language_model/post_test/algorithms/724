Recently, the zzso complex normal distribution has been used to develop a zzso probability function for zzso anomalous zzso phasing and refinement of zzso parameters zzso & Read (2004), zzso zzso zzso zzso The function accounts explicitly for the correlations between the observed and calculated zzso zzso and their zzso However, the method of derivation of the equation described by zzso & Read zzso leads to a complicated likelihood expression that suffers from a number of zzso zzso Here, an alternative derivation of the zzso function is described that leads to simplified zzso requirements and that allows an intuitive understanding of the zzso
