Ray zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most damaging disease of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Data collected from 72 plots in commercial zzso fields since 2001 to 2009 revealed substantial annual variations in isolation frequency of the pathogen during zzso of the crop in autumn and zzso Isolation frequency of the pathogen during this time and subsequent outbreaks of ray blight in spring were similar across the eight production regions where sampling was conducted, and isolation frequency of the pathogen was zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with subsequent zzso severity when plants commenced growth in zzso Isolation frequency and zzso severity also were correlated with the zzso of seed infested with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso in both zzso zzso accurate risk zzso for the occurrence of severe zzso of ray blight were constructed using zzso zzso A model based solely on isolation frequency of the pathogen over autumn and winter correctly predicted epidemic development in zzso of zzso Another model utilizing the zzso of infested seed and zzso interactions in early autumn zzso March and zzso and late winter zzso June and zzso had similar zzso ability zzso zzso zzso analysis modeling was used to zzso zzso among the explanatory variables used in the second zzso zzso zzso The analysis indicated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes indirectly to ray blight zzso severity through directly increasing zzso frequency of the zzso zzso and fall weather variables were modeled to have indirect effects on zzso severity through increasing zzso success of the pathogen but also direct effects on zzso zzso zzso the analyses point to several critical stages in the disease cycle that can be targeted to minimize the probability of regional zzso of ray blight in this perennial zzso
