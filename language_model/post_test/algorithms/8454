A zzso model of the zzso muscle zzso zzso response was implemented in precision zzso We derived engineering specifications from zzso zzso potential, and zzso data in the muscle zzso literature, allowing reproduction of muscle zzso behavior directly in the zzso zzso a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior, a zzso zzso reproduced sensory membrane zzso and a zzso zzso zzso strain into a frequency zzso Aspects of muscle zzso behavior not intrinsic to the physical design were added in control software using an adaptation of zzso mathematical zzso We tuned the response to biological ramp and hold metrics including peak, mean, dynamic index, time domain response, and sensory region zzso The model was validated against biological zzso response to ramp and hold, zzso and zzso zzso The response with dynamic or zzso gamma zzso input was excellent across all zzso The passive zzso response matched well in five of the nine zzso Potential applications include basic science muscle zzso research and applied research in zzso and zzso
