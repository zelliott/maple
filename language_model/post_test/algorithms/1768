We introduce a zzso supervised approach for learning human actions modeled as interactions between humans and zzso Our approach is zzso We first zzso a human in the image and then determine the object relevant for the action and its spatial relation with the zzso The model is learned automatically from a set of still images zzso only with the action zzso Our approach relies on a human detector to zzso the model zzso For zzso to various degrees of zzso we build a detector that learns to combine a set of existing part zzso Starting from humans detected in a set of images depicting the action, our approach determines the action object and its spatial relation to the zzso Its final output is a zzso model of the zzso interaction, zzso the spatial relation between the human and the zzso We present an extensive experimental evaluation on the sports action data set from zzso the zzso Action 2010 data set zzso and a new zzso interaction data zzso
