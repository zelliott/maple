The concept of a zzso control system is attractive in zzso because of the imprecise nature of available zzso zzso In this paper a particular strategy called a zzso controller zzso originating from the work of Barron on aerospace systems is applied to the control of muscle zzso zzso The zzso algorithm, which requires no prior knowledge of system zzso is zzso both in single variable and multivariable zzso zzso results are presented for zzso performance on a well-established zzso zzso Three zzso are zzso being the use of a general purpose language, a zzso zzso approach, and a parallel computer zzso zzso The latter approach becomes important for multivariable control because of the zzso nature of zzso The zzso is shown to be a suitable vehicle for zzso in terms of speed and zzso for zzso
