Genes might have different gene interactions in different cell conditions, which might be mapped into different zzso zzso analysis of gene networks allows spotting zzso interactions that, for instance, form disease networks if the conditions are a disease, such as cancer, and zzso This could potentially allow developing better and subtly targeted drugs to cure zzso zzso network analysis with direct physical gene interactions needs to be explored in this zzso 

zzso is a recently introduced information theory based gene network zzso zzso that zzso direct physical gene interactions from expression data, which was shown to give consistently higher zzso performances over various networks than its zzso In this paper, we present, zzso an approach to employ zzso in zzso disease zzso We apply zzso on a synthetic and real prostate cancer zzso which show promising zzso With loose zzso we predicted zzso interactions from tumor and normal samples in zzso Although there are no reference interactions databases for the specific conditions of our samples in the literature, we found zzso for 54 of our predicted direct physical interactions from only four of the biological interaction zzso As an example, we predicted that zzso with zzso have prostate cancer specific interaction that turned out to be having validation from the zzso It is known that zzso complex associates with zzso in the S phase of cell cycle, which suggests that this predicted interaction may promote zzso maintenance in tumor cells in order to allow tumor cells to divide zzso Our enrichment analysis suggests that the identified tumor specific gene interactions may be potentially important in driving the growth in prostate zzso Additionally, we found that the highest connected zzso of our predicted tumor specific network is enriched for all proliferation zzso which further suggests that the genes in this network may serve in the process of zzso 

Our approach reveals disease specific zzso It may help to make experimental follow-up studies more cost and time efficient by zzso disease relevant parts of the global gene zzso
