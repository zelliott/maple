The analysis of zzso cell zzso receptors zzso in terms of zzso have only been done through zzso numerous and selected zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been roughly described by two groups (A and zzso based on their gene zzso No further zzso adapted methods have been applied to the zzso of zzso zzso using unrelated zzso We propose here a maximum likelihood zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed as an extension of those successfully applied to human zzso zzso zzso data including the handling of missing values and zzso zzso It has been implemented using an adapted zzso zzso zzso zzso types on 11 zzso in more than 40 Irish families were used to validate the method in a simulation zzso zzso zzso zzso are compared to the phase zzso Various zzso or gene frequency zzso methods were also zzso We demonstrated the interest and reliability of the zzso method and underline the effect of the sample size on the quality of the zzso The zzso zzso method also provides by collapsing more accurate zzso of zzso or gene zzso in zzso Such an zzso opens new perspectives in the analysis of zzso zzso Large sample size studies are required using zzso data and/or zzso It would allow a zzso approach to explore the zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso may be used to compare zzso
