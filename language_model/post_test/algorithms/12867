We propose that replication (with zzso of patterns of zzso activity can occur within the brain using known zzso zzso Thereby evolutionary zzso implemented by zzso zzso circuits can play a role in zzso zzso of structured zzso representations is assumed in several cognitive zzso zzso overcome some limitations of zzso models of zzso zzso zzso learning is combined with replication to structure exploration on the basis of associations learned in the zzso zzso gating of sets of zzso zzso allows patterns of zzso to be copied with zzso If the probability of copying a set is related to the utility of that set, then an evolutionary zzso can be implemented at rapid zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso can undertake a more rapid and stable search than can be achieved by serial modification of a single zzso zzso learning added to zzso replication allows a powerful structuring of zzso capable of learning the location of a global optimum from multiple previously visited local zzso zzso of solutions can solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in the zzso zzso In short, zzso replication is essential to explain several features of flexible zzso zzso are made for the experimental validation of the zzso zzso zzso
