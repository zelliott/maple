We recently developed a novel method for assessment of zzso wave reflections zzso zzso based on adopted zzso methods, flow zzso are estimated from pressure zzso and wave separation analysis is performed, yielding the zzso of the forward and backward zzso The aim of this study was to investigate their clinical zzso and zzso zzso In 725 patients zzso zzso mean age, 64 zzso undergoing coronary zzso we determined wave reflections from zzso zzso and transfer zzso zzso zzso using pulse wave analysis, as well as wave separation zzso zzso of zzso zzso function were statistically zzso although moderately associated with markers of cardiac load and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After a median follow-up duration of zzso days, 139 patients reached the combined cardiovascular end point zzso zzso zzso stroke, zzso zzso and peripheral zzso In zzso analysis, the relative risk of the combined end point increased with increasing levels of incident pressure wave zzso zzso pressure, and forward and backward wave zzso zzso ratio for 1 zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for all, zzso In zzso analysis, backward wave zzso was the most consistent predictor of the combined end zzso Of note, its zzso value was independent of zzso zzso zzso and mean blood pressures and was superior to zzso pulse zzso In conclusion, the zzso of the reflected wave, as assessed with a novel method for wave zzso is associated with zzso end organ damage and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in high-risk zzso
