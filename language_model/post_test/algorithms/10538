Cell differentiation in a developing tissue is controlled by the concentration fields of signaling molecules called zzso zzso of these concentration fields can be described by the zzso mechanism in which locally produced molecules diffuse through the patterned tissue and are zzso The formation zzso at a given point of the patterned tissue can be characterized by the local zzso time, defined in terms of the local relaxation zzso Here, we show that this time zzso an ordinary differential zzso Using this equation one can zzso determine the local zzso time, zzso without preliminary calculation of the relaxation function by solving the partial differential zzso as was done in previous zzso We derive this ordinary differential equation together with the accompanying boundary conditions and demonstrate that the earlier obtained results for the local zzso time can be recovered by solving this zzso
