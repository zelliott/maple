In a previous study, we developed a methodology to assess the intrinsic optical properties governing the radiation field in algae zzso With these properties at our zzso a zzso Carlo simulation program is developed and used in this study as a zzso autonomous program applied to the simulation of experiments that reproduce the common zzso conditions that are found in processes of large scale production of zzso especially when using open ponds such as raceway zzso The simulation module is validated by comparing the results of experimental zzso made on artificially illuminated zzso suspension with those predicted by the zzso Carlo zzso This experiment deals with a situation that resembles that of an open pond or that of a raceway pond, except for the fact that for zzso the experimental arrangement appears as if those zzso were turned upside zzso It serves the purpose of assessing to what extent the scattering phenomena are important for the prediction of the spatial distribution of the radiant energy zzso The simulation module developed can be applied to zzso the local energy density inside zzso with the goal to zzso its design and their operating zzso
