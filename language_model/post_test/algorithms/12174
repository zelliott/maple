The development of zzso technologies gives scientists the ability to zzso discover and monitor the zzso transcript levels of thousands of genes in a single zzso Nonetheless, the tremendous amount of data that can be obtained from zzso studies presents a challenge for data zzso The most commonly used zzso approach for analyzing zzso data is cluster analysis, since the number of genes is usually very high compared to the number of zzso In this paper, we investigate the application of the recently proposed zzso zzso zzso on gene expression zzso zzso This zzso apart from identifying the clusters present in a data set also zzso their number and thus requires no special knowledge about the zzso To improve the quality of the zzso we employ various dimension reduction techniques and propose a hybrid zzso The results obtained by the application of the zzso exhibit high zzso zzso
