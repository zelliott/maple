The source population included zzso unique patients from a large public hospital system between January 2009 and April zzso A diabetes zzso zzso was zzso derived using chart review and subsequently validated zzso in a zzso random sample of patients, using data extracted from the electronic health records zzso A zzso zzso using encounter diagnoses, clinical history, pharmacy data, and laboratory results was used to identify diabetes zzso The date when accumulated points reached a specified threshold zzso to the diagnosis zzso zzso chart review served as the gold zzso 

The electronic model had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso for the identification of patients with zzso The zzso score for agreement between the model and physician for the diagnosis date allowing for a zzso delay was zzso where zzso of cases had exact agreement on the precise zzso 

A diabetes zzso zzso using data exclusively extracted from a comprehensive zzso can accurately identify patients with diabetes at the earliest possible date within a zzso zzso The real-time capability may enable proactive disease zzso
