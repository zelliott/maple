zzso roots obtained by transformation via zzso zzso provide an artificial plant material devoid of aerial parts with high growth on zzso zzso Fundamental knowledge of zzso root physiology is essential to develop and control its zzso In contrast to zzso cultures, a zzso zzso combined with zzso data logging provides an efficient tool to study rapid zzso variations in zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso roots were grown in a zzso equipped with zzso data analyses of zzso dissolved oxygen zzso zzso zzso and carbon zzso The experiments were done at a constant temperature and in the absence of light zzso The results obtained showed that the carbon dioxide evolution rate zzso presented regular zzso during the zzso Similar zzso were also observed for the oxygen zzso rate zzso These signals were treated zzso to look for the existence of a zzso An zzso function was used to detect any periodic zzso The results demonstrate that zzso root zzso exhibited zzso of 1 zzso These zzso having a period of about 24 zzso were also observed in pH and zzso signals, although not for the zzso zzso The data acquired in the absence of zzso roots showed that the observed periodic behavior was not an zzso No effect on rhythms was observed by the imposition of an external zzso zzso The fact that zzso persisted in the absence of external zzso with a zzso period of 24 zzso suggests that a zzso rhythm exists in zzso roots of zzso zzso
