To zzso evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the knee performed by using a three-dimensional zzso zzso sequence involving an acquisition time of approximately 3 minutes, with surgery as the reference zzso 

The study was institutional review board zzso Written informed consent was obtained from all zzso Thirty knees of 29 patients zzso women, 15 zzso mean age, 41 zzso were zzso examined by using a zzso zzso true fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso sequence with water zzso and secondary zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso within 12 days after true zzso MR zzso Two blinded readers evaluated the MR zzso zzso for detection of cartilage defects and anterior cruciate ligament zzso and zzso tears, zzso agreement, and zzso agreement were zzso 

zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso true zzso imaging for the diagnosis of cartilage defects were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader 1 and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader zzso zzso (for readers 1 and 2) sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso true zzso imaging were, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of lateral zzso zzso The standard MR sequences used at the zzso institution had overall sensitivities, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader 1 and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of the standard MR sequences were, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosis of lateral zzso zzso 

The diagnostic performance of knee MR imaging performed by using a zzso water zzso zzso true zzso sequence and an imaging time of approximately 3 minutes is comparable to the diagnostic performance of the MR sequences used as standards at the zzso zzso
