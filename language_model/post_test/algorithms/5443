zzso guidelines for the appropriate use of emergency department zzso zzso according to current national zzso guidelines have been developed by the American College of Surgeons Committee on zzso zzso and zzso At an urban level I trauma center we analyzed how closely these guidelines were followed and their ability to predict zzso 

Between January 2003 and July 2010, 120 patients with penetrating zzso trauma underwent zzso at Mount Sinai Hospital zzso Patients were separated based on adherence zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso 2, zzso to current zzso guidelines, and group survival rates were zzso These 2 groups were analyzed based on outcome to determine the effect of a strict policy of adherence on zzso 

Of zzso performed during the study period, zzso zzso were considered outside current zzso Patients in group 2 were less likely to have traditional zzso of zzso There were 6 survivors in group 1 zzso all of whom were zzso intact; there were no zzso intact survivors in group 2 zzso The presence of a zzso surgeon in the operating room zzso was associated with increased survival zzso 

A policy of strict adherence to zzso guidelines based on current national guidelines would have accounted for all potential survivors while avoiding the harmful exposure of health care personnel to zzso pathogens and the futile use of resources for trauma victims unable to benefit from zzso zzso surgeons should be familiar with current zzso guidelines because they are often asked to contribute their operative skills for those patients who survive to reach the zzso
