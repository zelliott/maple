zzso proximity correction zzso and zzso mask zzso are resolution enhancement techniques zzso used extensively in the semiconductor industry to improve the resolution and pattern zzso of optical zzso Traditional zzso however, fix the source thus limiting the degrees of freedom during the zzso of the mask zzso To overcome this zzso a set of simultaneous source and mask zzso zzso methods have been developed recently where the resulting source and mask patterns fall well outside the realm of known design zzso This paper focuses on developing zzso efficient, zzso simultaneous source mask zzso methods for both zzso and zzso designs, where the zzso is exploited in the joint zzso of source and mask zzso The zzso series expansion model is applied to approximate the partially coherent system as a sum of coherent zzso Cost sensitivity is used to drive the output pattern error in the descent zzso In order to influence the solution patterns to have more desirable zzso properties, zzso constraints are added to the zzso zzso Several illustrative simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
