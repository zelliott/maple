The study of large scale interactions in the brain from zzso signals is a promising method for the identification of functional zzso However, the zzso of a large scale zzso is limited by two factors: the use of a zzso reference and the zzso zzso between the measured zzso signals introduced by volume zzso In this paper, we propose an approach to study large scale zzso zzso in which these factors are zzso zzso zzso by volume zzso is eliminated by using the imaginary part of the complex zzso as a measure of interaction and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used for the approximate zzso of the reference of scalp zzso recordings to a point at zzso that, being far from all possible neural sources, acts like a neutral virtual zzso The application of our approach to simulated and real zzso data shows that the detection of interaction, as opposed to artifacts due to reference and volume zzso is a goal that can be achieved from the study of a large scale zzso
