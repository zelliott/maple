zzso of a technique for three-dimensional zzso assessment of zzso regarding site, length and degree, based on spiral zzso zzso zzso 

zzso scanning and automated zzso of the zzso tract zzso was followed by the extraction of the zzso zzso axis using a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso axis the zzso 3-D zzso profile was zzso and presented as line charts, where degree and length was zzso zzso for both parameters were compared between 36 patients and 18 normal controls zzso zzso and precision was derived from 17 phantom zzso 

Average degree and length of zzso zzso was found to be zzso and zzso zzso in patients compared with minor caliber changes of zzso and zzso zzso in normal controls zzso zzso zzso For the zzso an excellent correlation between the true and zzso 3-D zzso profile was found zzso zzso zzso and an accuracy for length and degree zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively could be zzso The corresponding figures for the precision were found to be zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso 3-D zzso profiles permit objective, accurate and precise assessment of zzso caliber zzso Minor zzso caliber changes can be observed even in zzso and, in case of an otherwise normal zzso study, can be regarded as zzso
