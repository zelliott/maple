Although sequencing of the human zzso will soon be completed, gene identification and zzso remains a zzso Early estimates suggested that there might be zzso zzso 1) human zzso but recent analyses of the available data from zzso sequencing projects have estimated as few as 45,000 zzso 2) or as many as zzso zzso zzso 3) distinct zzso The zzso 22 zzso zzso estimated a minimum of 45,000 genes based on their zzso of the complete zzso although their data suggests there may be additional zzso The nearly zzso human zzso in zzso provide an important resource for gene identification and zzso zzso but these zzso sequences must be carefully zzso to remove zzso zzso including those from zzso DNA, zzso transcription, and zzso and bacterial zzso We have developed a highly refined and rigorously tested protocol for cleaning, zzso and assembling zzso sequences to produce zzso consensus sequences for the represented genes zzso et zzso manuscript zzso and used this to create the zzso Gene zzso of expressed genes for human, zzso rat and other species zzso Using highly refined and tested zzso for zzso analysis, we have arrived at two independent estimates indicating the human zzso contains approximately zzso zzso
