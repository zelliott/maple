The design and zzso of the zzso effect of Continuous zzso Rail zzso requires accurate material constants, especially at elevated zzso However, such material zzso have rarely been found in zzso In this article, the Young's zzso and zzso zzso of rail steel at elevated temperatures are determined by a new sonic resonance method developed in our zzso A network zzso is used to zzso a sample hanged inside a furnace through a simple zzso type zzso The zzso signal is picked up by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and then transferred back to the network zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso modes are measured, and the Young's zzso and zzso zzso are determined through the measured resonant zzso To validate the measured elastic constants, the zzso have been repeated by using the classic sonic resonance zzso The comparisons of obtained zzso from the two methods show an excellent consistency of the zzso In addition, the material elastic zzso measured are validated by an ultrasound test based on a zzso method and compared with previous published results at room zzso The measured material data provides an invaluable reference for the design of zzso to avoid zzso zzso zzso
