zzso zzso contact areas zzso formed between single small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported zzso zzso are zzso by measuring zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between a zzso layer of donor zzso labeling the supported zzso and zzso zzso labeling the zzso The smallest zzso detected in our setup between zzso zzso and dense zzso of zzso were approximately 20 zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is revealed by comparing the zzso of the donors to calculations of zzso between a perfectly zzso shell and a flat surface containing complementary zzso These results confirmed the theoretical prediction that the degree of deformation scales with the zzso zzso The size of the CA can be controlled zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso or the surface and thereby modulating the zzso energy of zzso In this manner, we could achieve secure zzso of zzso under conditions of minimal zzso Finally, we demonstrate that kinetic zzso of CA, at constant zzso can be used to record in real-time quantitative changes in the zzso tension of a zzso zzso membrane zzso
