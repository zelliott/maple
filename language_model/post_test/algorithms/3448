The probability formula of the zzso zzso zzso anomalous zzso phasing proposed by Fan & Gu zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an error term which is related to the zzso zzso This error term is used as a weighting function in the phase derivation and in the subsequent calculation of zzso zzso Previously, there has been a constant in the error term that has had to be determined zzso for each particular zzso It has been found that improper choice of the constant often leads to failure of the zzso zzso zzso The problem is resolved by introducing a modified error term and a method of automatically tuning the associated zzso zzso
