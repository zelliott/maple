In the zzso field, a great deal of interest has been given to zzso zzso zzso technique zzso due to its capability of providing new insights and relevant information about the complex zzso relationships in experimental data zzso This method, and some of its zzso has been successfully applied to gene zzso sequence analysis, functional characterization of genes and text zzso Even if the interest on this technique by the zzso community has been increased during the last few years, there are not many available simple zzso tools to specifically perform these types of data analysis in an integrated zzso 

In this work we propose a versatile and zzso tool that zzso the zzso methodology in different analysis contexts to support some of the most important reported applications of this new zzso This includes zzso and zzso gene expression data, protein sequence analysis, text mining of biomedical literature and sample zzso using gene zzso The zzso which is named zzso also contains a zzso zzso interface to explore results in an interactive manner and facilitate in this way the exploratory data analysis zzso 

zzso is a zzso versatile application which does not require any special installation or zzso It can be used for most of the multiple applications proposed in the zzso field or to support new research using this zzso This tool is publicly available at zzso
