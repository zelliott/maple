A new technique for the automated tracing of protein chains in experimental zzso maps is zzso The technique relies on the repeated application of an oriented zzso likelihood target function to identify likely zzso zzso This function is applied both in the location of a few promising zzso positions in the map and to grow those initial zzso positions into extended chain zzso zzso for assembling the chain fragments into an initial chain trace are zzso
