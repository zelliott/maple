In zzso zzso is used as an effective technique for delivery of therapeutic agents such as zzso drugs or DNA into target tissue cells for different biomedical zzso In order to successfully zzso a target zzso it is essential to know the local electric field distribution produced by an application of zzso zzso zzso In this study three-dimensional finite element models were built in order to analyze local electric field distribution and corresponding tissue zzso changes in rat muscle zzso either zzso or directly zzso zzso zzso were placed either on the skin or directly on the skeletal muscle after removing the zzso zzso calculations of zzso thresholds and zzso changes in skin and muscle were validated with in zzso zzso Our model of muscle with skin also confirms the in zzso findings of previous studies that zzso zzso the skin barrier when the applied zzso is above 50 zzso
