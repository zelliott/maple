A technique is described for filtering out the components of an zzso signal that have passed through an zzso spin order zzso The method involves a coordinated cycle of three zzso phase angles, where two of the zzso zzso to the polar angles describing the zzso of a regular zzso and the third angle is stepped around a zzso The most economical zzso filtering scheme involves a zzso phase cycle based on zzso zzso The method is used to filter out zzso signals that have passed through zzso populations in a solution zzso zzso
