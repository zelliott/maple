We propose a deadbeat controller for the control of zzso pump flow zzso ) in an zzso rotary blood pump zzso zzso zzso of pump speed and current are used as zzso to a zzso model of zzso zzso previously developed and verified in our zzso The controller was tested using a lumped zzso model of the cardiovascular system zzso in combination with the stable zzso models of zzso and differential pressure zzso zzso for the zzso The control zzso was tested with both constant and zzso reference zzso as input to the CVS zzso zzso showed that the controller was able to track the reference input with minimal error in the presence of model zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to settle to the desired reference value within a finite number of sampling zzso Our results also indicated that zzso yields the minimum left zzso stroke work, left zzso end zzso volume, and zzso pulse pressure, without significantly affecting mean cardiac output and zzso zzso
