This study is concerned with the zzso learning of an zzso zzso fuzzy zzso system, in a deterministic zzso in the presence of data uncertainties and modeling zzso The authors explore the use of zzso zzso theory and least squares zzso for online learning of membership functions and zzso parameters without making any assumption and requiring a zzso knowledge of upper bounds, statistics, and distribution of data uncertainties and modeling zzso The issues of data zzso modeling zzso and time variations have been considered zzso in a sensible zzso The proposed robust approach to the zzso learning of fuzzy models has been illustrated through the examples of zzso system zzso zzso zzso and zzso of an uncertain zzso
