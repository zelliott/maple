This work presents a method to separately analyze the conservative electric fields zzso primarily originating with the zzso electric potential in the zzso zzso and the zzso electric fields zzso caused by the zzso magnetic field zzso within samples that are much smaller than one wavelength at the frequency of zzso The method consists of first using a zzso simulation method to calculate the total electric field zzso and zzso currents zzso then calculating zzso based on J, and finally calculating zzso by zzso zzso from zzso The method was applied to calculate electric fields for a small zzso sample in a zzso at zzso When a zzso sample was zzso calculated values of zzso and zzso were at least in rough agreement with very simple zzso zzso When the sample was given zzso and/or zzso properties, zzso was seen to decrease, but still remained much larger than zzso When a zzso approach to reduce heating by placing a passive conductor in the shape of a zzso cylinder between the zzso and sample was zzso reduced zzso and improved B1 zzso within the sample resulted, in agreement with the published zzso
