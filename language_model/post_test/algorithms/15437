The principle of operations of the zzso program written by the author for Potential Energy Distribution zzso analysis of theoretical zzso zzso is zzso Nowadays, the zzso analysis is zzso tool in serious analysis of the zzso zzso To perform the zzso analysis it is necessary to define zzso zzso independent local mode zzso Already for zzso molecules it is a difficult zzso The zzso program reads the input data automatically from the zzso program output zzso Then, zzso automatically proposes an introductory set of local mode zzso Next, the more adequate coordinates are proposed by the program and zzso to obtain zzso elements of each column zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (the zzso zzso The possibility for an automatic zzso of zzso contributions is a unique feature of the zzso program absent in any other programs performing zzso zzso
