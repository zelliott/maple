We use conventional and zzso dynamic light scattering to investigate the dynamics of a wide variety of jammed soft materials, including zzso gels, concentrated zzso and concentrated zzso zzso For all systems, the dynamic structure factor zzso exhibits a zzso zzso The initial zzso is due to the zzso activated zzso motion of the zzso as indicated by the zzso dependence of the characteristic relaxation time, where zzso is the scattering zzso However, due to the constrained motion of the zzso in jammed zzso the dynamics are arrested and the initial zzso zzso in a zzso Surprisingly, we find that a final, zzso zzso leads to the complete relaxation of zzso indicative of zzso on length scales as large as several zzso or tens of zzso zzso for all systems the same very peculiar form is found for the final relaxation of the dynamic structure zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso with p approximately equal to zzso and zzso s approximately zzso thus suggesting the zzso of this zzso Additionally, for all samples the final relaxation slows down with zzso although the aging behavior is found to be sample zzso We propose that the unusual zzso dynamics are due to the relaxation of internal zzso built into the sample at the jamming transition, and present simple zzso arguments that support this zzso
