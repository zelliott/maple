An zzso approach is developed for reconstructing zzso zzso protein zzso zzso energy surfaces from zzso zzso axis order parameters zzso Application of an enhanced sampling zzso zzso zzso zzso to molecular dynamics simulation of a zzso zzso zzso reveals a zzso correlation between zzso and the populations of zzso states of protein zzso permitting the zzso populations to be extracted directly from zzso The zzso approach yields zzso zzso zzso that are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the zzso MD zzso
