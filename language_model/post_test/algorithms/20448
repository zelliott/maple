The zzso and zzso of cocaine and its three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in awake, freely moving zzso This work was performed to examine the effect of alcohol zzso on the zzso profile of cocaine and to determine the contribution of cocaine zzso to the pharmacological responses observed after cocaine zzso The plasma and brain zzso fluid zzso profiles were characterized after intravenous zzso administration of cocaine and the three zzso in a crossover experimental zzso The zzso response, measured as the change in zzso concentration in the nucleus zzso and the cardiovascular responses, measured as the change in the mean zzso blood pressure, heart rate, and zzso zzso were monitored zzso zzso had the highest zzso distribution ratio, followed by cocaine, zzso and zzso The estimated total body zzso for cocaine, zzso zzso and zzso were 140 zzso 19, zzso zzso zzso 130 zzso 19, and 111 zzso 16 zzso zzso Alcohol zzso increased the formation of zzso decreased the formation of zzso and resulted in the formation of the zzso active zzso zzso When cocaine was administered with alcohol, zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the cocaine dose was converted to zzso zzso did not have any central nervous system or cardiovascular activities after zzso zzso Compared with cocaine, zzso and zzso had more potent and prolonged effects on the zzso heart rate, and zzso zzso responses, and were zzso in increasing the mean zzso blood zzso These results indicate that changes in the cocaine zzso profile and the formation of the zzso active zzso zzso are, at least zzso responsible for the more intense and longer lasting effects reported after using this drug in combination with zzso
