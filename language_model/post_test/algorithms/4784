We developed novel methods for analyzing the zzso curve of an zzso to estimate the product of observed affinity and intrinsic zzso expressed relative to that of a standard zzso This zzso termed intrinsic relative activity zzso is most zzso for the analysis of responses at G zzso zzso zzso is equivalent to the potency ratios that zzso would exhibit in a hypothetical, highly sensitive zzso in which all zzso behave as full zzso even those with little intrinsic zzso We investigated zzso responses at the zzso zzso including stimulation of zzso zzso through zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso through zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, and stimulation of zzso zzso through zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso were approximately the same in the three zzso zzso In contrast, the activity of zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso greater at zzso receptors coupled to zzso in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso receptors coupled to zzso in the same cells or in zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso estimate is a useful measure for zzso zzso activity across different zzso systems and for detecting zzso directed zzso
