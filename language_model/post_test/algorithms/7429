zzso variations zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are a common feature in human zzso and a number of studies have reported that such zzso are associated with human zzso Although the progress of next generation sequencing zzso technologies has led to the discovery of a large number of zzso accurate and zzso detection of zzso remains zzso Thus far, various calling zzso based on zzso data have been zzso However, their strategies are diverse and there is no tool able to detect a full range of zzso zzso 

We focused on evaluating the performance of existing deletion calling zzso for various spanning ranges from low- to zzso simulation zzso The simulation data was generated from a whole zzso sequence with artificial zzso constructed based on the distribution of zzso obtained from the 1000 zzso zzso From the simulation analysis, deletion calls of various deletion sizes were obtained with each caller, and it was found that the performance was quite different according to the type of zzso and targeting deletion zzso Based on these results, we propose an integrated structural zzso calling pipeline zzso that combines existing methods with a newly devised filtering and merging zzso It achieved highly accurate deletion calling with zzso precision and zzso recall on the zzso read data for a broad range of zzso We applied zzso to the zzso sequence data of a zzso zzso sample, and detected a large number of zzso including notable zzso around 300 zzso and 6,000 zzso which corresponded to zzso and long zzso nuclear zzso zzso In addition, many of the predicted deletions were highly consistent with zzso validated ones by other zzso 

We present zzso a new deletion calling pipeline to obtain a zzso landscape of deletions in a highly accurate zzso From simulation and real data analysis, we show that zzso is broadly zzso to human zzso sequencing data, which will zzso relationships between zzso across zzso and associated diseases or biological zzso
