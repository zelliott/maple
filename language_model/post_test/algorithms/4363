While performing their functions, biological zzso often form large, zzso changing zzso zzso Only a relatively small number of such zzso have been accessible to the zzso techniques X-ray zzso and zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with image reconstruction has become the preferred alternative for revealing the structures of such zzso zzso However, for most zzso the achievable resolution is too low to allow accurate atomic modeling directly from the zzso Yet, useful models often can be obtained by fitting atomic models of individual components into a zzso reconstruction of the entire zzso Several zzso for achieving optimal fits in this context were developed recently, many allowing considerable degrees of flexibility to account for zzso zzso changes of the assembly zzso This chapter describes the advantages and potential pitfalls of these methods and puts them into perspective with alternative approaches such as zzso modular fitting of zzso zzso
