zzso methods have dominated the approaches to the particle selection problem, proving fast, and accurate on even the most challenging zzso A reference volume, however, is not always available and compiling a set of reference projections from the zzso themselves requires significant effort to attain the same level of zzso We propose a zzso method to quickly extract particles from the zzso The method is zzso with a new zzso zzso zzso to accurately discriminate particles from zzso and zzso
