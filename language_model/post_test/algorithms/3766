A previous analysis of the solid cancer mortality data for zzso from the Japanese zzso study of the zzso survivors has assessed the solid cancer risk zzso for zzso in terms of the low dose risk zzso zzso zzso the initial slope of the zzso zzso dose zzso and also in terms of the more precisely estimated intermediate dose risk zzso zzso for a reference dose, zzso which was chosen to be 1 zzso The zzso were performed for tentatively assumed values zzso of the zzso zzso against the reference dose and in terms of zzso doses, rather than the traditionally applied colon zzso The resulting risk estimate for a dose of 1 zzso was about half as large as the most recent zzso zzso The present assessment repeats the earlier analysis with two major zzso It parallels zzso based on zzso doses with zzso based on zzso doses and it updates the previous results by using the cancer mortality data for zzso which have recently been made zzso With an assumed zzso zzso of 35, the resulting intermediate dose estimate of the lifetime attributable risk zzso for solid cancer mortality for a working population zzso zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso model, and zzso with the zzso zzso For a population of all ages, zzso is obtained with the zzso model and zzso with the zzso zzso These values are up to about zzso higher than those obtained in the previous analysis with the zzso zzso However, considerably more zzso in the zzso relation is now supported by the zzso A dose and zzso reduction factor zzso is now much more in line with the data than zzso With this factor the zzso for a working population zzso over the zzso and the zzso zzso to zzso This is only half as large as the current zzso estimate which is also based on the assumption zzso
