zzso are stable zzso protein complexes that must be zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso modifications zzso are major regulatory factors of these zzso structural changes, but the molecular mechanisms associated with zzso function remains poorly zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso within distinct structured regions of the zzso directly regulate the inherent dynamic properties of the zzso zzso zzso were introduced into zzso by chemical zzso Single zzso magnetic tweezers zzso determined that only zzso near the zzso zzso increase the rate of zzso release in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and restriction zzso analysis reveal that only zzso throughout the DNA zzso region increase zzso and enhance zzso factor binding to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso in separate structural regions of the zzso control distinct dynamic events, where the zzso regulates zzso while the DNA zzso region regulates zzso These studies are consistent with the conclusion that zzso zzso may independently influence zzso dynamics and associated zzso zzso
