zzso noise is inherent in ultrasound images, and it generally tends to reduce the resolution and contrast, thereby degrading the diagnostic accuracy of this zzso zzso reduction is very important and critical for ultrasound zzso In this paper, we propose a novel approach for zzso reduction using zzso zzso and directional average zzso We have conducted experiments on numerous artificial images, clinic breast ultrasound images and vascular zzso The experimental results are compared with that of other methods and the performance is evaluated using several merits, and they demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce the zzso noise effectively without blurring the edges and damaging the zzso zzso It will be very useful for zzso diagnosis systems using ultrasound zzso
