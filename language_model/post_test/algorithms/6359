The sequence of any zzso becomes most useful for biological zzso when a complete and accurate gene set is zzso Gene prediction programs offer an efficient way to generate an automated gene zzso Manual zzso when performed by experienced zzso is more accurate and complete than automated zzso However, it is a zzso and expensive process, and by its nature, introduces a degree of zzso not found with automated zzso zzso zzso zzso is a program originally developed for manually zzso the human zzso It combines the latest zzso tools to extract and analyze a wide range of publicly available data in order to achieve fast and reliable automatic gene prediction and zzso zzso builds gene models based on zzso zzso and protein alignments to zzso zzso zzso supporting evidence to the corresponding zzso identifies zzso and locates zzso sites and zzso Here, we compare manual zzso of human zzso 6 with zzso performed by zzso in order to assess the latter's zzso zzso can readily be applied to manual zzso of other zzso zzso and can be used to rapidly obtain an automated gene zzso
