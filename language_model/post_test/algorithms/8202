Lung zzso is a prerequisite for automated analysis of chest CT zzso Conventional lung zzso methods rely on large zzso differences between lung zzso and surrounding zzso These methods fail in scans where dense abnormalities are present, which often occurs in clinical zzso Some methods to handle these situations have been proposed, but they are too time consuming or too specialized to be used in clinical zzso In this article, a new hybrid lung zzso method is presented that automatically detects failures of a conventional zzso and, when needed, resorts to a more complex algorithm, which is expected to produce better results in abnormal zzso In a large quantitative evaluation on a database of 150 scans from different sources, the hybrid method is shown to perform substantially better than a conventional approach at a relatively low increase in zzso zzso
