zzso structural analysis zzso has been developed over 20 zzso applied extensively in research, and has demonstrated useful outcomes zzso bone structural geometry with bone fragility zzso or zzso In 2007, zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso with some modifications as an option for zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso scanners zzso zzso or zzso This brought zzso from the research environment into the clinical zzso This article reports a comparison of zzso and zzso zzso using zzso scans from a group of 191 zzso zzso plots at the zzso zzso zzso region indicated higher zzso zzso bone mineral density zzso difference: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso moment of inertia zzso zzso zzso and section zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso The converse was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High linear correlations zzso zzso zzso were found between zzso and zzso zzso structural geometric zzso with the exception of neck zzso angle zzso zzso zzso As differences were significant zzso zzso zzso slopes and zzso are provided to enable linear transformations from zzso to corresponding zzso structural geometric zzso
