The zzso strategy which combines zzso zzso porous particles and zzso pressure zzso zzso was investigated considering very high resolution criteria in both zzso and zzso zzso with mobile phase temperatures between 30 and 90 degrees zzso In zzso mode, experimental conditions to reach the zzso efficiency were determined using the kinetic plot representation for zzso zzso It has been first confirmed that the molecular weight of the compounds zzso was a critical zzso which should be considered in the construction of such zzso With a zzso around 1000 g zzso efficiencies as high as 300,000 plates could be theoretically attained using zzso at 30 degrees zzso By limiting the column length to 450 zzso the zzso plate count was around zzso In zzso mode, the longest column does not provide the zzso peak capacity for a given analysis time in zzso This was attributed to the fact that peak capacity is not only related to the plate number but also to column dead zzso zzso a compromise should be found and a 150 zzso column should be zzso selected for zzso lengths up to 60 zzso at 30 degrees C, while the columns coupled in series zzso 150 zzso were attractive only for zzso zzso Compared to 30 degrees C, peak capacities were increased by about zzso for a constant zzso length at 90 degrees C and zzso time decreased by zzso for an identical peak zzso
