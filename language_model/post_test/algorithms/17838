An extension of zzso class zzso and finite mixture models is described for the analysis of zzso data zzso As is typical in zzso analysis, the dependence between zzso units within zzso units is dealt with by assuming that certain model parameters differ randomly across zzso zzso One of the special cases is an zzso model in which zzso differences in the zzso of belonging to a particular zzso are captured with continuous random zzso Other zzso are obtained by including random effects in the model for the response variables rather than for the zzso The zzso that receives most attention in this article is an zzso model with discrete random zzso zzso units are clustered based on the likelihood of their members belonging to the various zzso This yields a model with mixture zzso at two levels, namely at the group and the subject zzso This model is illustrated with three rather different empirical zzso The appendix describes an adapted version of the zzso zzso that can be used for maximum likelihood zzso as well as providing zzso for zzso the zzso zzso model with generally available zzso
