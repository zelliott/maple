In this paper, we present a protocol for the evaluation of similarity measures for zzso zzso The evaluation is based on five intuitive properties that characterize the behavior of a similarity measure, zzso the zzso capture range, distinctiveness of the zzso number of local zzso and risk of zzso These five properties are estimated locally from similarity measure values that zzso to a range of systematic local zzso zzso obtained by zzso control points in random directions from the gold standard zzso Global similarity measure properties are obtained by combining the local properties over image regions or over the entire zzso The feasibility of the proposed evaluation protocol is demonstrated for three similarity zzso mutual information, zzso mutual information and correlation zzso The evaluation is carried out on a number of MR and CT zzso a pair of simulated MR zzso and MR zzso images of the head, three pairs of real MR zzso and zzso images of the head, six pairs of real MR zzso and CT images of the head, and pairs of MR and CT images of three zzso The protocol may help researchers to select the most appropriate similarity measure for a zzso registration zzso
