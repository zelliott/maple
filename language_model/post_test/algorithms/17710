In most approaches to the problem of two-dimensional zzso zzso of ultrasound images, the zzso of a corresponding zzso function zzso is necessarily the first stage in the process of image zzso This zzso is usually performed in the zzso domain by either successive or simultaneous zzso of the zzso and phase of the zzso transform zzso of the zzso This paper addresses the problem of recovering the zzso of the zzso which is an important reconstruction problem by zzso The purpose of this paper is zzso First, it provides a theoretical zzso establishing that the zzso of the zzso can be effectively estimated by a proper smoothing of the zzso of the appropriate zzso zzso zzso Second, it presents a novel approach to the zzso of the zzso of the zzso by solving a continuous zzso equation over a zzso smooth zzso in contrast to the discrete zzso equation solver used for the classical least mean squares phase zzso zzso followed by a smoothing zzso The proposed approach is possible due to the distinct properties of the zzso among which the most important property is the availability of precise values of their partial zzso This property overcomes the main disadvantage of the discrete schemes, which routinely use wrapped zzso values of the phase in order to approximate its partial zzso Since such an approximation is feasible subject to the restriction that the partial phase differences do not exceed zzso in absolute value, the discrete schemes perform satisfactory only for few practical zzso The proposed approach is shown to be independent of this restriction and, thus, it performs for a wider class of the zzso with significantly lower zzso The main advantages of the novel method over the zzso based on discrete schemes are demonstrated in a series of computer simulations and for in zzso zzso
