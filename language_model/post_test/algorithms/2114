zzso have previously been determined for the zzso cost of restricting zzso acid zzso zzso upon protein zzso giving the rule of thumb that the zzso cost of restricting a single zzso bond is approximately zzso zzso zzso However, this result does not consider the distinct preferences shown by zzso acid zzso for particular zzso zzso angles in the folded zzso For example, zzso in an zzso has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trans zzso and zzso zzso zzso showing that it is most zzso to restrict zzso zzso as zzso in a zzso while zzso is least zzso The change in zzso zzso zzso is the same in both cases, but the free energy of each zzso is zzso Here, we determine the energies of every zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and each zzso zzso pair in zzso and zzso The calculation uses observed zzso zzso in secondary structure and the zzso state, together with zzso determined free energy changes for secondary structure zzso The results are sets of zzso energies within a secondary structure that can be directly compared to each zzso For example, we conclude that zzso is the most stable zzso in a zzso if only the trans zzso is zzso if only the zzso zzso is available, zzso would be the most zzso Previously published scales of zzso acid preferences for secondary structure are weighted averages of zzso energies and therefore imply that zzso is the most zzso substitution in a zzso in any zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and intrinsic secondary structure preferences are zzso within our zzso the results presented here should therefore be used in preference to both zzso zzso zzso and intrinsic secondary structure preferences when the zzso occupied in the folded state is zzso The results may be useful in protein engineering, simulations of binding and zzso prediction of protein stability and zzso binding zzso and identification of incorrectly folded zzso
