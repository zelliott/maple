zzso analyses for data hiding prescribe embedding the hidden data in the choice of zzso for the host zzso In this paper, we propose practical zzso of this prescription for data hiding in images, with a view to hiding large volumes of data with low zzso zzso The hidden data can be recovered reliably under attacks, such as zzso and limited amounts of image tampering and image zzso The three main findings are as zzso 1) In order to limit zzso distortion while hiding large amounts of data, hiding schemes must use zzso criteria in addition to statistical criteria based on information zzso 2) The use of local criteria to choose where to hide data can potentially cause zzso of the zzso and zzso This synchronization problem is solved by the use of powerful, but zzso zzso and errors correcting codes, which also provide zzso against a variety of zzso 3) For zzso zzso zzso hiding is zzso even though zzso guidelines prescribe zzso zzso zzso However, an zzso analysis for an idealized model is provided to show that zzso zzso hiding zzso approximately only a zzso penalty in terms of resilience to zzso
