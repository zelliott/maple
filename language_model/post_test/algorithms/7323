zzso zzso zzso is a recently developed imaging approach that zzso the resolution limit defined by the zzso zzso In current zzso imaging platforms, systematic noise sources come from the intensity fluctuation of multiple LED elements and the zzso aberrations of the employed zzso These system uncertainties can significantly degrade the reconstruction quality and limit the achievable resolution, imposing a restriction on the effectiveness of the zzso zzso In this paper, we report an zzso procedure that performs zzso system correction for zzso zzso zzso Similar to the techniques used in phase zzso the reported procedure involves the evaluation of an zzso metric at each iteration step, followed by the zzso of an improved system zzso This zzso process is repeated until the zzso metric is zzso As a demonstration, we used this process to correct for zzso intensity zzso to compensate for zzso aberration of the zzso and to recover several unknown system zzso The reported zzso correction scheme may improve the zzso of zzso zzso imaging by factoring out system imperfections and zzso
