zzso aspiration zzso is sensitive for detecting zzso such as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Because zzso aspiration specificity for zzso zzso of the zzso is zzso routine zzso frozen section is often zzso 

To define the roles of zzso aspiration and frozen section in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we reviewed data from 82 patients who underwent zzso between August 1989 and August 1995 for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso aspirations were grouped into three zzso diagnostic of zzso zzso of the zzso diagnostic of zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso or suspicious for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso diagnoses were made on permanent zzso 

A zzso aspiration revealing zzso zzso of the zzso was 98 percent specific for cancer or 100 percent specific for zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso A zzso aspiration that was suspicious for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 24) was only 54 percent specific for zzso On the basis of gross zzso findings, 5 of these 24 patients underwent total zzso without frozen section, and all had zzso The other 19 had frozen section zzso Of the 5 patients with cancer detected by frozen section, 4 had cancer on permanent zzso zzso on frozen section demonstrated a zzso zzso in the other 14 patients, of which 4 ultimately were zzso 

When zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso is definitively diagnosed on zzso zzso the surgeon can perform definitive zzso without frozen section because of the high specificity for zzso If the zzso aspiration is suspicious for zzso zzso of the zzso the zzso of cancer is 54 percent, and patients with these conditions should undergo surgery with frozen zzso When either gross findings or frozen sections suggest zzso definitive zzso can be performed because 90 percent of such cases will be zzso If frozen section is not diagnostic of zzso a zzso zzso is recommended because 71 percent have a benign zzso This systematic approach to zzso zzso of the zzso will zzso unnecessary frozen sections while maintaining excellent diagnostic zzso
