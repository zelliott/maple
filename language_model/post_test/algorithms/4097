The basic structure of the zzso system is highly zzso across zzso zzso zzso few zzso zzso can represent and address a multitude of cortical patterns, establish associations between cortical patterns and consolidate these associations in the zzso In this study, we investigate how elementary anatomical properties in the zzso loop along with synaptic plasticity contribute to these zzso Specifically, we focus on the high degree of connectivity between zzso and zzso leading to zzso and zzso forward and backward projections and zzso synaptic transmission delays that result from the detached location of the zzso and its multiple zzso We found that in a model incorporating these concepts, each cortical pattern can evoke a unique zzso zzso pattern in zzso zzso This zzso response zzso a reliable zzso of learned associations and a bridging of a time zzso larger than the time window of zzso dependent plasticity in the zzso Moreover, we found that repeated retrieval of a stored association leads to a zzso of the zzso between cue presentation and retrieval of the associated pattern from the zzso Neither a high degree of connectivity nor zzso synaptic delays alone is sufficient for this zzso We conclude that basic anatomical properties between zzso and zzso implement mechanisms for representing and consolidating zzso zzso Since our model reveals the observed functions for a range of zzso we suggest that these functions are robust to evolutionary changes consistent with the preserved function of the zzso loop across different zzso
