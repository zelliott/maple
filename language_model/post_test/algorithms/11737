The main objective of this study was to develop a zzso X-ray reconstruction system of the spine and rib cage for an accurate clinical assessment of spinal zzso The proposed system uses an explicit zzso technique and a new zzso object composed of: zzso a set of zzso markers embedded in a jacket worn by the patient during the X-ray zzso zzso six control markers to define a reference vertical zzso Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the zzso reconstruction procedure when different kind of zzso were applied on a reference zzso Clinical zzso zzso from the zzso X-ray reconstruction of the spine for 24 zzso subjects were compared to those obtained with the zzso zzso The results of the evaluation study showed that the new system allows the patient to adopt a normal attitude without any zzso zzso for its displacement between zzso
