This paper presents a zzso zzso model for zzso image registration and zzso zzso We develop an zzso zzso procedure that simultaneously estimates the parameters controlling the zzso of the zzso zzso To achieve this, we introduce a zzso Carlo zzso zzso algorithm, where the expectation step is zzso via zzso zzso Carlo sampling on the zzso of zzso An added benefit of this zzso approach is that it can successfully solve difficult registration problems involving large zzso where direct zzso zzso zzso Using synthetic data generated from the forward model with known zzso we demonstrate the ability of our model to successfully recover the zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the zzso zzso problem for zzso brain zzso
