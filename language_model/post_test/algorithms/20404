Automatic prediction of gait events zzso heel zzso flat foot, initiation of the swing, zzso and corresponding profiles of the zzso of muscles is important for real-time control of zzso This paper presents three supervised machine learning zzso techniques for prediction of the zzso patterns of muscles and sensory data, based on the history of sensory data, for walking assisted by a functional electrical stimulation zzso Those zzso are: 1) a zzso zzso with zzso modification of zzso learning zzso 2) an zzso fuzzy zzso system zzso and 3) a combination of an zzso zzso type of zzso learning zzso technique and a zzso basis function zzso type of artificial neural network with zzso least squares learning zzso Here we show the prediction of the zzso of the knee zzso muscles and the knee joint angle for seven consecutive strides based on the history of the knee joint angle and the ground reaction zzso The data used for training and testing of zzso was obtained from a simulation of walking assisted with an zzso system zzso The ability of generating rules for an zzso controller was selected as the most important criterion when comparing the zzso Other criteria such as zzso of results, zzso complexity, and learning rate were also zzso The minimal number of rules and the most explicit and comprehensible rules were obtained by zzso The best zzso was obtained by the zzso and zzso zzso
