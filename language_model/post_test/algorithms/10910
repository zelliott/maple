zzso zzso are an important resource in zzso zzso representing more than the half of the gross production of shrimp zzso In the present study, we used a sample of wide-ranging diversity (41 shrimp zzso and two zzso markers zzso zzso to clarify the evolutionary relationships among zzso zzso Three different zzso of tree reconstruction were employed in the zzso maximum likelihood, neighbor joining and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the old zzso zzso is zzso and that the inclusion of the zzso zzso within the zzso family remains zzso With respect to zzso zzso species of this zzso appeared zzso but with a zzso zzso zzso These results zzso some features of the unclear evolution of zzso and may contribute to the zzso characterization of this zzso
