There have been relatively few attempts to model the zzso of the fruit flies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in China, but the geographic zzso of these species are of considerable concern in terms of zzso In this study, two different modeling methods zzso zzso for zzso prediction zzso and maximum zzso species distribution modeling zzso were used to predict the potential zzso of these three fly species in China, by using distribution records and a set of environmental predictor zzso The results showed that zzso performed well, compared with modeling by zzso at each test zzso For all three species, the results predicted by zzso agreed with the observed zzso in Africa and in other parts of the zzso In China, zzso zzso seems to have the highest number of favorable habitat areas, relative to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso has the smallest range of suitable areas, zzso zzso some parts of zzso and zzso The suitable areas for zzso zzso are mainly restricted to zzso zzso southern zzso and a few areas of zzso The indications are that on the whole, Southwest and South China are the areas with the highest risk for establishment from these three fly zzso zzso tests reveal that environmental variables associated with temperature have the strongest influence on the potential zzso of all three species relative to other zzso
