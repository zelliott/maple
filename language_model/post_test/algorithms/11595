The prediction of clinical outcome of patients after breast cancer surgery plays an important role in medical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment zzso Different zzso factors for breast cancer outcome appear to be significant zzso for overall survival, but probably form part of a bigger picture zzso many zzso Survival zzso are currently performed by clinicians using the statistical techniques of survival zzso In this sense, artificial neural networks are shown to be a powerful tool for zzso zzso where there are complicated zzso interactions between the input data and the information to be zzso This paper presents a decision support tool for the prognosis of breast cancer zzso that combines a novel zzso zzso zzso of induction by sample division method, zzso to select the most relevant zzso factors for the accurate prognosis of breast cancer, with a system composed of different neural networks zzso that takes as input the selected variables in order for it to reach good correct zzso zzso In addition, a new method for the estimate of zzso optimal error using the neural network paradigm is zzso zzso data were obtained from the Medical Oncology Service of the Hospital zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results show that the proposed system is an useful tool to be used by clinicians to search through large zzso seeking subtle patterns in zzso factors, and that may further assist the selection of appropriate zzso treatments for the individual zzso
