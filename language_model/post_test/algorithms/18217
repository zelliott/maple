zzso models of zzso transfer zzso allow the zzso of physical properties of tissue which are thought to reflect zzso and are therefore likely to be useful for clinical zzso Although a model describing a zzso system under continuous zzso has been available for two decades, zzso such a model to zzso zzso and therefore to in zzso applications, is not straightforward, and only recently have a range of equations predicting the outcome of zzso zzso experiments been zzso These solutions of the zzso model are based on differing assumptions and involve differing degrees of complexity, so their individual advantages and limitations are not always zzso This paper is concerned with the comparison of three differing signal zzso After reviewing the theory behind each of them, their accuracy and precision is investigated using zzso simulations under variable experimental conditions such as degree of zzso of the acquisition sequence and zzso and the consistency of zzso results is tested using in zzso zzso We show that while in conditions of minimal zzso high zzso and large duty cycle the solutions of the three equations are consistent, they have a different tolerance to zzso from the basic assumptions behind their development, which should be taken into account when designing a quantitative zzso zzso
