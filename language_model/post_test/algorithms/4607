The reconstruction of a zzso representation from sampled data is an essential element of many image processing tasks, in particular, image zzso Until today, most image data have been available on Cartesian zzso despite the many theoretical advantages of zzso zzso In this paper, we propose new reconstruction methods for zzso sampled data that use the zzso zzso nature of the zzso and that at the same time remain practical and zzso To that aim, we deploy zzso and zzso models, which are notably well adapted to zzso zzso We also rely on the zzso paradigm to design compelling zzso that is, the optimal filter for a prescribed design is found using recent results from approximation zzso The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods are illustrated and compared for a zzso to Cartesian grid conversion zzso
