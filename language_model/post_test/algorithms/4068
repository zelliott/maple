zzso imaging with multiple signal zzso zzso is a zzso ultrasound imaging method for detecting point zzso This zzso assumes that there is no contrast between the density of the point targets and that of the background zzso and that ultrasound scattering is caused only by the zzso zzso We modify the zzso zzso to account for ultrasound scattering from point targets with both density and zzso zzso In addition, we develop an inversion method for zzso the density and zzso contrasts of point zzso with known zzso This approach is an extension of the inversion method previously developed by zzso et zzso for zzso the scattering strengths of point targets that have no density contrasts relative to the background zzso We use zzso phantom data to demonstrate that our new zzso inversion zzso can reliably estimate the density and zzso contrasts of point zzso The estimates of these properties could be used for distinguishing breast zzso from other tissue zzso
