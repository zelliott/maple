A major challenge of regional conservation planning is the identification of sets of sites that together represent the overall zzso of the relevant zzso Environmental cluster analysis zzso has been proposed as a potential tool for efficient selection of conservation sites, but the consequences of zzso decisions involved in its application have not been tested so zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso with respect to two such zzso the choice of the zzso zzso zzso linkage, complete linkage, zzso zzso average, zzso zzso Ward's minimum zzso and the zzso zzso and the weight given to different groups of environmental variables zzso temperature, and zzso zzso we tested how these decisions affect the spatial zzso of clusters of sites defined by the zzso whether and how they affect the effectiveness of the zzso zzso its ability to represent regional species zzso and whether the effectiveness of alternative methods of zzso zzso can be predicted a zzso based on the zzso zzso We used an extensive database of the zzso of Israel to test these zzso zzso in both the zzso zzso and the weighting regime had considerable effects on the spatial zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced mostly zzso clusters plus a single zzso cluster and was therefore found inappropriate for environmental zzso The effectiveness of the zzso was also sensitive to changes in the zzso zzso and the weighting zzso Yet, most combinations of zzso zzso and weighting regimes performed significantly better in capturing regional zzso than random zzso zzso The main zzso was zzso based on Ward's minimum zzso algorithm, which performed less well relative to all other zzso The two zzso that showed the highest effectiveness zzso average and zzso zzso zzso also exhibited the highest values of the zzso zzso suggesting that this index may serve as a potential indicator for the effectiveness of alternative zzso zzso
