Short protein repeats, frequently with a length between 20 and 40 zzso represent a significant fraction of known zzso Many repeats appear to possess high zzso acid substitution rates and thus recognition of repeat zzso is highly zzso Even if the presence of a certain repeat family is known, the exact locations and the number of repetitive units often cannot be determined using current zzso We have devised an zzso zzso based on optimal and zzso score zzso from profile analysis that estimates the significance of all repeats that are detected in a single zzso This procedure allows the identification of zzso at alignment scores lower than the highest optimal alignment score for zzso zzso The method has been used to investigate the occurrence of zzso families of repeats in zzso zzso zzso zzso and Homo sapiens accounting for zzso zzso and zzso repeats, zzso For these examples, the method is both more sensitive and more selective than conventional zzso search zzso The method allowed the detection in the zzso database of more than 2000 previously zzso repeats belonging to the 11 zzso In addition, the method was used to merge several repeat families that previously were supposed to be zzso indicating common zzso origins for these zzso
