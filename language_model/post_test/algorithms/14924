zzso zzso determination of the distribution of zzso zzso zzso among fibers of a peripheral nerve has the potential to improve both clinical diagnoses of pathology and zzso studies of the progress of disease or the efficacy of zzso Current techniques rely on long distances of propagation to increase the amount of zzso zzso in the compound signals and reduce the relative effect of errors in the forward zzso The method described in this paper attempts to reduce errors in zzso zzso through transfer function zzso and, zzso eliminate the need for long segments of zzso zzso action potential zzso signals are recorded from zzso equally spaced zzso in an array spanning only a zzso length of zzso Relative zzso transfer functions zzso between the nerve and each of the array zzso are estimated by comparing discrete zzso zzso of the array zzso zzso are zzso along the array so that zzso differences can be attributed to the effects of zzso zzso between recordings, and more accurate zzso estimates can be calculated from the short nerve zzso The method is tested using simulated and real zzso zzso zzso estimates are improved for simulated zzso The zzso procedure results in zzso that zzso match those from the literature when used on actual zzso zzso
