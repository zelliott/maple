This article presents a general model for zzso population zzso and zzso of zzso uncertainty in zzso zzso exposure assessments using two-dimensional zzso Carlo zzso Using data from zzso populations in Bangladesh, Brazil, Sweden, and the United zzso zzso model estimates of dietary zzso zzso were compared against those derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso By zzso zzso uncertainty into components zzso population zzso measurement error, recall error, and sampling zzso estimates were obtained of the contribution of each component to the overall zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exposure ratios were estimated for each population and were used to develop zzso useful for conducting zzso zzso assessments of zzso zzso The 5th and 95th zzso modeled zzso exposure estimates around mean population exposure from each of the four study populations are presented to demonstrate lack of knowledge uncertainty about a best estimate for a true zzso zzso from a zzso study population showed that a zzso dietary model resulted in a zzso lower lack of knowledge uncertainty around a central mean estimate relative to a hair zzso model, and also in a zzso lower lack of knowledge uncertainty around central mean estimate relative to a blood zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for the Brazil and Bangladesh zzso Such zzso used here to evaluate alternative models of dietary zzso exposure, can be used to refine exposure instruments, improve information used in site management and zzso decision making, and identify sources of uncertainty in risk zzso
