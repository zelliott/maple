Visual comparison of a reference image with a zzso image is commonly used for setup zzso in external beam radiation zzso However, it sometimes lacks zzso and provides insufficient quantitative zzso The present study was performed to develop computerized methods for determining landmarks to verify a portal image with digital reconstruction zzso zzso and to investigate the clinical effectiveness of our zzso Our computer zzso consisted of three main zzso determination of landmarks, and zzso of which required manual zzso Finally, our system indicated the distance for setup zzso We evaluated the accuracy of our system using pelvic phantom images, and the maximum magnitude of error was shown to be zzso zzso The results indicated that the error range of our system was sufficiently small to examine patient positioning error, which should be less than 5 zzso as described in zzso report zzso Our system will aid operators in positioning patients accurately for external radiation zzso
