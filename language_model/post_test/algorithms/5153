The volume of digital image zzso storage continues to be an important problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso enables the size of files to be reduced but with the disadvantage of loss of zzso Previous results indicated that the efficiency of zzso zzso of zzso stained cell zzso may be significantly reduced when compressed zzso are zzso This study attempts to show, with respect to zzso stained zzso which zzso parameters may be altered by the different levels of zzso zzso and the implications of these zzso for automated nuclear counts, and further, develops a method for correcting this zzso in the nuclear zzso For this purpose, 47 zzso from different zzso were captured in zzso zzso format and converted to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive objects were selected from these images, and six zzso parameters were measured and compared for each object in zzso images and those of the different zzso levels using a set of previously developed and tested zzso zzso proved to be the only zzso zzso that was significantly affected by image zzso zzso to correct the zzso in the zzso estimate were derived from linear zzso models for each zzso level, thereby eliminating the statistically significant differences between zzso in the equivalent zzso These correction factors were incorporated in the automated zzso where they reduced the nuclear zzso differences arising from image zzso Our results demonstrate that it is possible to carry out unbiased automated zzso nuclear zzso in compressed zzso with a methodology that could be easily incorporated in different systems of digital image zzso
