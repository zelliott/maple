To develop and test a zzso tool for zzso new competing Health Technologies zzso after their assessment using the zzso zzso 

A two layer zzso tool was developed based on the zzso The first layer included 12 zzso variables classified in two dimensions, namely value zzso clinical benefit, patient impact, zzso quality of the evidence, zzso and risk zzso space and process of care impacts, incremental costs, net cost, investment zzso zzso given to these variables were obtained from a survey among zzso (at zzso level and hospital zzso A second layer included results from zzso zzso as higher, equal or zzso which compares the performance of the new zzso (in terms of the zzso 12 zzso with the available zzso An zzso combining the first zzso and second zzso layers was developed to obtain an overall score for each zzso which was then plotted in a zzso zzso The tool was tested using results from the zzso for three new zzso zzso Robot, zzso Rich zzso Deep Brain zzso 

No significant differences among zzso were observed as regards the weights given to the 12 zzso therefore, the median zzso weights from zzso were introduced in the first zzso The dot plot resulting from the zzso presented good power to visually discriminate between the assessed zzso 

The zzso tool developed here makes possible a robust and straightforward comparison of different competing zzso This zzso hospital zzso deliberations on the zzso of competing investments under fixed zzso
