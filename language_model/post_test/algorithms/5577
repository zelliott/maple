The ever increasing sizes of population genetic zzso pose great challenges for population structure zzso The zzso zzso statistical test is widely used for detecting zzso However, it has not been adequately investigated whether the zzso statistic is susceptible to type I error, especially in large, complex zzso zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso based methods for resolving structure have been developed which rely on the zzso zzso Although zzso methods can resolve structure, they cannot zzso zzso zzso methods are still needed for ancestry analysis, but they are not suitable for large zzso We propose a new structure analysis framework for large zzso This includes a new zzso for detecting structure and incorporation of the structure patterns zzso by a zzso method to complement zzso zzso 

A new zzso called zzso for detecting population structure is zzso When tested on simulated data, this zzso is robust to sample zzso In contrast, the zzso statistic was found to be susceptible to type I error, especially for large population zzso zzso is thus zzso for analysis of large zzso containing many individuals, in which zzso patterns are likely to exist and could be incorrectly interpreted as population zzso zzso was applied to the zzso pruning zzso zzso method, which resolves the underlying zzso This zzso information was used to supervise zzso analysis to zzso patterns of ancestry at an unprecedented level of zzso To validate the new approach, a bovine and a large human genetic zzso zzso zzso were zzso We found new ancestry patterns consistent with the zzso resolved by zzso 

The zzso zzso is robust to sampling and is thus superior for detecting structure in large zzso The application of zzso to the zzso zzso improves the zzso of the number of zzso and the individual assignment zzso especially for very large and complex zzso Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the structure resolved by this approach zzso zzso analysis, allowing a much more comprehensive account of population zzso The new version of the zzso software with zzso incorporated can be downloaded from zzso
