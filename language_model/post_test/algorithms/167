In this paper, we extend the class of energy functions for which the optimal zzso and zzso zzso moves can be zzso in zzso zzso Specifically, we introduce a novel family of higher order zzso zzso and show that the expansion and swap moves for any energy function composed of these zzso can be found by minimizing a zzso zzso We also show that for a subset of these zzso the optimal move can be found by solving an zzso zzso We refer to this subset as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results enable the use of powerful zzso and zzso zzso move making zzso for zzso of energy functions involving higher order zzso Such functions have the capability of modeling the rich statistics of natural scenes and can be used for many applications in Computer zzso We demonstrate their use in one such application, zzso the zzso image or zzso zzso
