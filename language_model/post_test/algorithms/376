We present a coding system combined with an zzso tool for the analysis of zzso zzso The zzso coding system consists of three zzso that progress from gesture zzso to gesture zzso zzso on empirical zzso and psychological studies, the theoretical assumption behind zzso is that its main kinetic and functional movement categories are zzso associated with specific zzso zzso and interactive zzso zzso is a free, zzso zzso tool for digital audio and video zzso It supports zzso zzso and zzso with such standards as zzso and zzso zzso allows gesture categories to be stored with associated zzso that are reusable by means of template zzso The combination of the zzso coding system and the zzso tool zzso creates an effective tool for empirical research on zzso zzso
