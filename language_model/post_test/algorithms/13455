Acute zzso disease is a severe complication of zzso stem cell transplantation in which the functional immune cells of the donor recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an zzso zzso There is an urgent need for better diagnostic instruments for the assessment of acute zzso zzso In the present study, a novel zzso framework was used to identify gene expression patterns associated with acute zzso disease in patients undergoing zzso zzso stem cell zzso 

zzso blood cells were collected zzso from patients who did develop acute zzso disease zzso and from those who did not zzso Gene expression profiling was performed using a panel of 47 candidate genes potentially involved in zzso zzso The entire population of zzso acute zzso disease patients formed the experimental validation zzso zzso modeling based on a gene selection technique was applied to identify the most significant zzso zzso which were then used to profile individual data samples for training and testing the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso procedure was performed to investigate the zzso of the zzso framework producing the following zzso zzso on the training zzso and zzso on the testing zzso According to our integrated methodology, transcripts for zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes involved in immune zzso responses and participating in immune cell zzso were identified as the most zzso zzso in zzso stem cell transplant recipients experiencing acute zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that the integrated methodology proposed is useful for the selection of valid gene targets for the diagnosis of acute zzso disease, producing satisfactory accuracy over independent clinical features of the zzso transplanted zzso
