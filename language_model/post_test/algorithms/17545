In this paper, a zzso method is proposed to recognize translation start sites in bacterial zzso without a prior knowledge of zzso in the zzso zzso Many features with biological zzso are zzso including zzso distribution patterns near the start zzso the start zzso itself, the coding potential and the distance from the zzso start zzso to the start zzso The proposed method correctly predicts zzso of the translation start sites of 195 zzso confirmed zzso coli zzso zzso of 58 reliable zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 140 reliable zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso method presented might also be used to relocate the translation start sites of putative zzso of zzso which are predicted by zzso zzso After zzso by the method zzso the improvement of gene start prediction of some zzso programs is zzso zzso the accuracy of gene start prediction of zzso zzso increases from 63 to zzso for 832 zzso coli reliable zzso An open source computer program to implement the method, zzso is freely available for academic purposes from zzso
