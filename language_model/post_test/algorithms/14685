zzso zzso is a zzso zzso tool that has been developed to study the zzso and zzso properties of zzso The zzso optical system is built to direct zzso laser light into an zzso microscope to create a zzso three-dimensional zzso laser trap at the microscope focal zzso A real-time automated tracking and zzso system zzso is described that provides a remote zzso robotic zzso The combination of laser zzso fluorescent imaging, and zzso can measure zzso swimming speed and swimming force simultaneously with zzso membrane potential zzso The roles of two sources of zzso zzso in zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso which occurs in the zzso located in the zzso zzso and zzso which occurs along the length of the zzso tail zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on human zzso zzso are zzso This combination of zzso physical and engineering tools has been used to examine the evolutionary effect of zzso competition in zzso The results demonstrate a correlation between mating type and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso species swim faster and with greater force than zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso engineering and biological systems are combined to provide a powerful interdisciplinary approach to study the complex biological systems that drive the zzso toward the zzso
