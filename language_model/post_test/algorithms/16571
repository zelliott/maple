Since a zzso row coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso was launched in 1998, zzso has experienced rapid improvement of imaging qualities with the ongoing evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso to detect coronary artery zzso is well established, whereas improvements are still needed to reduce the zzso of coronary artery disease zzso and assess plaque zzso zzso has been used to evaluate zzso in various clinical zzso For example, zzso could be an efficient initial zzso tool at emergency departments for patients with acute chest pain with zzso risk because of its high negative zzso zzso In patients with suspected zzso zzso could be a cost-effective alternative to zzso zzso imaging and exercise zzso for the initial coronary evaluation of patients with intermediate zzso likelihood suspected zzso However, in zzso zzso there is a lack of studies that show an improved zzso power of zzso over other zzso zzso the clinical use of zzso to detect zzso for purposes of risk zzso in zzso individuals should be zzso As CT technology zzso zzso will provide better quality coronary imaging and zzso information with lower radiation zzso Future studies should cover these ongoing technical improvements and evaluate the zzso power of zzso in various clinical settings of zzso in large, well-designed, zzso zzso
