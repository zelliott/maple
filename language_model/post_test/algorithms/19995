zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso is the most important and best studied zzso zzso at the zzso barrier zzso however, the organization of zzso is zzso The aim of this study was to employ the recently developed zzso zzso zzso method spectral precision distance zzso position determination zzso zzso to investigate the spatial distribution of zzso in the zzso plasma membrane of brain zzso zzso zzso Potential disturbing effects of cell membrane zzso on the distribution analysis are addressed with computer zzso zzso human cerebral zzso zzso cells zzso served as a model of human zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein incorporated in a zzso zzso The expression and zzso of the zzso fusion protein was zzso by zzso The limited resolution of zzso in the zzso leads to a projection during the imaging process affecting the appeared spatial distribution of zzso molecules in the zzso zzso zzso simulations of zzso zzso on differently curved cell zzso were performed and their projected spatial distribution was zzso zzso of the fusion protein was confirmed by zzso analysis after incubation of cells with the fluorescent probe zzso Gold in absence and presence of zzso More than 112,000 single zzso molecules zzso to approximately zzso zzso molecules per zzso were detected by zzso with an averaged spatial resolution of approximately 40 zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso is distributed in clustered zzso in zzso cells while the influence of present random cell membrane zzso can be excluded based on the simulation zzso Individual zzso are distributed randomly over the cell zzso
