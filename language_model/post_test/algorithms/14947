According to theoretical considerations, the magnetic field of the earth could influence the first steps of zzso changes in zzso zzso an effect that is thought to zzso the magnetic orientation of some zzso To find out whether man could be influenced in this way, we have tested the effect of an artificial fluctuation in the direction of the earth's magnetic field on zzso of the visual sensitivity in 27 healthy zzso The zzso zzso show a significant influence of the field zzso indicating that man is sensitive to changes in the direction of the earth's magnetic zzso
