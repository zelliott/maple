Estimates of zzso clearance zzso based on equations and various zzso zzso were compared with 24-hour measured zzso values in zzso obese zzso 

Patients age zzso years with a body mass index zzso of zzso zzso with stable serum zzso values were zzso zzso known to contribute to zzso in zzso were used to exclude zzso zzso urine collection was performed to measure zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to estimate zzso weight zzso zzso zzso rate was estimated using the zzso zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso zzso zzso was estimated using the zzso and zzso methods using total body weight zzso zzso zzso such as ideal body weight zzso adjusted body weight zzso and lean body weight zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso equation to generate additional estimates of zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completed the zzso All three equations were biased in their zzso of zzso Use of zzso and zzso in the zzso equation underestimated zzso while the zzso equation and use of zzso or zzso in the zzso equation overestimated this zzso zzso of zzso weight or zzso in the zzso equation provided unbiased estimates of zzso 

An zzso estimate, based on zzso and zzso incorporated into the zzso equation provided an zzso relatively precise, accurate, and clinically practical estimate of 24-hour measured zzso in zzso obese zzso
