Most existing models of zzso and learning in Parkinson disease zzso focus on simulating the role of zzso zzso zzso in reinforcement zzso Much data argue, however, for a critical role for prefrontal zzso zzso zzso in stimulus selection in zzso zzso Here, we present a new zzso model that simulates performance in zzso category learning, such as the zzso zzso zzso The model addresses how zzso and zzso medications affect stimulus selection zzso which mediate reinforcement zzso In this model, zzso zzso is key for zzso learning, whereas zzso zzso zzso consistent with other models, is key for reinforcement and motor zzso The model assumes that competitive dynamics among zzso zzso is the neural mechanism underlying stimulus selection with limited zzso resources, whereas competitive dynamics among zzso zzso is the neural mechanism underlying action zzso According to our model, zzso is associated with decreased zzso and zzso zzso levels in both zzso and zzso zzso We assume that zzso medications increase zzso levels in both the zzso zzso and zzso which, in turn, increase zzso zzso levels but decrease the magnitude of zzso zzso signaling in these brain zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in the simulated zzso enhances zzso shifting zzso The model provides a zzso account for several phenomena, including zzso zzso zzso patients are more impaired at zzso zzso category learning than zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso patients opt out of reversal when there are alternative and redundant cue zzso
