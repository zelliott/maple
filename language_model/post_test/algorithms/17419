This paper introduces a new technique for the zzso of brain electromagnetic activity: a zzso fit zzso This zzso uses some properties of the principal component analysis and makes no assumptions about the number of sources to be zzso It was applied to both simulated and real zzso signals and was compared to the well-known moving zzso fit zzso zzso For the simulations, we constructed extended sources, rather than single zzso that respected realistic anatomical and zzso zzso From these, we generated, under different noise conditions, zzso and zzso signals from which zzso was zzso The real signals were auditory evoked zzso zzso it appeared that the zzso was able to separate simultaneously activated sources even on strongly noisy signals while, most of the time, the zzso failed to give a clear description of the source zzso zzso although we used the same head model to both generate the signals and locate the sources, zzso for zzso was inferior to that for zzso In conclusion, since in all test conditions the zzso is found to be far superior to zzso we suggest the use zzso for the zzso of equivalent zzso
