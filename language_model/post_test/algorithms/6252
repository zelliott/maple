Previous data suggest that in a zzso procedure with gaps, memory for the zzso zzso varies with the zzso of the gap from the zzso zzso Here we extend this finding by manipulating the zzso and gap intervals as well as the visual contrast between the gap and the zzso zzso The delay in response function after the gap was found to vary with the duration and position of the zzso However, for each gap duration and position, the delay in response increased with the zzso contrast: at zzso zzso contrast pigeons continued to accumulate time during the zzso at zzso zzso contrast pigeons stopped timing during the zzso and at zzso zzso contrast pigeons reset their timing after the zzso Data are accounted for by a zzso model assuming two concurrent processes during the zzso zzso and memory zzso controlled by the zzso of the zzso interplay results in a zzso of responses in the gap zzso
