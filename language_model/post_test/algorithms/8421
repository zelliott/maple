In zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data sets, the number of variables is larger than the number of zzso This fact makes application of zzso linear model analysis difficult, except if a reduction of the data zzso dimension is performed prior to the zzso The reduced data set, however, will in general not be normally distributed and therefore, the usual zzso tests will not be necessarily zzso This problem has not been adequately discussed in the literature concerning zzso linear analysis of brain imaging zzso No theoretical foundation has been given to support that the zzso zzso of the tests are as zzso Our study addresses this issue by introducing a method of constructing test statistics that follow the same zzso as when the data zzso is normally zzso The method is based on the zzso of certain tests over a large class of zzso of the data zzso This implies that the method is very general and can be applied for different reductions of the data zzso As an illustration we apply a test statistic constructed by the method now presented to test a zzso hypothesis on a PET data zzso The test rejects the zzso hypothesis of no significant differences in measured brain activity between two zzso The effect responsible for the rejection of the hypothesis is characterized using zzso zzso analysis zzso and compared with the result obtained by using zzso zzso analysis for each zzso and statistical zzso based on size of zzso The results obtained from zzso and the zzso method are zzso
