The zzso locations of proteins are important functional zzso An effective and reliable zzso zzso method is necessary for zzso zzso This paper introduces a new zzso automatically predict the zzso locations of zzso The profiles of all protein sequences in the training set are constructed by zzso and the zzso zzso scores are used to form feature zzso for training a support zzso machine zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso the methods that are based on sequence alignment and zzso compositions even if most of the zzso sequences have been zzso This paper also demonstrates that the performance of zzso is sensitive (and somewhat zzso to the degree of its kernel zzso meeting the zzso zzso zzso was evaluated on zzso and zzso Huang and zzso and zzso et zzso protein zzso The overall zzso on these three zzso reach zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which are higher than or comparable to those obtained by sequence alignment and by the methods compared in this zzso
