zzso of a zzso symptom zzso in medical data set is a crucial zzso step for the medical zzso zzso This paper proposes a supportive attribute - assisted zzso zzso model for medical diagnostic zzso The intent of this approach is to discover the best supportive symptom that zzso closely with the zzso symptom being zzso and to conduct the zzso process using the significant supportive information that is provided by the best supportive zzso because we zzso that a good zzso scheme should rely heavily on the interaction between a zzso attribute and both its supportive attribute and the class zzso zzso can consider each zzso symptom differently and zzso which allows it to be capable of minimizing the information lost and the data zzso zzso zzso results in higher zzso zzso zzso experiments using ten real-life zzso from the zzso zzso were conducted to compare the zzso accuracy achieved by several prestigious zzso with zzso and other state-of-the-art zzso zzso The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach in enhancing the diagnostic zzso
