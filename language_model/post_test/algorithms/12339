Early manifestation of breast cancer is often very subtle and is displayed in a complex and variable pattern of normal anatomy that may obscure the zzso The use of zzso techniques, that can remove the structural noise, and contrast media, that enhance the region surrounding the zzso could help us to improve the zzso of the zzso The aim of this work is to investigate the use of an zzso contrast medium in zzso with two different double exposure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both techniques have been investigated by using an ideal source, like zzso beams produced at a zzso radiation facility and a clinical digital zzso zzso A dedicated zzso phantom containing cavities filled with different zzso zzso has been developed and used for zzso For each technique, information about the minimum zzso zzso which provides a significant enhancement of the zzso of the pathology by minimizing the risk due to high dose and high concentration of contrast zzso has been zzso In particular, for cavities of 5 and 8 zzso in diameter filled with zzso solutions, the minimum concentration needed to obtain a zzso ratio of 5 with a mean zzso dose of 2 zzso has been zzso The minimum zzso estimated with zzso beams and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the biggest and smallest details, respectively, while for zzso zzso zzso they are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the conventional clinical system the minimum zzso for the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso while for the zzso zzso zzso they are zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso
