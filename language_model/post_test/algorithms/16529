To evaluate the correlation between feature zzso zzso of the right zzso zzso and zzso age in healthy zzso 

Global and zzso zzso peak zzso strain, strain rate and zzso values of the right zzso zzso were assessed by a novel zzso technique in 150 healthy fetuses at between 13 and 39 zzso zzso zzso ranges were constructed with respect to zzso age, and zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso strain rate and zzso exhibited a zzso base to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Global zzso peak zzso zzso increased significantly across the zzso age range considered zzso zzso zzso whereas global zzso peak zzso strain and strain rate zzso as absolute zzso decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of global right zzso peak zzso strain, strain rate and zzso was zzso The zzso of measurement error between the two observers were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Global zzso peak zzso zzso of the right zzso increase with zzso age whereas global zzso peak absolute zzso strain and strain rate significantly decrease throughout zzso This novel zzso technique offers a new zzso approach for zzso and monitoring fetal zzso function throughout zzso
