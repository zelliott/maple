To compare the doses calculated using the zzso pencil beam zzso and zzso Carlo zzso zzso for tumors located in various sites including the lung and evaluate quality assurance procedures required for the zzso of the accuracy of dose zzso The zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso was also assessed zzso with measurement using zzso chamber and zzso films placed in solid water and zzso zzso The dose was calculated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso treatment planning system from zzso The dose calculation was performed on the patient's zzso zzso images with zzso in various treatment sites including 5 zzso 5 zzso 4 zzso 2 head and necks, and 2 zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso radiation therapy plans was used in dose zzso The leaf sequence from zzso radiation therapy plans or beam shapes from zzso plans and monitor units and other planning parameters calculated by the zzso were identical for calculating dose with zzso zzso correction was considered in both zzso and zzso dose zzso zzso parameters such as zzso zzso covered by zzso of prescription zzso dose zzso and gamma analysis were used to evaluate the calculated dose by zzso and zzso The measured doses by zzso chamber and zzso zzso film in solid water and zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso the accuracy of dose calculated by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and dose zzso calculated by zzso and zzso in the brain, zzso zzso and head and neck were in good agreement with one another zzso zzso and provided acceptable planning target volume zzso However, dose zzso of the patients with lung cancer had large zzso For a plan zzso with zzso the dose coverage was shown as clinically acceptable, whereas in reality, the zzso showed a systematic lack of dose zzso The dose calculated by zzso for lung tumors was overestimated by up to zzso An interesting feature that was observed is that despite large discrepancies in zzso zzso coverage of the planning target volume between zzso and zzso the point doses at the zzso (center of the zzso calculated by both zzso were within zzso even for lung zzso The dose zzso measured with zzso zzso films in zzso zzso showed large discrepancies of nearly zzso lower than zzso at zzso between zzso media, where these lower doses measured by the film were in agreement with those by zzso The doses zzso calculated by zzso and zzso agreed within zzso for treatment sites with small tissue zzso such as the zzso brain, head and neck, and zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso were observed in the zzso coverage between zzso and zzso in lung tumors, which may affect clinical zzso The discrepancies between zzso and zzso increased for zzso compared with zzso indicating the importance of zzso of accurate clinical treatment planning such as zzso The comparison of point doses is not representative of the discrepancies in dose coverage and might be misleading in evaluating the accuracy of dose calculation between zzso and zzso Thus, the clinical quality assurance procedures required to verify the accuracy of dose calculation using zzso and zzso need to consider zzso of zzso and zzso dose zzso rather than a single point measurement using zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso zzso
