How zzso zzso factors scan the zzso to locate their target sites is a fundamental question in gene zzso The in zzso binding interactions of several different zzso factors with zzso have been investigated recently using quantitative zzso recovery after zzso zzso These analyses have yielded significantly different estimates of both the binding rates and the number of predicted binding states of the respective zzso zzso We show here that these discrepancies are not due to fundamental differences among the zzso zzso factors, but rather arise from errors in zzso zzso The two principal errors are a neglect of zzso role and an zzso approximation of the zzso zzso zzso for these errors by developing a revised zzso protocol eliminates most of the previous discrepancies in the binding estimates for the three different zzso factors analyzed zzso The new estimates predict that for each of the three zzso factors, approximately zzso of the molecules are freely zzso within the nucleus, whereas the remainder is bound with an average residence time of approximately zzso s to a single type of zzso binding zzso Such consistent predictions for three different molecules suggest that many zzso zzso factors may exhibit similar in zzso interactions with native zzso
