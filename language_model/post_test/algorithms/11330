zzso zzso zzso learning methods usually build an zzso graph utilizing both labeled and zzso samples as zzso Those methods zzso label information of labeled samples to neighbors through their edges in order to get the predicted labels of zzso zzso Most popular zzso learning approaches are sensitive to initial label distribution which happened in zzso labeled zzso The class boundary will be severely skewed by the majority classes in an zzso zzso In this paper, we proposed a simple and effective approach to alleviate the zzso influence of imbalance problem by zzso selecting a few zzso samples and adding them into the minority classes to form a balanced labeled zzso for the learning methods zzso The experiments on zzso zzso and zzso handwritten digits zzso showed that the proposed approach zzso other existing zzso zzso
