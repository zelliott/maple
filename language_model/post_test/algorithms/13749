Given current zzso zzso it is worthwhile to establish zzso acid zzso functions which approximate protein folds quite zzso Such functions must be the interim steps toward protein three-dimensional structure zzso I have shown that an empirical zzso penalty function of zzso derived from the number of zzso in a sphere around each zzso could be zzso to distinguish the correctly folded structure from the incorrect zzso In order to assess the zzso power of the penalty function, I have generated zzso by randomly changing main chain zzso angles, and applied the penalty function to zzso If only a local region was allowed to change its zzso zzso structures could be generated within a reasonable zzso zzso In global simulations, however, a considerable number of zzso zzso which gave as small a penalty value as that of the native zzso were zzso Although some of the zzso were compact and zzso they were quite different from the native structure in that they lacked most of the secondary zzso This result shows that the penalty function alone cannot define the native structure, and that zzso information may help the penalty function to reach the correctly folded zzso
