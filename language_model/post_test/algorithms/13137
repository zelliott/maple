zzso has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional chemistry, especially for zzso zzso One key requirement during process development is the discovery of a zzso with an appropriate zzso and zzso which can be zzso for instance, by protein engineering or screening of zzso zzso We have developed an in zzso strategy for a zzso prediction of zzso specificity and zzso First, we used rational protein design to predict key zzso acid zzso that indicate the desired zzso Then, we searched protein databases for proteins already carrying these zzso instead of constructing the corresponding zzso in the zzso This methodology exploits the fact that naturally evolved proteins have undergone selection over millions of years, which has resulted in highly zzso zzso Using this in zzso approach, we have discovered 17 zzso zzso zzso which zzso the synthesis of several zzso with excellent optical purity up to zzso zzso zzso
