zzso zzso activities related to visual zzso association have been found in the inferior zzso zzso zzso of zzso They provide an important clue to zzso the memory mechanisms of the brain, but do not zzso with existing neural network zzso In the present paper, we clarify the zzso principle required for zzso the empirical data and construct a biologically feasible model that learns and performs a delayed zzso zzso This model is composed of two neural networks, association network zzso and trainer network zzso and zzso memories are formed by their zzso Specifically, zzso receives the output of zzso in addition to an external zzso and sends a learning signal back to zzso this signal works as a guide for shifts in output pattern or state transitions of zzso and memory traces are engraved along its path, so that a trajectory zzso connecting from the zzso to the zzso state is formed in zzso Computer simulation shows that the model not only zzso the target in the task, but also explains the activity of the IT zzso very zzso It is reasonable to zzso that zzso and zzso zzso to area TE and the zzso cortex, zzso based on this theory, we explain some zzso findings on learning and memory, and also make several zzso
