zzso zzso This paper introduces a family of kernels for analyzing zzso trees endowed with zzso valued zzso made along the zzso While state-of-the-art graph and tree kernels use zzso zzso structure with discrete zzso and edge labels, the kernels presented in this paper can include geometric information such as branch shape, branch radius or other zzso valued zzso In addition to being flexible in their ability to model different types of zzso the presented kernels are zzso efficient and some of them can easily be zzso for large zzso (N - zzso of trees with 30 - 600 zzso Combining the kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation between disease and anatomical tree structure and zzso Experimental zzso The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from zzso CT, endowed with branch shape zzso and airway wall area percentage zzso made along the zzso Using zzso hypothesis testing we show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease zzso than in healthy zzso The geometric tree kernels also give a significant increase in the zzso accuracy of COPD from geometric tree structure endowed with airway wall thickness zzso in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and zzso zzso Software for computing kernels and statistical tests is available at zzso
