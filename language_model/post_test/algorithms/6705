The standard procedure to determine the brain response from a zzso evoked zzso zzso or zzso zzso data set is to average the individual trials of these data, time locked to the stimulus zzso When the brain responses vary from zzso this approach is zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso is derived for the case that the recorded data contain zzso zzso The zzso accounts for zzso and temporally correlated background noise that is superimposed on the brain zzso The model is applied to a series of 17 zzso data sets of normal subjects, obtained during median nerve zzso It appears that the zzso of late component zzso zzso shows a systematic negative trend indicating a weakening response during stimulation zzso For the early components zzso zzso no such a systematic effect was zzso The model is zzso applied on a zzso data set consisting of zzso spikes of constant spatial distribution but varying zzso For these data, the advantage of applying the model is that positive and negative spikes can be processed with a single model, thereby reducing the number of degrees of freedom and increasing the zzso zzso
