West Nile virus zzso infection, a zzso disease for which birds act as a zzso first appeared in North America in August zzso It was first reported in Quebec in zzso The Quebec surveillance system for zzso has several zzso including the surveillance of mortality in zzso zzso which includes the American crow zzso zzso The main objectives of this study are to better understand the population dynamics of this species in Quebec and to evaluate the impact of zzso on these zzso We obtained observation data for living zzso in this province for the period of zzso and then conducted a spectral analysis of these zzso To study changes in crow population zzso the analysis was carried out before and after the appearance of zzso and space was divided in two different areas zzso and zzso Our results show the importance of cycles with periods of less than 1 year in zzso areas and cycles with periods of greater than 1 year in urban areas in the normal population dynamics of the zzso We obtained expected fluctuations in bird zzso using an zzso derived from spectral zzso When we compared these predictions with data observed after 2002, we found marked zzso in population dynamics beginning in 2003 and lasting up to zzso In the discussion, we present various hypotheses based on the zzso of the American crow to explain the normal population dynamics observed in this species and the effect of type of area zzso versus zzso We also discuss how the zzso zzso could be used as a disease surveillance tool and as a measure of the impact of a disease on wild zzso
