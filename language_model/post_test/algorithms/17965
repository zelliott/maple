Because most zzso zzso zzso are zzso into zzso any decrease in zzso function increases the plasma levels of these zzso This study was designed to investigate the appropriate doses of zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso The total plasma concentration of zzso an active zzso of zzso was measured in 47 patients with chronic zzso failure or normal zzso zzso Fifteen patients on chronic zzso were also enrolled in this zzso In patients treated with zzso 25 and 50 zzso zzso the plasma concentration of zzso was zzso correlated with serum zzso and zzso clearance zzso There was an approximately zzso decrease of the plasma zzso concentration after 4 h of zzso Among patients treated with 25 or 50 zzso zzso for zzso years, the plasma concentration of zzso gradually increased along with an increase in serum zzso (from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Although the plasma concentration of zzso was higher in the 50 zzso group, the increase in serum zzso during this period was not different between the two zzso The plasma zzso concentration did not increase during this zzso These data suggest that zzso should be reduced from 50 to 25 and zzso zzso in patients with a serum zzso level of greater than 2-3 and 4-6 zzso respectively, in order to maintain a plasma level equivalent to that in subjects with normal zzso function receiving 50 zzso zzso For patients on chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso is the appropriate zzso
