We detail the limitations of the current paradigm of the sedation zzso - a tool ubiquitous to all sedation care settings and now a quarter century zzso zzso in this existing zzso are based on patient responsiveness to verbal and/or tactile zzso and the inherent zzso of this focus has both challenged the reliable assessment of adverse event risk and precluded clear zzso of sedation zzso zzso what is the dividing line between moderate and deep zzso We present the rationale to support a broadening of this sedation zzso zzso to include an objective mechanism to predict the ongoing risk of serious adverse events, and then propose sequential steps for the development of such a restructured zzso This process, while ambitious, would yield a clear and consistent language to facilitate quality zzso provide an objective framework for standardized zzso training and zzso and permit inclusion into computerized zzso zzso to facilitate more precise sedative zzso It is important to clearly delineate this goal now to permit design and initiation of the requisite zzso
