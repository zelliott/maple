To evaluate zzso and mechanism of a special form of automatic mode switching zzso failure in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso the charts of zzso patients implanted with dual chamber zzso with zzso zzso were zzso Seven patients zzso were identified that presented with sustained rapid zzso pacing resulting from zzso flutter with failure of automatic zzso Since this form of zzso failure implies zzso tracking of zzso zzso it was coined zzso zzso A theoretical timing model was developed to clarify the mechanism of this special form of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso phenomenon are: zzso the sum of the zzso delay and the post zzso zzso zzso must be longer than the cycle length of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso detection rate must be higher than half the zzso flutter rate and zzso the maximum tracking rate zzso must be higher than half the zzso flutter zzso zzso for programming in order to avoid this specific form of zzso failure are made accordingly and parallel zzso for flutter detection are zzso 

zzso zzso is a typical form of zzso failure in patients with zzso flutter and the mechanism is closely linked to the typical zzso sensing zzso
