A new zzso detection system zzso is zzso built with the intention of detecting ongoing cerebral zzso in patients at risk of transient zzso attacks or zzso It is based on the analysis of the zzso signal of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso estimates the intensity, duration and zzso dynamics of the audio zzso The zzso has a zzso neural network which zzso events into zzso signals zzso or zzso The decision-making component of the software has been validated against human zzso Data from patients in the zzso phase of carotid surgery were used for the validation zzso The results showed agreement in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Apart from a monitoring display, the monitoring system includes a zzso unit that allows the user to listen and to look at all data of individual zzso and zzso Moreover, the system allows the user to record, store and zzso all data zzso Data are stored using European Data zzso which allows data transportation over the zzso The zzso may have a potential in stroke risk stratification, evaluating the effect of novel zzso therapies, and in zzso and remote monitoring of carotid zzso
