This paper studies quantitative methods for evaluating the potential benefits of introducing new advanced tracking technologies in the pharmaceutical industry with special reference to radio frequency identification zzso zzso technology is an effective way for increasing the quality of the data that are used to generate production schedules, but there is a lack of scientific research to zzso the return on investment that can be achieved in zzso In this work, we distinguish two major sources of data zzso one is the inherent zzso of operations, which cannot be reduced by zzso and the other one is the data zzso error, which can be significantly reduced by zzso We focus on the marginal contribution of the latter quantity to the productivity of the packaging department of a pharmaceutical plant, propose a systematic method for assessing this impact and discuss its zzso in a practical test zzso Our results confirm that advanced tracking technologies in combination with effective scheduling procedures show a significant potential for improving zzso zzso to other production environments and their issues associated with scheduling problems are also zzso
