Today zzso zzso zzso zzso is available as a clinical tool in muscle zzso used for picking up objects, for standing and walking, for controlling zzso zzso and for zzso Despite substantial progress in development and new knowledge, many challenges remain to be resolved to provide a more efficient functionality of zzso zzso The most important task of these challenges is to improve control of the activated muscles through open loop or feedback zzso Command and feedback signals can be extracted from zzso recorded from muscles zzso zzso nerves zzso zzso and the brain zzso zzso or individual zzso This paper reviews work in which zzso zzso and zzso signals in humans have been used as command and feedback signals in systems using electrical stimulation of motor nerves to restore movements after an injury to the Central zzso System zzso It is concluded that the technology is ready to push for more substantial clinical zzso investigations in applying muscle and nerve zzso zzso interface systems hold great zzso but require further development of faster and clinically more acceptable zzso
