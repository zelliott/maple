zzso zzso zzso is an emerging technique that has a great potential for zzso zzso zzso To date, most zzso zzso systems require multiple laser shots to generate one zzso image, yielding a frame rate of zzso Because a mouse zzso at up to 3 zzso without proper gating mechanisms, acquired images are susceptible to motion zzso Here, we zzso for the first time to our knowledge, retrospective respiratory gating for zzso zzso zzso zzso This new method involves simultaneous capturing of the zzso respiratory zzso during zzso data zzso The recorded zzso signals are sorted and clustered according to the respiratory phase, and an image of the animal at each respiratory phase is reconstructed subsequently from the corresponding zzso The new method was tested in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system with a zzso frame rate of zzso zzso After respiratory zzso we observed sharper vascular and anatomical images at different positions of the animal zzso The entire breathing cycle can also be zzso at zzso
