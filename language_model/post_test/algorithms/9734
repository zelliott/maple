To compare the results of drug safety data mining with three different zzso when adverse events are identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High Level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For a representative set of 26 drugs, data from the zzso zzso Event Reporting System zzso database from 2001 through 2005 was zzso for signals of disproportionate reporting zzso using three different data mining zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso reporting rate zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using a previously described zzso Event Database zzso which contains documented zzso associations for the 26 zzso Analysis emphasized the percentage of zzso in the zzso zzso category, corresponding to those adverse events that were not described in the zzso prescribing information for the drug at the time of its approval, but which were supported by some published evidence for an association with the zzso 

Based on a zzso zzso analysis, the percentage of zzso supported zzso was smallest at the zzso level, intermediate at the zzso level, and largest at the zzso level, for all three zzso The zzso and zzso methods detected comparable percentages of zzso supported zzso while the zzso method detected a smaller percentage, at all three zzso zzso No evidence of a zzso interaction was zzso 

Use of zzso and zzso groupings can improve the percentage of zzso supported zzso in data mining zzso The zzso for this gain is the medically zzso language of zzso and zzso compared to zzso and the need for the added step in data mining of examining the component zzso of each zzso or zzso that results in a signal of disproportionate zzso
