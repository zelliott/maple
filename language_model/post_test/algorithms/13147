A relevant problem in drug design is the comparison and recognition of protein binding zzso zzso sites recognition is generally based on geometry often combined with zzso properties of the site since the zzso size and chemical composition of the protein surface are all relevant for the interaction with a specific zzso Several matching strategies have been designed for the recognition of zzso binding sites and of zzso zzso but the problem cannot be considered zzso 

In this paper we propose a new method for local structural alignment of protein surfaces based on continuous global zzso zzso Given the three-dimensional structures of two zzso the method finds the zzso transformation zzso plus zzso that best zzso active regions of two zzso We draw our inspiration from the well-known zzso zzso Point zzso method for three-dimensional zzso shapes zzso Our main contribution is in the adoption of a controlled random search as a more efficient global zzso approach along with a new zzso zzso The reported zzso experience and comparison show viability of the proposed zzso 

Our method performs well to detect similarity in binding sites when this in fact zzso In the future we plan to do a more comprehensive evaluation of the method by considering large zzso of zzso proteins and applying a zzso technique to the results of all comparisons to zzso binding zzso
