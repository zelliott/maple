A new zzso field zzso zzso imaging technique to zzso position in the phase of every echo generated by a zzso sequence in the presence of a strongly zzso zzso magnetic field is zzso It was applied to improve the sensitivity in an imaging experiment by adding the echo train acquired during the zzso sequence and to zzso resolve relaxation times of zzso specimens using zzso zzso The sequence was implemented in a new zzso zzso equipped with a zzso zzso system to apply a zzso magnetic field with a constant zzso along one spatial zzso An important reduction by a factor larger than two orders of magnitude in the acquisition time was obtained compared to the previously published zzso imaging zzso
