In chronic zzso C zzso infection, a liver biopsy provides important information that guides treatment decisions, but is zzso expensive and associated with possible zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins may be useful zzso markers of zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of these markers in zzso patients, develop a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso fibrosis, and validate the model in external zzso 

A combination of zzso markers were initially evaluated and zzso in zzso zzso patients from a single center, and validated in an external cohort of 402 zzso 

zzso acid, zzso and zzso were selected as having the best zzso accuracy for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At an index zzso zzso and prevalence for zzso of zzso results in all zzso patients indicated positive and negative zzso values of zzso and zzso with an accuracy of zzso 

The zzso panel may reliably differentiate zzso patients with zzso zzso from those with zzso fibrosis, although accurate zzso between stages was not zzso Prospective studies are required to determine the potential utility of the marker panel in guiding treatment decisions and following disease zzso
