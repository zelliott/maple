zzso are long zzso segments homogeneous in zzso Here, we describe an zzso zzso running on the web zzso able to predict zzso at the sequence zzso We move a sliding zzso from left to right along the DNA zzso At each position of the zzso we zzso the mean zzso values to the left and to the right of the zzso We then determine the position of the zzso for which the difference between left and right mean values (as measured by the zzso reaches its zzso Next, we determine the statistical significance of this potential cutting point, after filtering out zzso zzso below 3 zzso by applying a zzso zzso Finally, the program checks whether this significance exceeds a probability zzso If so, the sequence is cut at this point into two zzso otherwise, the sequence remains zzso The procedure continues zzso for each of the two resulting zzso created by each zzso This leads to the decomposition of a zzso sequence into long homogeneous zzso regions zzso with zzso mean zzso zzso each significantly different from the zzso contents of the adjacent zzso Most zzso can be identified with zzso zzso given their correlation with biological features such as gene density, zzso and LINE zzso long zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso rate or single zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso maps are available at our web site zzso and also at the zzso Genome zzso zzso
