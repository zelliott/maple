We simulate and measure light scattering of a zzso zzso particle suspended in solution close to a glass zzso The model, based on the discrete sources method, is developed to describe the experimental situation of total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso the particle is illuminated by an zzso light field originating from the zzso zzso In contrast to the well-established assumption of a simple exponential zzso of the scattering intensity with distance, we demonstrate significant zzso for a certain range of penetration depths and polarization states of the incident zzso
