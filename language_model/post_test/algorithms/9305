zzso technologies have been used to detect zzso copy number changes zzso in the human zzso Recent studies identified numerous copy number zzso zzso and some are common zzso that may contribute to disease zzso We developed, and zzso zzso a novel zzso framework zzso for detecting regions of copy number variation from zzso zzso zzso data using an zzso zzso zzso Model zzso zzso zzso measures are used to set certain zzso in the zzso using a novel zzso framework to zzso the model to a fixed Type I zzso zzso error zzso Other parameters are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of known zzso zzso provides zzso zzso of state zzso and significantly improves the accuracy of zzso zzso identification and zzso relative to existing zzso tools zzso zzso as demonstrated by validation of zzso zzso zzso identified both novel and validated zzso zzso was developed using zzso zzso data but it can be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the zzso framework has widespread zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a novel zzso for high-resolution zzso detection with application to clinical zzso cancer and disease association zzso
