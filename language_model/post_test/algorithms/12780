zzso of zzso biomass to sugar release is a central issue in the production of zzso as an economically viable energy zzso Among all contributing factors, variations in zzso content and its zzso zzso composition have been directly linked with the yield of zzso zzso While recent advances in zzso and zzso profiling have significantly broadened our understanding of zzso zzso its regulation at the zzso level is yet poorly zzso During the past decade, zzso and mathematical methods of systems biology have become effective tools for deciphering the structure and regulation of complex zzso zzso As increasing amounts of data from various organizational levels are being published, the application of these methods to studying zzso zzso appears to be very beneficial for the future development of genetically engineered crops with reduced zzso Here, we use techniques from flux balance analysis and zzso dynamic modeling to construct a mathematical model of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Various types of experimental data from the literature are used to identify the statistically most significant parameters and to estimate their values through an ensemble zzso The thus generated ensemble of models yields results that are zzso consistent with several transgenic experiments, including two experiments not used in the model zzso Additional model results not only reveal probable zzso zzso at steps leading to the synthesis of zzso alcohol, but also suggest that the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso might not be affected by genetic zzso prior to the reactions involving zzso This latter model prediction is directly supported by data from transgenic zzso Finally, we demonstrate the zzso of the model in zzso engineering, where the zzso is to be zzso toward a higher yield of zzso through modification of the relative amounts of the two major zzso The results generated by our preliminary model of in zzso zzso zzso are encouraging and demonstrate that mathematical modeling is poised to become an effective and zzso complement to traditional zzso and transgenic approaches, not just in zzso but also in zzso
