zzso related genes zzso probably due to the strong selection pressure in zzso Thus we expect that they are present in multiple zzso Physical proximity among zzso known as gene team, is a very useful concept to discover functionally related genes in multiple zzso However, there are also many gene sets that do not preserve physical zzso In this paper, we generalized the gene team model, that looks for gene clusters in a physically clustered form, to multiple zzso cases with relaxed zzso We propose a novel hybrid pattern model that combines the set and the sequential pattern zzso Our model searches for gene clusters with and/or without physical proximity zzso This model is implemented and tested with 97 zzso zzso zzso The result was analyzed to show the usefulness of our zzso zzso analysis of gene clusters that belong to zzso zzso and zzso coli demonstrated that our model predicted many zzso verified zzso and functionally related zzso Our program is fast enough to provide a zzso on the web at zzso zzso Users can select any combination of 97 zzso to predict gene zzso
