zzso cell lung cancer zzso accounts for zzso of all cases of lung cancer and zzso zzso is very common in zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso probably leading to zzso resistance in tumors, is emerging as a novel zzso zzso However, the precise zzso mechanisms underlying the role of zzso in zzso zzso are still largely zzso In the present study, we performed the zzso method to zzso zzso expression zzso of two chosen zzso that are located in the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We selected seven tagging zzso zzso of zzso to assess the relationship between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in zzso of zzso zzso One tagging zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso region was found to be significantly associated with zzso zzso in zzso tumors zzso A zzso AT zzso reconstructed with zzso zzso and zzso in linkage zzso with each other, was strongly associated with zzso cases displaying zzso zzso In conclusion, our results shed light on the high frequency of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors, which is associated with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although this suggests an important role of the zzso locus in the zzso of zzso additional studies at the zzso level and in various ethnic populations are zzso
