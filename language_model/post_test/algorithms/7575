The study introduces a concept of zzso realized in presence of information zzso and offers a design framework supporting the formation of such zzso Information zzso are zzso meaningful entities formed on a basis of a large number of experimental zzso zzso data available for the construction of the zzso We develop a zzso and zzso sound way of forming information zzso Considering the directional nature of the mapping to be formed, this zzso aspect needs to be taken into account when developing information zzso The property of zzso implies that while the information zzso in the input space could be constructed with a great deal of flexibility, the information zzso formed in the output space have to inherently relate to those built in the input zzso The input space is zzso by running a zzso zzso for illustrative purposes, the focus here is on fuzzy zzso realized with the aid of the fuzzy zzso zzso The information zzso in the output space are constructed with the aid of the principle of justifiable zzso zzso one of the underlying fundamental conceptual pursuits of zzso zzso The construct exhibits two important zzso First, the constructed information zzso are formed in the presence of information zzso already constructed in the input space (and this realization is reflective of the direction of the mapping from the input to the output zzso Second, the principle of justifiable zzso does not zzso the realization of information zzso to a single zzso such as fuzzy sets but helps form the zzso expressed any required zzso of information zzso The quality of the zzso mapping zzso the mapping realized for the information zzso formed in the input and output zzso is expressed in terms of the coverage criterion zzso how well the experimental data are zzso by information zzso produced by the zzso mapping for any input experimental zzso Some zzso studies are reported by zzso the performance of the zzso mapping zzso in terms of the coverage and specificity zzso versus the values of a certain parameters zzso in the construction of output information zzso through the principle of justifiable zzso The plots of zzso dependency help determine a knee point and reach a sound compromise between these two conflicting requirements imposed on the quality of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is the quality of the mapping with regard to the number of information zzso zzso a certain zzso of the zzso A series of experiments is reported as zzso
