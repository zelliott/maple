The zzso components in the zzso complex were examined before and during the zzso of the left anterior descending coronary zzso zzso zzso from different stages of the zzso state were averaged using zzso technique and fast zzso transform zzso The average zzso were the filtered with zzso digital filters zzso zzso to obtain the zzso zzso zzso We tested our zzso digital filter for ringing and the trigger jitter during the averaging zzso We demonstrated that the zzso signal left after filtering is the result of a subtle zzso constituent of the zzso complex and that the zzso change during zzso (as zone of reduced zzso is a result of changes in these components of the original zzso zzso
