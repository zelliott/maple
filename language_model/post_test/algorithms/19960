This paper presents an zzso terminal sliding mode control zzso strategy for zzso buck zzso The idea behind this strategy is to use the terminal sliding mode control zzso approach to assure finite time convergence of the output zzso error to the equilibrium point and integrate an zzso law to the zzso strategy so as to achieve a dynamic sliding line during the load zzso In addition, the influence of the controller parameters on the performance of zzso system is zzso It is observed that the start up response of the output zzso becomes faster with increasing value of the fractional power used in the sliding zzso On the other hand, the transient response of the output zzso caused by the step change in the load, becomes faster with decreasing the value of the fractional zzso zzso the value of fractional power is to be chosen to make a compromise between start up and transient responses of the zzso Performance of the proposed zzso strategy has been tested through computer simulations and zzso The simulation results of the proposed zzso strategy are compared with the conventional zzso and zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso exhibits a considerable improvement in terms of a faster output zzso response during load zzso
