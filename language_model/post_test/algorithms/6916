Long zzso DNA molecules were separated in zzso zzso zzso in less than 1 zzso several orders of magnitude faster than by using conventional zzso DNA samples were first concentrated at the entrance to the array in a thin band by zzso zzso They were then separated by zzso field zzso T4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be resolved into two clearly separated bands in approximately 10 s in these zzso This zzso to a mass resolution of zzso in 11 zzso in a zzso zzso
