zzso zzso effects for the reaction zzso of zzso can be evaluated on the basis of published Henry's law zzso for nitrogen dioxide in various zzso zzso zzso partition zzso were derived from Henry's law zzso and used to assess the tendencies of zzso toward fleeing the zzso environments and concentrating in biological zzso zzso It is concluded, based only on the estimated zzso zzso membrane partition zzso for zzso that such tendencies will be relatively small, and that they may account for an acceleration of chemical reactions in biological zzso media with reaction zzso that are first order on zzso by a factor of approximately zzso Thus, kinetic effects due to mass action will be relatively small but it is also important to recognize that because zzso will tend to zzso in cell zzso reactions with cell membrane components will not be hindered by lack of physical zzso at these zzso In comparison to other zzso nitrogen dioxide is less zzso than zzso zzso and zzso
