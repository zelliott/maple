A new zzso index for neural activity is defined in this zzso The method is able to measure zzso dynamics in low firing rate zzso It is based on the zzso of the time intervals between nearest spikes of two given spike zzso zzso additive models are proposed for the zzso profiles obtained by this zzso Two hypothesis tests are proposed to assess for differences in the level of synchronization in a real data zzso zzso methods are used to zzso the distribution of the zzso Also, the expected zzso due to chance is zzso zzso and by simulation to assess for actual zzso
