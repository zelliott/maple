Although zzso zzso zzso can be employed to achieve a high sensitivity of the surface zzso resonance zzso zzso the zzso interpretation zzso the resulting sensitivity improvement remains zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the effects of the zzso geometric parameters on the amplification of zzso responses and to understand the physical mechanisms associated with the zzso Our zzso results show that the proposed zzso zzso with a zzso grating can provide a better sensitivity due to the combined effects of surface reaction area and field distribution at the binding zzso An influence of zzso layer on the sensor performance is also zzso The obtained results will be promising in zzso zzso zzso zzso
