zzso approximations are constructed for the model equations describing the population zzso of human tumor cells in zzso and their responses to zzso or zzso These approximations are more efficient than zzso zzso The spectral accuracy of the zzso method allows us to resolve the model with a much smaller number of spatial zzso than required for the zzso method to achieve comparable zzso This is demonstrated by zzso experiments which show a good agreement between predicted and experimental zzso
