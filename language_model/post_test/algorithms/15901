We assessed whether the American College of zzso Heart Association zzso task force guidelines for zzso cardiac evaluation could reliably zzso cardiac risk before zzso zzso 

We zzso applied the guidelines to a closed database, set up zzso The setting was a referral center in an institutional practice with hospitalized zzso The closed database included 133 patients who had a routine cardiac examination, which comprised an zzso of functional capacity and zzso testing, before zzso zzso This cardiac evaluation led to the proposal of zzso in 23 patients and to treating an underlying coronary artery disease in 21 patients (including three zzso zzso One patient died after zzso zzso and two patients died of cardiac causes after zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso guidelines was applied independently by two investigators to each patient's file that was included in the existing zzso The main outcome measure was a comparison between cardiac risk zzso with the zzso guidelines and the results of the routine cardiac zzso 

The zzso guidelines were successfully applied to all 133 files by the two zzso After applying the algorithm, 73 patients were zzso as low cardiac risk, and 60 patients were zzso as high zzso The 21 patients who had undergone a zzso coronary artery disease zzso were zzso as high risk by means of the zzso zzso The patients who died from cardiac causes were zzso as high risk by means of the zzso guidelines, whereas none of the patients zzso as low risk died during zzso 

The zzso guidelines were effective in zzso cardiac risk by using clinical zzso and an estimate of the physical capacity of the zzso Their use may allow a reduction in unnecessary zzso testing in patients zzso as being at low risk, while permitting the selection of all patients likely to benefit from zzso coronary artery disease zzso
