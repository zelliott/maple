Comparing and zzso the three-dimensional zzso structures of proteins is of crucial importance to molecular biology, from helping to determine the function of a protein to determining its evolutionary zzso Traditionally, zzso structures are classified into groups of families that closely resemble the grouping according to their primary zzso However, significant structural similarities exist at multiple levels between proteins that belong to these different structural zzso In this study, we propose a new algorithm, zzso to capture such zzso The method zzso zzso a pair of protein structures independent of zzso zzso acid zzso are represented by the Cartesian coordinates of a representative point (usually the zzso zzso side chain zzso accessibility, and secondary zzso zzso comparison is zzso by matching zzso of zzso zzso was extensively zzso for alignment accuracy on four different zzso zzso zzso zzso alignments between two structures with the same zzso zzso 64 alignments from set zzso that were considered to constitute difficult alignment zzso zzso 199 zzso alignments between proteins with similar structure but different zzso and zzso zzso zzso alignments of zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso alignments was measured by the average structure overlap score and compared with other alignment methods, including zzso zzso Geometric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ARTS and zzso On average, zzso produces zzso alignments that are either comparable or statistically significantly more accurate than all of these other zzso We have used zzso to uncover relationships between zzso unrelated zzso These new biological insights include: zzso detecting hinge regions in proteins where domain or zzso show zzso zzso discovering similar small zzso binding sites from proteins of different folds and zzso discovering zzso zzso of known zzso zzso Our method can generally be applied to compare any pair of molecular structures represented in Cartesian coordinates as exemplified by the zzso structure zzso zzso
