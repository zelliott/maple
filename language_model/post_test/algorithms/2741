The purpose of this paper was to compare manual and automated analysis for the zzso of carotid wall obtained with zzso by using the zzso zzso as validation zzso 

21 consecutive patients underwent zzso and ultrasound analysis of carotid arteries zzso age 68 years; age range zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the 42 zzso was measured with novel and dedicated automated software analysis (called zzso zzso Technologies, Denver, zzso zzso and by four observers that manually calculated the zzso The carotid artery wall thickness zzso was also zzso in the CT zzso zzso statistics was employed to measure the agreement between zzso A zzso zzso was used to test the differences between the zzso values of zzso The study obtained the zzso zzso 

The correlation between automated zzso zzso and those of the human experts were equal to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of variation of the human experts was equal to zzso By using a zzso zzso the differences between the zzso values of zzso and those of the human experts were not found statistically significant zzso zzso On comparing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the results suggested a very good zzso of zzso 

Data of this preliminary study indicate that automated software zzso can analyze with precision the zzso of carotid arteries and that the zzso with CT is zzso
