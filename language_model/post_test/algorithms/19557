In zzso zzso external zzso treatment planning systems zzso are used to calculate the dose to the target volume and the dose distribution around zzso zzso used zzso include zzso based on zzso in water and often fail in the estimate of dose in the presence of zzso In this study zzso detectors were used to study the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso such as the lung for 6 and 18 zzso zzso beams at different field zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso calculations and zzso Carlo simulations performed with the zzso zzso zzso In a phantom with lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso simulations agreed, with an average zzso inside the lung of zzso In contrast, zzso results overestimated the dose inside the zzso with a maximum zzso of zzso for the 18 zzso zzso beam and a field size of 2 zzso 2 zzso
