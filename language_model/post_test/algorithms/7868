Recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the wartime effect of traumatic brain injury zzso The reason for the prominence of zzso in these particular conflicts as opposed to others is unclear but may result from the increased zzso of blast due to improvements in body zzso In the military context blunt, ballistic and blast effects may all contribute to zzso injury, however blast in particular, has been suggested as a primary cause of military zzso While blast effects on some biological zzso such as the zzso are documented in terms of injury zzso this is not the case for the zzso We hypothesized that using zzso models, allowing for zzso interaction and basic material properties available in the literature, a blast wave would interact with zzso tissue and cause a possible zzso zzso 

The modeling approach employed for this investigation consisted of a zzso framework suitable for simulating coupled zzso dynamic zzso The model included a complex finite element mesh of the head and zzso zzso The effects of threshold and 50% lethal blast lung injury were compared with zzso impact injury using the full head model allowing upper and lower bounds of tissue injury to be applied using pulmonary injury as the reference zzso 

The effects of a 50% lethal dose blast lung injury zzso were comparable with zzso impact injury using the zzso full head zzso 

zzso blast zzso effects were found to be similar between impact mild zzso and the blast field associated with zzso lung blast injury sustained without personal protective zzso With the ubiquitous use of personal protective equipment this suggests that blast zzso effects may more readily zzso in personnel due to enhanced zzso in the current zzso
