The objective of the present study is to include coating thickness zzso in the development of a drug release model using coated zzso zzso through the use of zzso zzso Drug release from zzso zzso was described using a zzso zzso zzso of a model drug zzso and zzso zzso were prepared using a modified batch method and coated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The deterministic model, validated using experimental drug release profiles for different coating thicknesses at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was in agreement with the experimental data with a maximum root mean square error zzso of zzso An arbitrary zzso approach was pursued to develop models of zzso zzso with zzso coating zzso The zzso Carlo method was used to simulate the effect of the level of coating zzso on the cumulative drug release zzso Considering the zzso of equal percentages of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso the cumulative release profile can vary by approximately zzso as a result of coating zzso The release profile obtained for a model of an arbitrary zzso with an actual zzso coating profile was in good agreement with the average release profile for the models of the theoretical randomly zzso zzso The developed mathematical model is a useful tool to evaluate and predict release profiles of zzso coated zzso zzso zzso
