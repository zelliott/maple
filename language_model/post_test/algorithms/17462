zzso zzso zzso of all possible 96 zzso compounds, zzso constituted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are predicted from their zzso zzso zzso using pattern recognition zzso and artificial neural networks zzso zzso In particular, by a zzso study it is demonstrated that zzso zzso predominantly govern the zzso of zzso Furthermore, by using ANN techniques, prediction models of zzso a and c are developed, which reproduce well the measured zzso zzso All the literature reported on 30 pure and 22 mixed zzso compounds are collected and used in the present zzso zzso of all possible 66 new zzso zzso they zzso are estimated by the developed ANN zzso These proposed new zzso may be of interest to biomedical research especially in the design of new zzso zzso for bone zzso zzso these techniques may also be applied in the study of interface growth behaviors involving other zzso
