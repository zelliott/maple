zzso coli zzso zzso zzso are characterized by an zzso structure having a zzso zzso followed by a series of zzso zzso but they can be only partially predicted by the stability of this structure or by its primary zzso A large number of such zzso have been identified or proposed in the literature, and we have constituted a list of them zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso in order to analyze statistically the corresponding zzso zzso We show that the size of the zzso presents a narrow distribution, that their sequences are not random, and that most zzso are closed by a zzso zzso In particular, zzso of the zzso are zzso and the most abundant loop sequences are zzso and zzso These zzso are abundant in zzso and zzso zzso and are known to enhance the stability of zzso zzso We propose that these zzso play an important role in the nucleation of the nascent zzso structures, as does also the presence of a zzso zzso closing a hairpin zzso This analysis allows us to propose a model of formation of an zzso hairpin during the termination process and to construct an zzso of prediction of the zzso in a given DNA zzso For the zzso coli zzso it clearly zzso zzso from zzso zzso structures, and selects 141 of the 148 zzso zzso given in the literature, with a very low zzso It also predicts with reasonable accuracy the in zzso termination efficiency of known zzso zzso as well as predicting the existence of 35 as yet zzso zzso
