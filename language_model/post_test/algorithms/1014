To assess safety, zzso and disease control of zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso plus concurrent zzso zzso zzso and radiation therapy zzso with selective organ preservation in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso or high-risk zzso zzso associated zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer were entered into a protocol of zzso followed by concurrent zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso administered on Day zzso and zzso of zzso zzso dose zzso zzso total dose to the zzso zzso zzso Response was evaluated by restaging zzso 6 weeks zzso In case of invasive residual or zzso zzso salvage zzso was zzso Median follow-up was 35 months zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine patients zzso had no zzso tumor at restaging zzso 29 patients zzso have been continuously free of tumor in their zzso A superficial zzso occurred in 4 patients, a zzso zzso in 6 zzso zzso survival and survival with preserved zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, at 5 zzso Hematologic Grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in zzso Grade 3 zzso occurred in zzso Thirty-four patients zzso completed the protocol as scheduled or with only minor zzso One patient required salvage zzso because of a shrinking zzso 

This protocol of concurrent zzso and zzso has been associated with acceptable zzso The complete response rate of zzso and the zzso survival with intact zzso of zzso are encouraging and compare favorably with our historical control series using zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
