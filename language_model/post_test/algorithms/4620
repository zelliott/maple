The zzso transform is one of the most important transformations in image zzso A major component of this influence comes from the ability to implement it efficiently on a digital zzso This paper describes a new methodology to perform a fast zzso transform zzso This methodology emerges from considerations of the natural physical constraints imposed by image capture devices zzso The novel aspects of the specific zzso method described include: 1) a zzso reversal zzso operation of the conventional zzso is replaced by the use of zzso image rotation and zzso and 2) the usual zzso operations of complex zzso are replaced with zzso zzso The significance of the zzso presented in this paper is introduced by extending a discrete and finite image algebra, named zzso zzso Image zzso zzso to a continuous version, named zzso
