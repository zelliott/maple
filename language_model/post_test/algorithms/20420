It is shown that cell settling is a key factor affecting the performance of roller bottle zzso The two-dimensional zzso flow at the center of a roller bottle is simulated using a finite difference method, and the settling behavior of cells is simulated using particle dynamics zzso and validated zzso using fluorescent zzso The settling behavior of particles in the roller bottle flow is studied using both steady and time dependent rotation zzso Under steady flow conditions the flow is divided into two zzso one where the particles settle to the wall and one where the particles remain suspended zzso The relative size of these two regions depends on the ratio of the settling zzso to the rotation rate of the zzso For unsteady flows generated by periodic changes of the bottle rotation direction, the settling of cells is accelerated significantly, leading to complete deposition in just a few turns of the zzso
