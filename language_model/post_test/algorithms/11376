Deciphering the mechanisms involved in gene regulation holds the key to understanding the control of central biological zzso including human disease, population variation, and the evolution of zzso zzso New experimental techniques including whole zzso sequencing and zzso analysis have enabled comprehensive modeling approaches to study gene zzso In many cases, it is useful to be able to assign biological significance to the zzso model zzso but such interpretation should take into account features that affect these zzso including model construction and sensitivity, the type of fitness zzso and the effectiveness of zzso zzso This last point is often zzso as zzso methods are often selected for historical reasons or for zzso zzso Here, we compare the performance of two zzso zzso techniques broadly representative of local and global approaches, zzso a zzso zzso zzso method and a zzso zzso zzso strategy zzso zzso The zzso methods were applied to a set of zzso models of gene zzso applied to regulatory elements active in the zzso zzso zzso overall fit, the global zzso method performed significantly better than the local zzso method on high quality data sets, but this difference was negligible on lower quality data sets with increased noise or on data sets simplified by stringent zzso Our results suggest that the choice of zzso zzso technique for evaluation of gene expression models depends both on quality of data, the nature of the models zzso remains to be zzso and the aims of the modeling zzso
