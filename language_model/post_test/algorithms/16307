this study developed and tested zzso to identify outdoor walking trips from portable global positioning system zzso units in zzso zzso 

the study included a zzso and a validation zzso For the zzso phase, we determined the best zzso from 35 zzso of zzso zzso of agreement regarding the daily number and duration of zzso and zzso trips were zzso In the validation phase, the best zzso was applied to an additional and separate 136 zzso of diary and zzso zzso 

the preferred zzso in the zzso phase resulted in zzso of trips identified from the zzso data being found in the diary, whereas zzso of trips reported in the diary being found in the zzso zzso The preferred zzso used 1) a maximum zzso gap between points to define a trip, 2) at least 5 zzso or more of continuous zzso points, 3) a speed range between 2 and zzso zzso 4) at least 30 m of displacement between the start and end points of a trip, and 5) merged walking trips when the time gap between trips was less than 3 zzso With the validation data, substantial agreement between the zzso and the diary was zzso with zzso of trips identified from the zzso data found in the diary and zzso of trips reported in the diary found in the zzso zzso 

the zzso identified zzso walking trips of more than 5 zzso in zzso The ability to identify outdoor walking trips from zzso data can be improved by reducing recording intervals used in the zzso units and monitoring participant zzso Further research is desirable to determine whether concurrent wearing of an zzso may improve the ability to detect walking more zzso
