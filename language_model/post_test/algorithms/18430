The presently available scanning laser zzso zzso has a fixed zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso only in eyes with zzso that matches the population zzso A zzso variable zzso zzso zzso provides zzso of individual zzso zzso based on individual zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative ability of the zzso with the zzso and with the zzso to discriminate between normal and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso comparative case zzso 

zzso set consisting of 56 normal eyes and 55 zzso eyes and an independent data set consisting of 83 normal eyes and 56 zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso were obtained with the zzso with the zzso and the zzso from all zzso 

zzso of parameters on age, zzso ethnic origin, and eye side was zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate how well the various parameters could detect zzso zzso functions were generated, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve was zzso 

Discrimination between normal and zzso eyes on the basis of single parameters was significantly better with the zzso than with the zzso for 6 zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso superior maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso average thickness zzso zzso zzso superior average zzso zzso zzso and inferior average zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified the optimal combination of parameters for the zzso and for the zzso When the zzso functions were applied to the independent data set, areas under the zzso curve were zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso When the zzso functions were applied to a subset of patients with early visual field loss, areas under the zzso curve were zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso 

Individual correction for zzso zzso with the zzso significantly improved the ability of the zzso to distinguish between normal and zzso eyes and enabled detection of patients with early zzso
