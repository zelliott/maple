In this paper, periodic zzso in a zzso zzso spectrum are confirmed to be induced from interference zzso zzso we explained the periodic zzso and calculated the locations of zzso zzso a technique was suggested, with which the interference zzso in a zzso spectrum can be eliminated and therefore a real zzso zzso spectrum can be zzso zzso a sample, zzso was investigated and its zzso fingerprint was successfully extracted from its interference destruction zzso This technique is useful in getting zzso zzso fingerprint zzso and zzso provides a fast zzso testing method using a large size zzso beam to identify zzso
