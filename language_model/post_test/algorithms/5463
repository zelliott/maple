A muscle produces moments at the zzso it zzso but these moments can also cause zzso at zzso not crossed by the zzso This phenomenon, the acceleration of a joint caused by a muscle not crossing the joint, is referred to as induced zzso For a system of rigid bodies this study examines how system zzso and zzso zzso properties dictate the potential of one joint to cause the acceleration of other zzso in the zzso From the equations of motion for a series of rigid bodies, an induced acceleration index zzso was zzso The zzso permits zzso of the relative potential of moments produced at zzso in the zzso chain to accelerate other zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso is a function of system orientation, segment zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was used to examine the roles of the ankle and hip zzso in quiet zzso The ankle joint had over 12 times the ability to accelerate the hip joint, than the hip had to accelerate the ankle zzso These results in part explain the relative merits of the two strategies predominantly used to maintain upright zzso the ankle and hip zzso This index permits an understanding of how the induced zzso are dependent on system zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is also useful in situations where the zzso properties of the system under investigation changes, for example due to the fitting of a new zzso to a zzso zzso
