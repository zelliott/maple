Unlike evolution of genes and zzso evolution of regulatory systems is a relatively new area of zzso In particular, little systematic study has been done on evolution of DNA binding motifs in zzso factor zzso We suggest an zzso that reconstructs the most zzso scenario for changes in DNA binding motifs along an evolutionary tree of zzso factor binding zzso The zzso was validated on several artificial zzso and then applied to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso seems to be sufficiently robust to be zzso in realistic zzso In most zzso factor families the changes in binding motifs are limited to several zzso Changes in consensus zzso proceed via an intermediate stage when the respective position is not zzso
