To measure zzso pulse wave zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in volunteers and correlation with characteristics in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed in 12 volunteers (24 zzso 3 zzso and 86 acute stroke patients zzso zzso 9 zzso with zzso zzso zzso positioned 28 zzso 4 analysis planes along the entire zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and frame wise zzso zzso yielded zzso for each zzso Global zzso zzso was calculated from zzso and distances between the zzso portions of all available zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in volunteers zzso and zzso was low while zzso reliability zzso was zzso zzso in patients was significantly higher compared with volunteers zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among 17 patient characteristics considered, statistical analysis revealed significant zzso zzso zzso but low correlation of zzso with age zzso zzso zzso zzso valve zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulse pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling indicated that zzso valve zzso and elevated pulse pressure were significantly associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso allows for zzso zzso zzso with low observer dependence and moderate zzso zzso zzso in patients correlated with age, zzso valve zzso and pulse zzso
