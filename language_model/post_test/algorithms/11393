In this paper, a fast method for displaying a digital, real and zzso zzso zzso on a lower resolution device is zzso zzso the original resolution of the zzso upon display is one of the important attributes of the proposed zzso Our method can be divided into 3 zzso First, a digital zzso representing a given three zzso zzso object is zzso based on a fix, jitter zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso is zzso through zzso duplication, into a low resolution zzso that can be displayed with a zzso spatial light zzso zzso Third, the zzso is zzso with a grating which is generated based on the same jitter zzso lattice that samples the zzso The integration of the grating and the zzso zzso results in, to a good zzso the resolution of the original zzso As such, our proposed method enables digital zzso to be displayed with lower resolution zzso paving the way for the development of low-cost holographic video zzso
