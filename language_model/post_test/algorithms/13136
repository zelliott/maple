To demonstrate the feasibility and technical features of the zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso in zzso and zzso laser zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso zzso dimensions and channels used for zzso ring segment zzso were measured by means of an optical zzso zzso system in zzso zzso The increase in the zzso pressure zzso during zzso with the zzso interface was measured by means of an zzso zzso The possibility of creating a channel for gas diffusion within the zzso was investigated to minimize opaque bubble layer zzso 

The technical features, such as optical design, pulse energy, and scanning zzso at a high repetition rate, allow zzso for tissue cutting with a standard zzso of zzso zzso in depth and zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure increases up to 150 zzso during zzso The use of a gas channel zzso the creation of an opaque bubble layer during the zzso laser zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso laser provides a high zzso for cutting three-dimensional tissue zzso The zzso increase is comparable to other zzso and zzso zzso The minimized opaque bubble layers allow the surgeon to perform an zzso laser treatment immediately after zzso zzso zzso
