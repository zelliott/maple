The zzso zzso has been thought to represent the spatial environment as a cognitive zzso The zzso connections in the zzso imply that a neural entity represents the map as a geometrical network of zzso cells in terms of a zzso According to recent experimental zzso the cells fire successively relative to the zzso zzso of the local field potential, called zzso phase zzso when the animal is zzso This observation suggests the learning of zzso sequences with zzso connections in the zzso but it also gives rather inconsistent implications on the formation of the chart that should consist of zzso connections for space zzso In this study, we zzso that the chart is generated with zzso phase coding through the integration of zzso zzso Our computer experiments use a zzso network model to demonstrate that a geometrical network is formed through running experiences in a few zzso zzso connections are found to remain and distribute zzso in the zzso The obtained network exhibits the spatial zzso of activities at each instance as the chart does and their propagation that represents behavioral motions with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso phase zzso and the zzso rule with a time delay can provide the neural principles for learning the cognitive zzso
