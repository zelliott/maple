In this study, the optimal zzso material parameters of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso brain white matter were identified using a genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso The procedure was combined with zzso finite element analysis zzso of brain tissue and experimental stress relaxation tests on zzso specimens to find the optimal material zzso of zzso and zzso The stress relaxation tests were performed in tension on 10 zzso specimens at zzso strain zzso The zzso volume fraction in zzso was measured from the zzso zzso zzso images of the brain zzso A square periodic volume element was selected to represent the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso boundary conditions were applied on the square volume element to mimics the repetitive nature of the volume zzso Linear zzso material properties were assumed for the brain tissue constituents under small zzso The zzso behavior was expressed in terms of zzso zzso The zzso procedure searched for the optimal material parameters by fitting the zzso tissue stresses of brain tissue zzso to the stresses of relaxation tests under the same loading zzso The zzso procedure zzso after 60 zzso The initial elastic zzso of zzso was found to be zzso three times larger than that of zzso The long-term elastic zzso of zzso was zzso while for zzso this value was zzso The zzso correlation zzso between zzso estimated elastic zzso of zzso tissue using the optimal material properties and the experimental elastic zzso of zzso specimens was zzso showing a strong zzso The optimal material properties of brain tissue constituents can find applications in zzso analysis of brain tissue to gain insight into diffuse zzso zzso zzso
