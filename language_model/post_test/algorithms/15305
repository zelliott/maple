The objective of this work is to develop a robust method for human abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso zzso detection that can contribute to the accurate zzso of features for the prediction of AAA zzso zzso A semiautomatic zzso is proposed for detecting the zzso zzso in zzso abdominal zzso zzso images based on online zzso zzso which does not require prior image zzso The zzso was developed and applied to thirty zzso and thirty zzso AAA image data sets and the zzso of the detected zzso were measured to assess the correlation between AAA zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of each data set was segmented manually by a trained zzso and the resulting zzso of each data set were defined as the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of the zzso and to compare it against two widely used zzso zzso The average mean relative accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso with a standard zzso of zzso for the online zzso zzso it is zzso with a standard zzso of zzso zzso The online zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso while their zzso costs are zzso zzso zzso zzso from an accurately derived zzso zzso using online zzso is statistically higher for zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso indicating that zzso can be used to assess zzso risk in the vascular zzso
