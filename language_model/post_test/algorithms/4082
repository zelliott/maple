Quite often, zzso zzso zzso are contaminated by a series of artifacts that degrade the quality of the various source zzso methods applied to zzso In particular, eye zzso minor head movement and related activities are a constant source of measurement zzso In order to solve this problem, trial selection and rejection is applied, a task that is usually performed zzso 

The present work shows an automatic trial selection and rejection zzso based on zzso zzso These techniques employ a measurement of the zzso of the items belonging to a zzso This measure, based on the projection of the zzso corresponding to the largest zzso of the zzso zzso is provided and its rationale is zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the selected cluster are averaged and used in the well-known zzso zzso Minimum zzso zzso zzso 

The results show a marked improvement of the specificity of the zzso zzso compared to the application of the zzso without zzso 

The method shows a marked reduction in zzso cost compared with other data cleaning procedure widely zzso Independent zzso Analysis zzso 

Thus, we propose zzso techniques to be used in brain zzso activity zzso
