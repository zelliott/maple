zzso engineering gene networks and identifying regulatory interactions are integral to understanding cellular decision making zzso Advancement in high zzso experimental techniques has initiated innovative data driven analysis of gene regulatory zzso However, inherent noise associated with biological systems requires numerous experimental replicates for reliable zzso Furthermore, evidence of robust zzso directly exploiting basic biological traits are zzso Such zzso are expected to be efficient in their performance and robust in their zzso 

We have developed a network identification zzso to accurately zzso both the zzso and strength of regulatory interactions from time series gene expression data in the presence of significant experimental noise and zzso zzso In this novel zzso we have addressed data zzso in biological systems by zzso network identification with the zzso zzso technique, hence predicting robust interactions from limited experimental replicates subjected to zzso Furthermore, we have incorporated zzso in gene dynamics using the zzso zzso The basic network identification zzso exploits the trait of zzso of biological zzso zzso that, the identification zzso is formulated as an zzso problem by introducing zzso variables for each network zzso The objective function is targeted to minimize the network connections subjected to the constraint of zzso agreement between the experimental and predicted gene zzso The developed zzso is validated using both in zzso and experimental zzso These studies show that the zzso can accurately predict the zzso and connection strength of the in zzso networks, as zzso by high precision and recall, and small zzso between the actual and predicted kinetic zzso Furthermore, in both the in zzso and experimental case studies, the predicted gene expression profiles are in very close agreement with the dynamics of the input zzso 

Our zzso programming zzso effectively zzso zzso to identify robust gene regulatory networks from zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso With significant noise and zzso being inherent to biological systems, the present zzso with the incorporation of network zzso is extremely relevant to gene regulatory networks, and while the zzso has been validated against in zzso and zzso zzso data, it can be applied to any biological zzso
