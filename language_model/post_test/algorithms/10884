In some occupational health studies, observations occur in both exposed and zzso zzso If the levels of all exposed individuals have been zzso a zzso zzso zzso model is usually recommended, which assumes that the data has a probability mass at zero for zzso individuals and a continuous response for values greater than zero for exposed zzso However, many quantitative exposure zzso are subject to left zzso due to values falling below zzso detection zzso A zzso zzso mixture model is suggested in this situation since zzso zeros are not distinguishable from those exposed with values below detection zzso In the context of this mixture distribution, the information contributed by values falling below a fixed detection limit is used only to estimate the probability of zzso We consider sample size and statistical power calculation when comparing the median of exposed zzso to a regulatory zzso We calculate the required sample size for the data presented in a recent paper comparing the zzso zzso exposure data to a regulatory occupational exposure zzso A simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed sample size calculation zzso
