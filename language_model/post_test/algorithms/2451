zzso methods for zzso zzso zzso have the potential to reduce zzso zzso and to speed up its zzso In this study, we estimate the precision and accuracy of a zzso measurement for carotid artery zzso degree and identify and explain differences compared with the manual zzso 

In this retrospective study involving 90 patients, 2 observers determined the zzso degree twice, with both the zzso and the manual zzso zzso and zzso correlations were calculated for both zzso The accuracy was estimated by comparing average zzso with manual zzso The zzso zzso calculations were performed using either the minimal or zzso intersection at the reference zzso Individual cases with large differences in measurement were zzso inspected by 3 zzso 

zzso (R zzso zzso zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso correlations for the zzso method were excellent and exceeded the manual performance correlations (R zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated well with the manual zzso (R zzso zzso with high specificity of zzso and lower sensitivity of zzso Large differences were caused by zzso of the zzso method associated with zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the minimal diameter, zzso of zzso degree, and incorrect zzso The effect of using the minimal diameter at the reference position resulted in a small, but zzso zzso of the zzso degree by the zzso zzso 

The zzso method showed an excellent zzso and good correlation with manual zzso with a high specificity and lower sensitivity for detecting a significant zzso zzso semiautomatic zzso zzso were associated with the presence of zzso
