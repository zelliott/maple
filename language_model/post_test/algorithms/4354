zzso based zzso zzso modeling is a tool used in drug discovery and human health risk zzso zzso models are mathematical representations of the zzso physiology and zzso of an zzso and are used to predict a drug's zzso in various zzso zzso to plasma partition zzso zzso key zzso model zzso define the zzso concentration differential between tissue and plasma and are used to predict the volume of zzso The experimental determination of these parameters once limited the development of zzso zzso however, in zzso prediction methods were introduced to overcome this zzso The developed zzso vary in input parameters and prediction zzso and none are considered standard, zzso further zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso prediction method was developed using six previously published zzso The aim of the developed zzso was to identify the most accurate zzso zzso prediction zzso for a new zzso A zzso consisting of 122 drugs was used to train the zzso and identify the most accurate zzso prediction zzso for a certain zzso zzso Three versions of zzso zzso were developed and were dependent on the necessary zzso The use of the zzso resulted in a better prediction accuracy than that of any single zzso prediction zzso for all zzso the current mode of use in zzso model zzso Because built-in zzso equations for those input parameters are not necessarily available, this zzso prediction tool will provide zzso prediction when only limited input parameters are zzso The presented innovative method will improve tissue distribution prediction zzso thus enhancing the confidence in zzso modeling zzso
