This paper describes a scheme for implementing a zzso counter with chemical zzso The value of the counter is zzso by logical values of zzso and zzso that zzso to the absence and presence of specific molecular types, zzso It is zzso when molecules of a trigger type are zzso zzso is achieved with reactions that produce a sustained zzso zzso This zzso plays a role analogous to a clock signal in digital zzso zzso are transferred between molecular types in different zzso of the zzso Unlike all previous schemes for chemical computation, this scheme is dependent only on coarse rate categories for the reactions zzso and zzso Given such categories, the zzso is exact and independent of the specific reaction zzso Although conceptual for the time being, the methodology has potential applications in zzso of synthetic biology such as zzso sensing and drug zzso We are exploring zzso zzso via strand displacement as a possible experimental zzso
