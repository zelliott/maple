The suppression of zzso responses to a repeated event is a ubiquitous phenomenon in zzso However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely zzso The aim of this study was to examine the zzso evolution of zzso changes in connectivity induced by repeated zzso We recorded zzso zzso zzso during frequency changes of a repeating zzso zzso inversion of dynamic zzso models zzso of zzso revealed systematic zzso changes in both intrinsic and zzso connections, within a zzso cortical zzso zzso these changes occurred very quickly, over zzso intervals that zzso short-term synaptic zzso Furthermore, intrinsic zzso connections showed zzso changes that were much faster than changes in zzso zzso connections, which decreased zzso with zzso This study shows that auditory zzso learning is associated with zzso plasticity in the human zzso It is remarkable that distinct changes in intrinsic and zzso connections could be zzso so reliably and zzso using zzso
