zzso sleep is characterized by different zzso phenomena, such as zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso that are associated to characteristic patterns in the heart rate zzso zzso zzso zzso of such rhythms due to sleep disorders, for example zzso or zzso syndrome, alters the normal sleep patterns and the dynamics of the zzso recorded during the zzso 

In this paper we analyze long-term and complexity dynamics of the zzso signal recorded during sleep in different groups of zzso The aim is to investigate whether the calculated zzso are able to capture the different characteristics and to discriminate among the groups of subjects, classified according sleep disorders or cardiovascular zzso 

zzso able to detect the zzso behavior of a signal and to measure the zzso and complexity of a time series, are calculated on the zzso signal acquired during the zzso Different groups of subjects were zzso healthy subjects with high sleep efficiency, healthy subjects with low sleep efficiency, subjects affected by insomnia, heart failure patients, subjects affected by zzso sleep zzso 

The evaluated parameters show significant differences in the groups of subjects considered in this zzso In particular heart failure patients have significant lower zzso and complexity values, whereas zzso patients show an increased zzso when compared with normal subjects with high sleep zzso 

This work proposes zzso that can be used as global zzso of the dynamics of the whole night and can discriminate among different groups of zzso
