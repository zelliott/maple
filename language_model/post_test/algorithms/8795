This letter proposes a degradation and zzso model to estimate speech quality impairment because of packet loss zzso zzso zzso implemented in the speech zzso zzso By considering the fact that the quality degradation caused by packet loss is highly related to the zzso algorithm, the impact of quality degradation on various types of previous and lost packet classes is zzso Then, the zzso effects to the proposed class types are measured by the class conditional expectation of the degradation zzso Finally, the zzso module is derived to estimate the total quality degradation in a mean opinion score zzso zzso When assessed for correlation with subject test results, the correlation zzso of the zzso class model is zzso and that of the zzso model is zzso
