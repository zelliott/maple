In this paper, we present experimental and zzso analysis on Extraordinary zzso zzso zzso or optical resonance transmission through various zzso zzso constructed from an zzso thick metal film within the visible and near zzso zzso zzso zzso with different geometrical parameters zzso size, hole shape, and hole zzso having their zzso properties in the visible and zzso regime were simulated based on zzso zzso Time zzso zzso Large zzso zzso with geometric properties similar to the simulated zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The optical resonance transmission properties zzso position, transmission efficiency, and spectral bandwidth of resonance zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Finally, the experimental and zzso results were analyzed to determine the zzso and discrepancies between optical resonance transmission properties for various zzso zzso
