Unlike the field of tutorial systems, where a real-life student interacts and learns from a software system, our research focuses on a new philosophy in which no entity needs to be a real-life zzso Such systems are termed as zzso systems, and research in this field endeavors to model every component of the system using an appropriate learning model zzso our case, a learning zzso zzso While models for the student, the domain, the teacher, zzso have been presented elsewhere, the aim of this paper is to present a new approach to model how the teacher, in this zzso of our zzso system zzso and improves his zzso zzso while being himself an integral component of the zzso We propose to model the zzso zzso of the teacher by using a higher level zzso referred to as the zzso whose task is to assist the teacher zzso Ultimately, the intention is that the latter can communicate the teaching material to the zzso in a manner customized to the particular student's ability and zzso In short, the teacher will zzso the progress of the student and initiate a strategy by which he can zzso the material to each individual zzso The results that we present in a simulated environment validate the model for the teacher and for the zzso The use of the latter can be seen to significantly improve the teaching abilities of the zzso
