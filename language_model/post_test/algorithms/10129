Studies of the accuracy of medical tests to diagnose the presence or absence of disease can suffer from an inability to verify the true disease state in zzso When zzso is missing at random zzso the missing data mechanism can be ignored in zzso zzso However, this assumption may not hold even zzso When zzso is zzso missing, the most general model of the distribution of disease state, test result, and zzso indicator is zzso zzso are only partially identified, creating regions of ignorance for maximum likelihood zzso For studies of a single test, we use zzso analysis to implement the most general zzso model, a reduced zzso model with identifiable zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Gibbs sampling zzso are derived that enable zzso of the zzso distribution of test accuracy zzso In particular, the zzso distribution is easily obtained for the most general zzso model, which makes relatively weak assumptions about the missing data zzso For this model, the zzso distribution combines two sources of zzso ignorance in the zzso of partially identified zzso and zzso due to finite sampling zzso We compare the three models on data from a study of the accuracy of zzso to diagnose liver zzso
