With the aim of getting understandable symbolic rules to explain a given phenomenon, we split the task of learning these rules from sensory data in two zzso a zzso zzso maps features into zzso variables and a set of subsequent layers operated by a zzso zzso learns zzso expressions on these zzso The special features of this procedure are that: zzso the neural network is trained to produce a zzso output having the principal task of discriminating between classes of zzso zzso the symbolic part is directed to zzso rules within a family that is not known a zzso zzso the welding point between the two learning systems is represented by a feedback based on a suitability evaluation of the zzso zzso The procedure we propose is based on a zzso learning paradigm set up recently in some papers in the fields of theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and cognitive zzso The present article focuses on information management aspects of the zzso We deal with the lack of prior information about the rules through learning strategies that affect both the meaning of the variables and the description length of the rules into which they zzso The paper uses the task of learning to formally discriminate among several emotional states as both a working example and a test bench for a comparison with previous symbolic and zzso methods in the zzso
