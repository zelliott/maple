The zzso zzso point zzso is an important landmark for interpreting zzso pressure topography zzso zzso Previous analysis in normal subjects confirmed that the zzso could be localized using an zzso that found the time during zzso at which a zzso length of the zzso esophagus was contracting zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to test the zzso method for zzso zzso in patients with abnormal zzso 

zzso zzso studies of 75 patients with normal and zzso zzso were zzso Two experts, zzso and zzso used the original zzso method to score zzso coordinates for the first two swallows of each zzso Alternative computerized zzso tested against the expert were: zzso the zzso method, zzso & zzso the intercept between the leading edge of the zzso zzso zzso and a line zzso zzso (or zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso junction zzso at rest, or zzso the zzso zzso method, which added the stipulation that the zzso be within 3 zzso of the zzso 

All tested zzso were highly correlated with the zzso However, the zzso zzso method was better in the sense that it eliminated zzso zzso s zzso with the zzso that occurred with the other methods usually attributable to weak zzso zzso 

zzso automated zzso zzso was achieved in both normal and a spectrum of abnormal zzso using the zzso method with the added stipulation that the zzso be restricted to within the zzso 3 zzso of the zzso at zzso
