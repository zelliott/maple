The study presented evaluated the first clinical use of a new zzso zzso measuring zzso pressure zzso partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen zzso and brain temperature zzso zzso zzso To assess the zzso of measured zzso a second probe, which represents the current golden standard of zzso zzso was implanted zzso zzso 

Thirty patients with indicated invasive measurement of zzso under intensive care unit conditions were zzso Using a double zzso zzso zzso was measured simultaneously with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tests on both zzso were conducted independently by the manufacturer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The average of individual mean zzso zzso showed no relevant differences between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso probe zzso zzso zzso zzso out of 30 showed proper functioning over the desired monitoring zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a higher zzso error frequency (2 device zzso 11 handling zzso A comparison of the zzso data between the zzso and zzso systems according to zzso and Altman was possible in 18 out of 30 patients and showed acceptable results zzso difference zzso zzso zzso limits of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso of zzso recordings was within the calculated limits of zzso zzso zzso tests of the zzso after zzso revealed stable zzso and zzso function of the zzso zzso Precision of zzso zzso did not differ between the zzso whereas precision of the 150 zzso zzso zzso was greater in the zzso zzso 

Combining 3 different zzso functions in 1 probe might ease monitoring by making a second zzso probe zzso zzso of our data is limited by several factors: zzso zzso study; zzso reduced mechanical probe stability, handling difficulties with the double zzso zzso zzso design changes to improve mechanical stability will require further study; zzso conflict of interest with zzso because of its support for the zzso The conclusion drawn from our study is that the new zzso probe evaluated does measure zzso zzso and zzso But all the initial data given in this paper have to be interpreted zzso A new study will be necessary when the mechanical stability of the new probe has been zzso
