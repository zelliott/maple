The treatment of acquired zzso is characteristically zzso expensive and thus a cost-benefit analysis of the several available treatment strategies is urgently zzso To address this issue, zzso techniques were used to construct a zzso model to compare the cost of treatment with zzso factor VIII zzso human zzso zzso or an activated zzso complex concentrate zzso This model was based upon the results of a comprehensive literature search of all relevant clinical studies and case zzso To supplement these data, a panel of zzso specialists was presented with a clinical scenario describing an acquired zzso patient with an acute zzso in whom the human and zzso inhibitor zzso were initially zzso Based on this scenario and on their own clinical experience, the expert panel assessed the zzso of the model as initially constructed, assigned probabilities of success to each treatment and recommended appropriate initial dosing and follow-up zzso This information was incorporated into the model and a simulation was conducted from which the costs of care were zzso zzso analyses were then conducted on all zzso The results of the model show that treatment initiated with zzso would be more cost effective compared with treatment sequences initiated with an zzso or zzso zzso The model indicates that initial treatment with zzso in this scenario may be the preferred strategy zzso as well as on economic zzso
