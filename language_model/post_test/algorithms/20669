The underlying assumption for most zzso techniques is that the reduced models must be valid for the entire composition zzso This is a harsh requirement that often limits the models that are zzso The scheme that is presented here uses the inherent structure of reaction systems to divide the composition space into zzso Within each region, the zzso relationships that exist between terms in the rate equations are used to systematically reduce the order and zzso of the zzso The full system is then described through zzso combination of these zzso zzso zzso Although these reduced models are based on assumptions that make them invalid globally, they are accurate within the regions for which they have been zzso
