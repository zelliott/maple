The optimal control of linear systems accompanied by zzso cost functions can be achieved by solving the well-known zzso zzso However, the optimal control of zzso zzso systems is a much more challenging task that often requires solving the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the recent literature, zzso approximate dynamic programming zzso techniques have been widely used to determine the optimal or near optimal control policies for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, an inherent assumption of zzso requires the value of the controlled system one step ahead and at least partial knowledge of the system dynamics to be zzso In this work, the need of the partial knowledge of the zzso system dynamics is relaxed in the development of a novel approach to zzso using a two part process: online system identification and zzso optimal control zzso First, in the system identification process, a neural network zzso is tuned online using novel tuning laws to learn the complete plant dynamics so that a local zzso stability of the identification error can be zzso Then, using only the learned zzso system model, zzso zzso is attempted resulting in a novel optimal control zzso The proposed scheme does not require explicit knowledge of the system dynamics as only the learned zzso model is zzso The proof of convergence is zzso zzso results verify theoretical zzso
