To compare zzso and prone treatment positions for prostate cancer patients with respect to internal prostate motion and the required treatment planning zzso 

Fifteen patients were treated in zzso and zzso in prone zzso For each patient, a planning zzso zzso zzso scan was used for treatment zzso Three repeat CT scans were made in weeks 2, 4, and 6 of the zzso zzso Only for the planning CT zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso For all patients, the clinical target volume zzso consisted of prostate and seminal zzso Variations in the position of the zzso relative to the zzso anatomy in the four CT scans of each patient were assessed using zzso zzso zzso The overall variations were separated into variations in the mean zzso position per patient zzso the systematic zzso and the average zzso variation zzso the random zzso zzso planning margins to account for the systematic and random variations in internal organ position and patient zzso were estimated zzso using coverage probability zzso 

The observed overall variation in the internal zzso position was larger for the patients treated in zzso zzso For the zzso and prone treatment positions, the random components of the variation along the zzso axis zzso towards the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso (I standard zzso (1 zzso zzso the random zzso around the zzso axis were zzso and zzso degrees (1 zzso The systematic components of these motions (1 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso degrees, zzso The zzso variations were similar for both treatment zzso Despite the smaller overall variations in zzso position for the patients in prone position, the required planning margin is equal for both groups (about 1 zzso except for zzso zzso in lateral zzso due to the larger impact of the systematic zzso However, significant time trends cause a systematic zzso shift of the zzso in zzso position zzso 

For internal prostate movement, it is important to distinguish systematic from random zzso Compared to patients in zzso position, patients in prone position had smaller random but somewhat larger systematic variations in the most important coordinates of the internal zzso zzso The estimated planning margins to account for the geometrical uncertainties were therefore similar for the two treatment zzso
