We report on an zzso zzso approach designed for data zzso within scientific disciplines where counting statistics are expected to follow zzso zzso We zzso a wide range of applications stemming from astrophysics to the condensed matter zzso Our main focus of interest concerns, however, zzso zzso data from zzso samples where signals span a zzso space defined by three spatial coordinates plus zzso This makes widely used zzso zzso schemes inadequate since physically relevant information is often concentrated within rather small regions of such a zzso Our aim is thus to generate zzso zzso data sets from one-dimensional to three-dimensional volumes to provide the zzso with enhanced ability to carry out searches within a zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are then scrutinized against experimental as well as simulated zzso
