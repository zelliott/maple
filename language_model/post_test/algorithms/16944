The determination of the secondary structure zzso is a critical step in zzso the atomic structure from the protein density map obtained from electron zzso zzso This step often relies on the matching of two sources of zzso One source comes from the secondary structures detected from the protein density map at the medium resolution, such as zzso zzso The other source comes from the predicted secondary structures from the zzso acid zzso Due to the inaccuracy in either source of information, a pool of possible secondary structure positions needs to be zzso This paper studies the question, that is, how to reduce the zzso of the mapping when the inaccuracy of the secondary structure predictions is zzso We present a method that combines the concept of dynamic graph with our previous work of using constrained shortest path to identify the zzso of the secondary zzso We show a reduction of zzso of zzso as comparison to the zzso way of handling the zzso We also show an improved accuracy when the potential secondary structure errors are explicitly sampled verses the use of one consensus zzso Our framework demonstrated the potential of developing zzso effective exact zzso to identify the optimal zzso of the secondary structures when the inaccuracy of the predicted data is zzso
