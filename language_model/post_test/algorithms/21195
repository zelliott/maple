zzso of expression levels applied to zzso data can help in reducing measurement zzso Different methods, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and median or mean zzso have been zzso to zzso zzso zzso Although there is considerable literature regarding zzso techniques for zzso zzso data, there are no publications comparing zzso techniques for zzso zzso zzso data, which are subject to similar sources of measurement zzso In this paper, we compare the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso and no zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso method works best in reducing differences in zzso expression values for replicate tissue zzso By showing that the total mean squared error are lowest across almost all 36 investigated tissue samples, we are assured that the bias correction provided by zzso zzso is not zzso by additional error zzso that can arise from a more complex zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso does not achieve these results by zzso of zzso
