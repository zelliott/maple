zzso of the considerable variation in action potential (AP) shape throughout the heart is necessary to explain normal and pathological cardiac zzso zzso mathematical models reproduce typical zzso but not all measured zzso as fitting the sets of zzso equations is a tedious zzso The study describes the integration of a pre-existing mathematical model of an zzso cell zzso with a genetic zzso to provide an automated tool to generate zzso for arbitrary cells by fitting zzso channel zzso Using the zzso model as the base, the technique was first verified by starting with random values and fitting the zzso model to itself with an error of only zzso The zzso model, which has a different zzso from that of the zzso model, was successfully zzso The zzso duration zzso curve generated by the fit matched that of the target model very zzso Finally, zzso recorded zzso were zzso To match zzso duration zzso zzso properly, it was necessary simultaneously to fit over several stimulation zzso Also, fitting of the zzso was better if the stimulating current pulse zzso that found in zzso as opposed to a zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso parameters were successfully able to reproduce any given zzso zzso This tool can be useful for determining parameters in new zzso models, zzso specific zzso as well as determining the locus of drug action by examining changes in zzso zzso
