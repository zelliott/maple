We present a novel approach to zzso source zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso prior is obtained by calculation of the sample mean and zzso zzso for the equivalent moments of realistic simulated cortical zzso We compare the zzso zzso zzso framework to the classical zzso and general zzso source zzso methods by evaluating the ability of all three solutions to zzso the zzso of zzso plausible patches of activity simulated on the surface of a human cerebral zzso The results, obtained with a realistic sensor zzso a zzso head model, and given in terms of field and zzso error, depict the performance of the zzso and zzso models as a function of variable source surface area zzso zzso noise conditions zzso 10, and 5 zzso zzso source orientation zzso degrees ), and source depth zzso zzso We show that as the sources increase in size, they become less accurately modeled as current zzso The zzso zzso systematically zzso the single zzso model, increasingly so as the spatial extent of the sources zzso In addition, our simulations demonstrate that as the orientation of the sources becomes more zzso zzso zzso accuracy decreases zzso while the performance of the zzso zzso model is far less sensitive to orientation and even succeeds in zzso zzso source zzso Furthermore, our results show that the zzso model is able to zzso superficial sources with higher accuracy than the current zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso solution may be an attractive alternative to zzso source zzso methods in zzso
