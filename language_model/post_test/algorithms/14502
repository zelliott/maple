This paper proposes a diagnosis system using dynamic time zzso zzso and zzso analysis with zzso potential zzso and dissolved oxygen zzso values for zzso wastewater zzso A zzso sequencing batch reactor zzso which has an effective volume of 20 zzso was zzso and the reaction phase was performed by a zzso operation consisting of a repeated short cycle of the zzso zzso Using zzso and DO profiles, zzso status was divided into four categories of normal and abnormal zzso these were zzso zzso zzso controller fault, instrument trouble and inadequate raw wastewater zzso Through the zzso process, difference values zzso were determined and classified into seven zzso In spite of the zzso of high loading rates, the zzso profile provided good diagnosis zzso However, the DO profiles detected five zzso that indicated different zzso After the zzso process, several statistical values, including maximum value, minimum value, average value, standard zzso value and three zzso values, were extracted and applied to establish the zzso zzso The zzso analysis allows one to zzso seven cases with a percentage of zzso and zzso for zzso and DO profiles, zzso zzso the study showed that zzso profiles are more efficient than DO profiles as diagnosis parameters and zzso diagnosis zzso and zzso
