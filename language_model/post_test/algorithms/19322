A lattice model is used to study zzso and zzso effects on protein folding rates and folding zzso In the context of protein evolution, we address the question regarding the best scenario for a zzso chain to zzso either a fast zzso collapse followed by a slow zzso to form the native structure or a specific collapse from the unfolded state with the simultaneous formation of the native zzso This question is investigated for zzso zzso whose native state has no frustrated contacts between zzso and also for zzso zzso whose native state has some degree of zzso It is found that the best scenario for folding may depend on the amount of frustration of the native zzso The implication of this result on protein evolution is zzso
