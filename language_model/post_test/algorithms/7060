An approach is described for selecting zzso procedures based on goals for zzso quality, the performance characteristics of the measurement procedure zzso bias, frequency of zzso and the performance characteristics of the control procedure zzso for error detection and false zzso Performance characteristics of stable sample zzso procedures and patient data zzso procedures zzso patient zzso zzso zzso algorithm, zzso zzso zzso are compared to determine when to apply these different zzso procedures to zzso zzso zzso zzso stable methods may be controlled using zzso zzso zzso less precise, less stable methods require zzso zzso algorithm, retained patient zzso or stable sample zzso zzso imprecise and unstable methods are best controlled using stable sample zzso zzso zzso designs may employ stable samples for zzso testing, retained patient specimens for short term monitoring, and zzso zzso zzso for long term zzso
