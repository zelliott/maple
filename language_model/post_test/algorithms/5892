We contrast the performance of two methods of imposing constraints during the tracking of articulated objects, the first method zzso the zzso constraints during tracking and, thus, using the minimum degrees of freedom, and the second imposing constraints after tracking and, zzso using the zzso Despite their very different zzso the methods recover the same pose zzso Further comparisons are drawn in terms of zzso speed and zzso simplicity and zzso and it is the last area which is the most zzso The results suggest that using built-in constraints is zzso to tracking individual articulated objects, whereas applying constraints afterward is most suited to problems involving contact and breakage between articulated (or zzso objects, where the ability to test tracking performance quickly with constraints turned on or off is zzso
