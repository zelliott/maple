The behavior of highly charged short zzso zzso near zzso charged zzso surfaces is investigated by means of zzso Carlo zzso A detailed zzso study, including zzso and fluid charge zzso and chain orientation, is zzso The influence of chain zzso zzso zzso density, and image forces is zzso Due to the lower chain zzso zzso to flexible zzso our simulation data show that zzso zzso can, in general, better zzso than flexible ones zzso Nonetheless, at low zzso constant, it is found that repulsive image forces tend to significantly reduce this zzso
