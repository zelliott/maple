A zzso approach has been developed for zzso zzso In the first step, a Fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to globally sample all putative binding zzso in which the protein is represented by a reduced model, that is, each side chain on the protein surface is represented by its center of zzso Compared to conventional zzso zzso with zzso models, the zzso zzso method with a reduced model is expected to generate more hits because it allows larger zzso zzso Next, the filtered binding modes zzso several zzso are refined by an zzso derived zzso scoring function zzso and by considering zzso flexibility using an ensemble zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were extracted by a zzso zzso method, which zzso the long-standing reference state problem in the zzso zzso With this zzso zzso we have participated in the zzso experiments for zzso zzso of 11 targets zzso In the predictor experiments, we achieved correct binding modes for six zzso three are with high accuracy zzso for both distinct binding zzso zzso and zzso two are with medium accuracy zzso and zzso and one is acceptable zzso In the scorer experiments, of the seven target complexes that contain at least one acceptable mode submitted by the zzso predictor groups, we obtained correct binding modes for four zzso three are with high accuracy zzso zzso and zzso and one is with medium accuracy zzso suggesting good accuracy and zzso of zzso
