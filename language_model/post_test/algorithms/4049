Comparative zzso is a powerful approach for studying variation in zzso traits as well as the evolution and ecology of zzso Recent technological advances have enabled sequencing large numbers of related zzso in a single project, requiring zzso tools for their integrated zzso In particular, accurate zzso and identification of gene presence and absence are critical for understanding and modeling the cellular physiology of newly zzso zzso Although many tools are available to compare the gene contents of related zzso new tools are necessary to enable close examination and zzso of protein families from large numbers of closely related organisms, to integrate zzso with the analysis of gain and loss, and to generate zzso networks linking the zzso to observed zzso 

We have developed zzso an Integrated zzso for zzso of microbial zzso to zzso protein families, zzso similarities to zzso zzso analyze gene gain and loss, and generate draft zzso networks from one or more curated reference network reconstructions in groups of related microbial species among which the combination of core and variable genes constitute the their zzso The zzso zzso consists of: zzso a series of modular zzso scripts for zzso comparison, zzso and analysis of protein families and their distribution across many zzso zzso a set of Python libraries for zzso access to the same zzso and zzso zzso scripts to perform common analysis zzso on a collection of zzso zzso capabilities include de zzso protein family zzso zzso zzso analysis of functional zzso identification of core and variable genes and gene regions, sequence alignments and tree generation, zzso zzso and the integration of zzso analysis and zzso networks for study of zzso network zzso 

zzso is a powerful, flexible zzso for generation and zzso of protein zzso zzso modular design allows for straightforward extension as analysis methods and tools zzso By zzso comparative zzso with the development of draft zzso networks, zzso zzso the power of comparative zzso to build confidence in links between zzso and zzso and helps zzso gene zzso when they are evaluated in both evolutionary and zzso network zzso
