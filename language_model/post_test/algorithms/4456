The aim of the study was to assess a new zzso support zzso system in resolving air zzso in the lungs during mechanical zzso The zzso system consisted of a cylinder and two valves that were connected to the zzso zzso The movements of them were synchronized with the zzso The cylinder zzso gas during zzso We compared the effects of the zzso on air zzso between a zzso and an ordinary size zzso tube zzso zzso diameter zzso 5 and 8 zzso In addition, we compared the effects of the zzso on air zzso between normal and high airway resistance of the lungs (5 and 20 zzso zzso The zzso settings were as zzso volume controlled ventilation with constant zzso flow zzso tidal volume, zzso zzso zzso time, zzso zzso zzso time, zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso 0 zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso pressure of the 5 zzso ID zzso at a level similar to that of the 8 zzso ID zzso The zzso also resolved the air zzso induced by the high airway resistance of the zzso In conclusion, the zzso system resolved the air zzso associated with a narrow zzso tube and high airway resistance of the zzso
