By using the zzso zzso algorithm, we can efficiently produce a digital volume, called the zzso volume, from zzso data acquired along a circular scan zzso Due to the zzso of the zzso data set, the zzso volume suffers from zzso reproduction zzso Specifically, the zzso (on the zzso zzso can be exactly zzso and the reproduction zzso of zzso decreases as the distance from the zzso zzso We describe the zzso zzso degradation by a zzso function and the spatial distribution over the object domain by an zzso zzso With two zzso circular scan zzso we can reconstruct two zzso volumes and generate two zzso zzso We propose a volume fusion scheme to combine the two zzso volumes into a single zzso Let Va and zzso zzso the two zzso volumes, let zzso and zzso zzso the zzso volumes for orbits zzso and zzso respectively, then the volume fusion is defined by zzso with zzso and zzso In the result, the overall reproduction zzso of zzso is expected to outperform that of zzso or zzso or zzso In principle, this zzso scheme is zzso for general zzso zzso with multiple zzso and zzso zzso
