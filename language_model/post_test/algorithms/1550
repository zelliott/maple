zzso dye imaging was used to zzso in zzso network level zzso cortical zzso in response to electrical zzso of the zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked a distinctly different cortical response than natural sensory zzso with response to zzso spreading over a larger area of zzso and being zzso zzso with the cortical column to which the zzso zzso region zzso zzso stimulation with zzso zzso zzso reduced this zzso zzso while simultaneously increasing the spatial specificity of the cortical zzso zzso increasing the asymmetry of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso between zzso and zzso stimulation that gradually reduced the zzso zzso These data strongly support the hypothesis that manipulation of the electrical stimulation zzso can be used to selectively activate specific neural zzso Specifically, our results are consistent with the prediction that zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate cell bodies over zzso while zzso zzso zzso activate zzso over cell zzso The findings here provide some initial steps toward the design and zzso of zzso of neural circuitry, and open the door to more sophisticated engineering tools, such as zzso system identification techniques, to develop technologies for more effective control of activity in the nervous zzso
