zzso zzso experiments identify pairs of genes with complementary zzso More direct functional associations (for example greater probability of membership in a single protein zzso may be zzso between genes that share synthetic lethal interaction partners than genes that are directly synthetic zzso zzso zzso that identify gene zzso based on motif discovery are highly appropriate for the analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interaction data and have great potential in zzso analysis of zzso zzso 

We have developed zzso zzso zzso Finding zzso an zzso for zzso motif discovery from synthetic lethal interaction zzso zzso motifs are characterized by position weight zzso and zzso through expectation zzso Given a seed zzso zzso performs a zzso transform on the input genetic interaction data and automatically assigns genes to the motif or zzso zzso We demonstrate the capacity to extract known and novel pathways for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested for several zzso genes are supported by recent experimental zzso zzso is efficient in computation, requires no training and automatically zzso zzso genes with high zzso 

zzso effectively identifies pathways from synthetic zzso data with several unique zzso It is mostly suitable for building gene zzso around seed zzso zzso choice of one single model zzso allows construction of gene networks with different levels of zzso The impact of hub genes the generic zzso framework of zzso may be used to group other types of biological entities such as proteins based on zzso zzso Analysis of the strongest motifs discovered by the zzso indicates that synthetic lethal interactions are depleted between genes within a zzso suggesting that synthetic zzso occurs zzso rather than zzso
