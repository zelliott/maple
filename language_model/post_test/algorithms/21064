The aim of this study was to assess the zzso of an artificial neural network based on zzso spectral zzso as a diagnostic test for zzso sleep zzso and zzso zzso A data set of 37 subjects was used for spectral analysis of the zzso by performing a fast zzso zzso The examined intervals were divided into epochs of 3 zzso zzso zzso S was applied as a measure for the spread of the related power zzso The spectrum was divided into several frequency areas with various zzso of spectral zzso We studied 11 subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso 267 zzso 10 subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso 11 subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5 subjects with normal breathing in zzso sleep zzso zzso 174 zzso Based on spectral zzso an artificial neural network was built, and we obtained a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for distinguishing between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for discriminating between zzso zzso and normal breathing in zzso zzso This resulted in an accuracy of zzso for identifying flow patterns of zzso sleep zzso zzso zzso and normal breathing in zzso zzso It is concluded that the use of an artificial neural network relying on spectral analysis of the zzso could be a useful method as a diagnostic test for zzso sleep zzso and zzso zzso
