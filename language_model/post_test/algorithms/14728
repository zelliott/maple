A recently proposed product zzso method is efficient for large scale approximate nearest neighbor search, however, its performance on zzso zzso is zzso This paper introduces residual zzso zzso based approaches that are appropriate for zzso zzso Database zzso are zzso by residual zzso zzso The reproductions are represented by short codes composed of their zzso zzso zzso distance between query zzso and database zzso is zzso by zzso distance, zzso the distance between the query zzso and the reproduction of the database zzso An efficient exhaustive search approach is proposed by fast computing the zzso zzso A straight forward zzso search approach is proposed for large scale zzso Our approaches are compared to two state-of-the-art methods, spectral hashing and product zzso on both structured and zzso zzso zzso show that our approaches obtain the best results in terms of the zzso between search quality and memory zzso
