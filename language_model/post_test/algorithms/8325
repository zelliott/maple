A mathematical model is proposed for prediction of the efficacy of zzso therapy developed on the basis of the zzso zzso and successive zzso zzso The model uses the retrospective values of the results of zzso determination of the number of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso By means of the blind method the zzso value of the mathematical model to predict the zzso of zzso therapy in zzso zzso was zzso A zzso was zzso
