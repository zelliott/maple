A new method is described to allow interactive selection of the reconstruction filter at the time of interpretation of images from zzso zzso In the filtered back projection algorithm, the only part of the reconstruction process requiring user interaction is the selection of the window zzso Since the ramp and window filters have different purposes, they can be zzso placing the window at the end of the reconstruction process as a three-dimensional zzso All stages of reconstruction except the window filtering are performed before the physician begins to interpret the zzso The three-dimensional filtering is performed very rapidly with use of the zzso zzso zzso A 64 zzso 64 zzso 64 zzso cube of data is filtered in zzso s using filters of zzso zzso Smaller volumes of image data can be filtered in less than 1 zzso thus, the user can zzso choose any desired filter for a given zzso study at the time of interpretation of the zzso
