This paper presents the development and zzso of three zzso methods used to detect and measure the zzso of a vast number of points in the case of laboratory testing on construction zzso Starting from the needs of structural engineers, three ad hoc tools for crack measurement in zzso specimens and zzso or zzso deformation analysis through digital images were implemented and zzso These tools make use of advanced image processing zzso and can integrate or even substitute some traditional sensors employed today in most zzso In addition, the automation provided by the implemented software, the limited cost of the instruments and the possibility to operate with an indefinite number of points offer new and more extensive analysis in the field of material zzso Several comparisons with other traditional sensors widely adopted inside most laboratories were carried out in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the implemented zzso Implementation details, simulations and real applications are reported and discussed in this zzso
