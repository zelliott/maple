We investigate the zzso of the spatial pattern resulting from the division of land into the parcels that is observed in the centers of the cities, by analyzing the distribution function of the parcel zzso A simple model based on a two-dimensional bond zzso is employed to mimic the process of the formation of the zzso The model reproduces the empirical distribution of the parcel areas that is found to exhibit the power law with the zzso zzso We argue that the city emerges from a collection of separated settlements in a process that can be described as a structural phase zzso
