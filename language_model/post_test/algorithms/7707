In this paper we propose a novel way to construct a zzso zzso zzso Each zzso transform is defined on a local region and the resulting zzso encapsulates all the local zzso by a smooth and zzso displacement zzso Compared with traditional weighting schemes used in combining local zzso our new scheme guarantees that the resulting transform precisely preserves the value of each local zzso zzso By introducing the trajectory of local regions instead of using regions themselves, the new approach encodes precisely each local zzso transform using a zzso with one or more stationary zzso zzso zzso show that our new zzso model is both accurate and zzso
