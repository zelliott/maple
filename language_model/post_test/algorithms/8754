The zzso status of muscle changes according to the energetic demands of the zzso Two key regulators of these changes include exercise and insulin, with exercise zzso zzso expenditure within seconds and insulin enabling anabolic energy investment over minutes to zzso This study explores the potential of zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso to characterize the in zzso zzso zzso of muscle during functional and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso Using zzso acid as a zzso we find that despite the different time scales of these forms of zzso increases in zzso label transport and consumption and zzso increases in initial rates of the zzso metabolism to zzso were observed for both zzso By contrast, rates of zzso metabolism to labeled zzso increased zzso for insulin but remained unchanged following zzso muscle zzso zzso analysis revealed that branching of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso provides significant zzso zzso that distinguish between anabolic and zzso fates in zzso according to the zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso acid zzso
