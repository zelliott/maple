In this paper, we present a new zzso method for zzso the parameters of zzso functions and characterizing handwriting zzso According to the zzso zzso of rapid human movements, these parameters contain information on both the motor commands and the timing properties of a zzso zzso The new algorithm, called zzso exploits relationships between the zero crossings of the first and second time derivatives of a zzso function and its four basic zzso The methodology is described and then evaluated under various testing zzso The new tool allows a greater variety of stroke patterns to be processed zzso Furthermore, for the first time, the extraction accuracy is zzso zzso taking advantage of the exponential relationships that link the zzso of the extraction errors with its zzso zzso A new extraction system which combines this zzso with two other previously published methods is also described and zzso This system provides researchers involved in various zzso of pattern analysis and artificial intelligence with new tools for the basic study of single strokes as zzso for understanding rapid human zzso
