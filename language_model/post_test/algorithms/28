This paper describes some parallel processing zzso for the analysis of two-dimensional zzso zzso The machine used for the processing was the zzso Cellular zzso Computer at University College, London, one of the largest zzso zzso in the zzso Included in this paper are an zzso for zzso zzso zzso fitting zzso and an zzso for the extraction of data out of the cellular array zzso It is shown that these parallel zzso can run at a speed almost completely independent of the number of spots in the gel zzso
