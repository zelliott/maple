We study effects of periodic fields on charge transport in zzso and show that zzso acquire complex dynamics induced by the interplay between the periodic in time external field, energy zzso and depends on the zzso zzso zzso dynamics is a zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso with the frequency of the external field and directed zzso Even unbiased periodic in time fields can cause drift of zzso (the zzso zzso in the zzso periodic zzso This effect has a threshold with respect to the intensity and frequency of the zzso We calculate the dependence of the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of the drift on the intensity of the field, its frequency, and energy zzso Thus, we show that zzso charge transport processes in a field which is periodic in time acquire completely different dynamics than linear zzso This clearly plays a role in metabolism of zzso
