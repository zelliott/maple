The major aim of this study is to describe a unified procedure for detecting noisy segments and spikes in zzso signals with a zzso but zzso periodic zzso According to this zzso the cycles of the signal zzso and offset zzso are zzso Then, the cycles are clustered into a finite number of groups based on appropriate zzso and zzso time zzso Next, the median template of each time series of each cluster is zzso zzso a zzso technique is devised for making a comparison between a test cycle feature and the associated time series of each zzso Finally, by applying a suitably chosen threshold for the calculated correlation values, a segment is prescribed to be either clean or zzso As a key merit of this research, the procedure can introduce a decision support for choosing accurately zzso filtering or to remove noisy zzso In this paper, the application procedure of the proposed method is zzso described by applying it to zzso zzso signals for finding noisy zzso The database consists of 126 records from several patients of a domestic research station acquired by a 3M zzso zzso zzso sampling frequency electronic zzso By implementing the noisy segments detection zzso with this database, a sensitivity of zzso and a positive zzso value, zzso were obtained based on physicians zzso
