zzso measures of neural activity frequently display zzso patterns at various zzso Furthermore, these zzso patterns can become zzso synchronized across a wide region of the brain in a zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso in simultaneously recorded spike trains were analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso methods of calculating zzso zzso to spike train data was zzso In contrast, new methods were needed for evaluating the statistical significance of the zzso Although a zzso test based on a large number of zzso zzso can provide a reliable estimate of statistical significance, this was quite zzso As an alternative, statistical significance was determined with a normal probability density function estimated from a small number of zzso zzso When applied to zzso pairs recorded in the zzso supplementary motor area, the zzso procedure produced a reliable outcome even when it was based on as few as ten zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso analysis in combination with a zzso procedure provides a useful tool to examine the dynamic patterns of zzso correlation in cortical spike zzso
