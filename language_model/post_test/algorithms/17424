The rice blast fungus zzso zzso is a highly destructive plant pathogen and one of the most important for studying various aspects of zzso zzso It has been widely adopted as a model zzso because it is zzso suited for genetic and biological zzso To facilitate zzso zzso zzso walking, and zzso organization studies of zzso zzso a complete physical map of zzso 7 was constructed using a zzso zzso zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso Using 147 zzso zzso zzso zzso clones and 20 zzso markers on zzso 7, 625 zzso clones were identified by zzso zzso clones were zzso with zzso and fragments were size separated on zzso zzso gels to create DNA zzso zzso zzso were constructed using a random cost algorithm, whereas zzso zzso were constructed using the software package zzso zzso from both methods were generally in agreement, but numerous anomalies were zzso The combined data produced five robust anchored zzso after gap closure by zzso zzso The genetic and physical maps agreed zzso The final physical map was estimated to cover zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso a minimum zzso tile containing 42 zzso clones was created, and organization of repetitive elements and expressed genes of the zzso was zzso
