zzso chart review was performed on all patients treated in a multidisciplinary facial nerve center with lower lip asymmetry over an zzso month zzso Treatment ranged from a temporary trial of zzso to zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso muscle transfer, and/or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients were treated with zzso with zzso zzso four with anterior belly of the zzso transfer, and 3 with zzso zzso All patients with zzso zzso had undergone zzso to the zzso lower lip with zzso toxin and were pleased with the appearance of their zzso 

We have found that lower lip asymmetry is zzso managed by adherence to a standardized protocol that offers patients insight into the likely outcome of zzso or surgery and zzso systematically from the zzso to the zzso We present our zzso for the management of the zzso lower lip, which reflects this graduated approach and has resulted in high patient zzso
