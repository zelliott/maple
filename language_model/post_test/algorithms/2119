In contrast to conventional multilayered zzso networks which are typically trained by zzso zzso search methods, an optimal zzso zzso net can be trained by a zzso least squares zzso called zzso The basic idea of zzso is to use a subset of the training set, whose zzso are called zzso to zzso the zzso net zzso A subset of these zzso called zzso is then chosen as the zzso zzso of the zzso functions of the zzso net to satisfy the zzso constraints in the least squares zzso zzso By zzso increasing the numbers of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso net from scratch to the extent sufficient to solve a given zzso zzso To improve the performance of zzso this paper addresses two important problems in zzso net training: the selection of the zzso and the selection of the zzso By choosing zzso from poorly classified regions, this paper proposes a new zzso selection method which is zzso to the changing zzso performance of the growing zzso zzso This paper also proposes a new zzso selection criterion to reduce the complexity of the zzso zzso For the same training zzso simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach produces smaller zzso net than the zzso zzso Experimental results also show that the proposed approach is less sensitive to the variation of the training set than zzso
