In this study, the solution structures of eight zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso (where X zzso C, G, T or A and zzso is complementary to X), have been determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso sugar zzso angles, backbone zzso angles and hydrogen bond zzso Based on the structural data obtained in solution, a novel zzso local structure function, zzso zzso composed of the sum of the contributions from the zzso twist zzso base roll zzso zzso slide delta delta and zzso twist zzso is introduced to describe their zzso local zzso zzso zzso is found to produce an acceptable correlation zzso zzso zzso with the relative local stability zzso zzso 10) of a zzso This result demonstrates that in addition to the zzso zzso zzso the base zzso of zzso zzso is also important in defining the local geometry of zzso Thus, in analyzing the zzso structural zzso blocks of zzso are used as the basic unit whereas for the zzso structural zzso the basic unit is composed of blocks of zzso The omega zzso zzso 10 correlation is the first experimental evidence demonstrating the relationship between the relative local zzso and the zzso local structures of DNA zzso It also forms the basis for using the zzso model for the prediction of zzso local structures of zzso acid zzso
