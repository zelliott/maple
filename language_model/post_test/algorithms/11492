The zzso ratio zzso has been widely accepted for zzso the irregular or noise component of zzso zzso however, is usually inflated by zzso variations of fundamental frequency period because zero padding is used for time zzso of the zzso In this study, a new method was developed for analyzing zzso zzso of zzso In this method, noise components of voice were calculated from the discrepancies between zzso after they had been zzso aligned in zzso The optimal time zzso of zzso was accomplished using procedures of dynamic time zzso zzso This method was evaluated using both synthetic and natural voices, and significant reductions in noise were zzso The zzso ratio obtained using zzso for time zzso was also shown to be independent of fundamental frequency zzso
