zzso zzso zzso ratio frequency zzso zzso in the small flip angle regime commonly reduces to the solution of a least squares problem, which requires zzso to be solved zzso Usually, zzso is carried out by the introduction of a penalty, zzso on the solution zzso In most cases, the optimal zzso zzso is not known a zzso and the problem needs to be solved for several values of zzso The optimal value can be selected, typically by plotting the zzso In this article, a zzso zzso zzso is applied to design ratio frequency zzso in a zzso way without a zzso knowledge of the optimal zzso zzso The zzso time is reduced considerably (by a factor 10 in a typical set up) with respect to the standard zzso zzso for least square since just one run of the zzso is zzso zzso are shown and the performance is compared to that of zzso zzso for least zzso
