We derive a novel zzso to recover the in zzso zzso of zzso based on an zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We zzso demonstrate the advantage offered by this method in zzso zzso with distinct zzso This zzso has wide zzso for diagnostic zzso imaging in the presence of zzso biological zzso since zzso lifetime is a sensitive indicator of local tissue environment and interactions at the molecular zzso
