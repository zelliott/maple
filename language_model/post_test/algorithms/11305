We introduce a protocol with a zzso filter system to create zzso single zzso in the smart power grid for the realization of the zzso secure key distribution zzso The protocol is valid for one-dimensional zzso networks zzso power line) which are typical of the electricity distribution network between the utility and the zzso The speed of the protocol (the number of steps zzso versus grid size is zzso When properly zzso such a system has the potential to achieve unconditionally secure key distribution over the smart power grid of arbitrary geometrical zzso
