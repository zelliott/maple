In a zzso for example a zzso process, many biological reactions are always working in zzso space and the control of such a process is very zzso zzso have therefore been controlled by the judgment of the experts who are the skilled operators and have much experience in the control of such zzso Such experience is normally described in terms of linguistic zzso zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool for incorporating linguistic rules into computer control of such zzso zzso control is divided into two zzso fuzzy control of process zzso for example sugar feed rate and zzso temperature, and indirect control via phase zzso In zzso control the experts decide the value of zzso process variables such as sugar feed rate or temperature as output data from several state variables as input zzso zzso control is regarded as a zzso zzso in which the zzso relationship between input and output data are zzso In Japan fuzzy control has already been applied to practical industrial processes such as production of zzso precursor and vitamin B2 and to the Japanese sake mashing process; these examples are zzso In addition, an advanced control tool developed from a study on fuzzy control, fuzzy neural networks zzso are zzso zzso can involve complicated causality between input and output data in a network zzso zzso have been proven to be zzso to a research in zzso for example modeling of the complicated causality between electroencephalogram or gene expression profiling data and zzso zzso zzso results on this research will be also zzso
