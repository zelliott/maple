The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso remains unresolved despite its novel function because zzso is a hard target in X-ray and zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso change of zzso the zzso circular zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its constituent zzso were measured down to 160 zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso contents and numbers of segments of zzso were estimated from the zzso zzso of the protein zzso obtained by zzso the contributions of the zzso zzso Further, the positions of secondary structures on the zzso acid sequence were predicted by combining the zzso data with a neural network zzso These comprehensive zzso analyses revealed that zzso consists of zzso zzso (3 zzso and zzso zzso (12 zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso which are close to the proportions in the secondary structure of native zzso zzso zzso predicted by zzso zzso and that it consists of zzso zzso (7 zzso and zzso zzso (2 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of these zzso of zzso bound to zzso suggested that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso regions strongly interact with zzso Most of the zzso zzso of zzso were involved in the sequences transferring from zzso to zzso or zzso structures, which coincided with the large decrease in zzso capacity of zzso zzso These results provide the first zzso information on the zzso mechanism and zzso relationship of zzso
