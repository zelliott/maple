A successful zzso zzso space registration in zzso liver surgery zzso is critical to provide reliable guidance information to surgeons and pertinent surface displacement data for use in deformation correction zzso The current protocol used to perform the zzso space registration involves an initial pose zzso provided by a point based registration of anatomical landmarks identifiable in both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The surface based registration is then performed via a traditional zzso closest point zzso zzso between the zzso liver surface, segmented from the zzso image set, and an zzso acquired point cloud of the liver surface provided by a laser range zzso Using this more conventional method, the registration accuracy can be compromised by poor initial pose zzso as well as tissue deformation due to the zzso and liver zzso performed prior to tumor zzso In order to increase the zzso of the current zzso registration method used in zzso we propose the incorporation of salient anatomical features, identifiable in both the zzso image sets and zzso liver surface data, to aid in the initial pose zzso and play a more significant role in the zzso registration via a novel weighting zzso Examples of such salient anatomical features are the zzso groove region as well as the inferior zzso of the liver zzso In order to validate the proposed weighted patch registration method, the alignment results provided by the proposed zzso using both single and multiple patch regions were compared with the traditional zzso method using six clinical zzso zzso studies were also performed using both phantom and clinical data to compare the resulting registrations provided by the proposed zzso and the traditional method under conditions of varying initial zzso The results provided by the zzso trials and clinical registration comparisons suggest that the proposed weighted patch registration zzso provides a more robust method with which to perform the zzso space registration in zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the proposed zzso during surgical procedures does not impose significant increases in zzso or data acquisition zzso
