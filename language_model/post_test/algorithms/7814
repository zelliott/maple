The zzso protein is a master regulator that controls the zzso of many genes in various pathways in response to a variety of stress zzso The extent of this regulation depends in part on the binding affinity of zzso to its response elements zzso Traditional profile scores for zzso based on position weight zzso zzso are only a weak indicator of binding affinity because the level of binding also depends on various other factors such as interaction between the zzso and, in case of zzso the extent of the zzso between the zzso 

In the current study we introduce a novel zzso predictor for zzso zzso capability based on a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso validated known zzso along with their zzso capabilities are used for zzso Through zzso studies we show that our method zzso other existing zzso To demonstrate the utility of this method we zzso rank putative zzso of target genes and target zzso based on the predicted zzso capability and zzso study the implication of zzso overlapping zzso on its zzso zzso 

Taking into account both zzso interactions and the zzso length of zzso we have created a novel zzso zzso zzso capability predictor for zzso and used it to analyze validated and novel zzso and to predict the impact of zzso overlapping these zzso
