zzso zzso Surgery zzso is a promising minimally invasive technique in tissue zzso Because of the high intensity at the ultrasound focus, a precise zzso system is required to determine the site of the treating target in order to increase the efficiency and security of zzso This paper represents a three zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso system developed and its zzso The system is mainly composed of imaging and image processing system, movement device and its controlling zzso and position feedback zzso The system has a maximum scan range of zzso 30 degrees with a resolution of 8 levels from zzso to zzso zzso For a zzso shape like target, in theory, the maximum diameter is 160 zzso the system can zzso The system can be used to zzso precisely the treatment targets with general sizes in the suitable parts of the body in zzso
