Since zzso of magnetic resonance images is one of the most important initial steps in brain magnetic resonance image processing, success in this part has a great influence on the quality of outcomes of subsequent zzso In the past few decades, numerous methods have been introduced for zzso of such images, but typically they perform well only on a specific subset of images, do not zzso well to other image sets, and have poor zzso zzso In this study, we provided a method for zzso of magnetic resonance images of the brain that despite its simplicity has a high zzso We compare the performance of our proposed zzso with similar evolutionary zzso on a zzso zzso Our zzso is tested across varying sets of magnetic resonance images and demonstrates high speed and zzso It should be noted that in initial steps, the zzso is zzso intensive requiring a large number of calculations; however, in subsequent steps of the search process, the number is reduced with the zzso focused only in the target zzso
