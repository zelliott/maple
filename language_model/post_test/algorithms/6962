We have applied the zzso method to zzso zzso zzso zzso in biological zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to receive zzso signals, to which the zzso zzso was applied for image zzso We greatly improved the lateral resolution of images and acquired a clear view of the circular boundaries of buried zzso objects, which could not be obtained in conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso based on focused zzso Two zzso sources, which had zzso of 9 and 3 zzso respectively, were used in the experiments for zzso The 3 zzso system had a much larger imaging depth but a lower zzso ratio than the 9 zzso system in zzso zzso
