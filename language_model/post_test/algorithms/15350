zzso spike codes play a crucial role in neural information zzso In particular, there is strong experimental evidence that zzso intervals zzso are used for stimulus representation in neural zzso However, very few zzso principles exploit the benefits of such zzso codes for zzso zzso of stimuli or zzso Here, we describe and rigorously prove the functional properties of a zzso zzso that uses zzso zzso to perform zzso zzso The abstract zzso architecture serves as a building block for more concrete, neural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in arbitrary zzso models zzso zzso networks and factor zzso The distributed nature of zzso models matches well with the architectural and functional constraints imposed by zzso In our model, zzso zzso represent the zzso messages exchanged between factor zzso leading to the interpretation of a single spike as a random sample that follows such a zzso We verify the abstract zzso model by zzso simulation in full zzso and demonstrate that it can be applied even in the presence of analog zzso As a particular example, we also show results of a concrete, neural zzso of the processor, although in principle our approach is more flexible and allows different zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso data from area zzso during behavioral experiments are assessed in light of zzso coding, leading to concrete zzso quantitative predictions and a more accurate description of these data compared to zzso existing zzso
