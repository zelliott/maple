A quite unexpected zzso coordination of the hydrated zzso complex in zzso solution is revealed by an extensive study combining X-ray zzso zzso zzso and quantum zzso dynamics zzso zzso As a matter of fact, the generally accepted zzso zzso of zzso zzso cannot be zzso with zzso zzso Next, refined zzso zzso point out the remarkable stability of a zzso structure with C2 zzso and long-time MD simulations by new interaction zzso including zzso effects reveal that the hydrated complex has a quite flexible structure, corresponding for most of the time to zzso zzso This picture is fully consistent with X-ray zzso zzso structure experimental data which zzso show the preference for a zzso instead of a zzso zzso
