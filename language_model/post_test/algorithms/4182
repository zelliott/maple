zzso molecules often undergo zzso zzso In order to gain insights into the forces that drive such changes, it would be useful to have a method that zzso the zzso contributions to the conversion free zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso method, which is zzso to large zzso zzso We show that zzso correctly predicts the stable states of several zzso sequences that have previously been challenging for molecular zzso zzso can often discriminate better from worse predictions of native protein models in critical assessment of protein structure prediction zzso We show how the total conversion free energies can be parsed into zzso zzso zzso Such parsing gives insights into which zzso acids are most responsible for given zzso For example, here we are able to zzso the known design principles of the zzso zzso This opens up the possibility for systematic improvements in zzso scoring functions, in the design of protein zzso zzso and in interpreting protein mechanisms at the zzso zzso
