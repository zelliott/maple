The advent of scanning zzso zzso zzso has created a fertile new avenue for zzso investigation of brain activity in zzso One principal weakness of this method, however, lies with the limit of scanning speed, which makes optical interrogation of action zzso activity in a zzso network zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso method that allows simultaneous imaging of multiple targets in depth with high zzso resolution, addresses this zzso zzso uses a liquid crystal spatial light zzso to split a zzso zzso beam into multiple zzso To distinguish them, a digital zzso device encodes each zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence signals from all independently targeted sites are then collected simultaneously onto a single zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso can be used to image zzso zzso zzso in cultured cells and zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso and red blood cells in zzso from the zzso in depth in zzso These results establish zzso as a unique method for simultaneous acquisition of zzso network zzso
