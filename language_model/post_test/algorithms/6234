zzso and controlling zzso phenomena are notoriously complex tasks to tackle and require accurate models of the phenomena of zzso Currently, most zzso processes are described by a set of partial models capturing specific aspects of the phenomena, and usually their composition does not produce effective comprehensive zzso A current open issue is thus the development of techniques able to effectively describe a phenomenon starting from partial zzso This is particularly relevant for heart rate regulation modeling where a large number of zzso partial models zzso In this paper we make the original proposal of adopting a zzso zzso called zzso agency, to provide a powerful and flexible tool for combining partial models of heart rate regulation for zzso cardiac pacing zzso The partial models are embedded in autonomous zzso entities, called agents, that zzso negotiate in order to smooth their conflicts on the values of the variables forming the global model the zzso system zzso We zzso evaluate our approach and we analyze its zzso
