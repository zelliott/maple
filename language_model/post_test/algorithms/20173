In this paper, an innovative zzso zzso framework to detect sleep slow waves zzso in the human sleep electroencephalogram zzso is zzso Based on a restricted matching pursuit zzso algorithm, automatic pattern recognition of zzso is implemented using a small dictionary of zzso functions modeling the target zzso zzso zzso The method describes zzso signals in terms of zzso properties and provides detection thresholds based on the largest zzso zzso A computer software zzso of this new method was tested on a database of overnight zzso recordings collected in 15 young healthy subjects and visually scored by a trained sleep zzso In addition to full automation and fast application, the results obtained from the zzso algorithm, and evaluated using a rigorous performance evaluation zzso showed excellent agreement as compared with expert scoring, with zzso of correct zzso and a zzso of zzso in zzso time position and zzso The performances demonstrated by this new method were superior to that of a zzso detection zzso introduced earlier, with an equivalent sensitivity but a significant zzso increase in precision ( p zzso zzso By mimicking the way human processes information while scoring zzso the zzso zzso proves stable over time and zzso states, and may thus be used with virtually no human zzso
