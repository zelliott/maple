This work presents a new method for tracking and zzso along zzso objects within an image zzso One major contribution of the paper is the zzso of the notion of visible and zzso zzso For each object, we aim at tracking these two zzso Assuming that the zzso of each object is driven by a zzso law, predictions can be used to guide the successive zzso zzso these predicted areas into good and bad parts with respect to the final zzso and representing the objects with their visible and zzso parts permit handling partial and complete zzso To achieve this zzso a label is assigned to each object and an energy function representing the zzso problem is minimized via a graph cuts zzso This energy contains terms based on image zzso which enable zzso and zzso the visible parts of the zzso It also includes terms dedicated to the management of the zzso and disappearing areas, which are defined on the areas of prediction of the zzso The results on several challenging sequences prove the strength of the proposed zzso
