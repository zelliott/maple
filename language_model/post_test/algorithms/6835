The synthesis of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are reported along with their zzso values, zzso binding constants, and zzso solution zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Use of a zzso platform to zzso a zzso zzso zzso provides some advantages over other approaches to zzso models, including significant water zzso resistance to zzso and backbone zzso which may provide favorable recognition and availability to zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for both zzso and found to be significantly different, which is attributed to the differences in the zzso chain of the two zzso zzso dependent zzso equilibrium zzso were determined using a model involving the sequential zzso of the zzso zzso These results were used to calculate the formation constants, log zzso zzso zzso for zzso and log zzso zzso zzso for zzso The calculated zzso values of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso indicate that these zzso possess zzso affinities comparable to or greater than other zzso models and are zzso capable of removing zzso from zzso
