We study the dynamics of the voter and Moran processes running on top of complex network zzso where each edge has a weight depending on the degree of the zzso it zzso For each elementary zzso step the first zzso is chosen at random and the second is selected with probability zzso to the weight of the connecting zzso We present a zzso zzso approach allowing to identify conservation laws and to calculate exit probabilities along with consensus zzso In the specific case when the weight is given by the product of zzso degree raised to a power zzso we derive a rich phase zzso with the consensus time exhibiting various zzso laws depending on zzso and on the zzso of the degree distribution zzso zzso simulations give very good agreement for small values of zzso An additional zzso treatment zzso pair zzso improves the agreement with zzso but the theoretical understanding of the behavior in the limit of large zzso remains an open zzso
