The zzso action of zzso on zzso makes them effective zzso for many zzso zzso Although it is clear that zzso zzso requires transcription, the gene products that induce zzso remain zzso Using gene expression profiles of zzso cell lines and primary zzso treated with the synthetic zzso zzso we discovered that induction of zzso zzso zzso gene 8) was a common event in each model system zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion protein was sufficient to induce zzso and repression of zzso zzso using zzso interference partially inhibited zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso may be promising agents to improve the efficacy of zzso for the treatment of leukemia and zzso
