The objective of the article was to perform a zzso analysis, based on quantitative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of different medicinal compounds zzso salicylic acid, zzso zzso Given the importance of this property in medicinal chemistry, it is of interest to develop theoretical methods for its zzso The zzso selection from a pool containing more than a thousand zzso zzso zzso and electronic types of zzso was performed using the enhanced replacement zzso zzso zzso and the replacement method zzso techniques were used as reference zzso A new methodology for the selection of the optimal number of zzso to include in a model was presented and successfully used, showing that the best model should contain four zzso The best quantitative zzso relationships linear model constructed using 62 molecular structures not previously used in this type of quantitative zzso study showed good zzso zzso The root mean squared error of the 26 molecules test set was zzso The analysis of the quantitative zzso relationships model suggests that the zzso zzso depend significantly on the number of zzso atoms for zzso and on the number of zzso acids present in the zzso
