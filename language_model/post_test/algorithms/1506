A zzso method for measuring pulmonary oxygen exchange is described using a plot of inspired oxygen partial pressure zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso This method was assessed using nine normal subjects and 35 patients undergoing major surgery, including five zzso In each patient zzso was varied to produce a range of values of zzso between zzso and zzso A model based on the inspired to zzso oxygen difference involving the shunt zzso solved by simultaneous zzso methods, was used to show how the zzso zzso zzso relationship could be used to derive two parameters of oxygen exchange, the zzso difference and the zzso zzso The model allows the inspired to zzso difference in zzso to be divided into zzso an inspired to zzso zzso difference attributable to the balance between zzso ventilation and oxygen zzso zzso an zzso zzso to zzso difference attributable to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso difference attributable to true zzso which was termed zzso zzso because of the uncertainties of assuming fixed values for zzso concentration and zzso oxygen content zzso The zzso of determination showed that there was a good fit of the model to the zzso Because the method is zzso it enables zzso to different zzso values as well as the study of the evolution of changes in gas exchange under varying zzso
