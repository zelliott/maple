In animal development, the growth of a tissue or organ is timely arrested when it reaches the stereotyped correct zzso How this is robustly controlled remains poorly zzso The prevalent viewpoint, which is that zzso zzso due to their organizing roles in development, are directly responsible for growth arrest, cannot explain a number of zzso Recent findings from studies of the zzso wing have revealed that the interpretation of the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso and that cell proliferation is controlled by graded vestigial zzso These findings highlight a growth control mechanism that involves zzso regulated vestigial zzso but a question is whether they can zzso explain the observed precision and zzso of wing size zzso zzso and systematic investigation into zzso signaling using a mathematical model has zzso two zzso First, negative regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso signaling makes vestigial expression precise and zzso Second, weak zzso signaling in a primarily small wing zzso causes a short and steep zzso zzso which stimulates more cell divisions and leads to a significant expansion of the wing zzso however, strong zzso signaling in a primarily large wing zzso causes a long and smooth zzso zzso which stimulates fewer cell divisions and results in a slight expansion of the wing zzso These results substantially decipher an inherent mechanism of tissue and organ size zzso Our model explains, and is supported by, a number of experimental zzso
