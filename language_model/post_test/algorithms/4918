It has long been known that structural chemistry shows an intriguing correspondence with Classical zzso zzso zzso Under this view, an zzso zzso form of the degree zzso zzso to a chemical atom with zzso zzso and each physical zzso or zzso has an zzso zzso This theory was developed using the zzso zzso approach and the zzso processes of zzso in zzso was characterized as a potential zzso zzso zzso However, zzso has not been applied to the formal zzso of living zzso Based on the zzso interpretation of zzso form, as well as the process of zzso the First and Second Fundamental zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso we show how zzso can be applied to the structure of plants, especially when zzso as a series of plant zzso zzso We also show that the weight of the zzso that describes a zzso structure is a criterion of simplicity and, therefore, we argue that this allows us to formulate a zzso method of formal zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of zzso zzso is the simplest treatment of the grass zzso Our interpretations also represent zzso zzso of the zzso the principle of variable proportions, zzso zzso the basic types of stem zzso and zzso principle of metamorphosis in terms of zzso zzso forms of different degrees might describe any repeated module of plant zzso As bacteria, zzso and higher zzso are all generally shared a zzso zzso wider implications of the proposed symmetry between zzso and formal zzso of plants are zzso
