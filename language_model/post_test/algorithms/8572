The present paper is devoted to introducing zzso models for the relaxation function of soft biological zzso zzso models are suitable for the analysis of sampled data and for digital simulations of continuous zzso zzso models are searched for within both linear zzso structures and zzso Wiener models, consisting of an zzso element followed in cascade by a zzso zzso Both these zzso models zzso to sampling zzso exponential function series, thus preserving physical interpretation for the proposed relaxation zzso The zzso data set consists of zzso stress relaxation zzso drawn from experiments performed on samples of bovine zzso The zzso relaxation zzso are found to be almost insensitive to both the magnitude of strain and the loading direction, and so a single model for the whole relaxation zzso is zzso In order to identify the parameters of the Wiener model an zzso zzso is purposely zzso Over the zzso one, the zzso Wiener model exhibits higher capability of representing the experimental relaxation zzso over the whole observation zzso The stability of the solution for the zzso zzso is zzso and hence physical interpretation as material properties can be attached to the parameters of the zzso zzso zzso features of the Wiener model for zzso application are also briefly zzso
