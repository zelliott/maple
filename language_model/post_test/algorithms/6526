A test and a reference zzso method are usually compared for agreement based on paired data obtained from several independent zzso zzso between two methods can be classified as constant and zzso In this article, we provide an approach for maximum likelihood zzso of total bias between two methods and zzso it into constant and zzso bias for each zzso zzso zzso or zzso distribution are the conditional zzso of the response variable that we have considered here, whereas subjects are considered to be random sample from a normally distributed zzso Real data on blood cell counts and zzso are used for zzso The estimate of biases can be used to test different statistical hypotheses and/or for zzso interpretation of the zzso The zzso of total biases in terms of constant and zzso gives an insight on the sources of disagreement between two methods and helps designers and zzso define a remedial zzso
