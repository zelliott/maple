The knowledge of zzso pathways and zzso is important to understand the adaptation of organisms to their zzso and zzso zzso The specific distribution of stable isotope zzso precursors into zzso products can be taken as fingerprints of the zzso events and dynamics through the zzso zzso An zzso software is required that easily and rapidly zzso from mass zzso of zzso zzso derivatives and their fragments global isotope excess and zzso zzso 

The zzso software zzso Square Mass zzso zzso zzso is presented that processes experimental mass zzso zzso data on the basis of zzso information such as the number of atoms in the compound, mass to charge ratio zzso or zzso values of the compounds and fragments under study, and the experimental relative zzso zzso reflecting the zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso compounds, in comparison to the natural zzso in the zzso zzso The software uses zzso least square method of linear zzso As a result, global isotope zzso of the zzso or zzso under study and the zzso zzso of each zzso are obtained and zzso 

The new software provides an zzso platform that easily and rapidly converts experimental zzso patterns of zzso zzso into zzso zzso that are the basis for subsequent zzso analysis of pathways and zzso as well as for zzso zzso flux zzso
