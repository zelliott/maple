zzso zzso pursues the goal of lowering the initial investment of time and money necessary to participate in mixed reality work, bridging the gap between researchers in the field and regular computer zzso Our paper contributes to this goal by introducing the zzso a cheap tracking zzso with no significant setup zzso By itself, the zzso provides high frequency, high resolution relative position information similar to an zzso navigation system, but with significantly less zzso We present the design and zzso of the zzso analyze the impact of several design and zzso factors on tracking zzso and consider the implications of extending our zzso to different hardware zzso zzso by the performance analysis, we developed a hybrid tracker that couples the zzso with a wide area tracking zzso via a complementary Kalman zzso resulting in a powerful base for indoor and outdoor mobile mixed reality zzso To zzso the performance of the hybrid tracker and its utility within mixed reality applications is zzso
