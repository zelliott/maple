A new zzso design for zzso zzso missiles is zzso In the design of zzso a zzso zzso neural network with local learning capability and fewer tuning parameters than zzso neural networks is proposed to model the controlled zzso zzso We prove that the proposed zzso zzso neural network, which can be a universal zzso equals the expansions of rotated and scaled zzso zzso Although zzso zzso neural networks can approximate the zzso and complex systems accurately, the small approximation errors may affect the tracking performance zzso zzso by employing the zzso control theory, it is easy to zzso the effects of the approximation errors of the zzso zzso neural networks to a prescribed zzso Computer simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed zzso zzso neural zzso zzso with zzso zzso
