Discovery of new viruses has been zzso by novel deep sequencing zzso Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the zzso of the zzso However, zzso the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a zzso One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by zzso patient zzso zzso This method zzso identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery zzso To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing zzso was performed on clinical samples from 19 zzso 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral zzso Patient zzso was collected from one to several months after the acute infection zzso zzso and zzso capture material was zzso and enrichment was zzso In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from zzso viruses were enriched by zzso capture zzso between zzso to zzso in respiratory material, and zzso to zzso in zzso Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel zzso zzso In 16 of the 19 patients, zzso to zzso of the enriched reads were derived from infecting zzso In conclusion, the technique provides a novel approach to specifically identify zzso viral sequences among the bulk of sequences which are usually encountered during virus discovery zzso
