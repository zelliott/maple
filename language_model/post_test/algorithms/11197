zzso modeling is a widely used zzso zzso method, but its performance is known to deteriorate for high-pitched zzso In order to address this problem, several zzso modeling methods robust to fundamental frequency have been zzso This study compares five such previously known methods and introduces a technique, zzso Linear zzso with zzso Main zzso zzso zzso zzso temporally weighted linear prediction zzso in which the square of the prediction error is multiplied by a given zzso weighting zzso The weighting downgrades the contribution of the main zzso of the vocal tract in zzso the filter zzso zzso the resulting zzso model is affected more by the characteristics of the vocal tract leading to less biased zzso zzso By using synthetic zzso created with a physical modeling approach, the results showed that zzso yields improved zzso zzso for high-pitched sounds in comparison to the previously known methods zzso relative error in the first zzso of the vowel zzso decreased from zzso to zzso when conventional LP was replaced with zzso zzso conducted on natural zzso indicate that the zzso detected by zzso changed in a more regular manner between repetitions of different pitch than those zzso by conventional zzso
