Gas zzso zzso zzso have been used and shown utility for zzso inspection of greenhouse zzso However, a widely recognized difficulty associated with zzso application is the large and complex data generated by this zzso As a consequence, experienced analysts are often required to process this data in order to determine the zzso of the volatile organic compounds zzso of zzso Manual processing is zzso zzso intensive and may be subject to errors due to zzso The objective of this study was to assess whether or not zzso data can also be automatically processed in order to determine the zzso of crop health associated zzso in a zzso An experimental zzso that consisted of twelve data files was processed both manually and automatically to address this zzso Manual processing was based on simple peak integration while the automatic processing relied on the zzso implemented in the zzso software zzso The results of automatic processing of the experimental zzso resulted in zzso similar to that after manual zzso These results demonstrate that zzso data can be automatically processed in order to accurately determine the zzso of crop health associated zzso in a zzso When processing zzso data automatically, noise reduction, zzso baseline correction and zzso are zzso
