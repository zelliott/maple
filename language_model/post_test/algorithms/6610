zzso and accurate information about the onset of malaria zzso is essential for effective control activities in zzso zzso Early warning methods that provide earlier alerts (usually by the use of weather zzso may permit control measures to interrupt transmission earlier in the epidemic, perhaps at the expense of some level of zzso 

zzso case numbers were modeled using a zzso zzso with lagged weather factors in a zzso zzso distributed lag zzso For each week, the numbers of malaria cases were predicted using zzso obtained using all years except that for which the prediction was being zzso The effectiveness of alerts generated by the prediction system was compared against that of alerts based on observed zzso The usefulness of the prediction system was evaluated in cold and hot zzso 

The system predicts the overall pattern of cases well, yet zzso the height of the largest zzso Relative to alerts triggered by observed cases, the alerts triggered by the predicted number of cases performed slightly worse, within zzso of the detection zzso The zzso alerts were able to prevent zzso more cases at a given sensitivity in cold districts than in hot zzso 

The prediction of malaria cases using lagged weather performed well in identifying periods of increased malaria zzso zzso predictions identified zzso with reasonable accuracy and better zzso than early detection zzso therefore, the prediction of zzso zzso using weather is a plausible alternative to early detection zzso
