The aim of this study was to develop and test a robust approach to apply a joint coordinate system zzso to imaging data sets of the zzso joint and to reconstruct the zzso with six degrees of freedom zzso in order to investigate shoulder zzso related to zzso Visible human data were used to reconstruct zzso zzso Landmarks were used to define axes for zzso Cartesian coordinate frames on the zzso and zzso These were applied to a three-cylinder zzso zzso upon which the zzso zzso motions relative to the zzso were zzso Software was written that applies zzso input variables to rotate and translate the zzso of the surface geometry of the zzso relative to the zzso in a global coordinate zzso The instantaneous relative position and orientation of the zzso for a given set of variables were thus reconstructed on the bone models for zzso zzso This tool can be used for zzso animation of shoulder zzso demonstrating clinical zzso and allowing further analysis of the function of zzso within the zzso
