zzso literature has enormously grown in the last decades and become broadly available through online zzso zzso search methods, created on the basis of research field and goals, are required to enhance the quality of zzso zzso of this study was to formulate efficient, evidence-based zzso search strategies to retrieve articles assessing zzso associations between a condition of interest and zzso disorders zzso Based on expert knowledge, 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 79 free terms related to zzso were identified to search zzso Using random samples of abstracts retrieved by each term, we estimated the proportion of articles containing pertinent information and formulated two strings (one more specific, one more zzso for the detection of articles focusing on the zzso of zzso that were then applied to retrieve articles identifying possible zzso associations between zzso and three diseases zzso zzso and zzso disease) considered not associated to zzso and define the number of abstracts needed to read zzso to find one potentially pertinent zzso We propose two zzso one sensitive string derived from the combination of articles providing the largest literature coverage in the field and one specific including combined terms retrieving zzso of potentially pertinent zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for malaria, zzso and zzso for zzso disease, zzso and zzso for zzso zzso For the first time, two reliable, readily zzso strings are proposed for the retrieval of medical literature assessing putative zzso associations between zzso and other medical conditions of zzso
