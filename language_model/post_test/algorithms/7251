We have zzso zzso energy levels of zzso zzso For the potential, a Taylor expansion in normal coordinates is zzso The zzso and zzso methods and correlation consistent basis sets of zzso quality are used to determine the force zzso The zzso zzso equation was solved using both a zzso method and second order zzso zzso The Watson kinetic energy operator and a discrete variable representation were used with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sutcliffe and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso computer program to do the zzso zzso For the zzso calculations, the average absolute zzso of zzso with respect to experimental values, is less than 3 zzso zzso results are almost as zzso About 300 zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso shifts have also been calculated zzso for the lowest 75 zzso energy levels and are compared to experimental zzso
