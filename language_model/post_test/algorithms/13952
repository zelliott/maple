Relative potency is a measure that has been used for many years to zzso the comparison of zzso zzso in parallel line zzso When response zzso for two preparations are not parallel the traditional definition of relative potency no longer zzso We review the concept of relative potency and show that, in some situations, it can be given meaning for zzso zzso as the ratio of biological activity in full strength zzso zzso Under an assumption that zzso zzso result from the competition of zzso of zzso for zzso binding sites, zzso of relative potency for zzso zzso can be zzso We show that zzso of models for both parallel curve and response zzso situations may be accomplished within the framework of generalized linear zzso This zzso depends on the ability to deal with zzso parameters appearing in the link function, and an zzso zzso depending on direct zzso updates is zzso The topics discussed are illustrated with the analysis of data from two zzso conducted with veterinary zzso The models developed here depend in an essential way on the assumption of response zzso by competing zzso Our methods may not be appropriate for zzso zzso caused by other zzso
