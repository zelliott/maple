To determine the effect of zzso and geographic zzso zzso in dry age-related zzso zzso on retinal sensitivity using an eye tracking scanning laser zzso zzso 

A total of 44 eyes from 22 patients with dry age-related zzso zzso and zzso and 11 patients with zzso were zzso with scanning laser zzso zzso zzso Health, Miami, zzso A custom zzso pattern was used to evaluate retinal sensitivity to a zzso III size target zzso zzso on the zzso The zzso used a 4-2 stepladder zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso zzso were performed using a standardized zzso zzso eyes with zzso and 16 eyes with zzso were zzso 

zzso sensitivity zzso zzso was significantly reduced compared with the adjacent zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between retinal sensitivity and zzso volume, as well as the grading of the zzso inner zzso segment junction zzso In patients with zzso an absolute zzso was zzso zzso sensitivity at the margin of zzso was significantly decreased compared with the adjacent zzso zzso 

zzso laser zzso zzso is able to detect changes in retinal sensitivity in zzso patients zzso zzso and at the margin of zzso It is a useful device to grade focal retinal sensitivity in patients with dry age-related zzso zzso
