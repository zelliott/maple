Although zzso zzso zzso named zzso is widely used in the treatment of premature labor by intravenous prolonged infusion or frequent oral dosing of zzso those administrations often lower patients' quality of life zzso or cause zzso side effects, such as zzso therefore, in this study, the potential usefulness of zzso administration as a novel administration method was examined in zzso 

First, the zzso method was assessed for the determination of plasma zzso zzso Then, after zzso solution in saline was administered zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in rats, the plasma zzso profiles were investigated, and the zzso extent and rate zzso 

The present modified determination method by zzso with zzso detection zzso zzso zzso zzso was suitable to analyze the plasma level at zzso zzso administration gave the best plasma zzso profile for maintenance of an effective plasma level and fewer side zzso zzso rates calculated by zzso also supported better sustained zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso application of zzso was demonstrated to be a potentially useful dosing method in the treatment of premature labor with zzso
