A novel method for the determination of the particle contact angle at the zzso or zzso interface based on the excluded area concept revealed, in spite of its zzso some serious difficulties connected with the exact quantitative particle deposition at the interface and with changes in the particulate contact angle upon zzso zzso zzso The comprehensive theoretical consideration of the contact angle behavior made for such a system allowed considerable zzso zzso the prediction of direction of the zzso displacement at surface pressure increase is now possible and hence an zzso identification of particle zzso can be zzso zzso the zzso relation describing the dependence of the particulate contact angle on the surface tension zzso zzso was zzso allowing the prediction of whether or not particles of a given zzso will be expelled from the zzso at certain surface pressure and of the area relinquished by the displaced zzso zzso the transformation of this relation upon taking into consideration the initial conditions led to a linear dependence between excluded area and zzso surface tension allowing the determination of the particle contact angle and the exact number of deposited particles simultaneously and independently of each zzso Finally, the application of the improved approach to the previously collected experimental data yielded reasonable values for both particle contact angle and number of deposited zzso
