As a basic tool of modern biology, sequence alignment can provide us useful information in fold, function, and active site of zzso For many cases, the increased quality of sequence alignment means a better zzso The motivation of present work is to increase ability of the existing scoring zzso by considering zzso correlations zzso Based on a zzso approach, the zzso force between each pair of zzso is written out from protein zzso It results in the construction of an zzso zzso force network that describes the whole zzso interactions of each protein zzso and characterizes zzso biological properties in the zzso zzso A former work has suggested that such network can characterize the top weighted feature regarding zzso Moreover, for each zzso protein of a family, the corresponding network shares some common and representative family characters that eventually govern the conservation of biological properties during protein zzso In present work, we score such family representative characters of a protein by the zzso of its zzso zzso force network from that of zzso Such score can assist the existing scoring zzso and boost up the ability of multiple sequences zzso zzso achieving a prominent increase zzso zzso in searching the structurally alike zzso segments at a low identity zzso As the theoretical basis is different, the present scheme can assist most existing zzso and improve their efficiency zzso
