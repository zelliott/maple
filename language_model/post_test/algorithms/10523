zzso zzso followed by zzso sequencing zzso allows researchers to determine the zzso binding locations of individual zzso factors zzso at high zzso This information can be interrogated to study various aspects of zzso zzso including the mechanisms that control zzso zzso Physical interaction between zzso comprises one important aspect of zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We have developed an algorithm, spaced motif analysis zzso which is able to zzso physical interactions between the given zzso and zzso bound at zzso sites at the DNA zzso The zzso predicts zzso interactions in half of the zzso data sets we test, with the majority of these predictions supported by direct evidence from the literature or evidence of zzso High resolution motif spacing information obtained by this method can facilitate an improved understanding of individual zzso complex zzso zzso can assist researchers in zzso maximum information relating to binding mechanisms from their zzso zzso zzso zzso is available for download and interactive use as part of the zzso Suite zzso
