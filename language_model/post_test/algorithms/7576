The frame rate of the observation sequence in distributed speech recognition applications may be reduced to suit a zzso front-end zzso In order to use models trained using zzso data in the recognition of reduced zzso zzso data, we propose a method for adapting the transition probabilities of hidden zzso models zzso to match the frame rate of the zzso zzso on the recognition of clean and noisy connected digits are conducted to evaluate the proposed zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively compensate for the zzso mismatch between the training and the test zzso Using our adapted model to recognize the zzso speech data, one can significantly reduce the zzso time and achieve the same level of accuracy as that of a method, which restores the frame rate using data zzso
