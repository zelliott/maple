A new learning rule zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for processing and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a supervised learning rule that is zzso derived from the traditional zzso rule and can be used to train zzso to associate an input zzso spike pattern with a desired spike zzso zzso adaptation is driven by the error between the desired and the actual output zzso with positive errors causing long-term zzso and negative errors causing long-term zzso The amount of modification is zzso to an eligibility trace that is triggered by zzso zzso The zzso rule is both zzso efficient and biologically zzso The properties of this learning rule are investigated extensively through experimental simulations, including its learning performance, its zzso to different zzso models, its zzso against noisy conditions, its memory capacity, and the effects of its learning zzso Experimental results show that the zzso rule is capable of zzso pattern zzso and can even outperform a well studied benchmark zzso with the proposed relative confidence zzso The zzso rule is further validated on a practical example of an optical character recognition zzso The results again show that it can achieve a good recognition performance with a proper zzso Finally, a detailed discussion is provided about the zzso rule and several related zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso
