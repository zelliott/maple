This paper presents a mathematical model of a system of many coupled zzso branching from a common cortical zzso artery, and accompanying analysis of that zzso This modeling effort is a first step in understanding how zzso zzso the tendency of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso Central to the present work is the single zzso integral model (as in zzso et zzso The zzso Volumes in Mathematics and Its Applications, zzso zzso zzso zzso 2002 and in zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of the single zzso zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A second principal idea used in the present model is a zzso of model zzso zzso the work of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 66, zzso 2004) who proposed a model of two coupled zzso In this study, we couple zzso through a nearest neighbor zzso generally, our results suggest that a series of similar zzso coupled to their nearest neighbors are more prone to be found in an zzso mode, relative to a single zzso with the same zzso More specifically, we show zzso that, for N coupled identical zzso the region supporting zzso solutions in the time zzso zzso plane increases with zzso zzso simulations suggest that, if N zzso have gains and time delays that do not differ by much, the system is, again, more prone to zzso relative to a single zzso and the zzso tend to be approximately zzso and zzso We examine the effect of parameters on zzso We also examine alternative models of zzso this analysis allows us to conclude that the increased propensity of coupled zzso to zzso is a robust finding, true for several models of zzso zzso
