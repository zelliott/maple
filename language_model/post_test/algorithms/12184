A number of zzso zzso are known to contain functionally important or zzso zzso However, zzso structures are more complex than orthodox, and most methods for analyzing secondary structures do not handle zzso I present here a way to decompose and represent general secondary structures which extends the tree representation of the zzso structure, and use this to analyze the frequency of zzso in known and in random secondary zzso This comparison shows that, though a number of zzso exist, they are still relatively rare and mostly of the simpler zzso In contrast, random secondary structures tend to be heavily zzso and the number of available structures increases dramatically when allowing zzso zzso methods for structure prediction and zzso zzso identification that allow zzso are likely to be much less powerful than those that do not, unless they zzso zzso zzso
