zzso zzso transform zzso is used to record images of biological objects with zzso zzso X-ray zzso The zzso mask and the object are zzso from each other which allows us to move the field of view over a large area over the zzso Due to the separation of the mask and the sample on different X-ray windows, a gap between both windows in the zzso range typically zzso Using standard zzso transform zzso zzso images of the sample can directly be reconstructed only for gap distances within the zzso depth of zzso Here, we image zzso as function of the gap distance and demonstrate the possibility to recover zzso images via a zzso zzso zzso The limitations of our approach with respect to large zzso are mainly associated with zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso
