A new method of zzso of zzso zzso has been developed that makes use of zzso zzso gels which are capable of recording three-dimensional dose zzso The zzso data stored within the gels are measured using optical zzso zzso The zzso mechanism relies on the production of light scattering zzso which result from the zzso of acrylic zzso dispersed in the zzso The zzso of a zzso light beam caused by scattering in the zzso zzso zzso medium is directly related to the radiation dose over the range zzso zzso An optical scanner has been developed which incorporates an zzso laser, zzso zzso and a rotating gel zzso Using mirrors mounted on a translating stage, the laser beam scans across the gel between each incremental rotation of the zzso Using the set of optical density projections zzso a cross zzso image of the radiation field is then zzso zzso in the range zzso zzso can be measured to better than zzso accuracy with a spatial resolution approximately 2 zzso using the current zzso zzso This method can be used for the determination of three-dimensional dose zzso in zzso gels, including zzso of the complex zzso produced by zzso zzso dynamic wedge and zzso treatments, and for quality assurance zzso
