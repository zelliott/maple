An integrated zzso zzso zzso model describing the relationship between zzso hormone zzso and testosterone zzso after short-term administration of zzso was zzso Data from three clinical studies zzso intravenous zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso in healthy male subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso data from all studies were modeled zzso One intravenous study was used to develop the zzso model and the two other studies zzso and SC zzso were used to qualify the zzso zzso zzso follows a zzso model and exhibits zzso zzso after subcutaneous zzso Based on zzso zzso the zzso releasing hormone zzso time course was described using a zzso release zzso A zzso pool model was used to describe the zzso of zzso in the zzso and plasma zzso In zzso zzso regulates T production in zzso zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso from the pool compartment to the plasma compartment leading to decreased T zzso The plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso and T zzso zzso match well with the literature zzso The proposed zzso model reasonably described the time course of zzso and T including the zzso rebound for short-term zzso The model predicted the time course of zzso and T for the second IV and SC dosing studies very zzso However, the long term simulations from the final model did not match with literature zzso A modification is suggested based on the zzso understanding of the zzso The proposed novel modification to precursor models can be of general use for predicting long term zzso
