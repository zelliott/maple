The purpose of this study is to use a new method to assess the characteristics of sleep and zzso physical zzso in human beings by means of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso 

Forty girls and 40 boys aged 13 to 15 years, randomly selected from rural zzso wore an zzso for a 72-hour period during the dry season in 1998 and zzso An zzso already tested in another study was used to zzso calculate the characteristics of sleep and physical zzso from movement registration provided by zzso 

Adolescent girls slept for a longer time and more quietly than adolescent boys (8 hours 45 minutes versus 8 hours 9 zzso Girls were more inactive than boys (4 hours 23 minutes versus 2 hours 49 zzso zzso estimates of physical zzso period measures were excellent zzso to zzso and those of sleep period and length measures were acceptable zzso to zzso Girls and boys had the same levels of zzso except for sleep efficiency zzso 

These findings could be explained by the nature and sex division of habitual tasks within the zzso The zzso is a valid and useful zzso tool for measuring characteristics of sleep and physical zzso in zzso zzso This innovative tool opens new prospects in epidemiology and public health, especially in the worldwide epidemic of chronic diseases associated with physical zzso and sleep zzso
