At our institution the standard delivery quality assurance zzso procedure for zzso plans is accomplished with a water equivalent zzso zzso film, and zzso chamber zzso zzso Most plans deliver at most 5 zzso to the dose zzso however, recently a zzso body zzso zzso protocol has produced plans delivering zzso of 12 zzso to the film zzso zzso film zzso at a dose of zzso 7 zzso requiring a modification of our zzso procedure for zzso zzso To reduce the dose to the film plane and accommodate a possible move to zzso using zzso zzso a Teflon phantom has been constructed and zzso Our Teflon phantom is zzso in shape and of a similar design to the standard zzso The phantom was zzso scanned on the zzso system with images imported into the zzso and zzso Eclipse planning zzso Phantom images were smoothed to reduce artifacts for treatment planning zzso zzso zzso plans were delivered with film and zzso zzso against the standard zzso zzso tolerance criteria were zzso dose difference for chamber zzso and a gamma pass rate zzso zzso for film zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso dose difference, zzso zzso The phantom sufficiently reduced dose to the film plane for zzso of zzso zzso Both planning systems calculated accurate point doses in zzso with the largest differences being zzso and zzso for zzso and Rapid Arc zzso Measured dose zzso correlated well with planning system calculations zzso zzso 1 for zzso zzso These results were comparable to the standard zzso The Teflon phantom appears to be a potential option for zzso zzso zzso data show that the planning systems are capable of calculating point doses in the zzso and the dose to the film plane is reduced sufficiently to allow for a direct measured zzso without the need for dose zzso
