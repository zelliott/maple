We have developed a zzso system which models the side chain zzso of zzso in the variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso The system is written in zzso and uses an zzso database of aligned zzso structures in conjunction with a side chain zzso zzso The zzso database provides zzso clusters of side chain zzso which can be copied en masse into the model zzso The zzso database architecture zzso a navigational style of database access, necessary to assemble side chains zzso Around zzso of the model is built using side chain clusters and this eliminates much of the zzso complexity associated with many other side chain placement zzso Construction and placement of side chain clusters is guided by a zzso cost function based on a simple model of side chain packing zzso Even with a simple model, we find that a large proportion of side chain zzso are zzso zzso We expect our approach could be used with other zzso protein families, in addition to zzso both to improve the quality of model structures and to give a zzso zzso to the side chain placement zzso
