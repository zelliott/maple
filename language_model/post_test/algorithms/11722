We have developed a rigorous zzso zzso for zzso the shape properties of zzso lineage zzso We show that information about the dynamics of zzso and zzso zzso selection during the zzso immune response is contained in the shape of zzso lineage trees deduced from the responding zzso Age and tissue related differences in the selection process can be studied using this zzso Thus, tree shape analysis can be used as a means of zzso zzso immune response dynamics in various zzso
