zzso comprise a prominent structural element in several alpha zzso zzso Eight zzso were prepared as minimal zzso to investigate the relationship between the nature of the aromatic ring and affinity of these molecules for zzso zzso for alpha zzso alpha zzso was assessed by displacement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso reflected by their partition zzso between zzso and pH zzso zzso correlated well with affinity at both zzso zzso Although some compounds showed zzso affinity for zzso no zzso selectivity was zzso These results suggest that the aromatic ring enhances binding at both receptors chiefly through zzso interactions and contributes little to zzso zzso
