Based on the premise that similar surface properties between the adhesive and the zzso would yield a strong adhesive bond, zzso of acrylic acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and zzso for zzso zzso A series of linear zzso with varying feed ratios of the two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso through free radical zzso at zzso degrees C using zzso zzso as zzso The reactions were carried out in zzso under nitrogen for 24 zzso The glass transition temperatures, zzso of the zzso were determined using zzso The zzso studies were conducted to determine the effects of zzso zzso contact time between the zzso and the zzso and zzso speed on zzso performance of the zzso films using a computer zzso zzso material testing zzso The glass transition temperature of the zzso decreased with increasing zzso zzso Wet glass surface as zzso was shown not to be a good zzso model for zzso determination zzso The zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso (an almost zzso ratio in the repeat zzso yielded the highest zzso force in contact with zzso zzso zzso which was significantly greater zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso as positive zzso The zzso force for all zzso studied was significantly zzso greater than that of the negative control zzso material without zzso zzso except for the zzso zzso zzso speed increased zzso force zzso and had a more pronounced effect on the zzso performance than time of contact between the adhesive and the zzso
