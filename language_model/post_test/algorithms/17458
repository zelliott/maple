Two low-level motion models are applied to a zzso zzso a translating contrast zzso of zzso zzso zzso Both models have been used to demonstrate zzso between energy and zzso zzso and can be split into a zzso stage followed by a zzso zzso Analysis of results shows no directional bias at the zzso stage but a strong bias, indicating the correct direction of zzso motion, at the zzso zzso This demonstrates that the zzso zzso process of zzso may play a part in the detection of zzso zzso
