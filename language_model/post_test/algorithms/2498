zzso zzso which are both costly and potentially life-threatening are a major concern to patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso despite the availability of several treatment zzso This study aimed to assess the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with alternative treatment regimens for patients with severe COPD in the UK zzso 

A zzso cohort model was developed to predict lifetime costs, zzso and zzso of various combinations of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso beta zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a fully incremental zzso Patients willing and able to take zzso and those refusing or intolerant to zzso were analyzed zzso zzso was expressed as relative rate ratios of COPD zzso associated with alternative treatment regimens, taken from a mixed treatment zzso The analysis was conducted from the UK National Health Service zzso zzso zzso uncertainty was explored using one-way and zzso sensitivity zzso 

Based on the results of the fully incremental analysis a zzso frontier was determined, indicating those treatment regimens which represent the most cost-effective use of zzso zzso For zzso patients the zzso frontier suggested zzso as initial zzso Where patients continue to exacerbate and additional therapy is required, zzso + zzso can be a cost-effective option, followed by zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso versus zzso + zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso patients, comparing zzso + zzso + zzso versus zzso + zzso was zzso zzso The relative rate ratio of zzso was identified as the primary driver of zzso 

The treatment zzso recommended in UK clinical practice represents a cost-effective approach for the management of zzso The addition of zzso to the standard of care regimens is a clinical and cost-effective treatment option for patients with severe zzso who continue to exacerbate despite existing zzso zzso
