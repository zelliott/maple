A method for the correction of background zzso in flow zzso with special relevance to the zzso of low levels of cellular surface membrane zzso is zzso The method is based on the mathematical modeling of cellular zzso zzso of background zzso zzso control or irrelevant zzso zzso and total zzso zzso stained zzso zzso based on two models and utilizing only the routinely available background and total zzso zzso are developed and implemented in computer zzso These allow zzso of the zzso zzso corresponding exclusively to zzso zzso of the cell surface zzso of zzso Thus, the correction of background zzso is zzso solely with software processing of routinely available zzso no additional hardware or zzso zzso are zzso Two models were chosen to be physically plausible and to represent extremes in correlation between background and probe zzso zzso were chosen to assess the solution dependence on model and to provide bounds to the actual solution when no information on correlation is zzso zzso are presented for both computer simulations and for an actual zzso of the zzso complement zzso on human zzso to test and illustrate the zzso zzso data can be tested assuming a particular model to explore the relationship, if any, between specific and zzso zzso
