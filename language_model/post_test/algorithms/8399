We propose an alternative zzso strategy to search secondary structures based on the generalized simulated zzso zzso algorithm, by using zzso preferences based on the zzso zzso We zzso the search for zzso zzso space and apply to peptides considered to be good zzso promoters above a critical number of zzso Our strategy to obtain zzso energies consist in zzso a classical force field zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso backbone angles to the allowed regions in the zzso zzso For zzso we obtained stable zzso structures when the number of zzso were equal or exceeded 13 zzso acids zzso We also observed that the energy gap between the global minimum and the first local minimum tends to increase with the zzso zzso These zzso were generated by performing zzso zzso molecular zzso with a zzso medium zzso When compared with molecular dynamics or zzso Carlo methods, zzso can be considered the zzso
