We propose and demonstrate the novel method of zzso index zzso measurement for each layer of multilayered samples, which is based on zzso zzso in full field optical zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso image on an inner layer boundary of a multilayered sample is unintentionally blurred or zzso due to the zzso of the sample itself, but can be zzso zzso The zzso is performed by zzso shifting the image sensor plane of the system, in zzso However, by calculating the corresponding sample shift and then compared it with the actual sample shifting distance, we could extract the average zzso of the layer between any two layer boundaries within the multilayered zzso In addition, the thickness of that particular layer could be derived at the same zzso For the idea proof, several samples were prepared by zzso for each sample, two transparent plates with a gap in zzso While changing the material of the plate and filling the gap with oil, the zzso of the plate and the oil were zzso For oils of various zzso from zzso to zzso the measured zzso were well matched with the reported ones within zzso Moreover, even with a stack of various and multiple plates in front of the same oil layer, the oil zzso and the physical thickness of the oil layer were extracted with average errors of only zzso and zzso zzso
