zzso forecasting is a critical element of power system operation, involving prediction of the future level of demand to serve as the basis for supply and demand zzso This paper presents the development of a novel zzso fuzzy zzso neural network zzso model and zzso its prediction on the short-term electric load forecasting of the Power System of the Greek Island of zzso The proposed model is obtained from the traditional zzso fuzzy system by replacing the zzso part of fuzzy rules with a zzso zzso neural network zzso zzso zzso type of zzso functions have been used in the IF part of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso scheme is employed as a zzso technique to find out the initial set and adequate number of clusters and ultimately the number of zzso zzso in zzso while zzso zzso Models with the zzso zzso zzso are zzso for the definition of the zzso zzso The results corresponding to the minimum and maximum power load indicate that the proposed load forecasting model provides significantly accurate zzso compared to conventional neural networks zzso
