A mathematical description of the diffusion of zzso zzso molecules in zzso biological medium was zzso The distribution of zzso oxide in vascular smooth muscles was taken as an zzso The model makes it possible to describe the zzso zzso of NO near the surface of zzso in terms of one-dimensional zzso In the case of the constant rate of zzso oxide production in zzso an zzso expression of zzso distribution of NO concentration was zzso It was found that, if the diameter of blood vessel exceeds 800 zzso the concentration of zzso oxide on the outer border of vascular smooth muscle layer is less than the equilibrium zzso constant zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso Thus, the diffusion of zzso oxide produced in zzso is insufficient to cause a relaxation of vascular smooth muscles in zzso and zzso blood zzso In this case, the role of zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso acquires a special significance for the regulation of vessel zzso
