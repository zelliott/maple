Acute hamstring injuries are the most prevalent muscle injuries reported in zzso Despite a thorough and concentrated effort to prevent and rehabilitate hamstring injuries, injury occurrence and zzso rates have not improved over the past 28 zzso This failure is most likely due to the zzso 1) an zzso on treating the symptoms of injury, such as zzso measures of zzso with drugs and zzso 2) the risk factors investigated for hamstring injuries have not been related to the actual movements that cause hamstring injuries zzso not zzso and, 3) a zzso approach to assessment and treatment has not been zzso The purpose of this clinical commentary is to introduce a model for progression through a zzso rehabilitation following an acute hamstring zzso This model is developed from objective and quantifiable tests zzso clinical and functional zzso that are structured into a zzso zzso In addition, each step in the zzso includes a treatment zzso These protocols are meant to help the athlete to improve through each phase safely so that they can achieve the desired goals and progress through the zzso and back to their chosen zzso We hope that this zzso can serve as a foundation for future evidence based research and aid in the development of new objective and quantifiable testing zzso
