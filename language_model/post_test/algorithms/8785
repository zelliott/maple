We present a new method for reconstruction of zzso cone beam zzso zzso from an zzso set of X-ray zzso The novelty of the proposed method lies in utilizing optical flow based registration to facilitate that each zzso phase is reconstructed from the full set of acquired zzso The reconstruction of each phase thus exhibits limited zzso despite significant zzso zzso The method is fully zzso zzso an approximate zzso volume is reconstructed and an zzso registration based zzso A subsequent reconstruction pass zzso the optical flow zzso in a cost function zzso in which the X-ray projections from all zzso zzso are considered for the reconstruction of each individual zzso zzso and qualitative evaluations were performed through reconstruction of both a zzso phantom and a clinical zzso The obtained reconstructions are compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives of total variation zzso and prior image constrained compressed zzso Our studies show that the proposed method is the better overall zzso in the depiction of both moving and stationary anatomical zzso
