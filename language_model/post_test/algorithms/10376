zzso zzso approaches compare zzso drug targets based on their zzso acid sequences or derived properties, by similarity of their zzso or according to zzso interaction zzso Here we present ARTS zzso Related Target zzso as a quantitative index that estimates target similarity directly from measured affinities of a set of probe zzso This approach reduces the risk of zzso artificial target relationships from mutually inactive zzso ARTS zzso a scoring scheme that matches zzso similarity based on zzso zzso While all zzso derived target similarities have a tendency to be data zzso we demonstrate that ARTS depends less on the used data set than the commonly used zzso correlation or zzso zzso
