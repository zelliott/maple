This paper presents a novel learning method for precise eye zzso a challenge to be solved in order to improve the performance of face processing zzso Few existing approaches can directly detect and zzso eyes with arbitrary angels in predicted eye regions, face images, and original portraits at the same zzso To preserve rotation zzso property throughout the entire eye zzso zzso a zzso of zzso local features is proposed for the representation of eye zzso A heat map is then generated by zzso a zzso sparse representation zzso with a zzso detecting and locating strategy to fulfill the task of zzso zzso and precise zzso Furthermore, a series of prior information is adopted to improve the zzso precision and zzso Experimental results on three different databases show that our method is capable of effectively locating eyes in arbitrary rotation situations zzso in zzso
