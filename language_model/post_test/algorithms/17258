An efficient zzso of synaptic transmission models in realistic network simulations is an important theme of zzso zzso The amount of CPU time required to simulate synaptic interactions can increase as the square of the number of units of such networks, depending on the connectivity zzso As a consequence, any realistic description of synaptic phenomena, incorporating zzso details, is zzso highly zzso We present a consolidating zzso based on a zzso extended model of zzso zzso channels, describing short-term plasticity such as synaptic zzso The considerable zzso of simulation times makes this zzso suitable for investigating emergent collective effects of short-term depression in large-scale networks of model zzso
