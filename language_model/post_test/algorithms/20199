We introduce a new gesture recognition framework based on learning local motion signatures zzso of zzso zzso introduced by zzso Our main contribution is to propose a new zzso zzso scheme based on a reliable tracking of local zzso After the generation of these zzso zzso on one individual by tracking zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we learn a zzso of zzso zzso clusters of zzso using zzso zzso on a learning gesture video zzso Then, the zzso are zzso to a zzso of zzso by the zzso of Mutual Information zzso zzso At the final step, we compare the zzso generated for a new gesture zzso the learned zzso via the zzso neighbors zzso zzso and a novel voting zzso Our main contribution is the handling of the N to N mapping between zzso and gesture labels within the proposed voting zzso zzso have been carried out on two public gesture zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed method zzso recent state-of-the-art zzso
