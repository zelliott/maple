zzso transform infrared zzso single bounce zzso total zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso and artificial neural network zzso data analysis, was used to determine the zzso of industrial grade zzso in selected red zzso Red wine samples were artificially adulterated with industrial grade zzso over the concentration range from zzso to zzso and zzso models were developed and zzso Single bounce infrared zzso of zzso adulterated wine samples were recorded in the fingerprint zzso region, zzso zzso zzso least squares zzso and zzso first derivatives were used for quantitative analysis zzso zzso zzso to zzso while linear zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso analysis zzso were used for zzso and zzso The standard error of prediction zzso in the validation set was between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso adulterants in the different brands of red wine using zzso resulted in a zzso accuracy in the range between 94 and zzso zzso neural network analysis based on the quick back propagation network zzso and the zzso basis function network zzso zzso had zzso success rates of zzso using zzso and zzso using zzso The genetic zzso network was able to predict the zzso of zzso in wine up to an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso
