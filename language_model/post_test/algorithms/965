The minimal cost zzso zzso commonly used for quantitative coronary zzso has limitations in definition of complex zzso zzso A zzso field transform zzso zzso has been designed for the better analysis of complex zzso We compared zzso with zzso in zzso of 125 patients in the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso border definition was rated as one zzso two zzso or three zzso zzso While zzso and zzso reference diameters zzso were similar, zzso yielded smaller minimal zzso diameter zzso than zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the difference between zzso and zzso zzso increased with decreasing zzso Mean percent diameter zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso greater by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso border definition in simple zzso was similar (not significantly zzso However, in complex zzso zzso performed better zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to improve analysis of complex zzso compared to zzso zzso role in zzso trials and clinical practice deserves further zzso
