Recent advances in molecular technology are leading to the discovery of new tumor zzso that may be useful for cancer screening and early zzso zzso a potential screening zzso from the laboratory to its use in patient care may require an zzso or screening rule for its zzso An zzso that can detect the smallest zzso from a defined norm is likely to achieve the highest sensitivity, but any practical screening zzso must do so with strict controls on test specificity to avoid zzso results, and unnecessary patient alarm and zzso zzso zzso that make use of previous tumor marker values and trends are likely to obtain improvements over single threshold zzso Thus far, a few zzso screening zzso have been proposed zzso using serial zzso zzso values for the detection of prostate cancer and serial zzso values for the detection of zzso zzso but these zzso are not appropriate for novel tumor marker zzso because they rely on zzso assumptions that may not translate to the behavior of the new zzso The zzso presented here is motivated zzso zzso the need to develop an zzso for early detection using novel zzso zzso the practical demands on data and zzso zzso and zzso the need to be robust enough to accommodate a wide range of tumor growth zzso We use zzso zzso zzso statistical theory to model the trajectory of markers over time in a cohort of zzso healthy subjects, and use the estimated trajectory to produce zzso thresholds that depend on the screening history of each zzso The thresholds are chosen to give the person (or zzso a specified zzso zzso The resulting zzso is simple and can be represented in a simple graph or a zzso The statistical analysis needed to generate the zzso can be found in nearly every basic statistical zzso The zzso is highly robust and can detect a wide range of tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso screening zzso should take a central role when evaluating marker discoveries for use in zzso The zzso is particularly useful when screening with a new marker of which the behavior in the zzso period is not well zzso
