The aim of the study was to realize a mathematical model of zzso relationship in type I diabetes and test its effectiveness for the design of control zzso in external artificial zzso A new mathematical model, divided into zzso and insulin zzso was developed from the so-called zzso zzso The key feature is the representation of insulin sensitivity so as to permit the zzso of the zzso zzso applications are based on an insulin zzso zzso Clinical data were used to estimate model zzso Root mean square error between simulated and real blood zzso profiles zzso was used to evaluate system zzso zzso from zzso zzso and insulin zzso showed a good capability of the model to identify individual zzso zzso results with a zzso zzso zzso in the worst case testified the capacity of the model to accurately represent zzso relationship in type 1 diabetes allowing self tuning in real zzso
