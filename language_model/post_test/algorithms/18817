zzso factor zzso binding site discovery is an important step in understanding zzso zzso Many zzso tools have already been developed, but their success in detecting zzso motifs is still zzso We believe one of the main reasons for the low accuracy of current methods is that they do not take into account the structural aspects of zzso zzso We have previously shown that knowledge about the structural class of the zzso and information about zzso occupancy can be used to improve motif zzso Here, we demonstrate the benefits of using information about the DNA zzso stability for motif zzso We notice that, in general, the energy needed to destabilize the DNA double zzso is higher at zzso binding sites than at random DNA zzso We use this information to derive zzso zzso zzso that we incorporate into a motif finding zzso When applied to zzso zzso data, the new zzso zzso improve the performance of the motif zzso significantly when compared to zzso that do not use the energetic stability zzso
