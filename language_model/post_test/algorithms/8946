zzso development is still associated with substantial risks and difficulties as single zzso can radically change zzso properties like zzso stability, zzso or zzso Since zzso generation zzso cannot select and zzso for zzso properties which are important for zzso applications, careful sequence analysis and zzso is necessary to develop zzso that zzso the ambitious requirements of future zzso While efforts to grab the physical principles of zzso zzso properties from the very bottom are becoming increasingly powerful, the wealth of zzso available zzso sequences provides an alternative way to develop early assessment strategies for zzso using a statistical approach which is the objective of this zzso Here, zzso available sequences were used to develop zzso zzso for the framework regions of heavy and light chains of zzso of human and zzso zzso The zzso take into account position dependent probabilities of individual zzso acids but also conditional probabilities which are inevitable for sequence assessment and zzso It is shown that the zzso derived from human sequences clearly distinguish between human sequences and sequences from mice and, zzso can be used as a measure of zzso which compares a given sequence with the zzso pool of human sequences instead of comparing sequence identities to zzso zzso Following this line, it is demonstrated that, using the developed zzso zzso of an zzso can be described as a simple mathematical zzso problem and that the zzso generated framework zzso closely resemble native sequences in terms of predicted zzso
