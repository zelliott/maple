zzso engineers have widely adopted directed evolution as a design algorithm, but practitioners have not come to a consensus about the best method to evolve protein molecular zzso We previously used DNA zzso to direct the evolution of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso which are part of an active site loop, were identified in that experiment zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that site zzso zzso of these zzso zzso of the resulting library in zzso coli, and high zzso screening led to the rapid evolution of clones exhibiting increased activity in reactions with zzso zzso The zzso activities of the 14 zzso clones were zzso higher on average than that of the zzso zzso The 14 corresponding plasmids were zzso amplified by long zzso zzso with T4 DNA zzso and transformed into zzso zzso Thirteen clones exhibiting an average of zzso improvement in zzso activity were isolated in a second round of zzso One of the evolved proteins exhibited a approximately zzso improvement over the wild type in zzso zzso with zzso with a zzso inversion of zzso zzso analysis of the 13 round 2 zzso suggested that all were products of zzso zzso events that occurred during whole zzso zzso Further rounds of evolution using DNA zzso and staggered extension process zzso resulted in modest zzso These results underscore the importance of zzso interactions and demonstrate that they can be zzso through variations of the facile whole zzso zzso zzso
