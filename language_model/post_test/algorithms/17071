Digital image zzso reduces the storage requirements and network traffic on picture zzso and communications zzso zzso zzso zzso is an irreversible zzso method based on the discrete zzso transform that provides for high zzso ratios with a high degree of image zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso chest zzso were obtained on patients in an ambulatory patient setting, including 30 cases of zzso lung disease, 45 images containing combinations of lung zzso (N zzso zzso or zzso masses (N zzso zzso and 47 normal images containing none of the pathology for which we were zzso The images were digitized zzso 2 K zzso 2 K zzso zzso zzso printed on a 35 zzso zzso hard copy format, and compressed at an approximate zzso ratio of zzso Observer performance tests were conducted with five zzso using receiver operating characteristics analysis on digitized zzso and compressed hard copy zzso 

There were no significant differences between the two display conditions for the zzso of any of the zzso zzso 

Our preliminary results suggest that irreversible image zzso at ratios of zzso may be acceptable for use in digital zzso zzso
