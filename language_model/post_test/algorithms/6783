This study was designed to theoretically investigate the influence of drug release properties, characterized by the disintegration of a solid dosage form and dissolution of drug zzso on the systemic exposure of highly soluble drugs in immediate release zzso An zzso model was developed by considering disintegration of a solid dosage form, dissolution of drug zzso gastrointestinal transit flow, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso model was linked to a conventional zzso model to evaluate the effect of disintegration and dissolution on the peak exposure zzso and total exposure of area under the curve zzso zzso methods were used to solve the model zzso The simulations show that the effect of disintegration of a dosage form and dissolution of drug particles depend on the zzso of a drug, with a zzso drug having a greater zzso To provide similar exposure to an oral solution zzso a solid dosage form containing a zzso drug would need to zzso more rapidly than a solid dosage form containing a zzso zzso It was shown theoretically for poorly permeable drugs that the disintegration rate constant has to be greater than 9 zzso to approximately zzso in 30 minutes) to make both zzso and zzso ratios higher zzso ensuring the confidence zzso zzso to zzso The rapid in zzso release requirement of at least zzso dissolved in 30 minutes is sufficient for highly soluble and highly permeable zzso However, for highly soluble and poorly permeable drugs, the appropriate in zzso release requirement seems to be zzso dissolved in 30 zzso
