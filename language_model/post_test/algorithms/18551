We present a zzso approach to analyze matched zzso data with multiple disease zzso The probability of disease development is described by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The exposure distribution depends on the disease state and could vary across zzso In such a model, the number of stratum effect parameters grows in direct proportion to the sample size leading to inconsistent zzso for the parameters of interest even when one uses a retrospective conditional zzso We adopt a zzso zzso framework instead, assuming a zzso process prior with a mixing normal distribution on the distribution of the stratum zzso We also account for possible zzso in the exposure variable in our zzso The actual zzso is carried out through a zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso integration zzso The proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation and an example of a matched study on low birth weight of newborns zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2000, zzso zzso zzso with two possible disease groups matched with a control zzso
