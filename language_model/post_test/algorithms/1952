To assess the accuracy of zzso zzso delivery for treatment machine operation near allowable mechanical limits in dynamic zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso zzso speeds, and dose zzso 

Thirty zzso patient plans were created for treatment of zzso zzso and head and neck zzso on a Trilogy zzso For each patient, three zzso plans were zzso one with medium zzso zzso highest zzso speeds, and dose rates zzso zzso one with zzso allowable zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso and one with lowest zzso speeds zzso zzso zzso of dose rates zzso zzso zzso speeds zzso and zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso were zzso to test the zzso delivery zzso zzso delivery log files were acquired after delivery of each zzso zzso developed software was used to read in the original zzso zzso plan and update the plan to reflect the delivered plan by using the leaf position zzso zzso position zzso and zzso dose values zzso extracted from the zzso log zzso This modified zzso zzso plan was imported back to zzso and the delivered zzso dose map zzso Finally, the planned and delivered zzso zzso maps were compared under three criteria to evaluate the zzso zzso maximum percentage dose difference, zzso gamma analysis criteria for zzso zzso number of dose zzso having a dose difference that is greater than zzso zzso or zzso of the maximum dose, and their respective zzso 

For the three cases indicated above, zzso leaf position discrepancies between planned and delivered values are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the maximum zzso position discrepancies are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the maximum differences in delivered zzso per control point are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso percentage dose difference observed is zzso for a case where 1 zzso zzso leaves were used with high zzso leaf zzso zzso number zzso of dose zzso having a dose difference that is greater than zzso zzso and zzso of the maximum dose were zzso zzso 897 zzso and 188 zzso This also zzso to the plan utilizing the most number of 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor acceptance rates are better than zzso 

This work shows that the accuracy of zzso delivery holds across the full range of zzso speeds, leaf zzso and dose rates with small zzso uncertainties for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, caution should be exercised when using large zzso leaves in zzso A novel technique to obtain the delivered zzso dose zzso using machine log files is also zzso
