zzso is a program that matches tandem mass zzso with theoretical zzso sequences derived from a protein zzso The program uses a mass accuracy sensitive zzso score model to rank zzso zzso The zzso search software was evaluated by use of a high mass accuracy zzso and its results compared with those from zzso zzso zzso and zzso For the high mass accuracy data, zzso provided better sensitivity than zzso zzso zzso and zzso for a given specificity and the percentage of false zzso was zzso More zzso all manually validated true zzso corresponded to a unique zzso zzso The presence of decoy sequence and additional variable zzso did not significantly affect the results from the high mass accuracy zzso zzso performs well when compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with regard to search zzso zzso was also run on a distributed memory clusters and achieved search speeds of approximately 100,000 zzso per hour when searching against a complete human database with eight variable zzso The zzso is available for public searches at zzso
