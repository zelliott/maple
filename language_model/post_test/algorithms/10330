zzso molecules play important roles in cancer development and zzso The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic utility of zzso acid zzso and soluble zzso class I zzso molecules A zzso and B zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso compared with those of cancer zzso zzso zzso the most commonly available tumor marker for zzso We evaluated serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso process of zzso obtained from 148 individuals composed of normal zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared them with those of zzso We also evaluated the correlations of these zzso with tumor size, zzso or zzso stage, and tested zzso zzso to ascertain the potential zzso of these markers for the detection of zzso We also investigated the correlations among these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed significantly according to groups zzso P zzso zzso and were closely correlated with the development of zzso zzso zzso were correlated with distant zzso and zzso were correlated with zzso zzso and specificity of zzso and zzso were higher than zzso and a zzso panel using all tested markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated the best potential for detecting zzso zzso sensitivity at zzso zzso The three tested markers also showed added diagnostic zzso to overcome the limitation of zzso by differentiation of zzso from zzso conditions when zzso is zzso In conclusion, serum zzso zzso and zzso might be useful screening or differential diagnostic zzso for zzso to complement zzso
