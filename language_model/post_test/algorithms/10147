zzso of the donor pool coupled with an increasing demand for blood presents a major challenge to maintaining an adequate blood zzso zzso it has become even more important to reduce inappropriate blood use, including decisions about when and how much blood to zzso This study aimed to ascertain the levels of inappropriate practice and factors associated with zzso 

The medical records of a randomly selected sample of hospital patients in Northern Ireland who received a red blood cell zzso during 2005 zzso were zzso and inappropriate zzso and zzso criteria were zzso zzso zzso models were used to identify factors associated with inappropriate practice and zzso 

In this study zzso of zzso were considered inappropriate, occurring most commonly where the lowest zzso zzso threshold for zzso zzso Younger patients, those undergoing surgery, and those with lower zzso and higher zzso values were most likely to have an inappropriate zzso Among patients appropriately zzso zzso were zzso zzso and those of lower weight zzso were most likely to be zzso 

While the choice of criteria used to judge decisions will influence the absolute level of inappropriate or zzso reported, our findings suggest that a significant minority of clinicians are either unaware of or are reluctant to accept lower zzso zzso To improve further improve zzso practice we suggest that barriers to the zzso of recommended zzso thresholds should be examined and guidance on an appropriate zzso zzso level zzso
