To zzso three-dimensional spiral CT of the zzso tree using adequate acquisition and reconstruction parameters for spiral CT of the zzso 

zzso and quantitative assessment of different 3 D reconstructions of two test objects of the zzso tree depending on section zzso reconstruction zzso pitch, and reconstruction zzso used in spiral CT zzso zzso plus zzso of the zzso The frequency of volume and zzso artifacts was zzso The 3 D reconstructions were generated using a seeded zzso zzso zzso 

Reduction of artifacts was achieved by decreasing section zzso zzso overlap of source images, lowering the pitch factor, and application of the reconstruction zzso zzso Section thickness was the single most important factor which was mainly responsible for the occurrence of volume zzso zzso artifacts were primarily influenced by the reconstruction zzso 

zzso CT with a section thickness zzso 4 zzso is not adequate for 3 D reconstructions of the zzso zzso Overlapping source images with a pitch of 1 and the reconstruction zzso zzso can be recommended to reduce zzso
