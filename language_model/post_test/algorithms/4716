zzso of zzso zzso data sets is a zzso problem, especially for color zzso Medical zzso ultrasound zzso technology has rapidly advanced during the last few decades and scanners can now generate joint zzso scans of zzso zzso and blood flow zzso or color zzso in real zzso zzso of such data sets have to zzso convey both the relevant structures of the zzso that form the context for blood flow, as well as the distribution of blood flow zzso The narrow field of view in US data, which is often used to make real-time imaging possible, zzso volume exploration since only parts of zzso are usually zzso that is, clearly defined anatomical landmarks are zzso In addition, the noisy nature and low zzso ratio of US data make effective zzso a challenge, zzso there are currently no convincing solutions for combined US zzso and color zzso data zzso zzso displaying zzso slices out of the zzso data is still often the preferred zzso zzso We present new combinations of zzso and zzso rendering strategies for combined zzso of zzso and color zzso data, which are straightforward to zzso flexible, and suited for a wide range of US zzso
