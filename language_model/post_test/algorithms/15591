zzso zzso zzso analysis is a powerful tool for mapping and diagnosing zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso zzso primer extension zzso can be zzso zzso using DNA zzso or flow zzso with zzso as solid zzso By adding a unique zzso tag to the zzso end of the zzso primer and attaching the complementary zzso to the array or zzso surface, the zzso can be zzso Such zzso scoring of zzso requires a high level of primer zzso in order to analyze multiple zzso in one zzso thus enabling inexpensive and fast zzso zzso We present a computer program to automate the design process for the zzso zzso zzso for the reaction are automatically selected by the software, a unique DNA zzso system is generated, and the pairing of zzso and DNA tags is automatically done in a way to avoid any zzso We report results on a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso can be adapted to be a powerful tool for zzso zzso parallel zzso The software is available to academic users on zzso
