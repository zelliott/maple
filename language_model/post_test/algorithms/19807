zzso recognized in many fields including economics, engineering, zzso health sciences, technology and wildlife management, zzso sampling generates biased and zzso data but often provide the best information available for statistical zzso Different from traditional zzso data, zzso data have unique aspects resulting from their sampling zzso We exploit these unique aspects and propose a general zzso zzso method for analyzing zzso data under a class of flexible zzso transformation zzso We present new zzso zzso that can jointly estimate the zzso zzso and the baseline function zzso The zzso method under the transformation model provides an unbiased zzso regardless whether the zzso is independent or not on the zzso We establish zzso properties using the empirical processes zzso zzso studies show that under small to moderate sample sizes, the proposed procedure has smaller mean square errors than two existing zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate the zzso procedure by a real data zzso
