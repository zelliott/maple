The problem of analyzing heart rate zzso in the presence of zzso beats is zzso Based on the integral pulse frequency zzso model and the closely related heart timing zzso a new technique is introduced which zzso for the occasional presence of zzso zzso The correction technique, which involves the occurrence times of a certain number of beats preceding the zzso zzso is zzso very zzso From actual heart rate data, the results show that the new technique is associated with a much lower zzso complexity zzso reduced by a factor of about zzso than the original heart timing technique, while producing similar zzso It is also shown that the power spectrum and related clinical zzso obtained by the new technique are more accurately estimated than by other zzso
