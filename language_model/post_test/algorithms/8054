zzso automation increases the operator's workload in case of zzso and takes over more responsibility if workload becomes too zzso Two consecutive studies were conducted to construct a zzso zzso system for a professional flight simulator, based on zzso zzso zzso was varied through different stages of zzso In a first study with 18 participants, zzso responses of experimental subjects oscillated very close to the individual set point, demonstrating that workload level was adjusted as a result of zzso control, which was not the case in zzso control subjects without zzso zzso Combining zzso responses with heart rate zzso in a second study with 48 participants further enhanced the zzso power which was seen in even smaller set point zzso for the experimental compared to the zzso control zzso We conclude that the level of zzso can be adjusted to avoid zzso by combining zzso measures in a closed zzso
