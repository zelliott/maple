This paper presents a complete zzso method for zzso zzso called zzso prediction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of photographs, graphics, zzso and mixed images is achieved by ordering the data in a zzso zzso zzso applying an zzso zzso zzso zzso exploiting structural redundancies between color zzso then coding with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Color zzso and order statistics zzso are applied zzso as zzso Over a diverse image test set, the method zzso standard zzso and zzso zzso The competing zzso alternatives use block zzso and zzso in well-studied zzso A major result of this paper is that zzso coding is a viable and sometimes preferable alternative to these zzso
