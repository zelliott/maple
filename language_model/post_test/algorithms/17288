A family of finite zzso zzso filters is derived which estimate the second zzso or zzso of a digitized zzso The acceleration is obtained from zzso that are continuously fit to the signal using a least squares zzso zzso A zzso solution for the filter zzso is zzso The general approach is zzso simple, can be performed in zzso and is robust in the presence of zzso An important application of the method, that of measuring sharpness in zzso signals, is presented using the electroencephalogram zzso and zzso zzso signals as zzso Furthermore, the design method is extended to derive zzso filters for zzso derivatives of arbitrary order in digital signals of zzso or other zzso
