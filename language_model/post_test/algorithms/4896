zzso zzso zzso is a minimally invasive technique increasingly used for zzso therapy of liver zzso zzso zzso requires efficient zzso antennas that destroy tumors and a margin of healthy zzso in zzso while minimizing damage to the rest of the zzso Previously, we presented a method for zzso zzso antenna designs by zzso finite element method models of antennas with a zzso zzso genetic zzso We zzso this procedure to zzso the design of a minimally invasive choke antenna that can be used to create zzso zzso zones of adjustable size zzso 1-2 zzso by adjusting treatment zzso and a sliding structure of the zzso zzso results were validated with experiments in ex zzso bovine zzso The zzso procedure yielded antennas with reflection zzso below zzso zzso which were capable of creating zzso zzso zones up to 2 zzso in radius using 100 W input power at zzso zzso with treatment zzso under 2 zzso
