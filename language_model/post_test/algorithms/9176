A recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that zzso zzso contains a map of visual space related to zzso and spatial attention and identified this area as the likely human zzso of the lateral zzso zzso A human zzso for the zzso reach region zzso thought to zzso zzso planned hand movements, has also been recently zzso Both of these areas, originally identified in the zzso zzso have been shown to zzso space with zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of humans was used to test the hypothesis that the putative human zzso contains a zzso map recruited by finger pointing but not zzso and to test more generally for differences in the zzso maps recruited by pointing and zzso We identified multiple maps in both zzso zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso recruited for eye and hand movements, including maps not observed in previous mapping zzso Pointing and zzso maps were generally consistent within single zzso We have developed new group analysis methods for zzso data, which revealed subtle differences between pointing and zzso including zzso zzso but we did not find evidence of zzso maps of visual zzso
