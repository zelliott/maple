It is shown that the multiple alignment problem with zzso is zzso for each scoring zzso in a broad class M that includes most scoring zzso actually used in biological zzso The problem remains zzso even if sequences can only be shifted relative to each other and no internal gaps are zzso It is also shown that there is a scoring zzso zzso such that the multiple alignment problem for zzso is zzso regardless of whether or not internal gaps are zzso
