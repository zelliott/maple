A cardiovascular system zzso model and zzso identification method have previously been validated for identifying different cardiac and circulatory zzso in simulation and using zzso models of pulmonary zzso zzso with zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso However, these studies required both left and right heart zzso to collect the data required for zzso monitoring and zzso zzso invasive data set in a critical care setting although it does occur in zzso zzso use of this zzso diagnostic would require significant additional invasive sensors for some subjects, which is unacceptable in some, if not all, zzso The main goal of this study is to prove the concept of using only zzso from one side of the heart (right) in a zzso data set to identify an effective zzso model that can capture key clinical trends in zzso zzso This research extends existing methods to a reduced and minimal data set requiring only a single zzso and reducing the risk of infection and other zzso very common, typical situation in critical care patients, particularly after cardiac zzso The extended methods and assumptions that found it are developed and presented in a case study for the zzso zzso identification of zzso parameters in an animal model of induced zzso zzso This case study is used to define the impact of this minimal data set on the quality and accuracy of the model application for monitoring, detecting and diagnosing septic zzso Six zzso healthy pigs weighing zzso zzso received a zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion over a period of 30 zzso from zzso to zzso For this research, only right heart zzso were zzso Errors for the identified model are within zzso when the model is identified from data, zzso and then compared to the zzso measured data, including zzso not used in the identification process for zzso zzso all identified zzso trends match zzso and clinically and zzso expected changes, indicating that no diagnostic power is zzso This work represents a further with human subjects validation for this zzso approach to cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy guidance in monitoring zzso disease zzso The results and methods obtained can be readily extended from this case study to the other animal model results presented zzso Overall, these results provide further support for zzso proof of concept clinical testing with zzso
