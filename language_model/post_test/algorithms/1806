zzso modeling for focal species is the most widely used method for designing conservation corridors and zzso However, these linkages have been based on current zzso zzso and land cover, both of which will change with large-scale climate zzso One method to develop corridors that facilitate zzso shifting zzso is to incorporate climate models into their zzso But this approach is enormously complex and prone to error zzso It also produces zzso at a grain size zzso zzso than the grain at which conservation decisions are zzso One way to avoid these problems is to design linkages for the continuity and zzso of land zzso or recurring landscape units of relatively uniform topography and zzso This zzso approach aims to conserve the zzso of biological activity rather than the temporary occupants of those zzso In this paper, we demonstrate how land zzso can be defined in a zzso and adaptable way, and how they can be used for linkage design in the face of climate zzso We used fuzzy zzso cluster analysis to define land zzso with respect to four zzso variables zzso slope angle, solar zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis to design linkages that include one corridor per land zzso To demonstrate the flexibility of our procedures, we designed linkages using land zzso in three zzso diverse landscapes in Arizona, zzso Our procedures can use other zzso including soil zzso to define land zzso We advocate using land zzso to complement, rather than zzso existing focal species approaches to linkage zzso This approach can be used even in regions lacking land cover maps and is not affected by the bias and zzso common in species occurrence zzso
