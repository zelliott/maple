Using zzso based on point of care zzso tests can decrease blood loss and blood component zzso after cardiac zzso We wished to test the hypothesis that a management zzso based on zzso tests would reduce blood loss and blood component use after routine coronary artery surgery with zzso bypass when compared with an zzso based on routine laboratory zzso or with clinical zzso 

Patients zzso undergoing zzso coronary artery surgery with cardiac bypass were zzso into two zzso In the point of care group, the management zzso was based on information provided by three devices, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso function zzso Management in the laboratory test group depended on rapidly available laboratory zzso tests and zzso of zzso blood components only if specific criteria were zzso Blood loss and zzso was compared between these two groups and with a retrospective zzso group zzso in which management of bleeding had been according to the zzso zzso 

All three groups had similar median blood zzso The zzso of packed red blood cells zzso and blood components was greater in the zzso discretion group zzso but there was no difference in the zzso of zzso and blood components between the two zzso zzso 

Following zzso based on point of care tests or on structured clinical practice with standard laboratory tests does not decrease blood loss, but reduces the zzso of zzso and blood components after routine cardiac surgery, when compared with zzso zzso zzso surgery services should use zzso guidelines based on zzso zzso and the possible benefits of point of care testing should be tested against this zzso
