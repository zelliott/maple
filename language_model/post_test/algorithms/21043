zzso networks are increasingly being used in zzso zzso Usually, a simple equal angle zzso is used to draw such networks, producing zzso that leave much room for zzso Addressing the problem of producing better zzso of split networks, this paper presents an zzso for maximizing the area covered by the network, describes an extension of the zzso zzso to networks, looks into using a spring zzso and discusses how to construct rooted split zzso
