zzso editing is a class of zzso processing which contributes to the zzso zzso zzso zzso editing is commonly observed in higher plant zzso The in zzso mechanism of recognizing zzso zzso editing sites is still zzso In recent years, many efforts have been made to zzso predict zzso zzso editing zzso But all existing methods require using knowledge other than an zzso zzso In the present work, we propose the first method for predicting zzso zzso editing sites using only zzso sequence zzso This method was developed based on the zzso zzso combined with a zzso scoring zzso Our method can achieve zzso overall accuracy which is comparable to other zzso We also zzso found that several triplets never appear upstream near an edited zzso indicating that these triplets may protect a zzso from being zzso This discovery suggests the need for further experimental research and may be helpful in understanding the editing site recognition zzso
