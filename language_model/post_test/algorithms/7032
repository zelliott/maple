zzso arising in the graphics simulation of bone zzso and in the use of commercial libraries to create zzso models revolve on the ability to combine data defined in Volume zzso that generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso data introduced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso To address these issues the authors propose a hybrid filling technique, which also processes conflicting zzso information created by zzso or zzso zzso A graphics experiment has been designed to illustrate the problems arising in the presence of objects defined partially in Volume and partially in zzso zzso and a method to handle zzso
