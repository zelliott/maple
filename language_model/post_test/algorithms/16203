The easy path zzso transform zzso has recently been proposed by one of the authors as a tool for sparse representations of zzso functions from discrete data, in particular from image zzso The zzso is a locally zzso zzso zzso It works along pathways through the array of function values and exploits the local correlations of the given data in a simple appropriate zzso However, the zzso suffers from its zzso costs that arise from the storage of path zzso In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method for image approximation that exploits the advantages of the usual zzso product zzso transform for the representation of smooth images and uses the zzso for an efficient representation of edges and zzso zzso results show the efficiency of this zzso
