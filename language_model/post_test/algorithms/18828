zzso representing flames, water, smoke, zzso are often defined as dynamic zzso zzso because they are characterized by the redundant repetition of a pattern and zzso because this repetition is also in time and not only in zzso Dynamic textures have been modeled as linear dynamic systems by unfolding the video frames into column zzso and describing their trajectory as time zzso After the projection of the zzso onto a lower zzso space by a singular value decomposition zzso the trajectory is modeled using system identification zzso zzso is obtained by driving the system with random zzso In this paper, we show that the standard zzso can be replaced by a higher order zzso zzso originally known as Tucker zzso zzso zzso the dynamic texture as a zzso signal zzso without unfolding the video frames on column zzso This is a more natural and flexible decomposition, since it permits us to perform dimension reduction in the zzso zzso and chromatic domain, while standard zzso allows for zzso reduction zzso We show that for a comparable synthesis quality, the zzso approach requires, on average, five times less parameters than the standard zzso zzso The analysis part is more expensive, but the synthesis has the same cost as existing zzso Our technique is, thus, well suited to dynamic texture synthesis on devices limited by memory and zzso power, such as zzso or mobile zzso
