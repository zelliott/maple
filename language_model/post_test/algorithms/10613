This is a report of the assessment of the predictions made for the zzso protein structure prediction experiment conducted in 2004 in the New Fold zzso zzso There were nine protein zzso that were judged to have new folds zzso and 16 for which a similar structure was known but the sequence similarity was judged to be too low for them to be easily recognized zzso We selected all zzso targets and eight of the 16 zzso targets judged to be at the borderline between zzso and zzso for evaluation in the zzso zzso A total of 165 prediction groups submitted over zzso structural models for these zzso The quality of these models was evaluated using the zzso scores of the structural similarity detection program zzso and by visual inspection of the zzso zzso The best models submitted bore an overall similarity to the target structure for three or four of the nine zzso targets and for all but one of the zzso zzso zzso models for the zzso targets were submitted by several different zzso When both the zzso and zzso targets were considered, Baker group dominated by submitting best models for seven of the 17 targets, but 14 other groups also managed to submit best models for one or more zzso
