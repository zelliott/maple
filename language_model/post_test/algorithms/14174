The zzso concentration zzso of a drug at a specific zzso zzso should be independent of the rate of drug zzso We used this assumption to derive an zzso equilibrium rate constant zzso for zzso during induction of zzso using a target controlled infusion device zzso zzso zzso patients were induced with a target blood zzso concentration of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), while another 18 were induced with a target concentration of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The time at loss of the zzso zzso was zzso Computer simulation was used to derive the rate constant zzso that resulted in the mean zzso at loss of the zzso zzso in group 1 being equal to that in group zzso Using this population technique, we found the zzso to be zzso zzso The mean zzso effect compartment concentration at loss of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This means that to achieve a desired zzso within 3 zzso of zzso the initial target blood concentration should be set at zzso times that of the desired zzso for 1 zzso after which it should zzso to the desired zzso
