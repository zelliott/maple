This article concerns the problem of the zzso bound for tracking an extended target observed by a high resolution zzso Two types of commonly used models for extended targets and the corresponding zzso zzso lower bound zzso are zzso The first type is the zzso model which extends the state space to include parameters such as target size and zzso Thus, the extended state zzso can be estimated through the zzso obtained by a high resolution zzso The measurement zzso is also an expansion of the conventional one, and the additional zzso such as target extent can provide extra information for the zzso The second model is based on multiple target zzso each of which is an independent random draw from a spatial probability zzso As the number of zzso per frame is unknown and random, the general form of the measurement contribution to the Fisher information zzso zzso conditional on the number of zzso is zzso and an extended information reduction factor zzso approach is proposed to calculate the overall zzso and, therefore, the zzso The bound of the second extended target model is also less than that of the point model, on condition that the average number of zzso is greater than zzso zzso simulation examples of the two models are discussed and zzso
