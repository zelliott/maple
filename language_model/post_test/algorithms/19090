Gene zzso plays an important role in the organization of the bacterial zzso and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its zzso However, the controversies raised about the zzso of each of these mechanisms remind us that the cause of this gene organization remains an open zzso Models proposed to explain zzso did not take into account the function of the gene products nor the likely presence or absence of a given gene in a zzso However, zzso harbor two very different categories of zzso those genes present in a majority of organisms - persistent genes - and those present in very few organisms - rare zzso 

We show that two classes of genes are significantly clustered in bacterial zzso the highly persistent and the rare zzso The zzso of rare genes is readily explained by the selfish zzso zzso Yet, genes persistently present in bacterial zzso are also clustered and we try to understand zzso We propose a model accounting specifically for such zzso and show that zzso in a zzso with frequent gene deletion and zzso leads to the transient zzso of these zzso The model describes how clusters are created via the gene flux that continuously introduces new genes while deleting zzso We then test if known selective zzso such as zzso physical interaction or functional neighborhood, account for the stabilization of these zzso 

We show that the strong selective pressure acting on the function of persistent zzso in a permanent state of flux of genes in bacterial zzso maintaining their size fairly constant, that drives persistent genes zzso A further selective stabilization process might contribute to maintaining the zzso
