In this study, we present a novel methodology that allows reliable zzso of the magnetic resonance images zzso for accurate fully automated three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of the carotid arteries and zzso characterization of plaque zzso Our approach uses active contours to detect the zzso borders in the zzso images and the outer vessel wall borders in the zzso zzso The methodology incorporates the connecting components theory for the automated identification of the zzso region and a zzso zzso for the accurate characterization of the plaque zzso The proposed zzso method was validated in randomly selected zzso frames analyzed zzso by two expert zzso The zzso zzso of the method for the zzso and outer vessel wall was zzso and zzso respectively, while the Williams Index for all metrics was close to zzso The methodology implemented to identify the composition of the plaque was also validated in 591 images acquired from 24 zzso The obtained Cohen's k was zzso zzso for zzso zzso while the time needed to process an zzso sequence for zzso reconstruction was only 30 zzso The obtained results indicate that the proposed methodology allows reliable and automated detection of the zzso and vessel wall borders and fast and accurate characterization of plaque type in carotid zzso zzso These features render the currently presented methodology a useful tool in the clinical and research zzso
