The use of exact zzso zzso for zzso digital zzso zzso is zzso As opposed to traditional zzso methods, which use zzso to select a small subset of representative signal samples, the problem of selecting the subset is formulated in rigorous mathematical zzso This approach makes it possible to derive zzso guaranteeing the smallest possible reconstruction error when a bounded selection of signal samples is zzso The proposed model resembles well-known network models and is solved by a cubic dynamic programming zzso When applied to standard test problems, the zzso produces a compressed representation for which the distortion is about one-half of that obtained by traditional zzso zzso techniques at reasonable zzso zzso This illustrates that, in terms of the accuracy of zzso signals, existing zzso zzso for zzso zzso may be far from what is theoretically zzso The paper is an attempt to bridge this zzso
