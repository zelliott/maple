To evaluate different methods of length determination in acute displaced zzso zzso zzso 

To provide zzso conditions, 30 patients with healed zzso zzso fracture were investigated by comparing all measuring methods described in zzso The investigation included a standardized zzso zzso zzso of the zzso a zzso zzso zzso panorama zzso of the shoulder zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The difference between both zzso was also measured clinically with a zzso A zzso zzso zzso scan of the shoulder zzso was conducted with two-dimensional reconstructions of the CT scan serving as a reference zzso Shortening was determined as zzso length zzso Clinical measuring was performed by 2 observers, and zzso analyses were performed by 4 independent zzso Investigators were asked to perform repeated zzso to provide zzso zzso 

CT zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso panorama zzso of the shoulder zzso showed comparable zzso zzso for clinical zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were markedly zzso zzso with CT zzso was highest for the zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

While zzso in zzso fractures is considered an important zzso in choosing a treatment zzso a standardized method of measurement is zzso Our results suggest determining zzso length differences by taking a zzso zzso zzso
