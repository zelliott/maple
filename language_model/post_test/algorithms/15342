zzso are small cellular projections that help cells to move through and sense their zzso zzso play crucial roles in processes such as development and zzso Also, increases in zzso number or size are characteristic of many invasive zzso and are correlated with increased rates of zzso in mouse zzso Thus, one possible route to developing zzso therapies is to target factors that influence the zzso zzso zzso can be detected by eye using zzso zzso zzso and they can be manually zzso in images to zzso zzso zzso Although this approach is accurate, it is slow, tedious and not entirely zzso Manual detection is a significant barrier to the discovery and zzso of new factors that influence the zzso zzso 

Here, we present zzso an automated tool for zzso counting and measuring the length of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The method first segments the cell from the background, using a modified triangle threshold method, and then extracts the zzso using a series of zzso zzso We verified the accuracy of zzso on zzso and zzso cell images from three different labs, showing that zzso zzso counts and length estimates are highly correlated with the manual zzso We then used zzso to assess the role of a zzso zzso on zzso production in breast cancer zzso Experimental results show that zzso zzso expression leads to an increase in zzso number and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is involved in driving zzso zzso 

zzso provides accurate and objective zzso of zzso in zzso images, and will enable large scale comparative studies to assess the effects of different genetic and chemical zzso on zzso production in different cell types, including cancer cell zzso
