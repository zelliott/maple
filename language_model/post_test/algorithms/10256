To evaluate acute change of right and left zzso after zzso closure of isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 adult patients (13 zzso 8 zzso aged 28 zzso zzso range zzso years have been examined by zzso before and 24 hours after zzso closure of zzso zzso normal adult subjects, as control group were zzso A zzso echo machine equipped with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso computer-based analysis for strain and zzso were performed using zzso software based on a feature tracking zzso All patients had zzso zzso with right zzso zzso and zzso areas were larger than in zzso P zzso zzso Global right zzso zzso strain was higher P zzso zzso zzso hours after zzso closure, right zzso zzso and zzso areas were significantly zzso Right zzso global zzso zzso strain zzso P zzso zzso as well as global right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At the mean time left zzso end zzso volume and left zzso cardiac output measured by two-dimensional zzso both increased significantly P zzso zzso and zzso Global zzso strain at zzso level zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso strain of the right zzso works as indicator of right zzso function dependent on loading conditions while zzso seems to be less dependent on zzso zzso strain could be used as an indicator of left zzso response to zzso loading zzso
