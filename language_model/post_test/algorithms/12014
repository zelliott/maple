The expected role of computerized mate selection programs with regard to zzso and lifetime profitability of zzso and Jersey cattle was examined using data from 25 large registered zzso of each zzso zzso selection and mate allocation were carried out using linear programming with the following zzso 1) minimum zzso 2) maximum net merit subject to a fixed zzso zzso and 3) maximum expected lifetime profit after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso of actual zzso was similar to zzso from random zzso indicating that current zzso avoidance programs in these zzso are zzso zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, when a mate allocation program was applied with service zzso and usage levels fixed at the actual zzso zzso of mate selection programs increased when both zzso selection and mate pair allocation were zzso zzso of mean net merit with zzso restricted to a fixed level zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso led to decreases in zzso of zzso and zzso and increases in lifetime profit of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, relative to programs that ignored zzso zzso of mean expected lifetime profit after adjustment for zzso depression decreased zzso by zzso and zzso and increased lifetime profit by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated with pedigree traced to 1985 were inadequate zzso of zzso zzso estimated with zzso traced to zzso zzso selection programs cannot function zzso unless extensive historical pedigree data are available, particularly for service zzso zzso mate selection programs can reduce zzso in the next generation, which will lead to an increase in farm zzso However, if genetic diversity is to be maintained in the long term, procedures for selecting parents of zzso zzso must also be zzso
