The rapid proliferation of clinical practice guidelines zzso has made zzso increasingly useful to zzso zzso however, requires transformation of the content and logic of each zzso into a zzso zzso In this project, we sought to use a zzso database to construct a generalized zzso knowledge base for use with Internet-based decision support zzso We hypothesized that knowledge representation schemes could be developed to capture zzso content and logic within the constraints of a zzso database zzso In this paper we describe a database zzso based on a zzso model for zzso zzso using a hybrid of structured and procedural knowledge representation zzso We developed and refined this model in the context of five diverse zzso and found it zzso all necessary zzso zzso
