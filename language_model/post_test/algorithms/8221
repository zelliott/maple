The goal of Task Group 25 zzso of the zzso zzso Committee of the American Association zzso in Medicine zzso was to provide a methodology and set of procedures for a medical physicist performing clinical electron beam zzso in the nominal energy range of zzso zzso Specifically, the task group recommended procedures for acquiring basic information required for acceptance testing and treatment planning of new zzso with therapeutic electron zzso Since the publication of the zzso report, significant advances have taken place in the field of electron beam zzso the most significant being that primary standards laboratories around the world have shifted from zzso standards based on exposure or air zzso to standards based on absorbed dose to zzso The zzso has published a new zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso and electron zzso The zzso and zzso procedures recommended in this protocol are based on the absorbed dose to water zzso zzso of an zzso chamber at zzso energy, zzso together with the theoretical beam quality conversion zzso zzso for the determination of absorbed dose to water in zzso zzso and electron zzso Task Group 70 was charged to reassess and update the recommendations in zzso to bring them into alignment with report zzso and to recommend new zzso and procedures that would allow the practicing medical physicist to initiate and continue a high quality program in clinical electron beam zzso This zzso report is a supplement to the zzso report and enhances the zzso report by including new topics and topics that were not covered in depth in the zzso zzso These topics include procedures for obtaining data to commission a treatment planning computer, determining dose in zzso shaped electron fields, and commissioning of sophisticated special procedures using zzso electron zzso The use of zzso film for electrons is zzso and zzso film that is no longer available has been replaced by film that is zzso zzso zzso data are incorporated when appropriate along with enhanced tables of electron zzso zzso A larger list of clinical applications of electron beams is included in the full zzso report available at zzso zzso of the techniques in the clinical sections are not exhaustive but do describe key elements of the procedures and how to initiate these programs in the zzso There have been no major changes since the zzso report relating to zzso and zzso surface dose, use of zzso zzso or diodes, virtual source position designation, air gap corrections, zzso zzso or corrections for zzso Thus these topics are not addressed in the zzso zzso
