A zzso zzso mirror in a zzso zzso mass zzso zzso can perform first order zzso focusing of zzso initially located at a start focal plane while second order zzso focusing can be achieved using a zzso zzso The situation is quite different when an zzso source extraction field is taken into zzso In this case which is common in any practical zzso laser zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for example, cannot perform zzso focusing at zzso In this paper an zzso zzso solution for an electric field inside a one-dimensional zzso has been found to achieve universal zzso focusing of zzso having an initial zzso zzso The general solution is valid for arbitrary electric field zzso in the upstream (from the zzso source to the zzso and downstream (from the zzso to an zzso zzso regions and in a decelerating part of the zzso of a zzso zzso mass zzso The results obtained are especially useful for designing zzso zzso zzso mass zzso in which the initial zzso distribution of zzso zzso is the major limiting factor for achieving high mass zzso Using zzso expressions obtained for an arbitrary case, convenient working formulas are derived for the case of a zzso zzso with a zzso extraction zzso zzso The special case of a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso source having a low acceleration zzso (or large extraction zzso is zzso The formulas derived correct the effect of the acceleration regions in a zzso zzso source and after the zzso before detecting zzso
