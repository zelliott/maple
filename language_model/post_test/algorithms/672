Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso imaging using zzso in the zzso assessment of the vascular anatomy around the stomach before zzso zzso zzso AND zzso zzso consecutive patients scheduled for zzso zzso zzso were evaluated on zzso CT was performed at the zzso phase after a zzso IV injection of contrast zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso systems was reconstructed separately using a zzso algorithm, and the images were zzso zzso zzso for the left zzso right zzso and replaced left zzso arteries and the left gastric coronary vein was evaluated zzso by three zzso and then a surgical correlation was zzso 

In all 36 cases, the left gastric artery was correctly identified on zzso zzso In 35 of 36 cases, the right gastric artery was correctly identified, whereas in one case, the right gastric artery could not be zzso on zzso zzso because of its small zzso In 35 of 36 cases zzso one case with zzso of the left gastric coronary vein was zzso the left gastric coronary vein was correctly zzso In six cases, the replaced left zzso artery was correctly identified on zzso zzso All 36 cases underwent successful zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso zzso Both the sensitivity and positive zzso values of zzso zzso revealed zzso correct determination of the left gastric artery, replaced left zzso artery, and left gastric coronary zzso The sensitivity and positive zzso values for the right gastric artery were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso clearly revealed individual vascular zzso around the stomach and could play an important role in safely zzso the zzso zzso zzso
