zzso zzso cardiac output zzso have been a mainstay in clinical monitoring of critically ill patients for more than 30 zzso Usually the results of an arbitrarily chosen number zzso of zzso indicator injections are averaged to increase the reliability of the zzso The number of injections needed to achieve a given level of precision has, however, not previously been systematically zzso 

In 80 zzso stable patients cardiac output was determined as the average of eight injections of 10 zzso of iced zzso From the zzso zzso we examined the relationship between the number of zzso indicator injections and the precision of the resulting cardiac output zzso Furthermore, the association between the number of injections and the least zzso difference among two sets of zzso was zzso 

The current study shows that one needs to average the results of four injections to be zzso confident that the result is within zzso of the zzso cardiac output and that two series of four zzso have to differ by at least zzso before one can be sure zzso that a change in cardiac function has taken zzso
