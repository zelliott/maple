It has been shown that canine and human hearts exhibit a cardiac zzso variation of integrated zzso zzso zzso that reflects intrinsic regional zzso zzso To determine whether ultrasound tissue characterization can identify viable though stunned zzso before recovery of regional wall zzso transient zzso injury was produced in eight open chest dogs for 15 zzso followed by zzso for 2 zzso zzso variation and wall zzso were measured before zzso at 15 zzso after the onset of zzso and at selected intervals after the onset of zzso from multiple sites within the zzso zone with a novel combined two-dimensional and zzso acquisition zzso zzso variation and wall zzso were zzso from digitized zzso integrated zzso images with an zzso developed and validated for this zzso zzso and zzso of zzso variation and wall zzso were zzso zzso represents the degree of zzso of regional zzso variation or wall zzso with global zzso mechanical zzso zzso zzso variation and wall zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso With zzso zzso variation and wall zzso decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso respectively zzso less than zzso compared with zzso zzso variation recovered to baseline levels within 20 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Wall zzso remained depressed for 2 h after the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso variation in a zzso ratio expressed as delay (in zzso divided by the zzso zzso (in zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso with zzso a change consistent with mild zzso and returned to baseline zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso compared with zzso within 20 zzso after zzso zzso of wall zzso was zzso zzso zzso at zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso with zzso and remained significantly increased 2 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso compared with zzso Recovery time zzso for zzso variation and wall zzso with zzso reflected earlier restoration of zzso variation zzso zzso than of wall zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso variation recovers before wall zzso with zzso Its analysis appears to provide a useful index of the presence of viable and potentially zzso tissue in regions of stunned zzso that is independent of wall zzso
