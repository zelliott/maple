The zzso zzso activities in response to sensory input are likely signals representing different stages of sensory information zzso To understand these signals, it is critical to establish the specificity of the timing and frequency of zzso associated with sensory and zzso cognitive zzso We used a simple paired auditory stimulus paradigm for sensory gating and sought to identify zzso and zzso zzso components contributing to sensory zzso Using a discrete zzso decomposition technique we separated zzso zzso components of evoked zzso zzso by the first of two zzso zzso analyses were then used to identify the components most relevant to the suppression of the second evoked potential zzso The results suggested that beta zzso zzso a neural process associated with the strength of sensory zzso
