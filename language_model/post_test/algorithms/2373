The zzso response of bacteria is zzso by complexes containing two molecules each of a zzso zzso and the zzso signaling proteins zzso and zzso zzso in which one or the other of the proteins of this complex are zzso zzso or expressed at elevated amounts show altered zzso behavior and the zzso are difficult to interpret for some zzso zzso We have examined the possibility that these unexpected zzso might arise from the binding steps that lead to active complex zzso A limited genetic zzso was used to search for sets of binding reactions and associated binding zzso expected to give zzso zzso in zzso with experimental zzso Different sets of binding zzso and different assumptions about the activity of particular zzso complexes were zzso Computer analysis demonstrated that it is possible to obtain sets of binding zzso consistent with the observed zzso and provided a simple explanation for these zzso in terms of the distribution of active and inactive complexes formed under various zzso zzso methods of this kind offer a unique way to analyze reactions taking place inside living cells based on behavioral zzso
