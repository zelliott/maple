In this paper, the fast zzso zzso zzso was used to both eliminate noise zzso the important information coming from a zzso zzso for automotive applications, and improve the convergence rate of the filtering process based on the conventional zzso zzso The response of the zzso under test was corrupted by process and measurement noise, and the signal processing stage was carried out by using both conventional zzso which was already shown in a previous paper, and optimal zzso zzso The zzso filtering process relied on the zzso zzso filtering family, which has shown to have very good convergence and zzso properties, and here a comparative analysis between the results of the application of the conventional zzso zzso and the fast zzso zzso to solve a real-life filtering problem was carried zzso In short, in this paper the zzso zzso was tested for a zzso acceleration zzso Due to the kind of test conducted in this paper, the use of conventional filtering was discarded and the choice of one zzso filter over the other was based on the zzso ratio improvement and the convergence zzso
