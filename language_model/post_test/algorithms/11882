The purpose of this work is to calculate zzso and zzso volumes of zzso zzso zzso from two-dimensional zzso zzso images, comparing four different linear methods, and to derive zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso ejection zzso stroke volume, and cardiac output independent of the zzso zzso zzso provided high resolution images of cardiac structures and allowed accurate linear zzso The Simpson zzso proved to be the best method of calculating zzso zzso As a zzso zzso mass can be derived from zzso volume zzso This zzso method promises wide zzso in experimental comparative cardiovascular zzso
