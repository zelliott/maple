zzso of the magnitude and duration of effects of zzso zzso and zzso administered insulin on blood zzso zzso is required for improved zzso regulation in people with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso The goal of this study was to zzso these effects in people with zzso using a novel zzso 

The protocol duration was 8 hours: a 1-3 U subcutaneous zzso insulin zzso was administered and a zzso zzso meal was zzso with these zzso separated by 3-5 zzso The zzso zzso PLUS continuous zzso monitor was used to obtain SC zzso zzso every 5 minutes and zzso zzso zzso Plus was used to obtain intravenous zzso zzso every 15 zzso 

The protocol was tested on 11 subjects at zzso Diabetes Research zzso The zzso zzso zzso of variation for the best identification method was zzso The mean percentages of output variation explained by the zzso insulin and meal models were 68 and zzso respectively, with root mean square error of 14 and 10 zzso zzso zzso between the model parameters and clinical parameters were zzso 

zzso of insulin zzso and meals in time allowed unique identification of model zzso The wide zzso variation in parameters supports the notion that zzso models and thus insulin delivery zzso for people with zzso should be zzso This experimental protocol could be used to refine estimates of the correction factor and the zzso ratio used by people with zzso
