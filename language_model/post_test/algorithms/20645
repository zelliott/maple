A large number of new DNA sequences with virtually unknown functions are generated as the Human Genome Project zzso zzso it is essential to develop computer zzso that can predict the functionality of DNA segments according to their primary zzso including zzso that can predict zzso Although several zzso zzso are available, they have high zzso zzso and the rate of promoter detection needs to be improved zzso 

In this research, zzso a computer program to recognize zzso zzso zzso II zzso has been zzso Both zzso promoters and zzso sequences are used in the zzso The promoters are obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso are divided into a training set and a test zzso zzso sequences are obtained from the zzso sequence zzso and are also divided into a training set and a test zzso The first step is to search out, among all possible permutations, patterns of strings zzso zzso long, that are significantly zzso in the promoter zzso The program also searches zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have a significantly higher presence in the promoter zzso The results of the searches are stored in the zzso database, and the program zzso scores input DNA sequences according to their content of the database zzso zzso predicts zzso locations and the location of potential zzso boxes, if zzso The program can detect zzso of promoters in the training set with a zzso rate of under 1 in every 13,000 zzso and zzso of promoters in the test set with a zzso rate of under 1 in every zzso zzso zzso uses a new approach and its zzso identification rate is better compared with other available promoter recognition zzso The source code for zzso is in the zzso zzso
