Two zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso is used to identify zzso expressed proteins and may be applied to zzso zzso A limitation of this approach is the inability to detect a protein when its concentration falls below the limit of zzso zzso differential expression of proteins may be missed when the level of a protein in the cases or controls is below the limit of detection for zzso zzso Standard statistical techniques have difficulty dealing with zzso zzso To address this issue, we propose a mixture model that takes into account both detected and zzso zzso zzso proteins are classified either as zzso proteins that are not expressed in at least one zzso or zzso proteins that are expressed but are below the limit of zzso We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the mixture model, including the zzso probability of expression and mean expression zzso zzso expressed proteins can be detected by using a zzso zzso Test zzso Our simulation results, using data generated from biological experiments, show that the likelihood model has higher statistical power than standard statistical approaches to detect zzso expressed zzso An R package, zzso zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso in zzso is freely available at zzso
