zzso zzso markers for zzso association studies is an important and challenging zzso The goal is to minimize the number of markers selected for zzso in a particular platform and therefore reduce zzso cost while simultaneously maximizing the information content provided by selected zzso 

We devised an improved zzso for zzso selection using the zzso zzso zzso We first break down large marker sets into zzso pieces, where more exhaustive searches can replace the greedy zzso for zzso zzso These exhaustive searches lead to smaller zzso sets being zzso In addition, our method evaluates multiple solutions that are equivalent according to the linkage zzso criteria to accommodate additional zzso Its performance was assessed using zzso zzso 

A computer program named zzso has been developed based on this zzso The program is freely available and can be downloaded at zzso
