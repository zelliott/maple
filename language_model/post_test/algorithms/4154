zzso foot surface temperature has been identified as a clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso sensors in foot zzso zzso may allow long term monitoring of these temperatures, with compliance via the detection of periods of activity being a potential clinical zzso This study aimed to test novel designs for zzso with embedded sensing that were produced via additive manufacturing and determine if foot temperature zzso could be used to detect periods of increased zzso zzso with embedded temperature sensors were developed and tested in 10 healthy participants over four day wear zzso zzso monitoring was used to estimate energy expenditure during zzso A zzso zzso was developed to identify time periods of high activity from foot temperature zzso Group differences in estimated energy expenditure between time periods below and above the threshold were significant in both the training and validation sets zzso zzso differences were also seen at individual participant level zzso in all zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso with embedded sensing to monitor zzso surface foot temperatures during normal daily activities and for extended periods and show that periods of increased activity can be identified using foot temperature zzso
