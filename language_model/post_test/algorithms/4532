zzso association studies are widely used in biomedical research and yet only a minority of positive findings stand the test of zzso I explored the capacity of association studies to produce false positive findings and the impact of various definitions of zzso 

zzso realistic simulation data of a typical zzso approach for 10 single zzso zzso zzso in zzso a commonly studied candidate zzso 

zzso gene studies like those simulated here are highly likely to produce one or more false positive findings at alpha zzso or zzso zzso the pattern of findings can often be zzso or zzso and false positive findings zzso and confuse the literature unless the definition of replication is zzso 

zzso from single association studies constitute zzso zzso and must be interpreted with exceptional zzso For the association method to function as intended, every statistical comparison must be tracked and reported, and integrated replication is zzso zzso replication (the same zzso zzso and direction of zzso is required in the interpretation of multiple association zzso
