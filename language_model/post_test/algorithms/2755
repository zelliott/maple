Heart rate asymmetry zzso is a zzso phenomenon that reflects a systematic and zzso difference between heart rate zzso and zzso In terms of zzso zzso zzso causes the contributions from heart rate zzso to contribute more to short-term zzso than zzso and for the long-term zzso the relation is zzso The hypothesis tested in the present article is that this reversal is caused by a zzso mechanism whose function is to keep the system in relative zzso 

zzso zzso recordings from zzso young healthy volunteers were zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso Cases with both zzso and long-term zzso were considered to show zzso In the zzso test, we looked for statistically significant departures from independence in the distribution of cases possessing both types of zzso 

zzso asymmetry was observed in zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso and long-term zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso both types of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the whole zzso This result is significantly different zzso zzso zzso from the independent case zzso 

The compensation effect between the zzso and long-term zzso is present in zzso resting zzso recordings in young healthy zzso
