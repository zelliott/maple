The zzso models with passive zzso cables are often used for detailed cortical network simulations zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso For this, the compartment model based on finite volume or finite difference zzso was zzso In this paper, we propose an zzso expansion approach combined with singular zzso and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve an order of magnitude accuracy improvement with the same number of zzso Moreover, it is also shown that the proposed scheme zzso much faster to attain a given zzso zzso for a network simulation of the zzso with passive zzso cables, the proposed scheme can be an attractive alternative to the compartment model, that leads to a low order model with much higher accuracy or that zzso faster for a given zzso
