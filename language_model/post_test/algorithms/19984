zzso to the structural connections of the zzso is a frequent feature of traumatic brain injury zzso and can be a key factor in determining clinical zzso Until recently it has been difficult to zzso the extent of this damage in zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso provides a validated method to investigate traumatic zzso injury, and can be applied to zzso damage to zzso zzso zzso can also be used to assess white matter tract structure using zzso and this technique has been used to study zzso connections in the healthy zzso However, the presence of white matter injury can cause failure of zzso zzso Here, we report a method for investigating zzso connectivity that zzso the need for individual zzso We first created a template for a number of zzso connections using zzso zzso performed in ten healthy zzso This template for investigating white matter structure was validated by comparison with individual zzso in the same group, as well as in an independent control group zzso We also evaluated two methods of masking tract location using the tract skeleton generated by tract based spatial statistics, and a zzso fluid zzso zzso estimates of fractional zzso derived from the template were more strongly correlated with individual zzso when both types of masking were zzso The tract templates were then used to sample zzso measures from a group of zzso patients zzso with direct comparison performed against zzso zzso in individual zzso zzso zzso often failed to produce zzso plausible tracts in zzso zzso zzso we show that this problem increases as tracts become more damaged, and leads to zzso of the amount of traumatic zzso zzso In contrast, the tract template can be used in these cases, allowing a more accurate assessment of white matter zzso In zzso we propose a method suitable for assessing specific zzso white matter connections after zzso that is robust to the presence of varying amounts of traumatic zzso injury, as well as highlighting the potential problems of applying zzso zzso in patient zzso
