Independent component analysis zzso was used for the processing of zzso signals obtained by means of fetal zzso zzso a technique allowing the zzso recording of the weak magnetic field variations associated to the electrical activity of the fetal zzso Purpose of the present work was to verify whether a zzso zzso zzso zzso tailored to the characteristics of zzso could reconstruct reliable signals of the fetal cardiac activity during the last zzso zzso when good zzso traces are difficult to obtain although being extremely important for clinical diagnosis of severe fetal zzso Several combinations of input recordings and output components were examined in order to assess the best zzso to successfully use zzso The reconstructed traces were compared with those obtained with deterministic techniques already used for this purpose, and they showed to be stable and reliable, unaffected by overlapped maternal and fetal beats and suitable for clinical zzso
