The Perfect zzso zzso zzso problem is one of the many zzso approaches to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Though there are many zzso solutions to the zzso problem, the complexity of the zzso problem itself has remained an open zzso In this paper, We introduce the zzso data structure that represents all the solutions for a zzso zzso We also introduce zzso that arranges the zzso in a more manageable zzso The column ordering, the zzso data structure and the row ordering together make the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also present some results on simulated data which demonstrate that the zzso zzso performs quiet impressively when compared to the earlier zzso zzso
