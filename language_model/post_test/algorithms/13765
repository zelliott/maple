We have recently proposed a method, based on artificial neural networks zzso to cluster protein sequences into families according to their degree of sequence zzso The network was trained with an zzso learning algorithm, zzso as zzso zzso patterns derived from the zzso composition of the protein zzso We describe here some further improvements to that zzso First, we propose a statistical method to cluster a set of zzso zzso into zzso It consists of three zzso zzso principal component analysis, zzso determination of the optimal number M of clusters and zzso final zzso of the zzso zzso into M zzso Using a set of zzso protein zzso we show that the zzso given by the statistical method is in agreement with biological zzso We also show that the resulting zzso is very similar to the one previously obtained with the ANN zzso Finally, we propose a new hybrid method of the statistical and ANN approaches, in which the results of the statistical method are used to choose the number of zzso and zzso of the zzso We show that a network built in this way, and fed with a few principal components of the set of zzso zzso as input signals, can be trained in an extremely short computing zzso The resulting zzso maps do not essentially differ from the ones obtained with the initial ANN zzso
