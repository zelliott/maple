The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between bone levels observed on dental panoramic zzso zzso and the zzso recommended zzso screening zzso the community zzso index of treatment needs zzso Computer enhancement and digital analysis were used to improve accuracy and zzso A total of 199 zzso zzso on zzso zzso from 50 patients (29 female and 21 zzso with a mean age of 42 were zzso A statistically significant relationship was found between zzso and zzso measurement from the zzso junction to the zzso zzso bone margin zzso The relationship between A and zzso was found to fit the following zzso square root of A zzso beta 1 + zzso where, F is constant and beta 1 is the zzso corresponding to the i the codes of zzso It was concluded that there was a close correlation between the zzso screening codes and bone loss as measured on the zzso zzso
