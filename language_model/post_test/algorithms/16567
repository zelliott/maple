To compare paralyzed zzso force properties and zzso zzso loads in an upright functional task during conventional zzso stimulation and force zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Research zzso 

zzso zzso 12 men, 1 woman) with zzso spinal zzso zzso 

zzso performed 2 bouts of 60 zzso zzso zzso while supported in a standing zzso On separate days, subjects received zzso stimulation at zzso zzso or zzso stimulation triggered by a change in force zzso During zzso a computer zzso responded to each zzso reduction in force with a zzso increase in stimulation zzso 

A zzso model was used to derive zzso loads on the zzso with a target starting dose of load equal to zzso times body zzso 

Peak zzso force and fatigue index were higher for zzso than zzso zzso zzso force decline was greater during zzso zzso but mean force remained above zzso values zzso As fatigue developed during repetitive zzso zzso was superior to zzso for maintenance of zzso zzso loads zzso 

zzso stimulation in zzso activated stance is a viable method to maximize the zzso performance of paralyzed zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso yielded zzso loads that were closer to a targeted dose of stress with known zzso zzso zzso of muscle force with zzso may be a useful tactic for future zzso zzso zzso
