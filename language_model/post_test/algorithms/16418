To investigate steering the volume of activated tissue zzso with deep brain stimulation zzso using a novel high zzso lead zzso 

We examined the effect of zzso zzso across the zzso on the zzso These predictions were then evaluated acutely in a zzso zzso implanted with the zzso using motor zzso thresholds as the metric for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso show the zzso with zzso arranged together in a zzso zzso can generate field zzso equivalent to commercial zzso zzso and these field zzso can be modulated using zzso zzso zzso with implanted zzso showed zzso muscle zzso presumably through spread of stimulation fields into portions of the zzso tract lying in the internal zzso 

Our zzso and experimental studies demonstrate that the zzso is capable of zzso selective zzso zzso zzso away from the zzso axis can be achieved using a single simple and intuitive control zzso 

zzso zzso likely requires zzso zzso that may zzso affect a nucleus or fiber zzso The zzso allows positioning zzso with zzso precision, which is especially relevant for those patients with zzso leads placed in zzso zzso This may present clinicians with an additional degree of freedom to zzso the zzso zzso
