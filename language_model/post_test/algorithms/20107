We describe two zzso to diagnose zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso consecutive zzso zzso excised to exclude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 119 zzso 67 pigmented facial zzso and 42 other skin zzso were zzso by zzso zzso features were correlated with pathology diagnosis to develop diagnostic zzso The diagnostic accuracy of the zzso zzso defined on zzso analysis of the training set zzso and tested on the remaining cases was zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso Positive features were polarized zzso features, zzso and convoluted vessels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to horizontal zzso zzso features were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso layer, and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis on the training set zzso the zzso identified seven independently significant features for zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of the zzso zzso on the test set was zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso The four invasive zzso that were zzso by zzso were all of zzso zzso zzso is a highly accurate zzso technique for zzso zzso Good diagnostic accuracy was achieved also for zzso diagnosis, although rare zzso of zzso tumors may limit the strict application of the zzso
