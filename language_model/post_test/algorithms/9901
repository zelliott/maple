zzso effects of a zzso intelligent tutoring system in zzso on student zzso goals and solution zzso zzso if limited enforcement in a medical tutoring system zzso students from learning the optimal and most efficient solution zzso zzso the type of zzso from the optimal solution path that occur during tutoring, and how these zzso change over zzso zzso if the size of the zzso zzso zzso has an effect on learning gains when using a tutor with limited zzso 

zzso data zzso from 44 pathology residents using zzso Medical zzso zzso System in zzso that teaches zzso diagnosis and reporting skills based on commonly used diagnostic zzso Two zzso were included in the study representing zzso of different sizes and zzso zzso of the tutoring system on student zzso goal states and solution paths were zzso 

Students gradually increase the frequency of steps that match the tutoring system's expectation of expert zzso zzso of errors gradually declines in all categories of error zzso Student performance frequently differs from the zzso optimal zzso However, as students continue to be zzso they approach the optimal solution zzso Performance in both zzso was similar for both errors and goal zzso However, the rate at which students progress toward the optimal solution path differs between the two zzso zzso in superficial zzso zzso the larger and more complex domain was associated with a slower rate of approximation towards the optimal solution zzso 

Students benefit from a zzso tutoring system that zzso diagnostic zzso but does not prevent alternative zzso Even with limited enforcement, students zzso toward the optimal solution zzso
