A technique for automatic retrospective correction of motion artifacts on magnetic resonance zzso images was developed that uses only the raw zzso data from the MR zzso and requires no knowledge of patient motion during the zzso The zzso was tested on zzso images of the rotator cuff in a series of 144 patients, and the improvements in image quality were similar to those achieved with zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso can significantly reduce motion artifacts in a technically demanding MR imaging zzso
