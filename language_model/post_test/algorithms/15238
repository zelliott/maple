zzso zzso imaging zzso is a new method of magnetic resonance imaging zzso that provides zzso information that is not available in conventional diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso requires data acquisition at multiple zzso for zzso zzso this process is usually zzso zzso fewer zzso are preferable to zzso zzso In this study, we carefully evaluated various acquisition zzso using different numbers and combinations of zzso Acquisition zzso that sampled zzso that were distributed to two ends were zzso Compared to conventional zzso using equally spaced zzso zzso zzso zzso require fewer zzso to minimize fitting errors in zzso zzso and may thus significantly reduce scanning zzso Following a ranked list of zzso zzso resulted from the zzso we recommend the zzso zzso based on its zzso accuracy and time efficiency, which needs data from only 3 zzso at 0, around 800 and around zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso analysis with human zzso zzso support the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in practical clinical zzso
