A model of zzso dynamics within a water column was analyzed with special consideration on the existence of a zzso set in the zzso zzso We considered two resources, light and a limiting zzso for zzso growth and assumed that the water column is separated into two layers by zzso and/or density zzso It was shown that there exists a zzso set in the zzso space when the growth function meets several conditions that are general for growth functions of two essential zzso Specifically, these conditions include that a less abundant of the two resources limits the growth while the effect of the other is sufficiently zzso zzso structure with two stable states separated by one unstable state appears in the catastrophe zzso when parameters move to a certain direction with a certain zzso from a point in the zzso zzso These results suggest that occurrence of zzso transition between two alternative vertical patterns is possible nature of zzso dynamics within a zzso water zzso
