Patients are eligible for zzso onto a phase I zzso zzso vaccine clinical trial if their zzso and zzso zzso achieves a minimum viable cell zzso Because zzso zzso and cell count determination are expensive, there has been developed a screening procedure based on zzso mass to screen out those zzso unlikely to yield sufficient viable zzso If zzso is the ratio of the expected benefit of an zzso onto the study to the cost of zzso zzso and cell zzso then we maximize long-run benefit by zzso and counting only those zzso whose masses exceed a zzso zzso such that zzso zzso cells masses zzso zzso zzso zzso We derive zzso for zzso zzso and evaluate them under a variety of assumptions concerning the cell zzso zzso These include explicit equations for zzso under zzso assumptions as well as more general zzso based on zzso smoothing zzso We show that when zzso deviates substantially from 2, these methods outperform simple inverse zzso
