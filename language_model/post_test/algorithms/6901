Recent studies have shown that younger women are more likely to die during and after hospitalization for acute zzso zzso zzso than older women and men of all zzso This may be partly due to incorrect diagnosis or late detection of acute zzso in younger zzso At high specificity levels zzso the sensitivity of the initial zzso to detect acute zzso may be as low as zzso when using traditional criteria by both physicians and computerized interpretation zzso This study examines if women of different age groups have a similar zzso presentation to men during acute inferior zzso and if the diagnostic zzso of the initial zzso are zzso We analyzed chest pain zzso from Mayo Clinic and Medical College of Wisconsin, which included zzso patients with acute inferior zzso and zzso zzso controls with zzso chest zzso We subdivided all groups by age zzso and above 60 zzso and compared zzso parameters zzso zzso ST depression, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duration and zzso zzso zzso between zzso For inferior zzso patients under age 60, women had lower ST zzso at the J point in lead II than men zzso zzso 91 zzso zzso 86 zzso 117 zzso P zzso zzso This trend was reversed for patients over age 60 zzso a zzso 102 zzso 126 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Lead zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A neural network method was used to identify the most significant group of zzso parameters for detecting acute zzso An zzso fuzzy logic method was developed for adapting to the threshold differences among the different gender and age zzso The new zzso improved the sensitivity of acute inferior zzso detection by more than zzso relative to old algorithm, while maintaining the high specificity around zzso for zzso chest pain zzso
