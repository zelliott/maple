The zzso group is one of the finite zzso of the rotation group in 3-D zzso space and a symmetry group of the cubic zzso zzso and filtering of 3-D volumes are given as application examples of its representation zzso We give an overview over the finite zzso of the 3-D rotation group and their zzso We zzso properties of the zzso group and basic results from its representation zzso zzso stationary processes are processes with group theoretical zzso whose principal components are closely related to the representation theory of their symmetry zzso Linear filter systems are defined as projection operators and zzso filter systems are zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso are implemented in zzso functions and zzso In the experimental part, we use two publicly available zzso zzso It is shown that the assumption of zzso zzso is realistic and the true principal components of the correlation zzso are very well zzso by the group theoretically predicted zzso We illustrate the nature of the different types of filter systems, their zzso and transformation zzso Finally, we show how zzso in the transform domain can be used in 3-D signal zzso
