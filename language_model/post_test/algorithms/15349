Container closure integrity is a critical factor for maintaining product zzso and zzso zzso closure systems zzso in vials, zzso and zzso are designed to provide a seal between rubber zzso and glass zzso To ensure that the contained product has maintained its zzso and stability at the time of deployment, the seal must remain intact within acceptable zzso To this end, a mathematical model has been developed to describe vacuum loss in evacuated drug zzso The model zzso equivalent leak diameter corresponding to initial air leak rate as well as vacuum loss as a function of time and vial zzso The theory accounts for three flow regimes that may be zzso zzso leak rates from zzso to zzso zzso zzso cubic zzso per zzso were investigated for zzso ranging from 1 to zzso zzso leak diameters of zzso were zzso The time for a vial to lose half of its zzso the zzso value, ranged from many years at the lowest leak rates and largest vials, to zzso of a second at the highest leak rates and smallest zzso These results may be used to determine what level of initial vacuum leak is acceptable for a given zzso
