zzso with suspected deep vein zzso zzso have zzso signs and zzso zzso zzso diagnosis may result in fatal pulmonary zzso Since many patients may have zzso a selective and efficient diagnostic process is zzso 

To systematically review trials that determined the prevalence of zzso using clinical prediction rules either with or without zzso for the diagnosis of zzso 

zzso and zzso studies were identified from zzso from 1990 to July 2004 and supplemented by a review of all relevant zzso 

We included studies that zzso enrolled zzso zzso zzso with suspected zzso and applied clinical prediction rules before zzso testing or diagnostic zzso All studies included sufficient information to allow the calculation of the prevalence of zzso for at least 1 of the 3 clinical probability estimates zzso moderate, or zzso We required that patients be followed up for a minimum zzso zzso Unless the clinical model incorporated prior zzso studies were excluded if patients with a history of prior zzso were zzso 

Two zzso independently reviewed and zzso data for zzso the prevalence of zzso sensitivity, zzso and likelihood ratios zzso of zzso in each of the 3 clinical probability zzso Data for the zzso in all studies were pooled and analyzed as zzso test or a zzso zzso 

Fourteen studies involving more than 8000 patients used 1 clinical prediction rule for diagnosing zzso of which 11 incorporated zzso testing in the diagnostic zzso The prevalence of zzso in the low, moderate, and high clinical probability groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall prevalence of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all studies, the sensitivity, zzso and negative zzso of zzso testing in the low probability group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the moderate probability group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the high probability group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for a normal result on a high or moderately sensitive zzso zzso among patients with: zzso low clinical suspicion were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate clinical suspicion were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso high clinical suspicion were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso accuracy for zzso improves when clinical probability is estimated before diagnostic zzso Patients with low clinical probability on the zzso rule have prevalence of zzso of less than zzso In zzso patients with negative zzso results, diagnosis of zzso can be excluded without zzso in patients with high clinical suspicion for zzso results should not affect clinical zzso
