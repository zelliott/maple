We introduce a zzso model that combines a zzso with an extra reinforcement signal zzso zzso the probability of an erroneous feedback being delivered by the zzso This representation zzso the class probabilities given the task related features and the reinforcement zzso Using expectation zzso zzso to estimate the zzso values under such a model shows that some existing zzso zzso are particular cases of such an zzso zzso Further, we present a new zzso for zzso zzso which we call constrained means zzso zzso and show using zzso data and simulated zzso that this zzso is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art zzso zzso
