An zzso solution for the zzso zzso rate of association of a protein with a specific site on a circular DNA is zzso zzso binding is modeled by a short-range attractive surface zzso The protein zzso diffusion in the bulk solution and in the surface zzso The association rate for a circular DNA is compared to the counterpart for a linear DNA, in which the ends of the surface layer are treated as zzso As expected, when the DNA length is long, the shape of the DNA does not affect the association zzso For a shorter zzso the association rate for the linear DNA is modestly higher than the circular zzso The higher rate of the linear DNA is possibly due to its more open shape, which zzso it a higher ability to draw the protein from the bulk to its zzso The zzso solution is verified by zzso dynamics zzso
