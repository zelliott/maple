zzso new molecular graphics program, zzso a combination of standard zzso developed for molecular systems as well as various ray casting techniques to produce highly realistic images on inexpensive zzso zzso The program produces images of zzso ball and stick or stick models derived from a zzso coordinate zzso The most notable new feature of zzso is a simple, yet effective, zzso for the improved treatment of shadows within a zzso This new zzso is based upon a calculation of a light pyramid at each point under zzso zzso of various objects with this light pyramid will decrease the percentage of the light that can reach the zzso If the entire zzso is zzso the point will be in the zzso of the zzso if only a portion of the light is zzso the point will be in the zzso of the zzso
