Recently we considered a zzso discrete model which describes fronts of cells invading a wound zzso zzso zzso zzso Sander, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 209 zzso In the model cells can move, zzso and experience zzso zzso In this work we focus on a zzso description of this phenomenon by means of a generalized zzso equation zzso with a proliferation zzso As in the discrete model, there are two interesting zzso For zzso zzso there are zzso zzso fronts, similar to those of the zzso zzso The problem of front zzso selection is zzso and our theoretical predictions are in the good agreement with a zzso solution of the zzso zzso For zzso zzso there is a zzso transient behavior, where density profile exhibits a secondary zzso To analyze this regime, we investigated relaxation dynamics for the zzso equation without zzso We found that the relaxation process exhibits zzso zzso The results of zzso and discrete models are in good agreement with each other for the different regimes we zzso
