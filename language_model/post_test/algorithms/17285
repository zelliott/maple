The zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso uses a small electrical current to enhance delivery of zzso to systemic zzso zzso doses can be administered by periodic application of the zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the frequency of intermittent drug delivery by zzso zzso and compare the drug delivery to systemic circulation by zzso zzso with intravenous zzso The topical safety was also determined for the zzso zzso zzso Nine adult male volunteers completed this zzso randomized, zzso crossover zzso zzso zzso treatments with 200 zzso direct current applied for 30 zzso at frequent zzso or zzso zzso intervals over a zzso period were zzso Also, the drug delivery to systemic circulation from zzso zzso was compared with intravenous zzso 75 zzso infused over 30 zzso every 4 h over a 24-hour zzso The mean serum zzso concentration achieved with the hourly zzso zzso regimen was higher than that for the zzso zzso zzso regimen as expected from the higher frequency of drug zzso The amount of zzso delivered estimated per dose from the zzso zzso system using the zzso zzso treatment as the reference was similar for the two zzso regimens throughout the dosing zzso This indicates consistent drug delivery regardless of the frequency of zzso zzso The majority of subjects reported either no, or barely zzso zzso 24 h after removal of the zzso
