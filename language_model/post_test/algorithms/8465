Currently there is no simple clinical method for zzso the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso border zzso however, may be combined with zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso zzso We investigated the feasibility of zzso display and sampling of zzso zzso zzso by such an zzso For this purpose we used a new zzso digital echo zzso zzso method in combination with zzso pressures zzso and in zzso 

zzso patients were screened by conventional zzso and zzso Ten of the patients with high quality images were included in the zzso Left zzso pressures and volumes were recorded simultaneously and were displayed zzso as zzso zzso Changes in zzso volume were induced by intravenous zzso Left zzso chamber compliance was estimated as change in volume divided by change in pressure from minimum zzso pressure to zzso pressure zzso zzso chamber zzso 

Left zzso zzso zzso were displayed zzso during the zzso When compared with the zzso method, zzso underestimated zzso volume zzso by zzso and overestimated zzso volume zzso by zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Volume loading increased zzso zzso pressure zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 79 zzso 10 to 85 zzso 11 zzso zzso and decreased zzso chamber compliance from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The current study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso can be displayed and evaluated in real-time during routine cardiac zzso This may represent a clinically useful method for identifying patients with reduced chamber zzso The zzso of the volumes by zzso compared with the zzso method suggests that further refinements should be performed to improve the zzso border detection zzso
