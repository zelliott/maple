zzso flow zzso reserve is obtained by manual zzso of zzso coronary zzso flow zzso profiles as the ratio of stress versus baseline zzso peak zzso This approach introduces zzso in the zzso and limits the information which could be exploited from the zzso zzso zzso zzso our goals were to develop a technique for nearly automated detection of zzso coronary flow zzso profile, and automatically zzso both conventional and additional zzso zzso and zzso zzso and validate it with manual zzso A total of 100 patients (17 zzso 15 patients with severe coronary zzso 41 with zzso tissue disease and 27 with diabetes zzso were zzso Linear correlation and zzso analyses showed that the proposed method was highly accurate and zzso compared to the manual zzso zzso between groups evidenced significant differences in some of the automated zzso thus representing potentially additional zzso useful for the zzso diagnosis of zzso or coronary artery zzso
