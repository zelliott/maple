Response of zzso zzso discs under different filter regions of a zzso based zzso zzso system was simulated to zzso zzso beams in the energy range of zzso zzso to 24 zzso ( approximately 9 zzso This was done using zzso zzso Carlo code and also zzso verified for some energy zzso Response of disc D1 under metal filter combination was found to increase with zzso energy, whereas that for the discs under polystyrene filter and open window regions of the zzso decreases zzso The changes in the response of the discs under polystyrene filter and open window were attributed to the lack of zzso zzso The increase in the response of disc D1 was due to the contribution from secondary electrons produced through Compton and pair production processes mainly arising out from the metal filter zzso The knowledge of the change in the response of individual discs and the ratio of zzso responses under different filter regions of the zzso system could be used for the measurement of energy of zzso radiation that exists in and around zzso electron accelerator and could be used for accurate evaluation of personal dose equivalent in zzso zzso zzso
