In zzso zzso delivery of zzso across the zzso was zzso The experiment was carried out at three different donor drug zzso using zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso with corresponding passive zzso At all concentration levels, zzso showed enhanced zzso rate compared to passive controls zzso For passive zzso the zzso flux significantly increased with the increase in donor drug concentration zzso zzso process followed zzso profile while the profile was zzso in zzso Competition by zzso zzso released in the zzso compartment could be the zzso zzso enhancement was highest at the lowest drug load and lowest at the highest drug zzso The target flux of zzso was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso As the highest flux obtained was zzso zzso zzso zzso it can be said that zzso is a promising candidate for zzso zzso
