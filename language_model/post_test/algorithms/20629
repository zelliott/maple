zzso techniques for modeling the zzso of random variables have been explored in a variety of different areas, including statistics, statistical physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image processing, and zzso zzso for manipulating these models have been developed relatively independently in these research zzso In this paper we explore hidden zzso models zzso and related structures within the general framework of zzso independence networks zzso The paper presents a self-contained review of the basic principles of zzso It is shown that the well-known zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso are special cases of more general zzso zzso for arbitrary zzso Furthermore, the existence of zzso and zzso zzso for more general zzso models provides a set of analysis tools for zzso practitioners who wish to explore a richer class of zzso zzso Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and zzso in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the zzso model framework to illustrate the advantages of the general zzso
