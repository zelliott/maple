zzso regulation is a fundamental mechanism of living cells, which allows them to determine their actions and properties, by selectively choosing which proteins to express and by zzso controlling the amounts of those zzso In this article, we revisit the problem of zzso modeling zzso zzso First, we adopt a biologically motivated continuous model for gene zzso and zzso translation, based on zzso rate zzso coupled with a set of zzso equations that model zzso Then, we view the processes of zzso and translation as being zzso which, together with the need to use zzso techniques for large-scale analysis and zzso motivates us to model zzso regulation by means of a zzso discrete zzso zzso Classical arguments from chemical zzso allow us to specify the zzso underlying zzso and to include both zzso and zzso as well as the notion of regulatory zzso in our zzso We show that the zzso behavior of the proposed discrete zzso system is identical to that of the continuous zzso We discuss several aspects of our model, related to zzso and zzso regulation as well as to zzso networks, and elaborate on their zzso zzso of zzso regulation of a hypothetical zzso zzso illustrate several properties of our model, and demonstrate that a zzso discrete zzso system may be effectively used to model zzso regulation in a biologically relevant zzso
