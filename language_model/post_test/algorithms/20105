The efficacy of complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as additional zzso modification in zzso zzso zzso patients has been shown to be highly zzso Recently, the zzso of sequential zzso mapping has been challenged by concerns regarding zzso stability of zzso zzso studies on zzso stability are small with very different zzso zzso Here, we undertook a systematic literature review to address these controversial zzso 

A systematic search of the scientific literature was performed through to September 1, zzso From a total of 162 zzso 7 were identified to contain assessment of the zzso stability of zzso in human zzso These studies included a total of 96 zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso male, mean 58 years zzso zzso zzso mapping techniques or definitions were zzso zzso stability averaged zzso between 2 zzso sequential zzso maps over an average time zzso of 19 zzso However, zzso stability only averaged at zzso from shorter term continuous recordings zzso 15 comparisons within 75 zzso Although the zzso in zzso cycle length was small zzso zzso zzso of variation in continuous electrical activity were high (up to zzso The overall spatial distribution of zzso was found to be zzso Nevertheless, sequential mapping may not capture all zzso sites given their dynamic zzso 

zzso are temporally variable in keeping with the diverse mechanisms underlying their zzso The dynamic nature of zzso will continue to pose a challenge for zzso in search of critical sites requiring zzso to combat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso September zzso
