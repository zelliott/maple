zzso in a gene regulatory network is used to avoid zzso states, such as those associated with a zzso Several types of intervention have been studied in the framework of a zzso zzso network zzso which is a collection of zzso networks in which the gene state zzso transitions according to the rules of one of the constituent networks and where network choice is governed by a selection zzso The theory of automatic control has been applied to find optimal strategies for manipulating external control variables that affect the transition probabilities to zzso affect dynamic evolution over a finite time zzso In this paper we treat a case in which we lack the governing probability structure for zzso network selection, so we simply have a family of zzso networks, but where these networks possess a common zzso zzso This zzso to the situation in which network construction is treated as an zzso inverse problem in which there are many zzso networks created from the data under the constraint that they all possess zzso structures matching the data states, which are assumed to arise from sampling the steady state of the real biological zzso 

Given a family of zzso networks possessing a common zzso structure composed of singleton zzso a control zzso is derived by minimizing a composite zzso cost function that is a weighted average over all the individual networks, the idea being that we desire a control policy that on average suits the networks because these are viewed as equivalent relative to the zzso The weighting for each network at any time point is taken to be zzso to the instantaneous estimated probability of that network being the underlying network governing the state zzso The results are applied to a family of zzso networks derived from zzso data collected in a study of zzso melanoma, the intent being to devise a control strategy that reduces the zzso zzso action in affecting biological zzso
