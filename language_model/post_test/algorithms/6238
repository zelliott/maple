The delay performance of zzso zzso is particularly important when zzso data transmission is zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a low delay property for zzso continuous zzso transmission suitable for zzso applications over a wireless zzso The proposed zzso reduces the frame size as much as possible to achieve a low zzso while maintaining reconstructed signal zzso To attain both low delay and high quality, it employs zzso zzso zzso frame size adjustment, zzso zzso flexible bit zzso and zzso zzso The performances of the proposed zzso in terms of reconstructed signal quality, processing zzso and error resilience were evaluated using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University and Beth Israel Hospital zzso and zzso University zzso zzso zzso databases and a code division multiple zzso simulation model with mobile channel zzso
