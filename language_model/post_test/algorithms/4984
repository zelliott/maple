Many mass zzso studies, as well as other biological experiments produce zzso zzso Failure to account for correlation among observations may result in a zzso zzso zzso the training data and producing overoptimistic estimated error rates and may make subsequent zzso zzso Current common practice for dealing with zzso data is to average each subject replicate sample set, reducing the zzso size and incurring loss of zzso In this manuscript we compare three approaches to dealing with zzso zzso unmodified zzso Random Forest zzso forest grown using zzso averages zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel Random zzso zzso implemented in zzso handles zzso data through a modification of the original zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an alternative sampling method that zzso the need to average or otherwise reduce each set of replicates to a single independent zzso Our experiments show nearly identical median zzso and variable selection accuracy for zzso forests and zzso forests when applied to both simulated and real zzso However, the zzso estimated error rate was severely underestimated for zzso zzso zzso zzso forests were found to be more severely affected by the reduction in sample size which led to poorer zzso and variable selection zzso Perhaps most zzso our results suggest that it is reasonable to zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso Two zzso should be noted: first, correct zzso error rates must be obtained using a separate test zzso and second, an additional zzso step is required to obtain zzso zzso zzso is shown to be an effective alternative for zzso both clustered and zzso zzso zzso code and zzso compiled versions of zzso and zzso zzso user interface zzso versions of zzso for Windows and Linux as well as a user manual zzso File zzso are available for download at: zzso under the zzso public zzso
