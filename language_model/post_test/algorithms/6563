The ability to detect clusters of functionally related genes in multiple microbial zzso has enormous potential for enhancing studies on gene function and microbial zzso The staggering amount of new zzso sequence data presents a largely untapped resource for gene cluster zzso To date, gene cluster analysis has not been fully zzso and one must rely on manual, tedious and time-consuming manipulation of zzso To facilitate accurate and rapid identification of zzso gene zzso we developed a zzso web application, called zzso We used zzso to find clusters containing any genes similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso Island of zzso zzso From 126 zzso zzso identified all 73 clusters previously determined by manual zzso 

zzso and all associated scripts are freely available as supplementary zzso
