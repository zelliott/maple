There is a general scientific need to be able to identify and evaluate what any given set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has in zzso Whether it is to zzso expand upon or identify zzso and functional zzso informational needs can be diverse and the best source to identify relationships among a potentially zzso set of objects is the scientific zzso 

We first establish a network of related objects by their zzso within zzso zzso A set of objects within this network can then be zzso to identify shared zzso and a method is presented to score their statistical relevance by comparing observed zzso with what would be expected in a random network zzso Using Gene zzso zzso categories, we demonstrate that this method enables a quantitative ranking of the zzso of a set of objects and, importantly, allows other objects related to this set to be identified and evaluated for their zzso to zzso Supplemental information: A list of ranked genes related to each GO category analyzed can be found at zzso
