zzso (or zzso modeling is a highly versatile tool for the analysis of experiments within living zzso In zzso it is essential for developing zzso for assessing zzso behavior and for zzso quantitative information about the target zzso However, tools to support the modeling tasks involved are not easily zzso 

This article presents a requirements analysis for kinetic modeling in zzso The interactive kinetic modeling tool zzso zzso many of these zzso It zzso model development by a set of zzso models and by the ease of introducing new zzso zzso Carlo studies allow assessing zzso zzso The responses in the different compartments as well as the expected zzso curve can be simulated for specific model zzso For measured zzso curves, model zzso can be performed by the Powell or the zzso zzso Both support weighted zzso zzso fitting and allow optional constraints of zzso zzso To further improve zzso zzso the fitting of several regional zzso zzso can be zzso resulting in lower standard errors for parameters common among zzso It is possible to highly automate the evaluation of study series and to forward the results into statistical analysis zzso 

The zzso tool has proven highly suitable in evaluating data from different types of studies, and the intuitive user interface enables medical doctors to successfully perform routine evaluations after a short training zzso 

A portable kinetic modeling tool with the described features would provide easy access to model development and may help consolidate kinetic modeling in clinical settings for zzso zzso
