We investigated the properties of mixed states in a sparsely zzso zzso memory model with a structural learning zzso When mixed states are made of s memory patterns, s types of mixed states, which become equilibrium states of the model, can be zzso To investigate the properties of s types of the mixed states, we analyzed them using the statistical mechanical zzso We found that the storage capacity of the memory pattern and the storage capacity of only a particular mixed state diverge at the sparse zzso We also found that the threshold value needed to recall the memory pattern is nearly equal to the threshold value needed to recall the particular mixed zzso This means that the memory pattern and the particular mixed state can be made to easily coexist at the sparse zzso The properties of the model obtained by the analysis are also useful for constructing a zzso recognition zzso
