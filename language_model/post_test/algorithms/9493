It has been observed recently that the finite duration of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso acquisition of the signal formed under the influence of the zzso field leads to significant signal zzso zzso Kennedy, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kwok, zzso zzso Investigation of zzso zzso signal acquisition under distant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 (2005) zzso zzso we zzso the phenomenon by evaluating zzso the influences of both the distant zzso field zzso and zzso relaxation zzso on the zzso in a zzso pulse sequence based on correlation zzso revamped by zzso zzso echo detection zzso Analytic expressions for the zzso were zzso which demonstrate explicitly the origin of zzso signal in the presence of the finite zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The expressions also explain the effects of the zzso and zzso during the zzso zzso on the signal strength, and show the substantial signal dependence on the phase of the zzso zzso We show that when the zzso effect during the pulse is canceled, the signal rises primarily during the free evolution time in the acquisition zzso This zzso the signal zzso when the zzso zzso cover a significant proportion of time in the zzso In addition, we performed an zzso on the number of zzso zzso that zzso the total acquired signal using parameters for water, brain white matter, and zzso We found that zzso zzso ratio is obtained when the pulse duration approximately equals the free evolution time in the samples with a wide range of zzso
