We have developed new methods for contrast transfer function zzso correction of zzso and/or thick zzso In order to achieve higher resolutions in zzso zzso zzso it is necessary to account for the zzso zzso on a zzso zzso and possibly the zzso zzso within a thick zzso zzso correction methods which account for these zzso differences have recently gained zzso However, there is no global zzso correction method available to this date (to process the entire zzso at once) which can use different inverse zzso zzso zzso or Wiener zzso and which can do so within a reasonable time for realistic image zzso We show that the zzso correction methods presented in this paper correctly account for the zzso varying zzso can employ different inverse filters and are significantly faster zzso than existing zzso We provide zzso zzso of all the presented zzso correction methods zzso
