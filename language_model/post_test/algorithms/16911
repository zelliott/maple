In this paper, we evaluate the quality of zero bounds on the zzso of zzso complex zzso We select classical and recently developed bounds and evaluate their quality by using several sets of complex zzso As the quality of zzso bounds has not been investigated zzso our results can be useful to find optimal bounds to locate the zeros of complex zzso
