The results of zzso Controlled Trials zzso on zzso outcomes that are usually reported are median time to events and Cox zzso zzso These do not constitute the sufficient statistics required for zzso or zzso analysis, and their use in secondary analyses requires strong assumptions that may not have been adequately zzso In order to enhance the quality of secondary data zzso we propose a method which derives from the published Kaplan zzso survival zzso a close approximation to the original individual patient zzso data from which they were zzso 

We develop an zzso that maps from zzso zzso back to zzso data by finding zzso solutions to the zzso zzso zzso using where available information on number of events and numbers at zzso The zzso and accuracy of survival zzso median survival times and hazard ratios based on reconstructed zzso data was assessed by comparing published statistics zzso zzso medians and hazard zzso with statistics based on repeated reconstructions by multiple zzso 

The validation exercise established there was no material systematic error and that there was a high degree of zzso for all zzso zzso was excellent for survival probabilities and zzso for hazard ratios reasonable accuracy can only be obtained if at least numbers at risk or total number of events are zzso 

The zzso is a reliable tool for zzso and zzso analyses of zzso reporting zzso zzso It is recommended that all zzso should report information on numbers at risk and total number of events alongside zzso zzso
