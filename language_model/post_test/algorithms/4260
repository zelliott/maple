During the last decade, many novel approaches for addressing zzso problems arising in clinical trials have been introduced in the zzso These approaches provide great flexibility in addressing given clinical trial objectives and yet maintain strong control of the zzso error zzso In this tutorial article, we review multiple testing strategies that are related to the zzso zzso recycling local significance levels to test zzso ordered zzso zzso adapting the significance level for testing a hypothesis to the findings of testing previous hypotheses within a given test zzso also in view of certain consistency requirements; zzso grouping hypotheses into zzso families of hypotheses along with recycling the significance level between those zzso and zzso zzso methods that permit repeated recycling of the significance zzso These four different zzso are related to each other, and we point out some connections as we describe and illustrate zzso By contrasting the main features of these approaches, our objective is to help practicing zzso to select an appropriate method for their zzso In this regard, we discuss how to apply some of these strategies to clinical trial settings and provide zzso to calculate critical values and adjusted zzso for their use in zzso The methods are illustrated with several zzso zzso
