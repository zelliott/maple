We zzso compared the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso sequence using the zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and zzso zzso zzso technique with the efficacy of conventional zzso zzso sequences for diagnosing zzso masses at zzso 

In images of 32 women zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso masses who underwent zzso imaging with both zzso and conventional techniques, we zzso analyzed zzso ratio zzso and contrast between zzso muscle and zzso zzso materials within zzso and assessed image zzso Two zzso independently evaluated fat zzso 

Mean zzso of subcutaneous fat did not differ significantly between zzso and conventional techniques for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean absolute contrast between zzso muscle and zzso high signal materials within zzso zzso was significantly higher with zzso on zzso images zzso and lower with zzso on zzso images zzso Fat suppression was significantly superior with zzso zzso zzso assessments of fat detection did not differ between zzso and conventional zzso 

The quality of zzso zzso images of zzso masses was better with zzso zzso zzso than conventional zzso zzso zzso
