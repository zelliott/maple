A zzso and simple method of zzso zzso has been developed for the zzso decision support of the artificial ventilation in intensive care zzso The zzso concerned was the respiratory zzso zzso the shunt had to be estimated using a zzso algorithm, which was slow and zzso The zzso process also required the knowledge of other zzso whose values could only be obtained using invasive monitoring zzso In this paper, the respiratory index is used for the shunt zzso A linear zzso model and a zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso model were used to describe the relationship between the respiratory index and the zzso The zzso estimated using these models were then used to calculate the fractional inspired oxygen needed to attain the target zzso oxygen level of the model zzso The advisor also zzso population median values of the cardiac index and oxygen consumption zzso This zzso the need for invasive zzso In a simulation study, the mean squared error of the control using the zzso model was zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso using the linear zzso zzso zzso the performance of the zzso advisor was better when the shunt was estimated using the zzso zzso zzso
