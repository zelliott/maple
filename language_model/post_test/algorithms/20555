The fast zzso transform zzso method of spectral analysis converts a time domain signal to a more easily zzso frequency domain spectrum but does not distinguish between signal and noise and produces spectral artifacts zzso zzso zzso for a truncated and/or improperly sampled time domain zzso For example, zzso cannot resolve two signals if the sampling duration is less than one cycle of the frequency difference between the two zzso Here, linear prediction zzso decomposition spectral analysis is applied to zzso zzso resonance mass zzso The zzso is robust and capable of zzso spectral parameters zzso time domain exponential zzso constant, zzso and zzso from a signal consisting of multiple zzso zzso noisy zzso Compared to zzso data reduction, linear prediction can offer significantly increased sensitivity (for signals at or below the zzso noise zzso elimination of zzso zzso and increased spectral resolving power for a time domain signal that either is truncated or has zzso to the zzso noise level before the end of the acquisition zzso The present analysis can handle up to zzso time domain data sets with zzso h PC zzso zzso
