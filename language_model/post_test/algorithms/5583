Environmental noise is a major source of public zzso Noise in the community causes physical and zzso effects and has been shown to be related to adverse health zzso Noise, however, has not been actively researched in the United States compared with the European Union countries in recent zzso In this research, we aimed at modeling road traffic noise and analyzing human exposure in Fulton County, Georgia, United zzso We modeled road traffic noise levels using the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model implemented in zzso After analyzing noise levels with zzso zzso and zzso zzso we estimated human exposure to high noise zzso zzso digital zzso models and building heights were derived from Light zzso And zzso survey zzso and building footprint zzso Traffic zzso were collected from the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Atlanta Regional zzso Noise level simulation was performed with 62 computers in a distributed computing zzso Finally, the zzso population was calculated using geographic information system zzso zzso show that zzso of the total county population zzso zzso is potentially exposed to 55 zzso or higher noise levels during zzso About zzso of the population is potentially exposed to 67 zzso or higher zzso At zzso zzso of the population is expected to be exposed to noise levels higher than 50 zzso This research shows that large-scale traffic noise zzso is possible with the help of various zzso We believe that this research is a significant stepping stone for analyzing community health associated with noise zzso in the United zzso
