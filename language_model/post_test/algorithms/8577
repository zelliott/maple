The zzso zzso equation is used to measure the rates of zzso consumption in the brain in zzso This equation depends zzso on one of its zzso zzso which is responsible for the zzso transport from plasma to zzso By zzso to zero the first zzso of the zzso function with respect to zzso it is possible to express this zzso as a function of the other two and reduce the zzso search from three to two zzso This approach was examined by the zzso zzso method and the zzso zzso In both cases the process of convergence was more robust and required fewer zzso to achieve a given accuracy than the direct zzso zzso zzso
