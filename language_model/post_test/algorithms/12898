In this paper, we propose generalized sampling approaches for measuring a zzso object using a compact zzso imaging system called thin observation module by bound zzso zzso This paper shows the proposed system model, physical examples, and simulations to verify zzso imaging using generalized zzso In the system, an object is modulated and multiplied by a weight distribution with physical coding, and the coded optical signal is integrated on to a detector zzso A zzso zzso zzso employing a zzso constraint is used for object zzso
