zzso DNA zzso of zzso sites is among the earliest and most frequent zzso in zzso Several studies suggest that zzso zzso occurs in a zzso zzso zzso However, large-scale analysis of candidate genes has so far been hampered by the lack of high zzso zzso for zzso zzso We have developed the first zzso technique which allows zzso assessment of selected zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso at each zzso Several hundred zzso sites were screened in 76 samples from four different human zzso types and corresponding healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified for different tissue type distinctions and used to predict the zzso class of as yet unknown samples with high accuracy using machine learning zzso Some zzso zzso correlate with progression to zzso whereas others are zzso in a zzso manner independent of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso analysis of zzso patterns combined with supervised and zzso machine learning techniques constitute a powerful novel tool to zzso human zzso
