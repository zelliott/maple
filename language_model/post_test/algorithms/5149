To describe the development and initial validation of the zzso Park zzso zzso Assessment zzso as a measure of therapy interventions in zzso 

An zzso development process, followed by comparison with systemic prospective activity analysis, and parallel application of prospective and retrospective zzso 

A zzso specialist zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 37 patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso with complex neurological disability in two consecutive zzso zzso 

The zzso was developed and refined over 18 months, together with an zzso that converts zzso scores to estimated therapy zzso zzso hours were compared with zzso therapy zzso identified from activity zzso In a subsequent cohort analysis, zzso rated zzso scores zzso intended levels of zzso were compared with retrospective zzso scores zzso zzso 

zzso therapy zzso were strongly correlated with those identified from activity analysis, for total scores zzso zzso zzso zzso and also for all five zzso for direct zzso intervention zzso zzso zzso The initial test zzso overestimated therapy hours zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjustment, zzso using a revised zzso showed this bias to be removed zzso zzso zzso P zzso Prospective and zzso applied total zzso scores were strongly correlated zzso zzso zzso Although intended levels of intervention were higher than those actually delivered zzso zzso zzso zzso the differences corresponded to real zzso from intended zzso 

In this initial zzso after revision of the algorithm, the zzso provided acceptable estimate of therapy zzso Further evaluation is now required in other populations and zzso
