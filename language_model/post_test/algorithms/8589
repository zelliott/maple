In the past year, great strides have been made in our understanding of the regulatory networks that control gene expression in the model zzso zzso zzso The development and use of a number of zzso tools, including zzso location and expression analysis, has fueled this zzso In addition, a variety of zzso zzso have been devised to mine zzso sequence for zzso regulatory motifs in zzso zzso The recent description of the genetic network controlling the cell cycle illustrates the tremendous potential of these approaches for deciphering gene expression regulatory networks in zzso zzso
