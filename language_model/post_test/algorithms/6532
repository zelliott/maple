A common objective in zzso experiments is to select genes that are zzso expressed between two classes zzso treatment zzso zzso of zzso expressed genes involves two zzso The first step is to calculate a zzso score that will rank the genes in order of evidence of differential zzso The second step is to determine a zzso for the ranked zzso zzso zzso of the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve provide relative measures for a ranking of differential zzso This article proposes using the zzso approach to zzso the raw zzso and/or adjusted zzso for three zzso discrimination zzso A zzso zzso can be determined from the zzso zzso or the adjusted zzso to select zzso expressed zzso To zzso the degree of confidence in the selected top-ranked zzso the conditional false discovery rate zzso over the selected gene set and the zzso zzso zzso zzso error probability for each selected gene are zzso The proposed approach is applied to a public colon tumor data set for zzso The selected gene sets from three zzso summary zzso and the commonly used zzso zzso are applied to the sample zzso to evaluate the predictability of the four discrimination zzso
