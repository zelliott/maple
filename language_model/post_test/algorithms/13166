The study of networks has become a substantial interdisciplinary endeavor that encompasses myriad disciplines in the natural, social, and information zzso Here we introduce a framework for constructing zzso of networks based on their structural zzso These networks can arise from any of numerous zzso They can be empirical or zzso they can arise from multiple zzso of a single process zzso empirical or zzso they can represent entirely different systems in different disciplines, zzso Because zzso properties of networks are hypothesized to be important for network function, we base our comparisons on zzso of network community zzso Although we use a specific method for uncovering network communities, much of the introduced framework is independent of that zzso After introducing the zzso we apply it to construct a zzso for zzso networks and demonstrate that our approach zzso identifies similar zzso We also construct zzso within individual categories of networks, and we thereby expose zzso zzso For example, we create zzso for similarity networks constructed from both political voting data and financial zzso We also construct network zzso to compare the social structures of 100 Facebook networks and the growth structures produced by different types of zzso
