In order to rapidly follow unexpected environmental changes, we propose a zzso control method in reinforcement learning that changes each of learning parameters in appropriate zzso We determine each appropriate direction on the basis of relationships between behaviors and zzso by considering an emergency as a key zzso Computer experiments show that the agents using our proposed method could rapidly respond to unexpected environmental changes, not depending on either two reinforcement learning zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or two learning problems zzso and continuous zzso zzso
