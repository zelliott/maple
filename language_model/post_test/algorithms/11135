Event recognition is one of the most active research areas in video surveillance zzso Advancement in event recognition systems mainly aims to provide zzso safety and an efficient lifestyle for zzso A precise, accurate and robust approach is necessary to enable event recognition systems to respond to sudden changes in various uncontrolled zzso such as the case of an emergency, physical threat and a fire or bomb zzso The performance of sudden event recognition systems depends heavily on the accuracy of low level processing, like zzso recognition, tracking and machine learning zzso This survey aims to detect and characterize a sudden event, which is a subset of an abnormal event in several video surveillance zzso This paper discusses the following in detail: zzso the importance of a sudden event over a general anomalous event; zzso zzso used in sudden event zzso zzso the requirements and comparative studies of a sudden event recognition system and zzso various decision-making approaches for sudden event zzso The advantages and drawbacks of using zzso images from multiple cameras for real-time application are also zzso The paper concludes with suggestions for future research directions in sudden event zzso
