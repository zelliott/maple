The ability to conduct high-quality semiautomatic zzso zzso of lung zzso in CT scans is of high value to busy zzso zzso random fields zzso were used to segment zzso volumes of lung zzso in CT scan data using only one seed point per zzso zzso parameters for the zzso zzso were first found using simulated zzso These parameters were then used to solve the zzso problem using the graph cuts zzso zzso of the zzso exhibited high precision and zzso The system can be adapted to facilitate the process of zzso studies but will still require human checking for failed zzso
