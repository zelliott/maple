zzso imaging zzso and infrared zzso imaging zzso are zzso zzso measurement methods for monitoring a wide range of basic vital zzso In particular, zzso enhances the classical zzso zzso Approved evaluation zzso of the well-established zzso method can easily be adapted for detection of heart rate, heart rate zzso zzso rate zzso respiratory zzso zzso and zzso activity with zzso The zzso method primarily records temperature distribution of the observed object, but information on zzso and RV can also be derived from zzso by analyzing the development of temperature distribution in the zzso zzso The main advantages of both monitoring methods are unobtrusive data acquisition and the possibility of assessing spatial assignment between vital parameters and body zzso zzso these methods enable long-term monitoring or the monitoring of effects with special local zzso Because the two systems supplement each, a combined hybrid application is proposed and its feasibility zzso
