In this paper, the experimental conditions for preparing zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso Our studies are focused on the potential use of a zzso zzso zzso as zzso delivery system for topical zzso The main components of the zzso are zzso and charged zzso loaded with zzso and dispersed in a zzso zzso The following issues are zzso the drug zzso efficiency zzso the kinetic of drug release from the delivery systems, the zzso activity of zzso zzso The in zzso zzso experiments through a synthetic zzso barrier zzso and through zzso skin are carried out to evaluate the potential use as a zzso zzso The use of both a synthetic and a biological membrane allows to discriminate between the effects related to variations of zzso parameters and those correlated to biological zzso The release rate of zzso is increased by zzso in neutral and zzso charged zzso and the zzso rate was slowed by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, studies of zzso activity on prepared systems evidenced that zzso zzso in zzso exhibit a higher activity than the free zzso
