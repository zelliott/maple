zzso and zzso dynamic changes in three-dimensional cellular zzso on fast time scales is a challenge because of mechanical limitations of imaging systems as well as of the inherent tradeoffs between zzso resolution and image zzso We have combined a custom high-speed zzso zzso approach with a novel image zzso method, the weighted directional zzso zzso to zzso the dimensions of zzso spaces of cells under zzso stress on zzso previously zzso The adaptation of a high-speed zzso microscope addressed the need to capture events occurring on short zzso while the zzso method was developed to address artifacts of standard zzso analysis methods when applied to this zzso Our novel approach is demonstrated by the enhanced zzso analysis of the three-dimensional cellular and zzso zzso that accompany zzso loading of airway zzso zzso
