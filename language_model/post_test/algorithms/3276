In this paper, we study the synchronization of two zzso coupled zzso linear chaotic systems when the zzso strength is disturbed by the common or different zzso Based on zzso differential equation theory, we verify that the noise can really induce the occurrence of zzso and the sufficient conditions of synchronization with probability 1 are zzso We also find that with the common noise it is easier to induce the synchronization than with different zzso Moreover, two examples are provided and some zzso simulations are performed to verify the theoretical zzso
