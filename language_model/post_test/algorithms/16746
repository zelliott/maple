The way that health is measured and valued is fundamental to economic zzso To date, adult health state values have been routinely used in the calculation of zzso for the economic evaluation of zzso treatment and preventive zzso including those targeted at zzso 

The main objective of this study was to apply profile case zzso zzso zzso zzso experiment zzso methods to obtain zzso values for the Child Health zzso zzso zzso a new generic zzso measure of zzso quality of life developed specifically for application in zzso analyses of treatments and interventions targeted at young zzso A secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of a zzso method of data collection for the valuation of health states defined by the zzso 

A zzso survey was developed including the zzso instrument and a series of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, respondents were asked to indicate the best and worst attribute levels from a series of ten health states defined by the zzso presented one at a zzso The survey was administered to a community-based sample of zzso adolescents zzso aged zzso zzso A conditional zzso zzso model was applied to estimate values zzso zzso for each level of the nine attributes relating to the zzso A marginal utility zzso was then estimated to generate an zzso scoring zzso on the full zzso and zzso scale required for the calculation of zzso 

The results indicate that participants were able to readily choose zzso and zzso attribute levels for the zzso health zzso Large differences in value were found between the first and fifth levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for all nine attributes relating to the zzso In general, there was little differentiation between the middle levels of all attributes indicating only limited additional value for adolescents of moving between these zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the existing adult scoring zzso for the zzso revealed some significant differences in values for identical health states, which may have important implications for the application of the zzso to value adolescent treatment and service zzso particularly for mental zzso In general, adolescents appeared to place more weight upon the zzso attributes relating to mental health zzso sad and zzso than would be implied by application of the existing zzso based upon adult zzso 

This study provides preliminary indications that there may be potentially important and systematic differences in the valuations attached to identical health states by adolescents in comparison with adult population zzso The study findings lend support to the potential future application of profile case zzso zzso methods to undertake large-scale health state valuation studies directly with young adolescent population samples and provide support for the feasibility and zzso of a zzso mode of administration for this zzso
