The calculation of zzso equilibrium compositions of zzso systems is very important for the work on zzso zzso zzso especially the phase composition and volume ratio obtained from zzso equilibrium zzso In this work, zzso zzso of zzso Arizona zzso systems, zzso zzso and related zzso systems are correlated and predicted using the zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the used zzso The parameters in the model are zzso only with the special systems zzso zzso comparison with experimental data shows that zzso zzso of these systems can be predicted with greatly improved accuracy as compared to the group contribution method zzso
