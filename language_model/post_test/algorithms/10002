In the present work we examine in detail the formation of a depletion zone in the zzso reaction in networks, with a single perfect zzso We monitor the particle density zzso with respect to the distance r from the zzso We show using zzso Carlo simulations that the depletion zone is absent in regular, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The density profiles show significant differences for these zzso The particles are zzso distributed in regular and zzso networks with the depletion effect appearing in very sparse zzso zzso In zzso networks we reveal the important role of the zzso which due to their high random walk zzso are critical in the zzso zzso In addition, the degree distribution plays a significant role in the distribution of the particles recovering the depletion zone formation for high gamma zzso The mean connectivity of the network is found to play a significant role in both zzso and zzso zzso
