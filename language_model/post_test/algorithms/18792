zzso serves a critical role in stem cell function and tissue zzso This role depends on its ability to zzso zzso repeats in a manner dependent on the reverse zzso zzso function of its protein component zzso zzso zzso as well as on a novel zzso whose mechanism is poorly zzso Here, we use a zzso zzso lacking zzso function zzso to study the mechanism of zzso action in zzso skin, an ideal tissue for studying zzso cell zzso We show that zzso retains the full activities of zzso zzso in enhancing zzso proliferation in skin and in zzso resting hair zzso stem cells, which triggers initiation of a new hair zzso growth phase and promotes hair zzso To understand the nature of this zzso function for zzso we studied the zzso zzso response to acute changes in zzso levels in mouse zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in the skin and hair zzso by triggering a rapid change in gene expression that significantly zzso the program controlling natural hair zzso cycling in zzso zzso zzso comparisons to other zzso gene sets using zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso response strongly resembles those zzso by zzso and zzso two proteins intimately associated with stem cell function and zzso These data show that zzso controls tissue zzso cells via zzso regulation of a zzso program zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso
