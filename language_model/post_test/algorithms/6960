Approximate zzso zzso is a recently formulated family of parameters and statistics zzso zzso zzso in serial data, with developments within theoretical mathematics as well as numerous applications to multiple biological zzso We discuss the motivation for zzso development, from the study of inappropriate application of zzso systems zzso zzso to general zzso zzso zzso is scale zzso and model independent, evaluates both dominant and zzso patterns in data, and discriminates series for which clear feature recognition is zzso zzso is zzso to systems with at least 50 data points and to broad classes of models: it can be applied to discriminate both general classes of correlated zzso zzso as well as noisy deterministic zzso Moreover, zzso is complementary to spectral and zzso zzso providing effective zzso capability in instances in which the aforementioned measures exhibit minimal zzso Representative zzso applications to human aging studies, based on both heart rate and zzso zzso zzso time series, are zzso Heart rate zzso studies include zzso and age-related changes in zzso dynamics in older subjects, and analyses of zzso zzso zzso applications establish clear quantitative changes in joint zzso zzso dynamics in older versus younger men (a zzso male zzso via zzso a related zzso zzso zzso a disruption in zzso zzso zzso zzso in older zzso and changes in zzso zzso dynamics across zzso The capability of zzso to assess relatively subtle zzso typically found earlier in the history of a subject than mean and zzso changes, holds the potential for enhanced preventative and earlier zzso zzso
