An approach to molecular zzso based on the comparative expression of protein pairs is zzso The method overcomes some of the present limitations in using zzso intensity data for class prediction for problems such as the detection of a disease, disease zzso or for predicting treatment zzso Data analysis is particularly challenging in these situations due to sample size (typically zzso being much smaller than the large number of peptides (typically zzso zzso based upon high zzso statistical models, machine learning or other complex zzso generate decisions which may be very accurate but can be complex and difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful zzso A zzso zzso called zzso is presented that generates simple decision rules leading to accurate zzso which is based on measurement of very few proteins and requires only relative expression values, providing specific targeted hypotheses suitable for straightforward zzso 

zzso has been tested against clinical data from 21 patients following a bone zzso zzso 13 of which progress to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome zzso The approach combines multiple zzso pairs originating from the same set of zzso with each unique zzso pair providing an independent measure of zzso zzso The prediction rate of the zzso for zzso study as measured by zzso zzso is zzso which can be very beneficial for clinical diagnosis as it may flag patients in need of closer zzso The zzso zzso proteins provided by zzso are known to be associated with the biological processes and pathways intimately associated with known zzso biology based on mouse zzso 

An approach to zzso discovery, called zzso is zzso zzso is based on the differential expression of pairs of peptides and the associated zzso Using mass zzso data from zzso zzso zzso methods, functionally related zzso pairs exhibiting zzso changes expression profile are discovered, which represent a signature for patients progressing to various disease zzso The method has been tested against clinical data from patients progressing to zzso pneumonia syndrome zzso following a bone zzso zzso The data indicates that patients with improper regulation in the concentration of specific acute phase response proteins at the time of bone zzso transplant are highly likely to develop zzso within few zzso The results lead to a specific set of protein pairs that can be efficiently verified by investigating the zzso abundance change in independent zzso using zzso or targeted mass zzso zzso This generalized zzso can be extended to other clinical problems in a variety of zzso
