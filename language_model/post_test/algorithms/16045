zzso valve zzso may be reduced by the local delivery of zzso proteins from the zzso sewing ring of a prosthetic heart zzso zzso discs were treated with a carbon dioxide gas plasma to improve the zzso and thereby enabling homogeneous zzso with gelatin type zzso The gelatin samples were zzso to different degrees using various amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a model protein for zzso zzso was loaded into zzso gelatin gels incorporated in zzso or zzso onto zzso and gas zzso zzso The in zzso zzso release was measured after subcutaneous zzso of zzso samples in zzso The zzso content of the samples, and the zzso level of the surrounding tissue were determined at different zzso times zzso from 6 h up to 1 zzso For zzso gelatin gels, the zzso tissue level was elevated up to 2 days after zzso In zzso release was measured using zzso medium or zzso zzso zzso release in buffer solution under sink conditions was in good agreement with the in zzso zzso release profiles, and therefore considered a good model to describe in zzso release zzso The release was zzso with a solution of zzso second law of diffusion using the appropriate boundary zzso In this way the zzso concentration in the gel and the surrounding tissue as a function of time and distance was zzso The presence of zzso gelatin in zzso did lead to an increased zzso of zzso and a delayed release during 30 h after zzso whereas a burst release took place from zzso gas zzso zzso or zzso containing zzso zzso
