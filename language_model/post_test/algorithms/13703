An engineering model of zzso single anterior implants was developed to calculate the zzso systems resulting from zzso zzso Analysis of a clinical example showed that zzso the zzso guidance and/or placing the implant in a more upright position reduced the moment and the zzso component of the force but increased the intrusive zzso The calculations are zzso to the design of implants and may help in the long-term evaluation of clinical zzso
