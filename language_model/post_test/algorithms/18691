We have developed an evolutionary approach for flexible zzso zzso This approval, zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso for molecular zzso and an empirical scoring zzso The former combines both discrete and continuous global search strategies with local search strategies to speed up zzso whereas the latter results in rapid recognition of potential zzso zzso was tested on a diverse data set of 100 zzso complexes from the zzso Data zzso In zzso of these complexes, the zzso lowest energy zzso structures had zzso zzso zzso below zzso A with respect to the corresponding crystal zzso The success rate increased to zzso if the structure water molecules were zzso We evaluated zzso on two zzso experiments in which each zzso of a protein ensemble was zzso into each protein of the zzso zzso percent of the zzso structures had zzso below zzso A when the zzso were zzso into foreign zzso We analyzed and validated zzso with respect to various search spaces and scoring functions, and found that if the scoring function was perfect, then the predicted accuracy was also essentially zzso This study suggests that zzso is a useful tool for molecular recognition and may be used to systematically evaluate and thus improve scoring zzso
