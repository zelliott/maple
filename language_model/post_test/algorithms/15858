The real time application of zzso zzso spectral analysis to a zzso zzso zzso blood zzso is zzso The system consists of a zzso zzso digital signal zzso with a zzso based zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso The zzso method was used for in zzso spectral analysis of the signals obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso in real zzso The data obtained from digital and coronary arteries were processed using both zzso and zzso spectral analysis zzso Also the data obtained from a zzso coronary artery under surgical operation were processed using both zzso When the results are zzso it is seen that zzso analysis has given better zzso Therefore the technique can be used in the examining of small vessels such as zzso zzso zzso coronary and digital zzso
