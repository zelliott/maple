zzso zzso zzso is a strong risk factor for heart failure zzso zzso onset in patients with zzso is associated with increased morbidity and zzso zzso factors that predict zzso in individuals with zzso in the community are not well zzso 

We examined clinical variables related to the 10-year zzso of zzso in 725 individuals zzso zzso years, zzso zzso with documented zzso in the zzso Heart zzso Event rates for incident zzso zzso zzso 161, zzso in zzso were comparable in women zzso per 100 zzso and men zzso per 100 zzso Age, body mass index, zzso zzso zzso diabetes, significant zzso and history of zzso zzso were positively associated with incident zzso in multivariable models zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso We developed a risk zzso for zzso absolute risk of zzso in zzso patients with good model fit and zzso zzso zzso zzso statistic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the algorithm, zzso of zzso events occurred in the top zzso in men compared with zzso in the bottom zzso and zzso in women in the upper zzso compared with zzso in the lowest zzso For zzso type, women had a zzso higher zzso of zzso with preserved zzso compared with zzso 

We describe advancing age, zzso zzso body mass index, diabetes, significant heart zzso and history of zzso zzso as clinical zzso of incident zzso in individuals with zzso A risk zzso may help identify individuals with zzso at high risk of developing zzso
