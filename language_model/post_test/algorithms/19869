zzso element zzso sequence dominates the landscape of zzso zzso and can zzso gene function by zzso zzso and zzso Our current knowledge of zzso in laboratory mouse strains is limited primarily to those present in the zzso reference zzso with most mouse zzso being drawn from three distinct classes, namely short zzso nuclear elements zzso long zzso nuclear elements zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite their high zzso the different zzso and gene properties controlling whether zzso are zzso zzso from, or are retained by, genetic drift or positive selection in zzso zzso remain poorly zzso 

Using whole zzso sequencing data from 13 classical laboratory and 4 zzso mouse zzso zzso we developed a comprehensive zzso of zzso zzso TE zzso We employ this extensive data set to characterize TE zzso across the zzso zzso and to zzso neutral and selective processes that have acted over 2 million zzso Our results indicate that the majority of TE zzso are introduced though the male zzso and that only a minority of TE zzso exert zzso changes in gene zzso However, among genes with differential expression across the strains there are twice as many TE zzso identified as being putative zzso zzso as zzso 

Most TE zzso that cause gene expression changes appear to be zzso rapidly by zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that past TE insertions have often been highly zzso and help to prioritize TE zzso according to their likely contribution to gene expression or zzso zzso
