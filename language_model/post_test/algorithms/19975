A new zzso zzso zzso potential energy surface for zzso is constructed at the zzso level with an zzso basis set together with bond zzso The zzso coordinates zzso and zzso of zzso are explicitly included, due to the strong zzso between the zzso and zzso stretches of zzso A global potential energy surface is obtained by fitting the original potential points to a zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso In the fitting, the zzso zzso noise in the long range region of the potential is smoothed over by theoretically fixed long range zzso zzso zzso zzso for both the ground and the excited zzso states of zzso are then constructed by zzso averaging the zzso zzso Based on the two-dimensional zzso we use the path integral zzso Carlo zzso to calculate the zzso band origin shifts for the zzso clusters using a first order zzso theory zzso The calculated shifts agree reasonably well with the experimental values and reproduce the evolution tendency from zzso to large zzso
