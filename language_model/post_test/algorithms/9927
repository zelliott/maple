This work evaluates the hypothesis that proteins with an identical zzso structure zzso share a unique set of zzso zzso though they may belong to different protein families and have very low sequence zzso This hypothesis was tested on two groups of zzso proteins zzso zzso in each group have an identical zzso but their sequence similarity is below the zzso zzso To find the zzso zzso specific to each group, a unique zzso zzso of multiple sequences alignment was zzso The units of alignment are individual strands and zzso rather than whole zzso The zzso is based on the alignment of zzso that form hydrogen bonds between corresponding zzso zzso alignment revealed that zzso of the positions in the sequences in each group of proteins are zzso zzso occupied either by zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, each group of zzso is characterized by a unique set of zzso zzso found at the zzso zzso The set of zzso zzso has very high sensitivity and specificity for identifying proteins with a corresponding zzso It is an zzso acid zzso that brands a sequence as having a particular zzso Thus, the sets of zzso zzso can be used to zzso proteins and to predict the zzso of a query zzso acid zzso
