When cows on dairy farms are zzso with an automatic milking system or in high capacity milking parlors, clinical zzso zzso cannot be adequately detected without zzso The objective of this paper is to describe the performance demands of sensor systems to detect CM and zzso the current performance of these sensor zzso Several detection models based on different sensors were studied in the zzso When evaluating these models, three factors are zzso performance (in terms of sensitivity and zzso the time window and the similarity of the study data with real farm zzso A CM detection system should offer at least a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso The time window should not be longer than 48 hours and study circumstances should be as similar to practical farm circumstances as zzso The study design should comprise more than one farm for data zzso Since 1992, 16 zzso papers have been published with a description and evaluation of CM detection zzso There is a large variation in the use of sensors and zzso All this makes these results not very zzso There is a also large difference in performance between the detection models and also a large variation in time windows used and little similarity between study zzso zzso it is difficult to compare the overall performance of the different CM detection zzso The sensitivity and specificity found in the different studies could, for a large part, be explained in differences in the used time zzso None of the described studies satisfied the demands for CM detection zzso
