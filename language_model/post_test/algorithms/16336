We explore one of the zzso protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso following nuclear zzso Using zzso delay differential equations and the zzso algorithm, we illustrate the distinct zzso dynamics at the zzso and zzso levels which were found in the recent zzso The zzso dynamics of zzso interaction appears as coherent resonance with delay and noise in individual zzso zzso mechanisms provide the origin of zzso zzso at the population level out of the sustained one at the zzso zzso The zzso nature of zzso of protein populations results from the interplay between time delay and zzso of reaction zzso Our findings may lead to new insights related to the effects of noise and cancer zzso
