To examine clinical and economic outcomes associated with zzso II zzso zzso zzso 

zzso claims data were analyzed for zzso adults with zzso year follow-up from first zzso zzso zzso were zzso into four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which represented the full zzso zzso were also conducted with the zzso zzso which excluded subjects with pre-existing conditions in the period before first zzso Time to follow-up cardiac event was modeled using Cox zzso hazards zzso follow-up zzso resource zzso and costs were examined using generalized linear zzso 

The full and limited samples consisted of zzso and zzso subjects, zzso Mean follow-up ranged from zzso to 933 zzso zzso characteristics including the zzso zzso score differed by zzso In both the full and limited samples, respectively, zzso models predicted a higher adjusted risk of follow-up cardiac event for zzso cohort zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso LOS cohort zzso zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso and zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso risk (full zzso of follow-up ambulatory and zzso visits zzso and zzso was higher in zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso risk zzso zzso of follow-up ambulatory visits zzso and zzso was greater for zzso LOS and zzso zzso relative to zzso but zzso visit risk was greater only in zzso and LOS zzso Compared to the zzso zzso follow-up zzso adjusted zzso costs zzso zzso were higher in zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In this large national US health plan, treatment with zzso was associated with lower risk of cardiac events and lower zzso resource zzso and costs versus zzso zzso and zzso over a mean follow-up of zzso zzso Association, rather than zzso to cardiac outcomes may be zzso from these zzso claims zzso
