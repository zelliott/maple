It is a well-known fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso on the two channel filter banks zzso cannot be simultaneously zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso have the energy preservation property, zzso zzso are preferred in image processing applications because of their zzso zzso In this paper, a novel method is presented for the design of almost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is structurally imposed by using the zzso lattice structure, and this leads to an objective function, which is relatively simple to zzso The designed filters have good frequency response, flat group zzso almost zzso filter zzso and zzso zzso zzso
