The effects of zzso noise in the zzso projection data and uncertainty in the zzso map on the image noise in zzso zzso images reconstructed using a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso projection data of a physical Hoffman brain phantom and a zzso phantom were acquired from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scanner being developed at zzso zzso zzso projection data from a zzso phantom and a zzso phantom were also obtained using a zzso geometry consistent with the zzso zzso The simulation assumed a zzso source, included zzso blurring but ignored zzso zzso For each zzso a region of interest zzso at the zzso of the reconstructed image was chosen for the purpose of noise zzso In all cases, the mean value zzso in the zzso approached a constant value after approximately 20 zzso The standard zzso zzso generally increased with the number of zzso The ratio zzso was found to be zzso zzso to the square root of the total detected counts and zzso to the relative uncertainty in the zzso zzso These two noise components contributed independently towards the noise in the reconstructed zzso In the zzso system employing an zzso tube for zzso map zzso the uncertainty in the reconstructed zzso distribution is limited mainly by zzso noise in the zzso projection zzso Our results are expected to be generally zzso to other zzso systems, including those using external zzso sources for the acquisition of zzso zzso
