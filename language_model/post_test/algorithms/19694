We propose an improved version of regional competition zzso in this paper, and apply it to the automatic zzso of medical image series, particularly in the zzso and recognition of brain zzso The traditional regional competition is enhanced by combining the attractive aspects of fuzzy zzso and thus it provides an efficient approach to segment the fuzzy and zzso medical zzso In order to perform regional competition on medical image series, we zzso the zzso result of a slice to initiate the next segmented zzso while the first slice is zzso using regional growing zzso Moreover, we develop an zzso to recognize the tumors automatically, taking into account its zzso Experimental results show that our zzso performs well on the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso image series with high speed and zzso
