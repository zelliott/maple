zzso complexes play an important role in cellular zzso Identification of protein complexes in zzso interaction zzso networks is the first step in understanding the organization and dynamics of cell zzso Several zzso experimental techniques produce a large amount of protein zzso which can be used to predict protein complexes in a zzso zzso We have developed an zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso using zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso for zzso the whole zzso network into zzso which serve as predicted protein zzso We consider both zzso properties of a zzso network as well as biological properties based on GO semantic similarity measure as objective zzso Here three different semantic similarity measures are used for grouping functionally similar proteins in the same zzso We have applied the zzso zzso on two different zzso of zzso zzso to find and predict protein zzso A real-life application of the zzso is also shown here by applying it in the human zzso network consisting of zzso expressed genes affected by gastric zzso Gene zzso and zzso based analyses are also performed to investigate the biological importance of the extracted gene zzso
