We have used zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso to investigate the statistical properties of dynamic zzso reflected from an obscuring scattering surface in order to reveal drawings that are hidden zzso Here we explore the limitations of this method used with various zzso when applied to a selection of paper zzso These samples consist of a sketch executed in an assortment of media laid on a base surface that are then hidden beneath a subsequent top zzso The ability to resolve gray scale images was examined as well as the contrast surface temperature zzso A book with glued pages was investigated in order to demonstrate the zzso zzso to the zzso examination of cultural zzso While being shown as a useful tool in revealing obscured drawings the scattering properties of the surface layer present a limitation in its general zzso
