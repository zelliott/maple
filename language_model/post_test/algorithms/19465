We present a zzso imaging system based on the use of structured zzso Feature zzso are obtained by projecting zzso structured zzso onto an object and collecting all the reflected light onto a single zzso Principal component features are used to define the zzso zzso The optimal linear minimum zzso error zzso operator is used to generate object estimates from the measured zzso We study the optimal allocation of zzso energy into each feature measurement in the presence of additive white zzso detector noise and optical zzso We demonstrate that this new imaging approach reduces zzso complexity and provides improved image quality in high noise zzso Compared to the optimal zzso zzso of a conventional image, zzso structured imaging provides a 38% zzso error reduction and requires 400 times fewer zzso for a noise standard zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Experimental results validate these theoretical zzso
