A method for determination of the cardiac electric center on the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso description of the zzso potential is zzso The method provides a more accurate and stable spatial location of the zzso generator as compared to other methods (in particular, those based on zzso of the zzso zzso The position of the electric center is a useful characteristic for topical diagnosis of the zzso state and function of the zzso Using mathematical models, the dependence of the position of the electric center, determined by the method zzso on the zzso and spatial position of the zzso is zzso
