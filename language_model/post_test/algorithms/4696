Many vision problems can be formulated as zzso of appropriate energy zzso These energy zzso are usually zzso based on the calculus of variations zzso zzso Once the zzso equation has been determined, it needs to be zzso in order to implement it on a digital zzso This is not a trivial task and, is moreover, zzso In this paper, we propose a flexible zzso We zzso the energy functional and, zzso apply the mathematical concept of zzso differentiation to directly derive zzso that implement the energy zzso zzso This approach has several zzso First, the zzso derivatives are exact with respect to the zzso of the energy zzso Second, it is basically straightforward to zzso zzso derivatives and, thus, the zzso zzso of the energy zzso Third, zzso differentiation is a process which can be zzso We demonstrate this novel approach on three representative vision problems zzso zzso zzso and zzso and show that state-of-the-art results are obtained with little zzso
