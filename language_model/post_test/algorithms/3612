To propose a respiratory zzso zzso zzso imaging sequence to significantly reduce the amount of zzso data required for zzso MR zzso zzso zzso 

Rapid acquisition of high-resolution imaging data is essential to detailed quantitative analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso MR sequences have explored the full capacity of the imaging hardware to reduce the acquisition window within each cardiac cycle while maintaining the desired spatial zzso Further improvement in zzso imaging will require a more efficient use of the information content of the zzso zzso The method uses prospective zzso zzso echoes to ensure that zzso filtering of zzso is carried out on a series of images that are zzso zzso An zzso real-time zzso zzso is developed for the creation of zzso image zzso related to different levels of respiratory zzso zzso concerning the zzso smoothing of zzso kinetic signals are discussed, and a solution based on zzso of the central zzso is zzso The method is assessed in 10 normal subjects without the administration of contrast agent, and further validated by administration of zzso in 10 patients at zzso 

The results of this study show that zzso significantly extends the zzso of zzso to zzso imaging, which yields a zzso reduction in image artifact when the same amount of zzso information is zzso 

The scan efficiency achieved can be used in combination with MR hardware improvements for extending the three-dimensional spatial coverage and zzso the data acquisition window to provide detailed information on regional zzso zzso zzso
