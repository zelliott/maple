In their 1990 paper zzso zzso efforts and the timing of reproduction of annual plants in randomly varying zzso Amir and Cohen considered zzso environments consisting of zzso sequences in an optimal allocation zzso zzso We suppose here that the sequence of environmental factors is more generally described by a zzso zzso Moreover, we discuss the connection between the time zzso of the zzso dynamic model and the ability of the plant to rebuild completely its zzso body (from zzso We formulate a zzso zzso problem covering the so-called linear and zzso fitness zzso to variation within and between zzso which yields optimal zzso For zzso zzso we zzso how optimal strategies depend upon the environmental zzso zzso constant, random zzso random zzso random zzso We provide general patterns in terms of targets and zzso including both zzso and indeterminate zzso We also provide a partial result on the comparison between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso simulations are zzso allowing to give a hint at the effect of different mathematical zzso
