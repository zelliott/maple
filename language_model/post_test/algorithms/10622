A number of new and newly improved methods for predicting protein structure developed by the zzso College London group were used to make predictions for the zzso zzso zzso were predicted with a combination of fold recognition methods zzso zzso and zzso and a substantially enhanced version of zzso our zzso assembly zzso Attempts at automatic domain parsing were made using zzso and zzso which are based on a secondary structure parsing zzso and additionally for zzso a simple local sequence alignment scoring zzso Disorder prediction was carried out using a new zzso version of zzso Attempts were also made at domain zzso and zzso folding in order to build complete chain models for some zzso
