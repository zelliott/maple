The zzso Automatic zzso zzso Trial zzso showed a conclusive 54 per cent reduction in mortality in patients with zzso sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired left zzso function who received an zzso zzso compared with those who did zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which studied a patient population with a similar extent of left zzso dysfunction and overall cardiovascular risk, demonstrated no mortality benefit from placement of an zzso zzso All patients in the zzso trial were zzso zzso while this criterion was neither required nor evaluated for entry into the zzso zzso zzso A statistical approach to zzso with good accuracy the fraction of zzso zzso patients who were zzso at the time of their zzso from the prevalence of VT zzso in the surviving zzso zzso Trial control population during follow-up is zzso This more generally zzso approach estimates the mixing percentage using missing data zzso We present the mathematical and zzso basis of the assumptions underpinning the mixture model and its zzso zzso The mixture model forms the basis for the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which directly tests the hypothesis that the difference in the frequency of zzso VT between the zzso and zzso zzso patients populations is sufficient to account for the difference in effect on zzso
