A zzso and multiple unit system, which contains versatile zzso in a hard zzso zzso is developed by preparing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso each with various lag times of zzso Based on the combinations of zzso multiplied zzso drug delivery system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso zzso curve, instead of the cumulative percentage drug release profile, is zzso The zzso least square model fit program is applied to process the zzso data of zzso The test zzso coincided with the theoretical zzso from simple zzso of zzso equations of individual zzso zzso the programmed zzso can be predicted by adding the zzso equations of various zzso to calculate the theoretical equations and be zzso
