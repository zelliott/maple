zzso zzso zzso is a zzso indicator of zzso necrosis due to zzso or zzso zzso Considering the multiple causes of zzso injury and treatment consequences there is great clinical need to clarify the underlying reason for zzso zzso We sought to implement acute zzso as a zzso imaging method for differential diagnosis of elevated zzso in zzso unit zzso patients with zzso symptoms and zzso and a low to intermediate probability for coronary artery disease zzso 

CPU patients zzso zzso 29) who had positive zzso were scanned at zzso with a new zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso late zzso enhancement zzso zzso For comparison patients also underwent zzso and coronary zzso if zzso zzso was conducted successfully in all patients and detected zzso of zzso releases of unknown cause, without adverse zzso or zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso was detected in 11, pulmonary embolism in 6, zzso in 5, zzso disease and zzso in 2, storage disorder in 1 zzso In 2 patients zzso was unable to reveal the cause of zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso was 35 zzso 8 zzso In 4 patients, zzso led to immediate coronary zzso with correct prediction of the zzso related zzso 

We implemented a novel zzso zzso to show the clinical value and practical feasibility of acute zzso in a zzso patient cohort with unclear zzso zzso Since this pilot study has shown the feasibility of zzso in CPU patients, further prospective studies are warranted to compare zzso with other imaging zzso
