The purpose of this work was to investigate the use of an zzso contrast agent to determine zzso zzso in skeletal zzso A zzso kinetic model was used to represent the flux of contrast agent between the zzso space and zzso zzso space zzso The relationship between the image zzso ratio zzso and errors in zzso zzso surface area product zzso zzso volume zzso and plasma volume zzso for linear and zzso zzso methods was estimated from zzso Carlo zzso Similar results were obtained for both zzso For an image zzso of 60, the estimated errors in these parameters were zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso experiments were conducted in rabbits to examine zzso differences between these parameters in the zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso muscles in the hind zzso zzso for zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as were values for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso for the two muscles zzso zzso zzso were not found to be zzso These results demonstrate that relevant zzso metrics can be calculated in skeletal muscle using zzso with an zzso contrast zzso
