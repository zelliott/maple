For shapes represented as closed zzso zzso we introduce a class of zzso which are zzso with respect to the zzso group and which are obtained by performing integral zzso While such integral zzso enjoy some of the desirable properties of their differential counterparts, such as locality of zzso (which allows matching under zzso and uniqueness of representation zzso they do not exhibit the noise sensitivity associated with differential quantities and, therefore, do not require zzso of the input zzso Our zzso allows the analysis of shapes at multiple zzso Based on integral zzso we define a notion of distance between zzso The proposed distance measure can be zzso efficiently and allows zzso the shape boundaries onto each zzso its zzso results in optimal point correspondence as an intermediate zzso zzso results on shape matching demonstrate that this framework can match shapes despite the deformation of zzso missing parts and zzso As a quantitative analysis, we report matching scores for shape retrieval from a zzso
