Hidden space support zzso machines zzso are presented in this zzso The input patterns are mapped into a zzso hidden space by a set of hidden zzso functions and then the structural risk is introduced into the hidden space to construct zzso Moreover, the conditions for the zzso kernel function in zzso are more relaxed, and even zzso is not zzso Compared with support zzso machines zzso zzso can adopt more kinds of kernel functions because the positive zzso property of the kernel function is not a necessary zzso The performance of zzso for pattern recognition and zzso zzso is also zzso zzso on artificial and real-world zzso confirm the feasibility and the zzso of our zzso
