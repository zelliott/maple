A coupled zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso couples the surface zzso resonance zzso mode and the zzso mode and generates two sharp resonance dips in the zzso zzso The proposed zzso not only retains the same sensing sensitivity as that of a conventional zzso device but also yields sharper dips in the zzso spectrum and therefore provides an improved measurement zzso The two zzso spectrum dips enable the zzso zzso and thicknesses of both the zzso zzso and a layer of human serum zzso absorbed zzso on the sensing surface to be determined directly on a real-time zzso The zzso zzso provides the capability to detect the zzso zzso changes that occur in zzso kinetic zzso
