The existing regulatory guidance for zzso testing of new drug products states that studies are warranted for those chemicals that both absorb light in the range of zzso zzso and that are either applied zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to the skin or zzso The initial in zzso study recommended for the assessment of zzso potential is the zzso zzso Red zzso zzso zzso The current study was undertaken to establish superior triggers for the initiation of biological zzso zzso In this study, zzso and zzso parameters for 40 drug or zzso molecules were zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso and a fivefold zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the relationship between zzso of zzso and zzso parameters with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Photo zzso zzso The parameters most indicative of a zzso zzso positive zzso or zzso score were the extent of degradation in solution, the quantum yield of formation of zzso oxygen and the relative formation of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that while zzso of light is critical to the induction of a zzso process, it is the zzso events that may be used to predict the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is therefore proposed that the trigger for zzso testing be revised to include a molecular basis for zzso From this limited investigation, estimated thresholds leading to zzso zzso positive results due to zzso formation of zzso oxygen quantum yield or a relative zzso zzso formation value are zzso
