In zzso dose zzso is used to prevent major zzso between the prescribed dose and the dose really delivered to the zzso This work presents a quick and simple alternative method for zzso of dose delivered to the patient using zzso zzso During the treatment session, a transit dose is measured with the zzso and the dose in the patient is estimated from back projection of the portal zzso 

The zzso for dose calculation is zzso It is independent of the detector and has been validated for different beam energies using an zzso chamber zzso Central axis doses estimated by this zzso were compared with measured zzso zzso the zzso was replaced by the zzso appropriately zzso The feasibility of the method and its zzso in clinical use has been evaluated on 3 8 patients treated with zzso therapy for various zzso 

zzso between stated and measured doses are zzso They are within the accepted tolerance of classical in zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

The proposed method for in zzso dose zzso is very simple to implement and to use in zzso zzso can be repeated during several sessions giving the opportunity to built new strategies for the validation by statistical evaluation of the zzso The zzso of in zzso dose along the treatment becomes also zzso The number of zzso beams is also increased by this zzso
