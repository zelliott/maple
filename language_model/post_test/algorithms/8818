The value of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to improve zzso zzso is under zzso We aimed to assess the effects of zzso or zzso therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery on the use of zzso blood zzso We analyzed 12 trials including zzso patients, zzso of them included in 7 zzso controlled trials zzso We collected data on the amount of zzso zzso blood products and on the proportion of patients who received zzso blood products or zzso factor zzso Including all trials, the odds ratios zzso for zzso of red blood cell zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, more than 50% of the patients in this analysis were derived from one retrospective zzso Including zzso only, the zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso factor concentrates was reported in 6 studies, 2 of them were zzso The zzso for the infusion of zzso and zzso complex concentrate were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and amounts were similar in the intervention and control group in the 2 zzso It is presumed that zzso or zzso zzso management reduces the proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery zzso with zzso zzso and zzso This presumption is strongly supported by similar zzso found in the analysis including zzso zzso Patient blood management based on the zzso triggers by zzso or zzso appears to be more restrictive than the one based on conventional laboratory zzso However, evidence for improved clinical outcome is limited at this zzso
