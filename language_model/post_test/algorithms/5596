In this paper, we discuss a deterministic zzso zzso to handle the missing cone problem of three-dimensional optical zzso zzso zzso The missing cone problem arises in most practical applications of zzso and is responsible for zzso of the reconstructed shape and zzso of the value of the zzso zzso By applying zzso and zzso constraints in an zzso reconstruction zzso we effectively suppress the missing cone artifact and recover sharp edges rounded out by the missing zzso and we significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions of the zzso zzso We also show the zzso capability of our zzso in the reconstruction zzso
