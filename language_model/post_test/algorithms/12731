The aims of this study were to determine the optimal image reconstruction intervals for the zzso and zzso zzso of coronary zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and to assess their associated motion zzso 

One hundred zzso patients were recruited zzso heart rate zzso zzso zzso heart rate zzso zzso zzso Twenty data sets were reconstructed in zzso steps through zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso optimal reconstruction intervals for 15 segments distributed in three coronary arteries on the basis of motion artifacts, which were graded from 1 (no motion zzso to 4 zzso motion artifacts preventing zzso Patients were then zzso into four zzso groups for motion score comparison according to the results of a correlation analysis of zzso and motion zzso 

The optimal zzso and zzso reconstruction intervals were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean motion scores for zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso zzso reconstructions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined zzso reconstruction improved diagnostic zzso to zzso and showed fewer motion artifacts compared to zzso reconstructions for all zzso ranges zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso for zzso zzso 85 zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso For zzso of 60 to 72 zzso motion artifacts were significantly lower for zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vice versa for zzso of 73 to 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso vs zzso zzso zzso for zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction intervals were determined for this zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined reconstruction showed fewer motion artifacts compared to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of coronary zzso zzso zzso
