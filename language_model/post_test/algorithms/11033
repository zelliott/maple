Controlling complex systems is a fundamental challenge of network zzso Recent advances indicate that control over the system can be achieved through a minimum driver zzso set zzso The existence of multiple zzso suggests that zzso do not participate in control zzso prompting us to zzso their zzso Here we introduce control capacity zzso the likelihood that a zzso is a driver zzso To efficiently measure this zzso we develop a random sampling zzso This zzso not only provides a statistical estimate of the control capacity, but also bridges the gap between multiple microscopic control zzso and zzso properties of the network under zzso We demonstrate that the possibility of being a driver zzso decreases with a zzso zzso and is independent of its zzso Given the inherent zzso of zzso our findings offer tools to explore control in various complex zzso
