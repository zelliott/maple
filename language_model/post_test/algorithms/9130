A zzso is a zzso model of common ancestry that is an indispensable tool for studying biological zzso zzso play a special role in the study of rapidly evolving populations such as zzso where the proliferation of lineages is constantly being shaped by the mode of virus transmission, by adaptation to immune systems, and by patterns of human migration and zzso These processes may leave an imprint on the shapes of virus zzso that can be extracted for comparative study; however, tree shapes are zzso difficult to zzso Here we present a comprehensive study of zzso reconstructed from 38 different zzso viruses from 12 zzso families that are associated with human zzso To accomplish this, we have developed a new procedure for studying zzso tree shapes based on the zzso zzso a technique that maps complex objects into a statistically convenient zzso We show that our kernel method zzso nine different tree balance statistics at correctly zzso zzso that were simulated under different evolutionary zzso Using the kernel method, we observe patterns in the distribution of zzso virus zzso in this space that reflect modes of transmission and zzso For example, viruses that can establish persistent chronic infections (such as zzso and zzso C zzso form a distinct zzso Although the visibly zzso shape characteristic of trees from these viruses has been zzso we show that established methods for zzso tree shape fail to distinguish these trees from those of other zzso The kernel approach presented here potentially represents an important new tool for characterizing the evolution and epidemiology of zzso zzso
