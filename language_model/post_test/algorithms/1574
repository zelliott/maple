Recent studies on human learning reveal that zzso learning in a zzso framework is the best strategy for efficient zzso As the machine learning zzso are inspired by the principles of human learning, one needs to incorporate the concept of zzso to develop efficient machine learning zzso In this letter we present a zzso learning framework that controls the learning process of a fully zzso zzso basis function network and is referred to as a zzso fully zzso zzso basis function zzso zzso zzso has two zzso a cognitive component containing the zzso network and a zzso zzso which regulates the learning process of zzso In every zzso when a sample is presented to zzso the zzso component decides what to zzso when to zzso and how to learn based on the knowledge acquired by the zzso network and the new information contained in the zzso The zzso learning zzso is described in detail, and both its approximation and zzso abilities are evaluated using a set of benchmark and practical zzso Performance results indicate the superior approximation and zzso performance of zzso compared to existing methods in the zzso
