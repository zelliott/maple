zzso technology enables the simultaneous monitoring of the expression pattern of a huge number of genes across different experimental zzso zzso in zzso data is an important technique that discovers a group of genes that are zzso in a subset of zzso zzso zzso require to identify coherent and zzso zzso zzso the zzso should have low mean squared zzso and high row zzso A zzso genetic zzso technique is proposed here that zzso these objectives zzso A novel zzso scheme that uses variable zzso length is zzso Moreover, a new quantitative measure to evaluate the goodness of the zzso is zzso The performance of the proposed zzso has been evaluated on both simulated and real-life gene expression zzso and compared with some other well-known zzso zzso
