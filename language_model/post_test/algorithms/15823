A method is presented for measuring protein surface zzso It is an improvement of an earlier method that zzso a sphere with the zzso volume of a protein zzso The new method, called a shape distribution, produces a more sophisticated description of the region of the sphere inside the protein than is provided by simply measuring the region's area or solid zzso This method is applied to the prediction of molecular complexes in three zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso It does not uniquely predict the correct structure, even though the individual structures are taken from the zzso determined complex zzso However, it does provide a list of several hundred predicted complexes, one of which is correct, and from which the correct complex might be extracted by a subsequent chemical zzso
