The frequency of free zzso of plant stems with zzso zzso as found in some zzso is different depending on whether the stems are oriented vertically or zzso zzso the zzso own weight the differential equations describing the zzso can be solved for both cases, although in the vertical orientation only for a limited set of conditions including constant zzso zzso along the zzso zzso with experimental data shows that the difference between the zzso zzso in vertical and horizontal zzso can be attributed to the fact that in the vertical orientation the top load due to gravity zzso a zzso moment varying with the zzso while in the horizontal case this zzso moment is nearly zzso
