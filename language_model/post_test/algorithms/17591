zzso the fold class of a protein sequence of unknown structure is a fundamental problem in modern zzso We apply a supervised learning zzso to the zzso of protein sequences with low sequence identity from a library of 174 structural classes created with the zzso Extension structural alignment zzso A class of rules is considered that assigns test sequences to structural classes based on the closest match of an zzso acid index profile of the test sequence to a profile zzso for each zzso A mathematical zzso procedure is applied to determine an zzso acid index of zzso structural zzso power by maximizing the ratio of zzso to zzso profile zzso The optimal index is zzso as the solution to a generalized zzso problem, and its performance for fold zzso is compared to that of other published zzso The optimal index has significantly more structural zzso power than all currently known zzso including average surrounding zzso which it most closely zzso It demonstrates zzso zzso accuracy over all folds and nearly zzso accuracy on several folds with distinctive zzso structural zzso Finally, there is a compelling zzso to the optimal index in that it does not appear to depend strongly on the specific structural classes used in its zzso
