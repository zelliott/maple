The differential phase contrast CT is emerging as a new technology to improve the contrast sensitivity of the conventional zzso Via system analysis, zzso and computer zzso the authors study the noise power spectrum zzso imaging performance zzso the differential phase contrast CT and compare it with that of the conventional zzso 

The differential phase contrast CT is implemented with zzso tube and zzso The zzso propagation and data acquisition are modeled and simulated with zzso analysis and zzso zzso To avoid any interference caused by scatter and beam zzso a zzso zzso source (30 zzso is zzso which zzso the object to be zzso by 360 degrees so that no weighting scheme is zzso A zzso zzso is assumed to simulate zzso zzso propagation through the zzso zzso and zzso with periods 8 and 4 zzso respectively, while the zzso distance is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The dimension of the detector cell for data acquisition ranges from 32 zzso 32 to 128 zzso 128 zzso while the field of view in data acquisition is zzso zzso zzso zzso A uniform water phantom with a diameter zzso zzso is employed to study the zzso with its complex refraction zzso zzso zzso 1 - delta + zzso zzso 1 - zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso The zzso flux ranges from zzso to zzso zzso and observes the zzso distribution, which is consistent with that of zzso in zzso zzso The image zzso of reconstructed water phantom is zzso zzso zzso and a total of 180 regions at 128 zzso 128 zzso are used for zzso calculation via zzso zzso zzso in which adequate zero padding is applied to avoid zzso 

The preliminary data show that the differential phase contrast CT zzso its zzso with a zzso zzso while the distribution of the conventional zzso zzso observes zzso This accounts for the significant difference in their noise zzso and the differential phase contrast zzso substantial advantage in noise over the conventional CT, particularly, in the situations where the detector cell size for data acquisition is smaller than 100 zzso 

The differential phase contrast CT detects the projection of zzso zzso zzso and uses the zzso filter for image zzso which leads to the radical difference in its zzso and the advantage in noise in comparison to that of the conventional zzso
