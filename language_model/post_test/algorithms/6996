The aim of this study was to compare the in zzso zzso strength and zzso of a black copper cement with one established zzso material (a conventional glass zzso zzso and two temporary zzso materials (a zinc zzso and a zinc zzso zzso The mean zzso strength of black copper cement varied with the zzso liquid ratio, with an intermediate ratio having a comparable strength to that of the zinc zzso cement (the best material in this zzso The zzso of the black copper cement at all mixing ratios was significantly greater than that of all other test zzso
