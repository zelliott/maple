We study the interplay between structural and zzso zzso disorder and the collective electrical response in random network zzso zzso the problem of zzso electrical response zzso and transient zzso in zzso random composite networks to the framework of generalized zzso we study and analyze the zzso behavior of the density of zzso in these zzso We found that by controlling the density of shortcuts zzso zzso and/or the composite ratio of the zzso links zzso zzso one can effectively shape resonance landscapes or suppress or enhance long transient delays in the corresponding random zzso zzso
