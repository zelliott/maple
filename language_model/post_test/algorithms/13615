In this paper, a class of zzso neural networks is zzso First, zzso stability is introduced as a new type of stability and some effective criteria are derived for such kind of stability of the addressed networks by handling a new zzso differential zzso Based on the results, the existence and zzso stability of the equilibrium point are zzso Besides, the synchronization of fractional chaotic networks is also zzso Finally, several examples with zzso simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained zzso
