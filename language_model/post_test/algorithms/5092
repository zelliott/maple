The study of evolutionary mechanisms is made more and more accurate by the increase in the number of fully zzso zzso One of the main problems is to reconstruct plausible ancestral zzso zzso based on the comparison of contemporary zzso Current methods have largely focused on finding complete zzso for ancestral zzso and, due to the zzso difficulty of the problem, stop after a small number of equivalent minimal solutions have been zzso Recent results suggest, however, that the set of minimum complete zzso is very large and zzso In fact these solutions are collections of zzso blocks, freely zzso In this paper, we identify these zzso zzso using a new method of analysis of ancestral zzso that zzso both zzso and zzso zzso as well as respects biological zzso The resulting zzso permit the first reliable reconstruction of plausible ancestral zzso for several zzso zzso zzso a problem zzso intractable due to the extensive map zzso of these zzso See online zzso zzso at zzso
