zzso electrical stimulation zzso is a prescribed treatment for various zzso disorders, where an electrical stimulus is provided to elicit a muscle zzso zzso to the development of zzso controllers exist because the muscle response to an electrical stimulation is zzso and the muscle model is zzso Efforts in this paper focus on the development of an zzso inverse optimal zzso zzso The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while simultaneously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the error states and stimulation zzso The development of this framework allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control effort by putting different penalties on error states and control zzso depending on the clinical goal or functional zzso The controller is examined through a zzso zzso zzso on zzso individuals are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed zzso
