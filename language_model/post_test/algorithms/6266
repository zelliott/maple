zzso zzso artificial neural networks zzso have been established to be universal zzso of continuous zzso The universal approximation results are summarized to identify the function sets represented by the zzso zzso with the universal approximation zzso The zzso properties of the identified sets is zzso The zzso property is related to the fault tolerance of the zzso zzso The generally used arbitrary weight zzso zzso are shown to be zzso zzso A class of bounded weight zzso zzso is established to be zzso The zzso behavior of the networks is analyzed and error bounds for the induced errors zzso
