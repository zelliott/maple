zzso models of calcium release sites derived from zzso chain models of zzso calcium channels exhibit collective gating reminiscent of the zzso observed phenomenon of calcium zzso and zzso Such models often take the form of zzso zzso networks in which the transition probabilities of each channel depend on the local calcium concentration and thus the state of the other zzso In order to overcome the zzso explosion that occurs in such zzso defined calcium release site models, we have implemented several automated procedures for model reduction using zzso zzso After zzso rate zzso in the single channel model as either fast or slow, groups of states in the expanded release site model that are connected by fast transitions are zzso and transition rates between reduced states are chosen consistent with the conditional probability distribution among states within each zzso For small problems these conditional probability zzso can be zzso calculated from the full model without zzso For large problems the conditional probability zzso can be zzso without the construction of the full model by assuming rapid mixing of states connected by fast zzso zzso zzso zzso may be employed to obtain reduced calcium release site models in a zzso zzso zzso of several different zzso zzso zzso reduction schemes establishes the effectiveness of automated calcium release site reduction utilizing the zzso zzso
