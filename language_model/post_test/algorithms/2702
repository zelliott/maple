The physical and potential biological advantages of zzso and carbon zzso have not been fully exploited in radiation therapy for the treatment of zzso In this work, an approach to predict zzso and carbon zzso relative biological effectiveness zzso in a representative zzso Bragg peak zzso is derived using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso linking zzso zzso parameters to zzso induction and processing are derived from the zzso zzso The zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso software is used to zzso the effects of radiation quality on the induction of DNA zzso breaks zzso Trends in parameters zzso and zzso for clinically relevant zzso and carbon zzso kinetic energies are zzso 

zzso and carbon zzso zzso are shown to increase as particle energy, dose, and tissue zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso for zzso and carbon zzso zzso For doses in the range of zzso to 10 zzso zzso zzso ranges from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Over the same dose range, the zzso for carbon zzso ranges from zzso on the zzso edge to zzso on the zzso zzso 

The proposed approach is advantageous because the zzso for clinically relevant particle zzso is guided by well-established physical and biological zzso zzso zzso The use of an independently tested zzso Carlo model to predict the effects of radiation quality on zzso induction also zzso the number of ad hoc biological parameters that must be determined to predict zzso Large variations in predicted zzso across an zzso may produce zzso biological hot and cold zzso These results highlight the potential for the zzso of physical dose for a uniform biological zzso
