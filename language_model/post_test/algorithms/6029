zzso properties are investigated both through the multistate empirical zzso bond potential and a zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso clusters zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the temperature region zzso K are explored using a hybrid parallel zzso and zzso zzso The effect of the zzso phase transition in both caloric zzso and structural distribution functions is zzso It is found that sodium and zzso zzso largely reside on the surface of water clusters below the cluster melting temperature but are zzso into the interior of the cluster above the melting temperature, while the zzso zzso was found to have significant propensity to reside on or near the surface in both the zzso and solid-state zzso
