zzso zzso are coded by more than 2,000 genes and thus constitute the largest single zzso family in the human zzso Most cellular processes are in fact regulated by the zzso zzso of proteins on zzso zzso and zzso zzso At least zzso of all proteins are thought to contain zzso bound zzso Despite the importance and widespread occurrence of this zzso identification of sites of protein zzso is still a challenge, even when performed on highly zzso zzso zzso here is methodology that should make it possible to characterize most, if not all, zzso from a zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso are zzso with zzso and the resulting peptides are then converted to zzso zzso enriched for zzso by immobilized zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso mass zzso More than 1,000 zzso were detected when the methodology was applied to the analysis of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso A total of 216 zzso sequences defining zzso sites of zzso were zzso Of these, 60 were zzso zzso 145 doubly zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso with the literature revealed that 18 of these sites were previously identified, including the doubly zzso motif zzso derived from the zzso loop of two zzso protein zzso zzso We note that the methodology can easily be extended to display and zzso differential expression of zzso in two different cell systems, and therefore demonstrates an approach for zzso as a measure of cellular zzso
