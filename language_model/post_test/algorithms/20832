zzso size is an important factor in food zzso In studies of feeding zzso prey items are usually measured individually using calipers or zzso zzso Among zzso and zzso there are species that feed on large numbers of small prey items zzso ants, zzso This high intake makes it difficult to estimate prey size consumed by these zzso We addressed this problem by developing and evaluating a procedure for zzso the stomach contents of such predators in order to estimate prey zzso Specifically, we developed a protocol based on a zzso procedure to obtain a zzso with a precision error of at the most zzso with a confidence level of at least zzso This zzso should reduce the sampling effort and facilitate future studies on the feeding habits of zzso and zzso and also provide a means of obtaining precise estimates of prey zzso
