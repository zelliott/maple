A method to obtain the zzso locations of objects reconstructed by scanning holographic zzso with zzso accuracy is presented and zzso The method combines the holographic advantage of capturing three-dimensional zzso information in a single two-dimensional zzso with the possibility of zzso zzso the zzso holographic reconstruction a zzso The method is demonstrated zzso for zzso features zzso zzso and the limitation of the method for features of arbitrary size and shape is zzso
