zzso families at high risk for the Lynch syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for both genetic counseling and cancer zzso Current clinical guidelines are effective but limited by zzso and zzso 

To develop and validate a genetic counseling and risk prediction tool that estimates the probability of carrying a deleterious zzso in mismatch repair genes zzso zzso or zzso and the probability of developing zzso or zzso zzso 

External validation of the zzso model was conducted on 279 individuals from 226 zzso families in the United States, Canada, and Australia zzso between zzso by comparing model predictions with results of highly sensitive zzso zzso detection zzso zzso models the zzso dominant inheritance of mismatch repair zzso with parameters based on zzso of the zzso and prevalence of zzso and of the zzso values of tumor zzso The zzso prediction is tailored to each zzso detailed family history information on zzso and zzso cancer and to tumor characteristics including zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to correctly predict zzso carrier status, as measured by operating zzso zzso and overall zzso 

In the independent zzso zzso provided a zzso index of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and a ratio of observed to predicted cases of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso This results in higher accuracy than existing alternatives and current clinical zzso 

zzso is a broadly zzso accurate prediction model that can contribute to current screening and genetic counseling practices in a high-risk zzso It is more sensitive and more specific than existing clinical guidelines for identifying individuals who may benefit from zzso zzso zzso It is zzso to individuals for whom tumor samples are not available and to individuals in whom zzso testing finds no zzso
