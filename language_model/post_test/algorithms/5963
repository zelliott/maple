This study compares the improvement and zzso of arm motor performance after physical or mental training in a motor task requiring a zzso zzso During the zzso and zzso sessions, 40 subjects pointed with their right arm as accurately and as fast as possible toward targets placed in the frontal zzso zzso movements were performed in two different zzso called right and left zzso During the training sessions, which included only the right path, subjects were divided into four training groups zzso zzso 10): zzso the physical group, subjects overtly performed the zzso zzso the mental group, subjects imagined themselves performing the zzso zzso the active control group, subjects performed eye movements through the targets, zzso the passive control group, subjects did not receive any specific zzso We recorded movement zzso peak acceleration and zzso signals from arm zzso Our findings showed that after both physical and mental training on the right path zzso zzso hand movement duration and peak acceleration respectively decreased and increased for this zzso However, motor performance improvement was greater after physical compared with mental zzso Interestingly, we also observed a partial learning zzso namely an enhancement of motor performance for the left path zzso zzso The amount of this zzso was roughly similar for the physical and mental zzso Furthermore, while arm muscle activity progressively increased during the training period for the physical group, the activity of the same muscles for the mental group was unchanged and comparable with that of the rest zzso Control groups did not exhibit any zzso These findings put forward the idea that mental training zzso motor learning and allows its partial transfer to nearby zzso They further suggest that motor zzso a common process during both actual and imagined movements, is a fundamental operation for both zzso control and zzso
