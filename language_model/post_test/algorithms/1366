The results of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso sensor based on a zzso zzso are zzso A transfer function, obtained by an independent experiment that describes the properties of the sensor system, was used to correct the measured zzso data in the zzso frequency zzso The phase of the transfer function was determined from its zzso by a fitting procedure using zzso zzso As an example of application, the acoustic output field of an electromagnetic zzso was investigated, and the zzso source was reliably zzso The measured data provide a basis for zzso the hazard to which a patient is exposed during zzso treatment and for zzso a zzso system to produce a sharply localized and effective acoustic zzso
