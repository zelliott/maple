In the outer hair cell zzso membrane zzso principally derives from two components - that associated with lateral membrane zzso charge movement, and that zzso to the membrane surface area zzso We used measures of membrane zzso to test a model hypothesis that zzso lateral membrane molecular motors, recently identified as the protein zzso zzso between two area zzso By measuring membrane zzso in native zzso or zzso zzso cells at extreme zzso zzso zzso where zzso charge movement is small or zzso we observed that zzso depends on the state of the motors, or zzso on membrane zzso zzso cells or control zzso cells, which lack motors, do not show this zzso We modeled the zzso change in zzso as a zzso process with the same parameters that describe the charge movement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larger during extreme zzso and the number of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso with the magnitude of Delta zzso zzso Although these data are consistent with the area motor model, the corresponding area change, assuming zzso zzso under constant membrane zzso is zzso large, and indicates that the zzso change must result from changes not only in lateral membrane area but also specific zzso Thus, we conclude that a zzso change in the lateral membrane zzso zzso additionally alters the zzso constant and/or thickness of the lateral plasma zzso
