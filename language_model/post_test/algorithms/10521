With the growing number of available microbial zzso zzso regulatory signals can now be revealed as zzso motifs in promoters of zzso genes zzso zzso A next challenge is to unravel zzso regulatory zzso Using as sole input zzso zzso we predicted zzso elements for each gene of the zzso zzso zzso by discovering zzso motifs in the promoters of their zzso in 19 zzso zzso We then linked all genes displaying similar motifs in their promoter regions and zzso a zzso network including zzso links between zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso highlights the high zzso value of the method: a majority of the zzso predictions zzso to already known zzso We also show that this zzso network is as accurate as a zzso network built from hundreds of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso validated 14 among 16 new functional links between orphan genes and known zzso This approach can be readily applied to unravel gene regulatory networks from hundreds of microbial zzso for which no other information is available except the zzso zzso benefits can easily be perceived when considering the exponential increase of new zzso zzso
