This paper presents the results obtained in a comparison of three zzso spectrum unfolding procedures based on the zzso zzso and zzso computer zzso The calculations were performed with data obtained previously from zzso using the zzso zzso sphere zzso and taken from the zzso the zzso zzso was done with the zzso zzso The evaluation of some spectrum zzso zzso is also zzso The codes give comparable zzso spectrum zzso Relative to ambient dose equivalent derived from the zzso sphere system, as a function of the unfolding code used, the zzso calculated readings were typically zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso times larger for the environment of a transport zzso with spent fuel elements zzso and inside the zzso building of a zzso water reactor zzso respectively, depending on the zzso zzso
