The benchmark test for prefrontal zzso zzso working memory in zzso is a delayed zzso task utilizing variations of zzso or zzso zzso which requires the animals to make specific arm entry responses for zzso In this task, however, manual procedures involved in shaping target behavior, imposing delays between trials and delivering rewards can potentially influence the zzso performance on the zzso Here, we report an automated zzso maze which does not zzso zzso interaction during zzso training or zzso This system incorporates a computer vision system for zzso motorized gates to impose delays, and automated reward zzso The maze is controlled by custom software that records the zzso location and activates the gates according to the zzso behavior and a control zzso The program performs calculations of task zzso tracks movement sequence through the zzso and provides other dependent variables (such as running speed, time spent in different maze locations, activity level during zzso Testing in rats indicates that the performance accuracy is zzso zzso to the delay zzso decreases with zzso zzso and that animals anticipate timing during long zzso Thus, our automated zzso maze is effective at assessing working memory and provides novel behavioral measures in zzso
