zzso spin relaxation times at 295 K were measured at zzso between 250 zzso and 34 zzso for zzso zzso zzso in five zzso with zzso that result in tumbling correlation times, zzso between 4 and 50 zzso and for three zzso pairs of zzso in water with zzso between 9 and 19 zzso To test the impact of structure on relaxation three additional zzso with zzso between 10 and 26 zzso were zzso In this fast tumbling regime zzso at zzso up to about 9 zzso At 34 zzso zzso due to increased contributions to zzso from incomplete zzso averaging of zzso and zzso is zzso to zzso The contribution to zzso from spin rotation is independent of frequency and decreases as zzso zzso Spin rotation dominates zzso at 34 zzso for all zzso zzso and at all zzso studied for zzso zzso The contribution to zzso from zzso of nitrogen zzso zzso increases as frequency decreases and as zzso increases; it dominates at low zzso for zzso zzso The contribution from zzso of g zzso is significant only at 34 zzso zzso of a zzso process was required to account for the observation that for most of the zzso zzso was smaller at 250 zzso than at 1-2 zzso The significant zzso isotope effect, the small zzso isotope effect, and the zzso dependence of the magnitude of the contribution from the zzso process suggest that it arises from zzso motions of the zzso ring that zzso the zzso A zzso
