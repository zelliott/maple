The effect of alcohol zzso on cocaine zzso and zzso was investigated in awake, freely moving zzso zzso plasma and brain zzso fluid zzso zzso profiles were characterized after zzso zzso administration of 30 zzso cocaine to rats that were zzso with either normal saline or alcohol at 5 zzso in a balanced crossover experimental zzso The zzso response to cocaine administration, measured as the change in zzso concentration in the nucleus zzso (N zzso and the change in the mean zzso blood pressure were monitored zzso zzso alcohol administration significantly increased cocaine systemic zzso after zzso administration from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, the zzso rate constant increased from zzso 199 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso due to alcohol zzso however, this increase was not zzso Alcohol zzso of cocaine metabolism caused an increase in cocaine elimination zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, cocaine tissue distribution was enhanced by alcohol, resulting in a significant increase in cocaine volume of zzso Analysis of the brain cocaine zzso effect relationship by the zzso zzso model showed that zzso increased from zzso zzso 200 to zzso zzso zzso of baseline due to alcohol zzso whereas zzso decreased from zzso zzso 580 to 2000 zzso 650 zzso indicating higher cocaine potency in the presence of zzso The estimates of the indirect zzso zzso model used to examine the plasma cocaine zzso in blood pressure relationship were not significantly different after the two zzso These results indicate that alcohol significantly alters cocaine zzso distribution, and zzso resulting in higher and prolonged cocaine plasma zzso Alcohol zzso also zzso the zzso response to cocaine zzso
