Automatic zzso of brain tissue on magnetic resonance images remains a challenge due to variations in brain shape and size, use of different pulse zzso overlapping signal zzso and imaging zzso An image analysis system that combines robust image processing techniques with zzso knowledge was developed to meet this zzso The system is fast, accurate, and robust to the zzso of brain anatomy and imaging conditions and is useful for studying the brain in healthy adults, patients with a zzso brain due to brain zzso and zzso With this new zzso method, the range of the proportion of brain tissue can be determined, thereby making good zzso possible even in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The system can zzso adjust the zzso processing to break the connection between brain and zzso tissue while preserving small brain zzso It can also segment the white matter and gray matter of the two zzso separated by the zzso zzso The zzso results can be zzso in either two or three zzso The system has been validated against 53 public data sets and zzso tested on 47 clinical data sets, yielding a better accuracy than that of the four most popular methods of brain zzso
