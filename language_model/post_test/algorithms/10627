We present an analysis of the domain boundary zzso a new category, in the sixth zzso experiment on the Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 1011 predictions submitted for 63 zzso Each prediction was compared to the set of zzso defined manually by visual inspection of the experimental zzso The comparison was scored using a new domain prediction scoring zzso As the definition of a domain is zzso many targets were assigned alternate zzso For such targets, each prediction was compared with all different definitions and the best score was zzso The zzso found it difficult to accurately predict domain boundaries when the target protein contained many zzso or zzso made of multiple sequence zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups were the most successful among human experts, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso did well among zzso
