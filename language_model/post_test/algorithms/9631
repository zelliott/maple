To make the results reasonable, existing joint zzso zzso have imposed a variety of constraints on zzso Actually, those constraints can be imposed zzso by minimizing the condition number of zzso zzso by this, the approximate joint zzso problem is reviewed as a zzso zzso problem for the first zzso Based on this, a new zzso for zzso joint zzso is zzso The new zzso yields zzso which not only minimize the zzso error but also have as small condition numbers as zzso Meanwhile, zzso solutions are avoided zzso Besides, the new zzso zzso few restrictions on the target set of zzso to be zzso which makes it widely zzso zzso results on convergence are presented and we also show that, for exactly jointly zzso sets, no local zzso exist and the solutions are unique under mild zzso zzso zzso simulations illustrate the performance of the zzso and provide comparison with other leading zzso zzso The practical use of our zzso is shown for blind source separation zzso problems, especially when zzso mixing zzso are zzso
