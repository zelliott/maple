The SURFACE zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared and zzso zzso zzso database is a zzso of zzso and compared protein surface zzso SURFACE contains the results of a large-scale protein zzso and local structural comparison zzso A zzso set of protein chains is used to build a database of protein surface patches, defined as putative surface functional zzso Each patch is zzso with sequence and zzso information about function or interaction zzso A new procedure for structure comparison is used to perform an zzso patches zzso zzso of the results obtained with stringent parameters offers a similarity score that can be used to associate different patches and allows reliable zzso by zzso zzso exerted through the comparison of regions of protein surface allows the highlighting of similarities that cannot be recognized by other methods of sequence or structure zzso A graphic representation of the surface patches, functional zzso and the structural zzso is available through the web zzso
