The detection of relative motion, zzso motion contrast, has been reported for zzso zzso in several zzso systems, yet the mechanism underlying zzso sensitivity remains zzso An zzso for computing motion contrast directly from the moving intensity distribution is zzso In this algorithm, the zzso intensity distribution of the visual space is zzso with a periodic zzso For coherent motion, the resulting zzso integral reduces to a traveling wave of fixed zzso while incoherent motion causes the zzso to zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso provides a measure of motion zzso The zzso is successful in zzso tuning zzso derived from zzso of zzso sensitivity in avian zzso and zzso middle zzso zzso
