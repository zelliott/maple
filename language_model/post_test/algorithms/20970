The genetic basis of complex diseases is expected to be highly heterogeneous, with many disease zzso where each gene by itself has only a small zzso Based on the zzso contributions of disease genes across the zzso to complex diseases, we introduce the concept of single zzso zzso zzso synergistic zzso A zzso approach is applied to detect the genetic association of synergistic blocks with a zzso In the first stage, synergistic blocks associated with a complex disease are identified by zzso zzso patterns and choosing blocks within a cluster that minimize a diversity zzso In the second stage, a zzso zzso model is given for a synergistic zzso Using simulated zzso data, we demonstrate that our method has reasonable power to identify zzso zzso To further evaluate the performance of our method, we apply our method to 17 zzso of four candidate genes for paranoid schizophrenia in a Chinese zzso Five synergistic blocks are found to be associated with zzso three of which are zzso associated zzso ratio, OR zzso zzso P zzso zzso while the others are positively associated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mathematical models of these five synergistic blocks are zzso The results suggest that there may be interactive effects for schizophrenia among zzso of the genes zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso the regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso Using synergistic blocks, we can reduce the zzso in a zzso association analysis, and evaluate the sizes of interactive effects among multiple disease genes on complex zzso
