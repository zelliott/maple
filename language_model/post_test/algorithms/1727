The expected performance of spatial zzso two-dimensional liquid zzso zzso has been calculated using the zzso zzso This approach allowed different objectives zzso peak capacity, total analysis time, and total zzso to be considered simultaneously and to establish optimal parameters zzso drop, particle size, bed zzso and initial spot zzso The performance of spatial two-dimensional zzso systems was compared with that of conventional zzso real-time two-dimensional zzso systems zzso The potential gain in peak capacity and/or analysis time of the spatial zzso was zzso By restricting the spatial parameters to realistic zzso conditions zzso the stress, as counterbalance for the pressure drop through the zzso bed, to zzso zzso it was found that zzso is attractive for very fast analysis of complex samples, rather than for extremely efficient zzso For example, a peak capacity of zzso may be achieved in only zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso bed of a quality currently encountered zzso zzso Furthermore, if beds can be packed as efficiently as contemporary zzso the predicted peak capacity increases to around zzso corresponding to a zzso rate of about zzso zzso zzso to boost the performance of zzso further are briefly zzso Unless we can overcome the severe stress requirements of zzso zzso conventional zzso may be more amenable to very complex zzso thanks to the very high peak zzso However, zzso zzso will require long analysis times zzso 10,000 zzso in 37 zzso corresponding to zzso zzso at a pressure drop of 40 zzso The best zzso between total peak capacity, total analysis time, and total dilution under restricted zzso conditions was obtained using high pressures, small zzso beds, small zzso and relatively large sample zzso
