Growth equations can be used in zzso based zzso zzso modeling to provide zzso parameters zzso body weight, zzso zzso for maturing zzso No diligent systematic exercise was found in the literature dealing with growth equations for developing zzso zzso A generalized zzso zzso model, originally developed to fit body weight zzso age data, was chosen to estimate different zzso compartment zzso The zzso model has the functional form: zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso where zzso is zzso weight at a specified age, zzso and zzso are weight at birth and zzso growth respectively, and K and gamma are zzso zzso of freshly collected zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso brain, gastrointestinal tract and zzso zzso measured in male zzso rats of different ages zzso zzso in our laboratory, were used to evaluate this zzso zzso The zzso model was fitted to the organ zzso and the resulting parameters were statistically significant for all zzso and zzso zzso weights were highly correlated with their respective zzso zzso organ growth and percent body weight zzso zzso of different zzso were plotted against animal age and compared with experimental zzso The zzso organ growth and zzso fraction profiles were in general agreement with our empirical data as well as previous zzso The zzso model gave adequately precise weight predictions at all ages for all the zzso zzso
