zzso zzso zzso are an important second zzso in zzso zzso They are involved in numerous zzso processes which are triggered by calcium signals in the form of local release events, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso spread of calcium signals in the zzso is strongly affected by zzso proteins zzso In addition, the zzso contains a large number of zzso molecules and molecular structures which make it a crowded zzso Here, we investigate the effects of such excluded volumes on calcium diffusion in the presence of different kinds of zzso We find that the contributions in slowing down zzso diffusion coming from zzso and molecular crowding are not zzso zzso the reduction in zzso zzso due to crowding and zzso together is not the sum of each single zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and high affinity mobile buffers the effective diffusion zzso of zzso can be reduced by up to zzso in highly crowded zzso This suggests that molecular crowding may significantly affect the shape of zzso zzso and wave propagation in cell types with high excluded volume zzso
