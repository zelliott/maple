We investigate interaction networks that we derive from zzso time series with methods frequently employed in diverse scientific fields such as biology, quantitative finance, physics, earth and climate sciences, and the zzso zzso experimental situations, we generate time series with finite length and varying frequency content but from independent zzso zzso Using the correlation zzso and the maximum zzso we estimate zzso between these time zzso With zzso zzso and average shortest path zzso we observe zzso interaction networks, derived via zzso the values of zzso to possess zzso zzso as compared to zzso networks, which would indicate zzso zzso These zzso reflect the mostly unavoidable zzso of the data, which limits the reliability of typically used zzso of signal zzso We propose random networks that are tailored to the way interaction networks are derived from empirical zzso Through an exemplary investigation of zzso zzso recordings of zzso zzso for their complex spatial and zzso zzso show that such random networks help to distinguish network properties of zzso structures related to seizure dynamics from those zzso induced by the applied methods of zzso
