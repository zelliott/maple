Cellular processes are governed and coordinated by a multitude of zzso A zzso can be viewed as a complex network of zzso zzso The dynamics of this network largely determines the functioning of the zzso Hence the modeling and analysis of zzso networks dynamics is an important problem and is an active area of zzso Here we review quantitative models of zzso networks based on ordinary differential equations zzso We mainly focus on the zzso zzso and sensitivity analysis problems and survey the current methods for tackling zzso In this context we also highlight a recently developed zzso approximation technique using which these two problems can be considerably zzso
