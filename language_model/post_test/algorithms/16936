zzso of gene expression in response to regulatory molecules or zzso could lead to different zzso zzso zzso have been discovered to be involved in regulation of gene expression and a wide variety of zzso In a zzso biological network of human zzso their predicted target genes and the diseases caused by altered expressions of these zzso valuable knowledge about the zzso of zzso involved genes and related disease classes can be revealed by zzso zzso target genes and diseases zzso zzso zzso can lead to more zzso results than traditional zzso with only two kinds of members and pass the hidden zzso information along the relation chain by considering zzso zzso Here we report a spectral zzso zzso for zzso graph to find clusters with zzso zzso We use the method to explore the potential relationships among zzso genes and zzso The clusters obtained from the zzso have significantly higher density than randomly selected zzso which means members in the same cluster are more likely to have common zzso zzso also show that zzso in the same family based on the hairpin sequences tend to belong to the same zzso We also validate the zzso results by checking the correlation of enriched gene functions and disease classes in the same zzso Finally, widely studied zzso and its zzso are analyzed as a case study to reveal that genes and diseases zzso with the zzso are in accordance with current research zzso
