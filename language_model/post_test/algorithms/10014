zzso echo zzso is a measure of zzso and sensitivity to zzso of quantum zzso For weak zzso its zzso rate is given by the zzso of the local density of states zzso When the zzso is strong enough, it has been shown in chaotic systems that its zzso is dictated by the classical zzso zzso However, several recent studies have shown an unexpected zzso zzso rate as a function of the zzso strength instead of that zzso zzso Here we study the systematic behavior of this regime in zzso cat zzso We show that some zzso produce coherent zzso in the zzso of zzso that imprint clear signals of the zzso in zzso zzso We also show that if the zzso acts in a small region of phase space zzso zzso the effect is magnified and the zzso is given by the zzso of the zzso
