The zzso zzso zzso has been widely used in fields of dealing with zzso speech recognition and image processing with zzso zzso However, the local zzso problem usually occurs in the process of zzso To solve this problem and to speed up the learning process, we propose a modified error function by adding a term to the conventional error function, which is corresponding to the hidden layer zzso The simulation results show that the proposed zzso is capable of preventing the learning from sticking into the local zzso and of speeding up the zzso
