Our approach to zzso zzso includes three main zzso First, we run zzso a rigid body zzso program based on the Fast zzso zzso zzso correlation approach, extended to use zzso interactions zzso Second, the 1000 best energy zzso are zzso and the 30 largest clusters are retained for zzso Third, the stability of the clusters is analyzed by short zzso Carlo simulations, and the structures are refined by the zzso zzso method zzso The first two steps of this approach are implemented in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite being fully zzso the last step is zzso too expensive to be included in the zzso When comparing the models obtained in zzso rounds zzso by zzso by the refinement of the zzso predictions and by all predictor groups, we arrived at three zzso First, for the first time in the zzso history, our automated zzso server was able to compete with the best human predictor zzso Second, selecting the top ranked models, our current protocol reliably generates high-quality structures of zzso complexes from the structures of separately zzso zzso even in the absence of biological information, provided that there is limited backbone zzso zzso Third, despite occasional successes, zzso modeling requires further improvement to achieve reliable zzso zzso
