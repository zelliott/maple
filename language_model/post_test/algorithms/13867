We describe an zzso and zzso theory of zzso zzso shape and zzso Unlike previous theories, our model is derived from a single zzso that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a random walk in a lattice whose points are positions and zzso in the image plane zzso the space that one can reasonably assume is represented by zzso of the zzso visual zzso Our model does not employ zzso relaxation or other explicit zzso but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be zzso directly as the product of two zzso zzso We show that for the random walk we zzso the maximum likelihood paths are zzso of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of zzso zzso A computer model is demonstrated on numerous zzso zzso stimuli from the zzso
