Approximate zzso chirped solitary pulse zzso zzso zzso solutions of the one-dimensional complex zzso zzso zzso equation are zzso These solutions are stable and highly accurate under condition of domination of a normal zzso over a spectral zzso The zzso space of the zzso is zzso that makes theirs to be easily traceable within a whole range of the equation zzso Scaling properties of the chirped zzso zzso are highly interesting for applications in the field of zzso zzso laser zzso
