Clinical databases may contain several records for a single zzso Multiple general zzso zzso have been developed to identify such duplicate zzso To achieve optimal zzso zzso parameters must be tuned to a particular zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the required training set size for zzso deterministic and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with parameters zzso using the particle swarm zzso Each zzso classified potential zzso zzso zzso match, zzso and indeterminate zzso requires manual zzso Training sets size ranged from zzso randomly selected zzso We also evaluated marginal uncertainty sampling for active zzso zzso reduced manual review size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso classified zzso of the records correctly zzso Best performance required training on all 10,000 zzso zzso Active learning achieved comparable results with 3,000 zzso zzso zzso is effective and targeted sampling can reduce the required training set zzso
