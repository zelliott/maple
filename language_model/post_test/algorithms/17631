Human zzso virus zzso is a syndrome characterized by changes in fat distribution and insulin zzso Prior studies suggest markedly reduced growth hormone zzso levels in association with excess visceral zzso among patients with zzso We investigated mechanisms of altered zzso zzso in a population of 13 male zzso patients with evidence of fat zzso compared with 10 zzso patients and 11 male healthy controls similar in age and body mass index zzso Although similar in zzso the zzso group was characterized by increased visceral zzso free fatty acids zzso and insulin and reduced zzso zzso We investigated zzso and the effects of acute lowering of zzso by zzso on zzso responses to growth zzso hormone zzso We also investigated zzso tone, comparing zzso response to combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone with a zzso zzso Our data demonstrate an equivalent number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso h in the zzso zzso and healthy control groups, respectively, P zzso zzso but markedly reduced zzso zzso pulse area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse area, and zzso pulse zzso in the zzso patients compared with the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso 546 zzso 45 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso response to zzso by excess zzso and increased zzso tone contribute to reduced zzso zzso in patients with zzso These data provide novel insight into the zzso regulation of zzso zzso in subjects with zzso
