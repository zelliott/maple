Human zzso zzso zzso were recorded from 10 subjects presented with visual target and zzso stimuli at five screen locations and responding to targets presented at one of the zzso The late positive response complexes of zzso zzso average zzso from the two task conditions were simultaneously analyzed with Independent zzso zzso a new zzso method for blindly separating zzso mixed zzso Three zzso zzso temporally independent, zzso relevant, and zzso plausible components were identified without reference to zzso in single-channel zzso A novel zzso component zzso began at approximately 140 zzso and peaked, in faster responders, at the onset of the motor zzso The scalp distribution of zzso appeared consistent with brain regions activated during spatial zzso in functional imaging zzso A zzso large component zzso positive over zzso cortex, was followed by a zzso potential zzso component that peaked 200 zzso after the button press and reversed polarity near the central zzso A fourth component associated with a left zzso zzso zzso zzso was evoked primarily by zzso zzso presented in the attended zzso When no zzso were zzso responses of five zzso subjects contained largest zzso and smallest zzso zzso when zzso were included, a zzso component appeared only in responses of the five zzso zzso zzso relationships between component zzso zzso and behavioral responses, plus similarities between component scalp zzso and regional zzso reported in functional brain imaging experiments suggest that zzso zzso and zzso measure the time course and strength of functionally distinct brain zzso
