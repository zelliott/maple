zzso principles in chemistry, zzso and zzso have been used extensively for zzso Nevertheless, it is well known that zzso frequently breaks down in complex zzso zzso within protein double zzso free energy cycles of zzso close zzso pairs is a generally zzso phenomenon, whereas a robust description of zzso extending over large distances remains to be zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that the zzso effects tend to be zzso if two structurally zzso zzso zzso belong to the same rigid cluster within the wild type zzso and additive if they are located within different zzso We find the hypothesis to be statistically significant with zzso that range from zzso to zzso To the best of our knowledge, this result represents the first demonstration of a statistically significant preponderance for zzso over long zzso These findings provide new insight into the origins of long-range zzso in double zzso cycles, which zzso the conventional wisdom that zzso arises in double zzso involving zzso zzso zzso these results should have far-reaching implications for a proper understanding of protein stability, zzso zzso and protein zzso
