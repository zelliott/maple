Important tissue parameters such as elasticity can be deduced from the study of the propagation of low frequency zzso zzso A new method for measuring the zzso zzso in soft zzso is presented in this zzso Unlike conventional transient zzso in which the zzso zzso and the low frequency vibrator are two separated parts, the new method relies on a probe that associates the vibrator and the zzso which is built on the axis of the zzso This setup is easy to zzso The low frequency zzso wave is driven by the zzso itself that acts as a zzso while it is used in pulse echo mode to acquire zzso zzso The results obtained with the new method are in good agreement with those obtained with the conventional zzso
