zzso zzso of brain activity recorded by zzso zzso requires that the forward problem, zzso the magnetic field caused by a zzso source current in a homogeneous volume conductor, be solved zzso We have used the zzso method with zzso linear basis functions in the boundary element method to improve the solution of the forward zzso In addition, we have replaced the direct method, zzso the zzso decomposition, by a modern zzso method to solve the dense linear system of equations arising from the boundary element zzso In this paper we describe a zzso method which we have combined with the zzso method to accelerate the solution of the forward problem and to avoid the explicit formation of the dense zzso zzso For example, with a triangular mesh of 18,000 zzso the CPU time to solve the forward problem was decreased from zzso h to less than 5 zzso and the computer memory requirements were decreased from zzso zzso to 156 zzso The method makes it possible to solve quickly significantly larger problems with zzso zzso
