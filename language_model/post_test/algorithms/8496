zzso of zzso from surrounding normal tissue into the wound bed is an important requirement for successful wound zzso This study investigated the zzso pattern of zzso zzso and skin zzso to determine whether differences in the wound healing efficiency at these sites can be explained by differences in the zzso behavior of their respective zzso zzso The migratory characteristics were studied in a two-dimensional culture zzso The migration of single cells was zzso video recorded at intervals of 15 zzso for a period of 6 h using a zzso microscope zzso For evaluation of cell zzso cell contours were recognized zzso and used for determination of cell area, cell spreading and number and length of zzso We found that the cellular displacement of the zzso zzso was only approximately 50% of the cellular displacement of zzso and skin zzso The decreased cellular displacement of the zzso zzso was found to be due to both lower cellular speed and less persistence in zzso The zzso zzso also displayed smaller areas and longer zzso The differences in cellular zzso and zzso pattern amongst the three zzso types could not be explained by differences in zzso of zzso zzso components and are therefore believed to reflect zzso differences amongst zzso zzso
