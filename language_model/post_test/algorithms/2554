zzso zzso have played significant roles in the discovery of gene function, but organized collection of zzso data has been overshadowed by developments in sequencing zzso In order to study zzso zzso large-scale projects with standardized objective assessment across populations are considered zzso The report of the 2006 Human zzso Project meeting zzso et zzso 2007) recommended documentation of zzso through electronic means by collaborative groups of zzso scientists and clinicians using standard, structured descriptions of zzso zzso In this report, we describe progress over the past decade in three-dimensional zzso digital imaging and shape analysis of the face, and future prospects for large-scale facial zzso zzso examples are given throughout using a collection of zzso zzso face images of healthy controls and individuals with a range of genetic conditions involving facial zzso
