This article examines functional and anatomical connectivity in healthy human subjects measured with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso connectivity in white matter is obtained from zzso of the diffusion zzso A zzso simulation determines the probability that a particle zzso between two points, with the probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given zzso being based on the local value of the diffusion zzso zzso zzso connectivity between zzso matter zzso is assessed without recourse to a specific zzso zzso by calculating the correlation zzso between random fluctuations in the blood zzso zzso signal time course in different zzso The methods are used to examine the anatomical and functional zzso between crowns of adjacent zzso A high functional connectivity was found between zzso matter zzso with white matter displaying only very low zzso A comparison of the zzso of anatomical and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity were not found together with high values of anatomical zzso zzso pairs of regions situated around the central zzso indicated a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each zzso These results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show high functional zzso but that the inverse need not be true as functional connectivity may also be indirectly zzso via more distant zzso matter zzso
