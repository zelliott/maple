Multiple zzso factors zzso control zzso regulation of genes in zzso Although many zzso methods consider the identification of individual zzso factor binding sites zzso very few focus on the interactions between these zzso We consider finding zzso and their context specific interactions using zzso gene expression zzso We devise a hybrid approach called zzso composed of a zzso identification method combined with the new zzso methodology logic zzso zzso has two steps: First, potential binding sites are identified from zzso control regions of genes of zzso Various available methods can be used in this step when the genes of interest can be divided into groups such as zzso zzso For this step, we also develop a simple zzso zzso and extension method zzso to extract candidate zzso from a large number of genes in the availability of zzso gene expression zzso zzso provides an alternative method for this step when zzso of the genes into zzso groups is not zzso This first step aims to identify individual sites within gene groups of interest or sites that are correlated with the gene expression zzso In the second step, logic zzso is used to build a zzso model of outcome of interest zzso gene expression or zzso and zzso using these potential zzso This zzso approach creates a rich diverse set of potential binding sites in the first step and builds zzso or zzso models in the second step using logic zzso that is particularly good at identifying complex zzso 

zzso is applied to two publicly available zzso A zzso gene expression data set of zzso zzso is used for zzso The zzso models obtained are zzso and the biological implications are in agreement with the known zzso This analysis suggests that zzso provides biologically more reasonable zzso models than previous analysis of this zzso with standard linear zzso zzso Another zzso of zzso illustrates the use of zzso in zzso questions by building a model that discriminates between zzso and zzso genes in iron copper zzso zzso identifies an zzso and two zzso motifs in this zzso The zzso motif matches the binding site of the zzso factor zzso that has a key role in regulation of the zzso zzso One of the novel zzso sites is highly present in zzso control regions of zzso zzso This site could represent a zzso for an unknown zzso factor involved in repression of genes zzso zzso proteins in iron zzso We establish the zzso of the method to the type of outcome variable used by considering both continuous and zzso outcome variables for this zzso Our results indicate that logic zzso used in combination with zzso operating binding site identification methods or with our proposed method zzso is a powerful and flexible alternative to linear zzso based motif finding zzso 

zzso code for logic zzso is freely available as a package of the R programming language by zzso et zzso zzso and can be downloaded at zzso an R package for zzso is available at zzso
