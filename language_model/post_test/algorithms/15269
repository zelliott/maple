zzso storage and retrieval of zzso zzso based on range intervals is necessary, given the amount of data produced by next-generation sequencing zzso The indexing strategies of zzso database systems (such as zzso greatly inhibit their use in zzso zzso zzso This has led to the development of zzso applications that are dependent on zzso zzso In this work, we introduce zzso an zzso of the zzso data structure within a zzso zzso zzso enables the storage, update and rapid retrieval of zzso zzso from the convenience of a zzso database zzso zzso zzso of 1 million zzso are retrieved in under a minute, making this approach feasible for zzso zzso zzso Database zzso zzso
