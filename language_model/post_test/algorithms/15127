To evaluate the relationship between chronic zzso failure zzso defined through zzso zzso zzso and zzso formula score and the patient's cardiovascular risk measured through cardiovascular disease zzso such as zzso zzso cerebrovascular disease and peripheral zzso zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso zzso Mean age was zzso years and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso score was calculated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso was estimated from zzso serum zzso using the zzso zzso of Diet in Renal Disease equation zzso zzso was measured in first morning urine zzso 

Using zzso formula zzso zzso zzso zzso of subjects had zzso Of them, 12 zzso had cardiovascular disease zzso Among patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects had history of previous cardiovascular diseases zzso p zzso zzso Square Chi zzso Using the zzso formula zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso 60 zzso Of them, 18 zzso had cardiovascular disease zzso Among patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso 188 subjects had history of previous cardiovascular diseases zzso p zzso zzso Square Chi zzso zzso ratio for cardiovascular diseases using zzso definition of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated to higher pulse pressure zzso and increased urinary zzso zzso 

A significant cardiovascular risk was associated to the diagnosis of zzso through zzso zzso This relation was closer than the obtained using zzso estimated zzso in spite of a bigger zzso zzso formula seems to be a useful tool for diagnosing zzso and evaluate the cardiovascular risk of these zzso
