We propose and investigate the performance of a new zzso zzso designed to identify potentially zzso data points for zzso An incremental zzso update scheme is used to build a zzso using a subset of these points as zzso basis function zzso The minimum descriptive length and the zzso error criteria are employed for automatic model zzso The proposed scheme is shown to generate zzso models, which perform zzso comparable to the state-of-the-art support and relevance zzso zzso
