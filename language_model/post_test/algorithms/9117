We present an evolutionary zzso which predicts stable atomic structures and phase zzso by searching the energy landscape of empirical and zzso zzso zzso zzso and geometrical degrees of freedom may be varied zzso We show that this method zzso information from favorable local structure at one composition to predict that at others, achieving far greater efficiency of phase zzso prediction than a method which relies on sampling compositions zzso We detail this and a number of other zzso techniques implemented in the genetic zzso for structure prediction code that is now publicly zzso We test the efficiency of the software by searching the zzso zzso system using an empirical zzso model zzso In addition to testing the algorithm, we also evaluate the accuracy of the potential zzso We find that the potential zzso several correct zzso zzso while a few of the predicted ground states are zzso Our results suggest that genetic zzso searches can be used to improve the methodology of empirical potential zzso
