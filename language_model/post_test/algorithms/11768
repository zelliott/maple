zzso the functional significance of alternative zzso and other mechanisms that generate zzso transcript diversity is an important challenge facing modern-day molecular zzso Using zzso protein sequence analysis methods, it should be possible to investigate how transcript diversity impacts protein structure and zzso To test this, a data mining technique zzso was developed to identify and catalog genes producing protein zzso which exhibit distinct profiles of zzso protein zzso We found that out of a test set of over 1,300 alternatively spliced genes with solved zzso structure, over zzso exhibited a differential profile of zzso zzso and/or zzso protein motifs across distinct zzso These results suggest that motif databases such as zzso and zzso are potentially useful tools for investigating how alternative transcript structure affects gene zzso
