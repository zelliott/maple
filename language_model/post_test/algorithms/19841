zzso large zzso zzso zzso includes two zzso important zzso the zzso center zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso approaches for predicting the survival of patients with zzso following zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso We identified 62 patients with zzso who either had an initial complete zzso (17 zzso or received salvage chemotherapy for relapsed or zzso disease zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using the Hans algorithm, we classified 50% of the cases as zzso type, whereas the Choi zzso classified zzso as zzso type and zzso was positive in zzso However, no significant differences were found in the zzso overall or zzso zzso using any of these zzso In conclusion, cell of origin fails to predict survival of zzso patients treated with zzso
