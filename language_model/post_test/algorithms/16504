zzso zzso zzso occurs as the result of complex interactions of multiple genetic and environmental zzso By conducting a zzso wide association study in a Japanese population using zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified a novel susceptible locus for zzso on zzso zzso An zzso zzso in this locus showed significant association in several independent zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso comparison of zzso zzso Association study using tag zzso in the same linkage zzso block revealed that two additional zzso zzso and zzso zzso risk of zzso These findings indicate that the zzso on zzso zzso are novel protective genetic factors against zzso
