zzso gene feature sets is a key issue for both zzso zzso for instance, tumor zzso in a DNA zzso experiment, and prediction in the context of genetic regulatory zzso Two broad methods are available to estimate the error zzso zzso of a zzso zzso fits a single zzso to the data, and applies this zzso in turn to each data zzso zzso (in zzso zzso removes each observation in turn, zzso the zzso and then zzso whether this zzso zzso correctly zzso the deleted zzso zzso typically zzso zzso error, severely so in many zzso zzso has the advantage of producing an effectively unbiased error estimate, but the estimate is highly zzso In many applications it is not the zzso rate per zzso that is of interest, but rather the construction of gene sets that have the potential to zzso or zzso zzso one needs to rank feature sets based on their zzso 

A zzso approach is used to compare the ranking performances of zzso and zzso for zzso based on zzso feature sets and for prediction in the context of zzso zzso networks zzso For zzso a zzso model is considered, along with zzso via linear zzso analysis and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is examined in the zzso of a zzso Three metrics are proposed to compare zzso ranking based on error zzso with ranking based on the true error, which is known zzso to the zzso zzso In all cases, zzso is competitive with zzso relative to ranking zzso This is in addition to the enormous savings in zzso time afforded by zzso
