Currently, there is an increasing interest for setting up medical systems that can screen a large number of people for sight threatening diseases, such as diabetic zzso This paper presents a method for automated identification of zzso zzso in zzso images based on zzso intelligence zzso The color retinal images are segmented using fuzzy zzso zzso following some zzso steps, zzso color zzso and contrast zzso The entire segmented images establish a zzso of zzso To zzso these segmented regions into zzso and zzso a set of initial features such as color, size, edge strength, and texture are zzso A zzso zzso is used to rank the features and identify the subset that gives the best zzso zzso The selected feature zzso are then classified using a zzso neural network zzso The zzso was implemented using a large image zzso consisting of 300 manually labeled retinal images, and could identify affected retinal images with zzso sensitivity while it recognized zzso of the normal images, zzso the zzso Moreover, the proposed scheme illustrated an accuracy including zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso for identification of retinal zzso at the zzso zzso
