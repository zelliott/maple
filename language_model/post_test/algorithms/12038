Bone mineral density zzso are widely used to estimate the relative risk of hip zzso In addition, many other risk factors have been identified, some of which are known to add to the risk independently of other risk factors, including bone mineral density zzso In this paper we develop an zzso that converts relative risks for hip fracture to absolute (15 years and zzso risks, modeled on the population of zzso Lifetime risks increased as expected with increments in relative zzso Average lifetime risk in women at the age of 50 years was zzso which increased to zzso when the relative risk was zzso In men the risk increased from zzso to zzso The identification of high-risk groups had little effect on the specificity of assessments but increased the sensitivity over a wide range of zzso The zzso in lifetime risk was relatively stable across all ages, reducing the complexity of computing lifetime risks from relative zzso The derivation of absolute risk from relative risk permits the zzso of selection of individuals or populations either for further risk assessment or for zzso
