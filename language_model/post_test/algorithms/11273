Certain patients who receive zzso zzso factor zzso for zzso zzso stem cell zzso collection fail to mobilize well enough to proceed with zzso When zzso is used with zzso the likelihood of achieving the zzso stem cell target in fewer collections is zzso zzso use in all patients is unlikely to be zzso This study zzso evaluated the effectiveness of utilizing a peripheral blood zzso stem cell count zzso zzso on day 4 of zzso zzso zzso as a threshold for zzso administration, and compared the efficacy of collection and cost analysis using historical zzso All patients in the study cohort reached their zzso targets in zzso zzso zzso more patients who received zzso + zzso versus zzso alone reached their zzso target in one collection zzso zzso zzso however, there were no significant differences in the number of collections or in cumulative product zzso The historical cohort had zzso zzso zzso the number of collections per patient needed to reach the target was significantly higher in the historical cohort versus study cohort zzso zzso zzso as was the number of patients requiring more than one collection to reach their target zzso zzso zzso However, the average cost per patient was also significantly higher in the study cohort zzso zzso zzso Further refinement of the zzso may reduce the difference in cost between the two zzso zzso
