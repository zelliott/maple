Due to the increasing popularity of iris zzso new sensors are being developed for acquiring iris images and existing ones are being continuously zzso zzso users every time a new sensor is deployed is expensive and zzso especially in applications with a large number of enrolled zzso However, recent studies show that zzso matching, where the test samples are verified using data enrolled with a different zzso often lead to reduced zzso In this paper, we propose a machine learning technique to mitigate the zzso performance degradation by adapting the iris samples from one sensor to zzso We first present a novel zzso framework for learning transformations on iris zzso We then zzso this framework for sensor adaptation, by reducing the distance between samples of the same class, and increasing it between samples of different classes, irrespective of the sensors acquiring zzso zzso evaluations on iris data from multiple sensors demonstrate that the proposed method leads to improvement in zzso recognition zzso Furthermore, since the proposed technique requires minimal changes to the iris recognition pipeline, it can easily be incorporated into existing iris recognition zzso
