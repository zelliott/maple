A mathematical model describing zzso transport in a zzso hollow fiber zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso in the circulating cell culture media was developed to explore the potential of zzso in properly zzso a zzso liver assist device zzso The zzso model is based on the geometry of a commercial zzso zzso operated under zzso zzso The zzso transport model considers fluid motion of a homogeneous mixture of cell culture media and zzso and mass transport of dissolved zzso in a single zzso Each zzso consists of three distinct zzso zzso the zzso zzso the homogeneous mixture of cell culture media and zzso zzso the membrane zzso separates the zzso from the zzso space zzso and zzso the zzso zzso cells reside in this zzso In a single zzso dissolved zzso is predominantly transported in the zzso via zzso in the zzso direction and via diffusion in the zzso direction through the membrane and zzso The resulting transport equations are solved using the finite element zzso The calculated zzso transfer flux showed that supplementation of the cell culture media with zzso can significantly enhance zzso transport to the zzso of the zzso when compared with a control with no zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso distribution and subsequent analysis of zzso zzso demonstrate that limited in zzso zzso zzso can be zzso with proper selection of the operational settings of the zzso zzso Taken together, this model can also be used to zzso the operating conditions for future zzso development that aim to fully zzso the zzso varied zzso
