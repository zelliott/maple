We studied kinetic pathways of zzso transitions in zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso During the zzso phase transition in an zzso zzso system, the stripe phase first develops a zzso instability along the phase zzso which grows and drives the stripes to break up into droplets that arrange into a zzso zzso These dynamic features are consistent with recent experimental zzso During the zzso phase transition in an zzso zzso system, the zzso state first passes through a transient zzso structure, which eventually breaks up into a zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest experiments with synthetic zzso where the zzso patterns could be zzso
