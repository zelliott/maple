zzso in the brain form highly complex networks through synaptic zzso Traditionally, functional connectivity between zzso has been explored using methods such as zzso which do not contain any notion of zzso Recently, an zzso approach based on directed information theory has been proposed as a way to zzso the direction of zzso However, it is still unclear whether this new approach provides any additional insight beyond conventional correlation zzso In this paper, we present a modified procedure for zzso directed information and provide a comparison of results obtained using correlation analyses on both simulated and experimental zzso Using zzso realistic simulations, we demonstrate that directed information can outperform correlation in determining connections between neural spike trains while also providing zzso of the relationship, which cannot be assessed using zzso zzso applying our method to zzso and zzso data sets, we demonstrate that directed information can accurately estimate the zzso delay in connections between different brain zzso Moreover, directed information reveals connectivity structures that are not captured by zzso zzso directed information provides accurate and novel insights into the functional connectivity of neural ensembles that are zzso to data from zzso studies in awake behaving zzso
