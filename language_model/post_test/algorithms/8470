The distribution function of pulmonary transit times zzso contains information on the transit time of blood through the lungs and the zzso in transit zzso Most of the previous studies have used specific functional forms with adjustable parameters to characterize the zzso It is the purpose here to investigate the possibility of zzso the zzso in a zzso zzso The method employs the maximum zzso principle and is used, in particular, on cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso studies but is believed to be more generally zzso Using this principle in a test case, we were able to accurately identify a zzso transfer function, which may theoretically be seen in patients with pulmonary disease confined to one zzso Transit time values for zzso were produced by applying the zzso to PET studies from normal zzso
