zzso A is a member of the plant zzso (or plant zzso family that contains two metal binding zzso one, called S1, is occupied by zzso and the other, zzso by zzso zzso zzso double resonance zzso zzso were performed on a single crystal of zzso A at zzso (95 zzso zzso zzso to determine the zzso nuclear zzso interaction in a protein binding site and its relation to structural zzso Such zzso are easier at a high field because of the high sensitivity for zzso samples and the reduction of zzso effects on the spectrum which zzso spectral zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso rotation patterns showed that two chemically zzso zzso types are present at low temperatures, although the high-resolution X-ray structure reported only one zzso Their zzso zzso constants, zzso are significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso only zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso data also refined the zzso zzso determined earlier by zzso zzso zzso yielding a small but significant difference between the two: zzso zzso for M and zzso zzso for zzso The principal zzso for M is not aligned with any of the zzso directions, but is 25 off the zzso direction, and its orientation is different than that of the zzso splitting zzso zzso Because of the small zzso interaction of M the orientation dependence was very mild, leading to larger uncertainties in the asymmetry zzso Nonetheless, there too zzso is not along the zzso bonds and is rotated 90 with respect to zzso These results show, that similar to the zzso the zzso interaction is highly sensitive to small differences in the coordination sphere of the zzso and the resolution of the two types is in agreement with the earlier observation of a zzso zzso dynamic detected through the zzso interaction, which is frozen out at low temperatures and averaged at room zzso To account for the structural origin of the different zzso values, the electric field zzso zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso The calculations showed that a relatively small displacement of the oxygen zzso of zzso can lead to differences on the order observed zzso
