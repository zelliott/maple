The global extended Kalman filtering zzso zzso for zzso neural networks zzso is plagued by the drawback of high zzso cost and storage zzso In this paper, we present a local zzso zzso approach that can solve this zzso In particular, the zzso obtained along with the local zzso training, can be zzso to measure the importance of the network zzso Comparing with the original global approach, the proposed local approach results in much lower zzso cost and storage zzso zzso it is more practical in solving real world zzso zzso showed that our approach is an effective zzso method for zzso under online zzso
