zzso is essential for nutritional assessment but direct measurement is not possible in zzso zzso Height prediction models have been developed for elderly persons but none is available for middle-aged zzso We aimed to validate new equations for height prediction in middle-aged zzso 

zzso zzso zzso adults zzso zzso zzso zzso men, 319 zzso were studied for zzso zzso standing zzso knee zzso and zzso zzso and body composition zzso mass by zzso The effect of estimated height on the derivation of body mass index and surface area, zzso mass, and resting energy expenditure was zzso Multiple zzso analyzed the zzso in stature zzso The best model was selected according to the highest zzso value and the lowest root mean square zzso 

We obtained a model valid for men and women that included age, knee zzso and gender zzso zzso zzso root mean square error zzso zzso zzso limits of agreement zzso to zzso zzso The use of estimated height in the calculation of body mass index, body surface area, zzso mass, and zzso produced acceptable zzso Application of the model to a control sample resulted in pure errors comparable to root mean square errors of the validation zzso In addition, the use of nationally representative models, introduced for elderly persons by zzso et zzso zzso Am Diet zzso zzso appeared to produce similar but slightly higher biases in both zzso 

In middle-aged zzso height can be estimated with acceptable accuracy by the model proposed in this zzso The derivation of body mass index, body surface area, zzso mass, and resting energy expenditure by this estimate is zzso Nevertheless, in the absence of more accurate zzso and zzso prediction models, the use of equations by zzso et zzso should always be zzso
