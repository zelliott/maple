The microscopic geometry of white matter carries rich information about brain function in health and zzso A key challenge for medical imaging is to estimate zzso features zzso One important zzso is the zzso diameter, which zzso with the zzso time delay of action zzso and is affected by various neurological zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso experiments are the method of choice today when we aim to recover the zzso diameter distribution, although the technique requires very high zzso strengths in order to assess nerve fibers with one zzso or less in zzso In practice zzso brain imaging is only sensitive to the largest zzso not least due to limitations in the human physiology which zzso only moderate zzso zzso This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, the feasibility of zzso to resolve zzso tissue zzso zzso the surface relaxation effect, we formulate a plausible zzso model relating the zzso diameter distribution to the zzso zzso which is based on a zzso ratio approximation of the zzso zzso Under a certain regime of bulk and surface relaxation zzso our simulation results suggest that it might be possible to reveal zzso smaller than one zzso in zzso
