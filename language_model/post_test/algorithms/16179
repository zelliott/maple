A zzso zzso model was developed from the epidemiology of fracture and death in zzso zzso probabilities were identified that corresponded to currently accepted reimbursement zzso 

The objective of this study was to evaluate a Belgian version of the WHO fracture risk assessment zzso tool to zzso 10-year probabilities of zzso fracture in men and zzso A particular aim was to determine fracture probabilities that corresponded to the reimbursement policy for the management of osteoporosis in Belgium and the clinical scenarios that gave equivalent fracture zzso 

zzso probabilities were zzso from published data on the fracture and death hazards in zzso zzso took account of age, sex, the presence of clinical risk factors and zzso neck bone mineral density zzso zzso probabilities were determined that were equivalent to intervention zzso thresholds currently used in zzso 

zzso probability increased with age, lower zzso decreasing zzso zzso and all clinical risk factors used alone or zzso The 10-year probabilities of a major zzso fracture that corresponded to current reimbursement guidelines ranged from approximately zzso at the age of 50 years to zzso at the age of 80 years where a prior fragility fracture was used as an intervention zzso For women at the threshold of osteoporosis zzso neck zzso zzso zzso zzso the respective probabilities ranged from zzso to zzso Several combinations of zzso profiles were identified that gave similar or higher fracture probabilities than those currently accepted for reimbursement in zzso 

The zzso tool has been used to identify possible thresholds for therapeutic intervention in Belgium, based on zzso of risk with current zzso The zzso model supports a shift from the current zzso intervention strategy, towards a strategy based on fracture probability of a major zzso fracture that in turn may improve identification of patients at increased fracture zzso The approach will need to be supported by health economic zzso
