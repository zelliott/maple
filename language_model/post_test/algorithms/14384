zzso zzso zzso zzso a machine learning algorithm, has been applied to the analysis of zzso zzso A key feature of zzso is the ability to identify patterns that together explain the data as a linear combination of expression zzso zzso data generally includes individual estimates of uncertainty for each gene in each condition, however zzso does not exploit this zzso Previous work has shown that such uncertainties can be extremely valuable for pattern zzso 

We have created a new algorithm, least squares zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso uncertainty zzso of gene expression data into zzso updating zzso While the zzso zzso maintains the advantages of original zzso algorithm, such as easy zzso and a guaranteed locally optimal solution, the performance in terms of linking functionally related genes has been zzso zzso exceeds zzso significantly in terms of identifying functionally related genes as determined from zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso on gene expression data provide valuable information for data analysis, and use of this information in the zzso zzso significantly improves the power of the zzso zzso
