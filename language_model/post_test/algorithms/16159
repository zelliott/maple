We present a practical system for controlling the zzso of a zzso zzso The system is mounted on the artificial hand and comprises simple hardware and software that are convenient for real-time zzso The hardware consists of a standard web camera and an ultrasound distance zzso The control zzso mimics biological mechanisms for the control of grasping and uses the measured distance to the target object and the method of computer vision to estimate the zzso size and zzso Based on these estimates, the zzso zzso the following commands for the control of zzso zzso the type of grasp and the zzso size appropriate for the target object; and zzso the angle through which the wrist should be rotated zzso in order to properly position the hand for the zzso We have tested the system's performance with different targets zzso geometric shapes, real-life zzso under zzso conditions zzso when the system is zzso and dynamic conditions zzso when the system moves toward the zzso The size zzso was more accurate in the zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso zzso the system showed to be very robust with respect to the zzso zzso and the correct control commands were generated in most of the tested zzso The presented system is only one component of the hand zzso related strictly to the zzso phase of zzso The final solution is envisioned as a combination of the presented system, zzso sensors zzso zzso and a zzso control zzso
