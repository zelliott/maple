We describe a fully zzso zzso process for the assessment of unilateral pulmonary function zzso by means of zzso and propose a measurement protocol for its clinical zzso zzso were performed at the fourth and sixth zzso levels on a first group of ten healthy subjects zzso zzso ages zzso zzso to define the proper protocol by evaluating the most common postures and ventilation zzso Several zzso processing tools were also zzso including the use of digital filters to extract the respiratory components from zzso time zzso Comparative measures were then carried out on a second group consisting of five zzso patients with lung cancer zzso zzso ages zzso zzso scheduled for zzso zzso zzso show that zzso were best performed with the subject sitting down, holding his arms up and breathing zzso As regards data processing, it is best to extract zzso respiratory zzso The mean of the healthy subject group leads to a zzso division of lung ventilation consistent with literature values zzso left zzso zzso right zzso The comparative study indicates a good correlation zzso zzso zzso between the two techniques, with a mean difference of zzso suggesting that the elimination of cardiac components from the zzso zzso signal leads to a better zzso of zzso
