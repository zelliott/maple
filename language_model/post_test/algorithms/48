zzso and scattering processes in biological zzso are studied through zzso zzso in zzso zzso For this aim, an experimental setup is designed to independently control both processes in zzso and zzso zzso From the analysis of the obtained zzso a simple empirical power law equation is found that relates zzso with scattering and zzso zzso This relationship includes three wavelength independent zzso which can be determined geometry from in zzso zzso for each particular optical zzso The dependence of the optical path length on the zzso and scattering zzso is also zzso and zzso of this zzso for zzso conditions are zzso This study is useful to better understand the scattering phenomena in biological zzso and to obtain absolute concentration of zzso particles when a homogeneous medium can be zzso
