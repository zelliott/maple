In this paper, a zzso technique for breast cancer imaging is zzso The approach is based on the use of magnetic zzso as contrast agent to induce a zzso magnetic contrast selectively localized within the zzso This allows us to face cancer imaging as the reconstruction of a magnetic contrast from the corresponding scattered zzso To zzso from the measured data the contribution due to the magnetic contrast, zzso the signal meaningful for cancer imaging, the approach exploits the possibility of modulating the magnetic response of magnetic zzso by means of a polarizing magnetic zzso The achievable reconstruction capabilities and the zzso against uncertainties on the electric features of the surrounding electric scenario are assessed by means of zzso zzso
