zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed as a zzso for zzso zzso by studying its zzso characteristics and in zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso a rich source of zzso zzso bound specifically to a single class of high zzso low capacity sites in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso binding at 25 C reached equilibrium after 2 h of incubation and was zzso and linear with protein concentration up to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis gave an equilibrium zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding by zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso gave the following order of zzso consistent with that expected for a zzso zzso approximately equal to zzso approximately equal to zzso greater than zzso zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso zzso acid, zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso zzso zzso No degradation of zzso zzso during incubation could be detected by zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso binding to rat kidney sections showed a very dense zzso of zzso binding over inner and outer zzso with a much lower density in cortex, consistent with the known major zzso of zzso on zzso collecting zzso These studies suggest that zzso is a suitable zzso for labeling zzso and may be useful in the characterization of zzso zzso zzso in a variety of zzso and in zzso of the zzso
