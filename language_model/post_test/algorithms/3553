zzso adapted zzso zzso complex 4 zzso from zzso zzso is a complex in which the arrangement of the zzso a zzso is very different from the well-known zzso zzso zzso For bulk samples, the main zzso feature in the zzso is the occurrence of a single zzso band at 802 zzso zzso zzso can resolve the narrow bands that are associated with the zzso states of the individual zzso The low temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso complexes are very zzso and display unique zzso It is shown that an zzso model can adequately reproduce the polarization behavior of the complex, the experimental zzso of the number of observed zzso per complex, and the zzso of the zzso zzso The results indicate that the excited states are mainly localized on one or a few zzso of the complex and provide further evidence supporting the recently proposed structure zzso
