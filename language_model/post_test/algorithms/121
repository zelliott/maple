The trajectory of the index finger during grasping movements was compared to the zzso predicted by three zzso zzso The three models consisted of minimizing the integral of the weighted squared joint derivatives along the path zzso zzso minimizing zzso change, and minimizing angular zzso Of the three models, it was observed that the path of the fingertip and the joint zzso were best described by the minimum angular zzso zzso This model, which does not take into account the dynamics of the finger, performed equally well when the inertia of the finger was altered by adding a 20 g weight to the zzso zzso Thus, for the finger, it appears that zzso are planned based primarily on zzso considerations at a joint zzso
