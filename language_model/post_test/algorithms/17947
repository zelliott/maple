As revealed by previous theoretical studies, targeted zzso therapy zzso that relies on a single zzso zzso is likely to be inappropriate for clinical scenarios such as zzso zzso For a patient with a vast number of zzso and zzso of largely differing sizes a high level of zzso efficiency might be achieved only for a restricted range of zzso zzso This is due to the limited range of zzso in human zzso essentially causing the zzso impact to vary tremendously with zzso zzso The dependence of zzso on the zzso dimension is expected to be significantly altered if a zzso cocktail, consisting of a long-range and a short-range zzso such as zzso and zzso is involved in the zzso In this study, a radiation transport simulation was performed, using the zzso zzso Carlo code, in order to investigate the relationship between zzso control probability zzso and zzso size, associated with concurrent use of zzso and zzso Two different models of zzso distribution of zzso activity were taken into zzso One simulated an ideal zzso zzso in zzso tissue and the other referred to a limited zzso zzso The results were examined in comparison to zzso targeted with pure zzso zzso and zzso For both zzso scenarios a considerable reduction of the overall variation of zzso and thus an increasing chance of achieving zzso cure was observed for zzso sizes ranging from microscopic dimensions up to zzso zzso if the targeted zzso treatment relies on a zzso zzso It was revealed that particular attention has to be given to the ratio of the zzso and zzso specific zzso activities zzso in the zzso since this is a significant zzso of the resulting zzso of zzso control probability as the zzso diameter zzso This study suggests that a zzso approach is more zzso to diseases that involve a variety of zzso and zzso differing in zzso
