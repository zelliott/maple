We propose a reaction model for the zzso zzso pump zzso The model, which is similar to the zzso model for zzso is used to zzso the effect of zzso on zzso during the zzso interactions with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and reactions for the pump are incorporated into the zzso model to represent zzso with or without bound zzso A mathematical model based on the reaction scheme is used in simulations modeling experimental studies of zzso zzso zzso Our simulations suggest that zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso promotes zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso complex is essential for describing the zzso current zzso
