zzso of spike trains made with zzso or silicon zzso include more noise from various sources that contaminate the observed spike shapes compared with recordings using sharp zzso This is a particularly serious problem if spike shape sorting is required to separate the several trains that might be observed on a particular zzso However, if recordings are made with an array of such electrodes, there are several mathematical methods to improve the effective signal zzso to noise ratio, thus considerably reducing inaccuracy in spike detection and shape zzso We compare the theoretical basis of three such methods and evaluate their performance with simulated and real zzso
