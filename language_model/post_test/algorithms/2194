The development of new diagnostic tests for diagnosing pulmonary embolism zzso has not yet resulted in any single zzso being universally zzso It is at least partially due to the perception by the clinicians ordering the tests that insufficient weight is given to the actual mortality and morbidity costs of pulmonary zzso in comparison to those associated with zzso and its zzso It also becomes more difficult to intuitively integrate all of the competing factors zzso sensitivity, zzso costs, zzso zzso for the different zzso to choose the most cost-effective zzso We evaluated the zzso recommended by the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary zzso Diagnosis zzso investigators, designated by zzso and compared it to pulmonary zzso zzso MR zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso which directly zzso the pulmonary zzso Using standard economic approaches to loss of life and morbidity to determine the possible costs, we compared the different zzso for all possible prevalence zzso The sensitivity and specificity rates used in making these comparisons were the average values reported in the zzso We found that the recommended algorithm, zzso had the lowest cost, provided that economically reasonable morbidity and mortality costs were zzso It seems that this zzso provides sufficient sensitivity and specificity to compensate for the risks of zzso as compared with the other zzso that avoid these zzso Neither M nor C can compete with this standard zzso despite their lower mortality and morbidity costs, and the costs of A alone are too zzso In the future, however, the inclusion of zzso studies with M and/or C may improve the results sufficiently to become more cost-effective than zzso
