The zzso relaxation signal from vegetal cells can be described by zzso zzso reflecting different water zzso This zzso relaxation is rarely measured by conventional zzso imaging zzso zzso relaxation times are measured instead, thus limiting information about of the zzso and water status in vegetal zzso In this study, an zzso multiple spin echo zzso zzso sequence was evaluated for assessment of zzso zzso relaxation in fruit zzso The sequence was designed for the acquisition of a maximum of 512 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in combination with balanced zzso zzso for elimination of zzso zzso The study was performed on a zzso phantom with known zzso values and on apple and tomato zzso zzso zzso measured in the phantom and fruit were zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso results were compared with low field zzso resolved zzso zzso performed on the same zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso sequence can be used for up to zzso zzso zzso allowing for zzso of relaxation times from a few tens of milliseconds to over a zzso The effects of the zzso moment and the TE value on zzso zzso were studied both on the zzso phantom and on the fruit zzso It was demonstrated that the sequence should be zzso with regard to the characteristics of the tissue to be examined by considering the effects of water molecular diffusion in the presence of both imaging zzso and zzso produced by zzso zzso
