zzso examination of zzso is the zzso zzso for diagnosing primary zzso zzso There is little evidence suggesting the most effective method of zzso a zzso biopsy and scant benchmark data on rates of conclusive zzso or on the diagnostic impact of such zzso To critically assess rates of inconclusive, positive, and negative zzso zzso and to identify clinical factors associated with conclusive results, we reviewed zzso zzso submitted for electron zzso from 2006 to 2011, noting whether specimens were adequate for analysis and whether the zzso structure was zzso The biopsy site, method used, zzso specialty, and clinical diagnoses were zzso zzso findings were zzso by diagnostic zzso Over 5 years, zzso patients had 211 zzso zzso results were obtained on zzso zzso zzso the remainder were zzso The rate of zzso zzso did not vary significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among sampling zzso zzso results were identified in zzso zzso of the adequate zzso zzso compared to brush zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso of the adequate zzso P zzso zzso along with multiple biopsy samples zzso on same or different zzso compared with a single biopsy sample zzso in zzso versus zzso of the adequate zzso P zzso zzso were more likely to yield an abnormal zzso Only zzso of pediatric zzso zzso provide adequate zzso for analysis, the large majority of these samples showing normal zzso zzso The method of obtaining zzso did not significantly affect result zzso zzso the diagnostic impact of zzso analysis is important as new diagnostic zzso are developed for primary zzso zzso
