zzso of protein secondary structural classes plays an important role in understanding protein folding zzso In this paper, 25 features based on zzso scoring zzso are selected to reflect evolutionary zzso In combination with other 11 rational features based on predicted protein secondary structure sequences proposed by the previous researchers, a zzso representation feature zzso is presented to predict protein secondary structural classes for zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to train and design our method, other three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used to test the proposed zzso Comparisons with other methods show that our method is effective to predict protein secondary structural zzso Stand alone version of the proposed method zzso is written in zzso language and it can be downloaded from zzso
