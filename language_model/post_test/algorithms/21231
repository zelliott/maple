zzso doped zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso and selected zzso properties were measured as a function of heat treatment times and zzso More specifically, the relative intensity of zzso zzso both through direct zzso of the zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso were evaluated with increasing amounts of time held at specific zzso A one zzso approximation was used to zzso an effective diffusion zzso for the rare earth zzso in zzso Despite the simplicity of the model zzso the calculated diffusion zzso based on the zzso results are accurate within an order of magnitude in comparison to other zzso zzso yielding a simplified approach to zzso kinetic and diffusion effects in optical zzso
