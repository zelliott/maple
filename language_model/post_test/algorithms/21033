The problem of motion is well known in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The PET images are formed over an zzso period of zzso As the patients cannot hold breath during the PET zzso spatial blurring and motion artifacts are the natural zzso These may lead to wrong zzso of the radioactive zzso We present a solution to this problem by zzso the PET data and correcting the PET images for motion with optical flow zzso The zzso is based on the combined local and global optical flow zzso with modifications to allow for zzso preservation across organ boundaries and for application to 3-D volume zzso The superiority of the zzso over previous work is demonstrated on software phantom and real patient zzso
