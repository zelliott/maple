To evaluate the usefulness of artificial neural networks zzso for differential diagnosis of bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso AND zzso Different ANN were designed to distinguish between 23 types of bone zzso and to zzso these zzso as benign or zzso on the basis of 28 items of clinical and zzso zzso Training of the zzso networks with a zzso zzso was performed using either 46 hypothetical examples or 115 real zzso The data base for testing the different ANN included 115 clinical cases (5 cases for each possible zzso which were different from the examples used for zzso The decision performance of the ANN was evaluated by means of zzso zzso zzso were compared to the performance of an experienced zzso 

The zzso was significantly superior in finding the correct diagnosis zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the area under his zzso curve (referring to the discrimination between benign and zzso zzso was slightly larger than that of two different ANN zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differences not zzso 

ANN may be potentially useful to distinguish between zzso and benign zzso but their performance in zzso between 23 diagnoses must be improved zzso
