Changes in zzso pressure zzso are known to be related to visual field deficit zzso although multiple models of this relationship zzso In addition, visual functioning is known to affect medical zzso The objective of this study was to project visual field deficit progression and subsequent costs based on clinical trial zzso 

Using data from a randomized, zzso zzso study, we compared the use of a fixed combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso versus a fixed combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso on visual field deficit progression and associated zzso We applied published zzso linking zzso to visual field changes to calculate the likelihood of visual field deterioration by treatment zzso zzso in medical care costs were estimated using zzso practice patterns, Medicare hospital costs, and published estimates of differences in hospitalization by visual zzso 

zzso in visual field deficit progression rates, increase in annual hospital days per subject, and increase in annual hospital, zzso and total costs per zzso 

zzso visual field deficit progression for zzso patients was less than that for zzso patients (not statistically zzso Projected annual medical care costs were 43 dollars lower for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

By applying published zzso linking zzso to visual field changes, this study projected long-term visual field deficit and associated zzso Use of a fixed zzso solution may lead to less long-term visual field deficit progression and lower annual medical care costs than a fixed zzso zzso 

The use of clinical trial data may limit the zzso of these zzso However, this analysis of direct medical costs only is likely a conservative estimate of the costs associated with visual field zzso
