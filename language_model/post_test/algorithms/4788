Current advances in molecular biology enable us to access the rapidly increasing body of genetic zzso It is still challenging to model gene systems at the molecular zzso Here, we propose two types of reaction kinetic models for constructing genetic zzso Time delays involved in zzso and translation are explicitly considered to explore the effects of delays, which may be significant in genetic networks featured with feedback zzso One type of model is based on delayed effective zzso each reaction modeling a zzso process like zzso without involving intermediate zzso The other is based on delayed virtual zzso each reaction being converted from a mathematical function to model a zzso function like gene zzso The latter zzso models are derived from the corresponding zzso zzso The former ones are composed of single gene expression zzso We thus design a model of gene zzso This model is verified by our simulations using a delayed zzso simulation algorithm, which accurately reproduces the zzso zzso in a recent experimental zzso Various simplified versions of the model are given and zzso We then use the two methods to study the genetic zzso switch and the zzso We define the zzso and zzso states of genes and extract a zzso code from the zzso time zzso The zzso code can be described by the corresponding zzso network models in certain zzso We discuss these conditions, suggesting a method to connect zzso models, zzso models, and zzso chemical zzso
