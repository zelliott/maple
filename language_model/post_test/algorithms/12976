We present an zzso camera zzso design zzso which determines an optimal mask pattern based on a sparse set of desired intensity zzso at different focal zzso This zzso method uses the ambiguity function as a tool to shape the camera's response to zzso and shares conceptual similarities with phase retrieval zzso An analysis of zzso convergence is zzso and experimental examples are shown to demonstrate the flexibility of the design zzso This zzso potentially ties together previous zzso zzso design approaches under a common zzso and offers new insights for the creation of future zzso imaging zzso
