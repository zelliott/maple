We present as novel method for the exploration of multiple overlapping volumes that provides flexibility to merge data in different ways in different zzso In each region, either one of the zzso is rendered alone or the fusion of two zzso is zzso In the regions where data is zzso the relative weights of each zzso are defined with a zzso transfer function depending on the zzso pair of property zzso The regions can be defined zzso by painting on the zzso zzso when one of the zzso has been zzso a graph representation of the zzso is constructed, and regions can be defined as sets of zzso fulfilling a specific combination of zzso zzso In both cases, a different fusion and zzso function can be defined for each zzso In this way, illustrative images of the zzso can be easily generated applying effects of cutting away, zzso and zzso zzso
