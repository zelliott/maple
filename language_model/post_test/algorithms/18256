The primary health concern associated with zzso to zzso ore processing zzso zzso zzso is inhalation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soil alternative zzso standards zzso are set using soil suspension and zzso models to be protective of the theoretical excess cancer risk associated with inhalation of soil suspended by vehicle traffic and zzso The purpose of this study was to update a previous model comparison study that identified the 1995 zzso particulate zzso model for vehicle traffic over zzso roads and the zzso Dust Model zzso as the most appropriate model combination for zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso model has been zzso we have updated our past zzso Specifically, the 2006 zzso particulate emissions zzso the Industrial zzso zzso Term model, version 3 zzso and the American Meteorological zzso Protection Agency Regulatory Model zzso air zzso models were zzso and the results were compared with those from the previously used modeling zzso Two sites with and two sites without vehicle traffic were evaluated to determine if wind erosion is a significant source of zzso For the two sites with vehicle traffic, both zzso and zzso produced total suspended particulate zzso estimates that were, on average, within a factor of 2 of zzso whereas zzso produced estimates that were as much as zzso higher than zzso In general, the estimated zzso zzso for zzso were higher than those for zzso For airborne zzso the zzso model produced estimates that were only zzso to zzso of the measured zzso and both zzso and zzso estimated airborne zzso zzso that were approximately zzso to zzso higher than zzso zzso using the 1995 zzso model were closer to measured than those from the 2006 zzso zzso Wind erosion was an insignificant contributor to particulate emissions at zzso zzso
