To improve the zzso source zzso in the brain, the zzso used in the head model play a very important zzso In this study, we focus on the modeling of the zzso zzso of the white zzso The zzso zzso profile can be derived from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images zzso However, zzso these zzso zzso from diffusion weighted MR images of the white matter is not zzso In the literature, two methods can be found for calculating the zzso from the diffusion weighted zzso One method uses a fixed value for the ratio of the zzso in different directions, while the other method uses a zzso profile obtained from a linear zzso of the diffusion zzso We propose a model which can be used to derive the zzso profile from the diffusion zzso zzso This model is based on the variable zzso ratio throughout the white matter and is a combination of the linear relationship as stated in the literature, with a constraint on the magnitude of the zzso zzso (also known as the volume zzso This approach is stated in the paper as approach zzso In our study we want to investigate zzso zzso differences due to using a more simplified model for white matter zzso zzso B), while the zzso zzso are derived using a head model with a more realistic approach for the white matter zzso zzso zzso We used a realistic head model, in which the forward problem was solved using a finite difference method that can incorporate zzso zzso As error measures we considered the zzso location error and the zzso orientation zzso The results show that the zzso location errors are all below 10 zzso and have an average of 4 zzso in gray matter zzso The zzso orientation errors ranged up to zzso degrees, and had a mean of, on average, zzso degrees in gray matter zzso In a qualitative manner, the results show that the orientation and location error is dependent on the orientation of the test zzso The location error is larger when the orientation of the test zzso is similar to the orientation of the zzso while the orientation error is larger when the orientation of the test zzso deviates from the orientation of the zzso From these results, we can conclude that the modeling of white matter zzso plays an important role in zzso source zzso More specifically, accurate source zzso will require an accurate modeling of the white matter zzso profile in each zzso
