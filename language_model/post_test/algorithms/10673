A reconstruction theory for intensity zzso zzso zzso has been proposed that permits reconstruction of a zzso scattering object without explicit knowledge of phase zzso We investigate the zzso reconstruction problem assuming an incident zzso zzso wave and scanning zzso that employ fixed zzso zzso Novel reconstruction methods are derived by identifying and exploiting zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso An underlying theme is that zzso in zzso imaging systems can facilitate solutions for zzso zzso A preliminary zzso investigation of the developed reconstruction methods is zzso
