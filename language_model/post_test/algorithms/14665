zzso CT zzso is an imaging technique used in conjunction with radiation zzso For example zzso is used to verify the position of lung cancer zzso just prior to radiation zzso The accuracy of the radiation treatment of zzso and upper abdominal structures is heavily affected by respiratory zzso Such movement typically blurs the zzso reconstruction and zzso should be zzso Hence zzso zzso has recently been researched for correcting image zzso due to breathing zzso This paper presents a new zzso approach where zzso is aided by using electrical zzso zzso zzso for motion zzso zzso can generate images of contrasts in electrical zzso The main advantage of using zzso is its high zzso zzso In this paper motion information is extracted from zzso images and incorporated directly in the zzso zzso In this study synthetic moving data are generated using simulated and experimental zzso The paper demonstrates that image zzso created as a result of motion, can be reduced through motion compensation with zzso
