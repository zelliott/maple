In this study we present an accurate secondary structure prediction procedure by using an query and related zzso The most novel aspect of our approach is its reliance on local zzso alignment of the sequence to be predicted with each related sequence rather than zzso of a multiple zzso The zzso accuracy of the method is zzso in three structural states after zzso zzso The gain in prediction accuracy compared with the existing techniques, which are at best zzso is achieved by secondary structure zzso based on both local and long-range effects, zzso of similar sequence information in the form of carefully selected zzso alignment fragments, and reliance on a large collection of known protein primary zzso The method is especially appropriate for large-scale sequence analysis of efforts such as zzso zzso where precise and significant multiple sequence alignments are not available or zzso
