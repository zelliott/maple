Through phase plane analysis of a class of two-dimensional zzso and bursting zzso models, covering some of the most popular zzso zzso models, we show that there exists a zzso between the sensitivity of the zzso to steady external stimulation and its resonance properties, and how this zzso may be tuned by the neutral or zzso character of the slow zzso zzso of the results for the zzso behavior of the zzso both by themselves and as part of networks, are presented in different regimes of interest, such as the zzso regular zzso and bursting zzso These results establish a consistent link between zzso parameters and resulting network zzso and will hopefully be useful as a guide for zzso
