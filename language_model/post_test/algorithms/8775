In this contribution, zzso and magnetic sensors are considered for real-time zzso orientation tracking of human limb or robotic segment zzso By using body sensor network integrated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two orientation zzso filters are presented and subsequently designed for bias insensitive tracking of human zzso Both filters use zzso for rotation zzso where zzso zzso and zzso data is conducted with the zzso based zzso zzso zzso as a reference filter zzso This results in a significant reduction of the complexity and calculation cost on the body sensor zzso zzso zzso attitude data is used for the designed extended Kalman filter zzso and a new complementary sliding mode zzso zzso and complementary sliding mode observer are designed and tested in simulations and subsequently validated with a reference motion tracking system in treadmill zzso
