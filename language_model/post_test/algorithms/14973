zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common zzso modification known mainly from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso follows after zzso zzso of a zzso zzso For the first time, a new prediction technique locating potential zzso sites in precursor sequences has been applied for large-scale protein sequence database zzso The composite prediction function (with separate zzso for zzso and zzso zzso consists of terms evaluating both zzso acid type preferences at sequence positions near a supposed zzso as well as the zzso with general physical properties zzso in zzso correlation within the motif zzso The latter terms are especially successful in rejecting zzso sequences from zzso The zzso has been validated with a zzso and two zzso tests for the learning set of fully zzso sequences from the zzso database as well as with a newly created database zzso (more than 300 zzso zzso extracted from original literature zzso The accuracy of predicting the effect of zzso in the zzso sequence motif was above 83 zzso zzso of potential precursor proteins which are zzso in zzso and zzso are presented on the zzso zzso zzso html The zzso has been implemented in the zzso software zzso zzso which may find application as a zzso zzso and target selection zzso
