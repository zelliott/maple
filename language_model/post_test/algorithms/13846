The authors assessed the use of a zzso zzso model and a new zzso for zzso zzso of receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

The proper zzso zzso model uses as its decision variable a zzso transformation of the likelihood ratio that is associated with a pair of normal zzso thereby ensuring fitted zzso zzso with zzso slope but maintaining a relationship with the conventional zzso zzso A computer program entitled zzso was used to fit proper zzso zzso to data obtained from zzso and real observer zzso 

zzso indexes such as total area were estimated with zzso and compared with the corresponding values obtained from the conventional zzso 

The proper zzso zzso model overcomes the problem of zzso in zzso curve zzso zzso is highly robust and yields zzso estimates with less bias and greater precision than those obtained with the conventional zzso zzso
