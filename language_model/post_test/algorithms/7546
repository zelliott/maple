Current clinical practice involves zzso of zzso or zzso tumor tissue based on a zzso evaluation by a zzso In this paper, we propose a method for zzso zzso evaluation using mass zzso zzso Specifically, mass zzso imaging can be used to acquire the chemical composition of a tissue section and, zzso provides a framework to study the molecular composition of the sample while preserving the zzso features in the zzso The proposed zzso framework uses statistical modeling to identify the tumor type associated with a given zzso In addition, if the tumor type for a given tissue sample is unknown or there is a great degree of uncertainty associated with assigning the tumor type to one of the known tumor models, then the zzso rejects the given sample without zzso Due to the modular nature of the proposed zzso new tumor models can be added without the need to zzso the zzso on all existing tumor zzso
