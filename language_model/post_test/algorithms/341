zzso short zzso zzso are useful tools for studying zzso because they can be used to investigate both zzso and expression zzso However, when different strains (or zzso produce different signal zzso after zzso zzso it is not easy to determine whether the signal zzso were affected by zzso or expression zzso To overcome this difficulty, zzso and expression zzso are currently examined zzso 

We have developed zzso a new method that allows simultaneous detection of both zzso and expression zzso zzso involves a robust statistical procedure based on the idea that a zzso zzso observed at the probe level can be regarded as an zzso because the zzso zzso can reduce the zzso signal zzso To investigate the performance of zzso we used three zzso zzso rice and zzso In addition to the publicly available barley data, we obtained new rice and mouse data from the strains with available zzso zzso The sensitivity and false positive rate of zzso zzso detection were estimated based on the sequence zzso The zzso of expression zzso detection against zzso zzso was also zzso 

zzso performed well regardless of the zzso size and showed a better performance for zzso zzso zzso when compared with other previously proposed zzso The zzso zzso is available at zzso
