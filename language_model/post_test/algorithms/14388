zzso systems with many interacting zzso when driven far from zzso exhibit zzso for example when a pathological rhythm appears suddenly in an zzso zzso zzso changes occurring while conditions vary smoothly have, in cases of interest, underlying mathematics that are the subject of zzso catastrophe zzso The assumption made zzso that the system's state zzso akin to order zzso reduce in practice to only one single real zzso ensures that the system derives from a potential function, and warrants recourse to the catastrophe zzso The order zzso is, zzso interpreted as a measure of the zzso activity in the brain, increasing zzso with the degree of zzso zzso With two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as control zzso the catastrophe is the zzso zzso Implementation of catastrophe theory leads to equations showing that fluctuations in a system's dynamics may be zzso for zzso steps zzso to oncoming zzso zzso dynamics in zzso patients exhibit steps towards and away from zzso the steps away are interpreted in terms of zzso feedback, zzso on changing patterns of zzso zzso A number of characteristics of zzso zzso of differing types merely follow from the geometry of the cusp equilibrium zzso In particular, types of zzso are distinguished by their angle of final approach to onset in zzso zzso The measurable parameters by which approach to catastrophe is zzso may be of use in investigations of the zzso plasticity in zzso patients, and in tests of therapeutic means for preventing zzso There is no need to resort to a model, in the usual sense of the word, and therefore no differential equation needs to be set zzso
