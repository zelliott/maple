The response of the vascular zzso to wall zzso stress plays a central role in the development and progression of zzso Current studies have investigated zzso response using idealized in zzso flow zzso Such cell culture models are unable to accurately replicate the complex in zzso wall zzso stress patterns arising from anatomical zzso To better understand this zzso we have created both zzso and zzso realistic in zzso zzso flow models of the human right coronary zzso A zzso vascular cast of the human left zzso zzso tract was used to create zzso accurate silicone zzso zzso zzso zzso models were created using a custom made zzso Following the culture of human abdominal zzso zzso cells within the inner zzso cells were exposed to steady flow zzso zzso zzso for varying time zzso The resulting cell zzso was analyzed in terms of shape index and angle of orientation relative to the flow zzso In both models a progressive zzso and alignment of the zzso in the flow direction was observed following 8, 12, and 24 zzso This change, however, was significantly less pronounced in the anatomical model (as observed from zzso variations indicative of localized flow zzso zzso were also observed between the inner and outer walls at the zzso zzso zzso Since zzso adaptation is a visual indication of zzso zzso stress zzso the use of anatomical models in zzso genetic and zzso studies may offer better insight into the disease zzso
