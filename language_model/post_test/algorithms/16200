Although the mean value of protein S and protein C in the case group was lower than the control group, there was no significance difference zzso and zzso zzso The mean of zzso III, activated protein C resistance zzso and homocysteine levels in the two groups were not significant zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We were unable to determine a positive relationship between zzso and zzso The existence of a possible trend towards high prevalence of zzso in women with zzso needs further zzso
