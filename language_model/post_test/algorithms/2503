To compare zzso and zzso zzso coils and to determine the optimal parallel imaging zzso technique and factor for brain zzso imaging using zzso zzso Spin labeling zzso at 3 zzso zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers underwent 10 different zzso zzso zzso zzso scans at zzso using zzso and zzso coils without zzso and with zzso or zzso using factor zzso zzso with factor 3 and 4 were used only with the zzso zzso Visual quality was assessed using four zzso zzso analyses were performed using zzso noise, zzso and zzso ratios zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso the scores for zzso acquisition were significantly higher for overall visual quality, lower for noise and higher for zzso and zzso With the zzso zzso artifact compromise achieved the best score with zzso factor zzso Noise increased, zzso and zzso decreased with zzso zzso However zzso 2 scores were not always significantly different from acquisition without zzso 

For zzso at zzso the zzso zzso at zzso provided better quality than the zzso zzso With the zzso zzso zzso 2 seemed to offer the best compromise for decreasing artifacts without significantly reducing zzso zzso
