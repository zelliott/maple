The aim of this study was to evaluate for the interest of realistic zzso simulations as a tool to assess the knowledge of emergency medicine physicians in the field of difficult zzso zzso

Emergency zzso 

zzso emergency physicians were invited entering the zzso The first step of the study consisted of an initial assessment of their knowledge in the field of difficult zzso zzso Then theoretical lectures on the tools and techniques of difficult zzso zzso were given, followed by standard zzso driven zzso The second step was conducted six weeks zzso Each zzso knowledge was re-evaluated and their ability to manage two difficult airway scenarios simulated on the zzso simulator zzso was zzso 

Only one physician could not complete the zzso Half of them worked at the University Hospital zzso with half of them for less than three zzso zzso and standard zzso driven workshops significantly improved zzso theoretical zzso zzso performance during difficult airway management scenarios was zzso 

We have demonstrated that theoretical lectures and standard zzso driven workshops improved overall theoretical knowledge but did not translated to practical skill during of realistic zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations teaching programs in the field of difficult zzso zzso should be zzso
