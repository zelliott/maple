This article describes the application of our distributed computing framework for crystal structure prediction zzso the modified genetic zzso for crystal and cluster prediction zzso to predict the crystal structure of flexible molecules using the general zzso force field zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso distributed computing framework includes a series of tightly integrated computer programs for generating the zzso force field, sampling crystal structures using a distributed parallel genetic zzso and local energy zzso of the structures followed by the zzso zzso and zzso of the most relevant zzso Our results indicate that the method can consistently find the zzso known crystal structures of flexible zzso but the number of missing structures and poor ranking observed in some zzso show the need for further improvement of the zzso
