zzso zzso gait disorders with freezing of gait zzso have been reported only recently as adverse effects of deep brain stimulation zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso The aim of this work was to determine the frequency and the nature of this zzso zzso 

We zzso screened our database of patients with zzso who underwent zzso Patients with zzso zzso or generalized zzso of primary or zzso origin and no gait disorder due to lower limb zzso before zzso bilateral zzso zzso and a follow-up for more than 6 months were zzso Reports of adverse events were zzso and gait abnormalities were scored by comparing zzso and zzso video recordings using Movement Disorder zzso revision of the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso zzso items zzso zzso and zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso in gait zzso zzso was paused for 24 zzso zzso and zzso were assessed 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after zzso zzso Finally, a standardized adjustment zzso was performed trying to eliminate the gait zzso 

Of a collective of 71 patients with zzso 6 presented with a new gait disorder zzso 2 men, 4 women, mean age zzso years zzso zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso improved zzso zzso zzso zzso motor score by zzso and disability score by zzso zzso item zzso worsened from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and item zzso from 0 to zzso zzso The gait disorder displayed zzso steps and difficulties with gait initiation and zzso zzso zzso improved zzso but triggered zzso sometimes worsening over a period of a few zzso It vanished within minutes after zzso zzso zzso zzso was ruled zzso In all but one patient, no optimal zzso was found despite extensive testing of settings zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso Nevertheless, a compromise between optimal stimulation for zzso and zzso zzso was achieved in each zzso 

A zzso gait disorder with zzso can be a complication of zzso
