zzso fusion gene is found in only a small subset zzso of zzso cell lung zzso There is an urgent need to establish a rational diagnostic zzso to identify this rare but important fusion in lung zzso 

We performed a comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a total of 360 surgically zzso lung zzso zzso zzso was examined by 3 zzso multiplex reverse zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A scoring system was used for zzso zzso A test set zzso patients with zzso lung zzso was used for proposing a diagnostic zzso This diagnostic zzso was validated in 158 patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was identified in 2 patients zzso from the test set and both zzso were negative for zzso and zzso zzso The results of FISH and zzso were completely zzso The highest zzso 3 was found only in the 2 positive zzso A diagnostic zzso was zzso zzso screening for zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso In the validation set, 8 cases zzso had zzso 3 and were positive for zzso while the other cases had zzso 0 and were negative for zzso 

zzso for zzso zzso by zzso followed by zzso FISH is a rational diagnostic zzso If needed, patients may be selected for screening zzso zzso by their zzso and zzso zzso zzso
