Class discovery from gene expression data is an important task for cancer zzso In this paper, we present a new framework for class zzso The new framework zzso the zzso technique, the cluster ensemble approach, and the cluster zzso zzso Specifically, it first generates a set of zzso zzso from the original zzso zzso Then, the zzso zzso which serves as the basic zzso algorithm, is applied to obtain the partitions from the original zzso and the zzso zzso Finally, a new cluster zzso index called zzso zzso index zzso is designed to identify the number of classes in the zzso by considering the difference between the partition obtained from the original zzso and the partitions obtained from the zzso zzso The experiments in three synthetic zzso and four cancer zzso show that: 1) zzso successfully discovers the underlying structure from all the synthetic zzso and most of the cancer zzso and 2) zzso zzso most of the state-of-the-art cluster zzso indexes when applied to gene expression zzso
