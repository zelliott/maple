zzso zzso is a major model zzso for investigating the function and zzso of animal genes in the earliest stages of zzso Today, images capturing zzso gene expression patterns are being produced at a higher zzso than ever zzso The analysis of spatial patterns of gene expression is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are zzso Thus, the critical first step is to determine the zzso stage of an zzso This information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over zzso zzso Currently, zzso stages zzso of zzso in images capturing spatial expression pattern are zzso zzso which is zzso and zzso zzso are often designated into stage zzso making the information on zzso time zzso This makes downstream analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression patterns challenging, particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression patterns of large number of zzso 

Here, we present a new zzso approach to zzso zzso stage for zzso zzso in the gene expression zzso In an analysis of zzso images, the new approach shows high accuracy in predicting the zzso stage correctly zzso In addition, it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely zzso each zzso so that they are divided into early and late periods of development within standard stage zzso Stage scores for all images containing expression patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over zzso time for any zzso We show that the zzso generated using images from zzso in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better, and more refined stage zzso improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between zzso
