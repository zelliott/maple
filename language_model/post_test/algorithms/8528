To investigate the transport mechanism of zzso acid across the human zzso we used human zzso zzso membrane zzso and compared them with that of zzso zzso 

Transport of zzso acid and zzso acid was measured by using human zzso zzso membrane zzso 

The zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid into zzso membrane zzso were greatly zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid were inhibited by various fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A kinetic analysis showed that it was zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso acid and zzso acid, zzso Furthermore, zzso acid competitively inhibited zzso acid zzso and vice zzso 

These results suggest that the transport of zzso acid across the zzso membrane of human zzso is zzso by a zzso transport system that also zzso zzso zzso However, some zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid, suggesting that other transport systems may also contribute to the elevated fetal blood concentration of zzso acid in zzso
