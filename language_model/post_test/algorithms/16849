The explosion of biological data has largely influenced the focus of zzso biology zzso zzso and zzso large quantity of data to provide meaningful insights has become the main challenge to biologists and zzso One major problem is the combined data analysis of data from different types, such as zzso and zzso This data is zzso as zzso zzso where zzso zzso to the different data points, zzso and diseases for instance, and weighted edges relate to associations between zzso zzso is a special case of zzso designed for zzso two different types of data zzso We present a zzso approach that zzso the zzso weighted zzso editing problem by transforming a given zzso graph into a zzso union of zzso Here we contribute with an exact zzso that is based on zzso zzso We evaluated its performance on artificial zzso zzso zzso we zzso applied our zzso zzso to data of zzso association studies zzso data aiming for discovering new, previously zzso zzso zzso We believe that our results will serve as guidelines for further wet lab zzso Generally our software can be applied to any kind of data that can be zzso as zzso zzso To our knowledge it is the fastest exact method for weighted zzso editing zzso
