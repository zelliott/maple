zzso simulation methods are important in modeling chemical zzso and biological and physical zzso processes zzso as zzso zzso zzso chains with a finite number of zzso species and zzso The current zzso of choice, zzso achieves fast and accurate zzso simulation by taking large time steps that leap over individual zzso During a leap zzso zzso zzso + zzso in zzso each reaction channel operates as a zzso process with a constant zzso We modify zzso to allow linear and zzso changes in reaction zzso Because our version of zzso accurately anticipates how zzso change over time, we propose calling it the step anticipation zzso zzso zzso We apply zzso to four examples: Kendall's process, a zzso branching process, zzso model of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In each case, zzso is more accurate than ordinary zzso The degree of improvement varies with the zzso Near zzso zzso reaction zzso are roughly constant, and zzso and ordinary zzso perform about equally zzso
