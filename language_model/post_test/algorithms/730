A simple method to calculate zzso zzso for zzso interactions by zzso zzso zzso is zzso The method uses raw migration time data for the zzso and needs only additional information about zzso inner radius and the absolute amount of protein zzso A theoretical study supported by experimental data also demonstrates that the retention of zzso in affinity zzso zzso zzso using the zzso technique depends zzso on the absolute amount of zzso added but is independent of both zzso zone length and zzso zzso zzso such as field strength and zzso flow are also zzso out if they are kept zzso The theory is confirmed and the usefulness of the method is demonstrated by zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso
