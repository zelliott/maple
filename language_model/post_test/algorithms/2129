zzso is a new software for the design of minimal experimental protocols using the notion of zzso zzso of strength zzso The main application of zzso is the search of protein zzso zzso Given a user input defining the relevant zzso zzso zzso temperature, zzso and states zzso zzso 5, 6, 7 and zzso this software proposes an optimal set of experiments in which all tested variables and the zzso interactions between them are zzso zzso No a zzso restrictions on the number and range of experimental variables is zzso zzso consists of two complementary programs, zzso and BA, using a simulated zzso approach and a backtracking algorithm, zzso The software is freely available as C code or as an interactive zzso zzso at zzso
