zzso and zzso zzso propose a method based on conditional power for designed extension of a study beyond its originally intended sample zzso Their zzso sampling method can be viewed as a zzso procedure in which the target total sample size is dependent upon the data observed at the first zzso We demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimate of the zzso of interest upon completion may be zzso and that this bias is similar in direction and magnitude to that commonly associated with zzso following a group sequential test with predetermined target total sample zzso Furthermore, we show how a bias adjusted estimate may be zzso
