Several zzso processes are affected by zzso zzso At the level of distribution, protein binding zzso is one of the most zzso The zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso has been evaluated in this work by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso and zzso were obtained for both zzso of zzso In order to improve the consistency of the zzso the evaluation of affinity zzso of each zzso was performed using two designs, one keeping constant the total concentration of protein and varying the total concentration of the zzso and the other in the opposite way, in both cases via an unusual zzso zzso strategy to assure model zzso Different mathematical approaches were compared and zzso and some of them, judged as the most consistent under the experimental conditions used, were selected to provide final zzso Quality considerations include criteria for three critical aspects: zzso zzso zzso zzso checking the number of binding sites in the protein and zzso evaluating the zzso of each zzso The differences on estimates from the selected approaches were used as an uncertainty source to zzso the reported zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso zzso was zzso Estimates include the assumptions of independent and competitive zzso In the last case, a zzso function was designed capable of simultaneously zzso the zzso binding models for both zzso thus improving the zzso of zzso
