zzso disease is caused by a selective lack of T cell tolerance for zzso It is known that the zzso tissue zzso zzso is involved in the generation of T cell zzso zzso peptides through zzso of zzso the most abundant zzso acid in zzso Only particular zzso zzso however, are modified by zzso Here we provide evidence that the spacing between zzso and zzso the second most abundant zzso acid in zzso plays an essential role in the specificity of zzso On the basis of this, zzso were designed and used to successfully predict novel T cell zzso peptides in zzso zzso these zzso identified many similar peptides in the zzso zzso from barley and zzso from rye but not in the zzso from zzso The zzso contain significantly lower percentages of zzso zzso which offers a likely explanation for the lack of toxicity of zzso Thus, the unique zzso acid composition of zzso and related proteins in barley and rye favors the generation of toxic T cell zzso zzso peptides by zzso This provides a rationale for the observation that zzso disease patients are intolerant to these cereal proteins but not to other common food zzso
