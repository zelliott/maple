A detailed analysis procedure is described for evaluating rates of zzso change in brain structures based on structural magnetic resonance zzso zzso In this zzso a series of image processing tools have been employed to address the problems encountered in measuring rates of change based on structural MR zzso These tools include an zzso for intensity zzso zzso a robust zzso for three-dimensional image registration with zzso precision and an zzso for brain tissue zzso However, a unique feature in the procedure is the use of a fractional volume model that has been developed to provide a quantitative measure for the partial volume zzso With this model, the fractional constituent tissue volumes are evaluated for zzso at the tissue boundary that manifest partial volume effect, thus allowing tissue boundaries be defined at a zzso level and in an automated zzso zzso studies are presented on key zzso including zzso and zzso An overall assessment of the method is provided through the evaluation of the rates of brain zzso in a group of normal elderly subjects for which the rate of brain zzso due to normal aging is predictably zzso An application of the method is given in Part II where the rates of brain zzso in various brain regions are studied in relation to normal aging and Alzheimer's zzso
