We propose an zzso model to estimate the zzso view quality in zzso zzso The model relates errors in the depth images to the synthesis quality, taking into account texture image zzso texture image quality, and the rendering zzso zzso we decompose the synthesis distortion into zzso induced distortion and zzso induced zzso We analyze the zzso induced distortion using an approach combining frequency and spatial domain zzso zzso results with video sequences and zzso tools used in zzso zzso activities show that our zzso model can accurately estimate the synthesis noise zzso Thus, the model can be used to estimate the rendering quality for different system zzso
