zzso and zzso zzso interface zzso studies have long focused on the motor zzso for zzso control of artificial zzso Most of these studies have used zzso recordings or zzso zzso zzso zzso is a relatively new recording zzso in zzso research that has primarily been built on successes in zzso zzso We built on prior experiments related to zzso recording and zzso compare the extent to which different brain regions reflect zzso tuning parameters of hand speed, direction, and zzso in both a reaching and tracing task in zzso Hand and arm movement experiments using zzso have shown positive results before, but the tasks were not designed to tease out which zzso are zzso In zzso zzso the relationships among these zzso have been more carefully zzso and we sought to begin zzso that relationship in humans using zzso The largest zzso in zzso activity for direction, speed, and zzso representation was found in the primary motor zzso We also found consistent zzso tuning across both tasks, to hand direction and zzso in the high gamma band zzso Thus, the results of this study clarify the neural zzso involved in zzso aspects of motor preparation and execution and confirm the important role of the motor zzso in zzso zzso
