zzso X-ray zzso produces an electron density map that rarely detects individual hydrogen atoms or zzso between zzso nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the electron zzso This makes it difficult to zzso the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso which appear symmetrical in the electron zzso their orientation is usually judged on the basis of hydrogen zzso Based on the observation that almost all buried donors and zzso are satisfied, we have developed a simple zzso to compare the alternative zzso of these zzso and, where possible, identify the most zzso In a zzso of protein structures we found a few side chains zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso which would be more zzso in the alternative zzso We have also found that this proportion rises slightly with worsening zzso
