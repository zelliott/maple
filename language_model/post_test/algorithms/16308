zzso zzso zzso zzso images suffer from low spatial resolution and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the effects affecting resolution within zzso reconstruction zzso can improve the zzso between spatial resolution and zzso ratio in PET zzso In this work, we present an original approach for zzso the resolution loss introduced by physical interactions between and within the zzso of the zzso and we investigate the impact of such zzso on the quality of the reconstructed zzso The proposed model includes two zzso zzso of the zzso scattering and penetration zzso and zzso of the zzso count distribution zzso The parameters of the model were obtained using a zzso Carlo simulation of the Philips zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to the raw zzso geometric zzso along the four dimensions and introduced in an zzso reconstruction zzso The impact of zzso zzso zzso or combined zzso and zzso on spatial resolution, contrast recovery and noise was studied using simulated zzso The feasibility of zzso zzso and zzso in two clinical zzso scans was also zzso zzso on zzso Carlo simulated data showed that, without any crystal interaction zzso the zzso spatial resolution in air varied from zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso to 10 zzso at zzso zzso from the zzso Resolution was improved with zzso zzso (from zzso zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso or with zzso zzso only (from zzso zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso and it became stationary across the zzso zzso zzso zzso when combining zzso and zzso zzso This improvement in resolution yielded significant contrast enhancement, zzso from 65 to zzso and zzso to zzso for a zzso zzso radius sphere with a zzso zzso activity ratio at 55 and 215 zzso from the zzso of the zzso respectively, without introducing additional zzso Patient images confirmed the usefulness of zzso and zzso zzso for improving spatial resolution and zzso Based on zzso Carlo simulated data, we conclude that zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso interactions during the reconstruction process yields a significantly improved contrast to noise ratio and the zzso of the spatial resolution in the reconstructed zzso
