zzso detection of diffuse lung disease is an important step for computerized diagnosis and zzso of this zzso It is also a difficult clinical task for zzso We developed a computerized scheme to assist zzso in the detection of diffuse lung disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso selected 31 normal and 37 abnormal CT scans with ground glass zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease patterns based on clinical zzso The abnormal cases in our database must contain at least an abnormal area with a severity of moderate or severe level that was zzso rated by the zzso Because statistical texture features may lack the power to distinguish a zzso pattern from a normal pattern, the abnormal cases that contain only a zzso pattern were zzso The areas that included specific abnormal patterns in the selected CT images were then delineated as reference standards by an expert chest zzso The lungs were first segmented in each slice by use of a zzso technique, and then divided into zzso volumes of interest zzso with a 64 zzso 64 zzso 64 zzso zzso For each zzso we determined and employed statistical texture features, such as zzso and zzso zzso features, to distinguish abnormal from normal lung zzso In particular, we developed new zzso texture features with clear physical zzso to considerably improve the accuracy of our detection zzso A zzso zzso was employed for distinguishing between normal and abnormal zzso by the use of a zzso validation zzso A zzso criterion was employed to further determine whether a case was normal or zzso We investigated the impact of new and conventional texture features, zzso size and the zzso for regions of interest on detecting diffuse lung zzso When we employed new texture features for zzso zzso of 64 zzso 64 zzso 64 zzso our system achieved the highest performance zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for the detection of abnormal zzso and a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for the detection of abnormal zzso Our computerized scheme would be useful for assisting zzso in the diagnosis of diffuse lung zzso
