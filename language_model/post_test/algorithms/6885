Most diagnostic zzso imaging systems perform fixed focusing on transmit and dynamic focusing on zzso Such systems suffer from image quality degradation at depths away from the transmit focal zzso Several dynamic transmit focusing techniques have been previously zzso Among them, a zzso retrospective focusing technique was proposed to increase the length of the transmit focal zzso In this paper, the zzso technique is extended from dynamic receive focusing to fixed receive zzso It is shown that the filtering technique with fixed receive focusing can achieve an image quality similar to that of dynamic receive focusing with zzso The performance of the proposed approach is verified using real ultrasound zzso It is shown that the proposed approach with fixed receive focusing requires a longer filter than that with dynamic receive zzso Nonetheless, system complexity is greatly reduced with synthetic transmit and receive focusing because the dynamic receive focusing circuit is no longer zzso
