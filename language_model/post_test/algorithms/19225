A zzso IV program is presented for zzso analysis using the zzso zzso zzso With the zzso technique retention functions are calculated from zzso curve data representing both zzso and blood zzso The program zzso for each kidney the minimum and maximum time of the retention zzso It also zzso the initial zzso absolute as well as relative, and the mean transit time of the retention zzso The design of the program allows for optional reviews of intermediate zzso at important zzso It also allows for the plotting of conventional zzso zzso of both zzso corrected for blood zzso Finally, the program plots the retention functions and some of their zzso
