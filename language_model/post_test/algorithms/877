Current techniques for imaging ultrasound zzso contrast agents zzso make no distinction between zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in the larger zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso filtering on a low mechanical index zzso pulse inversion acquisition is presented that zzso zzso zzso (on the order of zzso associated with zzso from the zzso zzso (on the order of zzso in larger zzso In zzso experiments demonstrate the ability to separate vascular flow using both harmonic and fundamental zzso zzso Fundamental and harmonic zzso signals from zzso using a zzso zzso acquisition are compared with conventional color zzso signals in zzso Due to the lower transmit zzso and enhanced zzso from zzso the in zzso signal to clutter ratios for both the fundamental zzso zzso and harmonic zzso zzso vascular flow signals were greater than with conventional power zzso zzso zzso without contrast zzso The processing investigated here, in parallel with conventional zzso processing, enables the simultaneous display of both zzso and vascular zzso In zzso results demonstrating the feasibility and potential utility of the real-time display of both zzso and vascular flow using US contrast agents are presented and zzso
