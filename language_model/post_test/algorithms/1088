A zzso problem with the zzso imaging zzso technique most commonly used for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies is geometric distortion caused by magnetic field zzso This makes it difficult to achieve an accurate registration between a functional zzso map calculated from an zzso time series and an zzso high resolution anatomical zzso A correction method based on mapping the spatial distribution of field zzso can be used to reduce these zzso This approach is attractive in its simplicity but requires zzso to improve the zzso of the acquired field map and reduce any secondary zzso Furthermore, the distribution of the internal magnetic field throughout the head is position dependent resulting in an interaction between distortion and head zzso zzso a single field map may not be sufficient to correct for the zzso throughout a whole zzso time zzso In this paper we present a quantitative evaluation of image distortion correction for zzso at zzso We assess zzso methods for the acquisition and calculation of field zzso zzso the effect of image distortion correction on the zzso between anatomical and functional images, and zzso the interaction between distortion and head motion, assessing the feasibility of using field maps to reduce this zzso We propose that field maps with acceptable noise levels can be generated easily using a dual zzso zzso sequence and demonstrate the importance of distortion correction for anatomical zzso even for small zzso Using a dual zzso series to generate a unique field map at each time point, we characterize the interaction between head motion and geometric zzso However, we suggest that the zzso between successively measured field maps introduces additional unwanted zzso in the zzso zzso and is therefore not adequate to correct for zzso zzso
