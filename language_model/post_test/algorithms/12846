The light zzso of natural images exhibit a high degree of zzso Knowing the exact amount of their statistical zzso is important for biological vision as well as zzso and coding applications but zzso the total amount of zzso the zzso is zzso zzso The common approach is to estimate the zzso for patches of increasing sizes and divide by the number of zzso Here, we show that the limiting value of this zzso zzso zzso be better estimated by using another limiting process based on measuring the mutual information between a zzso and a zzso neighborhood of increasing size around zzso Although in principle this method has been known for decades, its superiority for zzso the zzso rate of natural images has not been fully exploited zzso Either method provides a lower bound on the zzso rate, but the mutual information based sequence zzso much faster to the zzso rate than the conventional method zzso Using this fact, we provide improved estimates of the zzso rate of natural images and a better understanding of its underlying spatial zzso
