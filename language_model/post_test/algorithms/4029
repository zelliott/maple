Copy number variations zzso are one of the main sources of zzso in the human zzso Many zzso are associated with various diseases including cardiovascular zzso In addition to zzso methods, next-generation sequencing zzso technologies are increasingly used for zzso zzso However, respective zzso methods zzso to zzso data are still zzso We developed a novel zzso calling method based on zzso detection zzso to small zzso which is of particular interest for the discovery of individual zzso within families, de zzso zzso in trios and/or small zzso of specific zzso like rare zzso zzso 7,000 rare diseases are currently known, which collectively affect zzso of the zzso For our method, we applied the zzso Q test to detect zzso and used a Hidden zzso Model for their zzso The method can be used for data obtained by zzso and targeted zzso We evaluated our zzso method in comparison to the zzso calling tool zzso using eight zzso zzso samples and subsequently applied both methods to targeted zzso data of patients with zzso of zzso zzso the most common zzso zzso heart zzso In both the zzso samples and the zzso cases, our method is superior to zzso such that it identifies more true positive zzso Called zzso in zzso cases were validated by zzso and zzso zzso were confirmed with available zzso zzso In the zzso patients, we found four copy number gains affecting three zzso of which two are important regulators of heart development zzso zzso and one is located in a region associated with cardiac zzso zzso at zzso In zzso we present a novel zzso calling method based on zzso zzso which will be of particular interest for the analysis of de zzso or individual zzso in trios or zzso up to 30 individuals, zzso
