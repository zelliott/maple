zzso of control zzso such as zzso factor zzso crossover rate zzso and population size zzso appropriately is one of the major problems of zzso Evolution zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso control method can highly improve the performance of zzso Although there are many suggestions for adapting the control zzso it is still a challenging task to properly adapt the control parameters for zzso In this paper, we present an zzso zzso control DE zzso In the proposed algorithm, each individual has its own control zzso The control parameters of each individual are adapted based on the average zzso value of successfully evolved zzso zzso values by using the zzso zzso Through this, the control parameters of each individual are assigned either near the average zzso value or far from that of the average zzso value which might be better zzso value for next zzso The experimental results show that the proposed zzso is more robust than the standard DE zzso and several state-of-the-art zzso DE zzso in solving various zzso and zzso zzso
