In this paper, a statistical shape analysis method for zzso contraction is presented that was built to detect and locate regional wall motion abnormalities zzso For each slice level zzso middle, and zzso 44 zzso magnetic resonance images were selected from healthy volunteers to train a statistical model of normal zzso contraction using independent component analysis zzso A zzso zzso was constructed from the zzso components to automatically detect and zzso zzso contracting regions of the zzso The zzso was validated on 45 patients suffering from zzso heart zzso Two zzso were zzso one with visual wall motion scores zzso and the other with wall zzso zzso used as zzso zzso of the zzso method on each slice level was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso was used as reference, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso was used as zzso From this we conclude that the proposed method is a promising diagnostic support tool to assist clinicians in reducing the zzso in zzso
