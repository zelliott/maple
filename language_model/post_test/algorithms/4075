In zzso zzso testing zzso the phase shift migration zzso technique, as a zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso focusing technique zzso can be adopted for imaging of regularly layered objects that are zzso only in depth but zzso and homogeneous in the lateral zzso To deal with zzso layered objects that are zzso and zzso in both the depth and lateral directions, a generalized zzso domain zzso called generalized phase shift migration zzso is proposed in this zzso Compared with zzso the most significant innovation of zzso is that the phase shift factor is generalized to handle zzso media with lateral zzso zzso The zzso is accomplished by computer programming techniques without zzso the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso pruning zzso are developed and employed in the zzso zzso to speed up the image zzso The experiments show that the proposed imaging techniques are capable of reconstructing accurate shapes and zzso of zzso layered zzso The computing time of the zzso zzso is much less than the zzso zzso combined with the zzso technique, which is, at present, the common method used in zzso zzso industry for imaging layered zzso Furthermore, imaging regularly layered objects can be regarded as a special case of the presented zzso
