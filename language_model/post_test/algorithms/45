We present a method for reduction of image artifacts induced by the optical zzso of tissue in zzso molecular zzso zzso through identification and compensation of image regions that evidence propagation of zzso light through thin or zzso tunnels in zzso The light zzso as such contributes to the zzso image as zzso components that might substantially overwhelm the desirable zzso emanating from the targeted zzso The proposed method makes use of the strong spatial correlation between the zzso and zzso images to estimate the zzso components and yield a residual image that mainly consists of the signal due to the desirable zzso This residual image is further refined using a coincidence mask constructed for each zzso image zzso The coincidence mask is essentially a map of the zzso zzso that occur in both zzso and zzso images, as such areas are often associated with zzso zzso In zzso studies are performed on a human colon zzso zzso tumor model with subcutaneous tumors and a zzso breast zzso model with aggressive tumor cell zzso and growth in the zzso zzso demonstrate significant improvements in the reconstructions achieved by the proposed zzso
