A fundamental step in zzso modeling is the comparison of two protein zzso a probe sequence with an unknown structure and function and a template sequence for which the structure and function are zzso The detection of protein similarities relies on a substitution zzso that scores the proximity of the aligned zzso zzso zzso alignments use zzso substitution zzso whereas the zzso protocols use zzso zzso testing the fitness of the probe sequence into the structure of the template zzso We propose a linear combination of zzso and zzso scoring function, to produce a single zzso scoring zzso By fitting a single zzso (which is the relative contribution of the zzso 50 zzso and the zzso energy table of zzso we obtain a significant increase in prediction capacity in the twilight zone of zzso modeling zzso sequences with zzso sequence identity and with very similar zzso For a difficult test of 176 zzso pairs, with no signal of sequence zzso the mixed model makes it possible to detect between 40 and zzso more protein pairs than the number of pairs that are detected by pure zzso Surprisingly, the linear combination of the two models is performing better than zzso and than sequence alignment when the percentage of sequence identity is zzso We finally suggest that further enrichment of substitution zzso combing more structural zzso such as exposed surface area, or secondary structure is expected to enhance the signal as zzso
