zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso zzso during pregnancy is zzso because of their association with increased risks of zzso including central nervous systems zzso In addition, some reports have shown that zzso system components are expressed differently during embryonic development and adulthood in the zzso zzso Because zzso II and its zzso peptides have been implicated in anxiety and zzso of zzso the aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso zzso during prenatal and zzso periods would alter zzso plasticity in adult male offspring zzso zzso Female zzso rats were treated with zzso (2 zzso zzso approximately 200 zzso per day) during pregnancy and zzso At adulthood, the offspring were subjected to the open field, elevated plus zzso social interaction, forced swimming and tail zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso zzso P zzso zzso and decreased resting time zzso P zzso zzso in the open field zzso zzso zzso treatment did not alter any of the zzso parameters of the elevated plus zzso however, zzso treatment did cause a significant increase in social interaction zzso P zzso zzso In the forced swimming test, there was an increased zzso period zzso P zzso zzso and a decreased zzso period zzso P zzso zzso in rats treated with zzso zzso In the tail zzso test, zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced the zzso time zzso P zzso zzso zzso The data show that zzso zzso during prenatal and zzso periods affects zzso responses in adult offspring rats, suggesting that zzso is required for the development of neural systems that are associated with adult anxiety and zzso zzso zzso
