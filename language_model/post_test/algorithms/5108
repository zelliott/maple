The percent removal and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso developed from wastewater of biological zzso pond zzso New Delhi, zzso was studied under batch conditions with live biomass compared with continuous system using dried biomass immobilized on zzso under laboratory zzso In batch study, zzso consortium zzso consisting of a mixed culture of Chlorella zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to remove zzso of zzso after 15 days of incubation from culture media containing 10 zzso zzso which decreased by increasing metal concentration from zzso zzso This reduction in removal efficiency was zzso with direct toxic effect of zzso on live consortium as indicated by drastic zzso in zzso A maximum lead zzso capacity zzso of zzso zzso showed good zzso potential of live zzso zzso derived from the biomass of dried zzso consortium immobilized on zzso gel and packed in column exhibited zzso removal of zzso with inlet zzso concentration of zzso zzso was brought down to minimum zzso zzso of zzso in outlet zzso The plot of outlet concentration to volume exhibited the typical zzso shape curve with zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso recovery of zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso with dilute zzso which indicated multiple zzso of immobilized zzso
