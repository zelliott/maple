To evaluate our experience of adding zzso zzso zzso analysis following mismatch repair zzso protein zzso in the test zzso for Lynch syndrome zzso the most common inherited predisposition to zzso cancer zzso 

Since January 1, 2009, zzso zzso zzso analysis has been performed at our institution for all newly diagnosed zzso with absent zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of 412 patients with zzso had at least 1 zzso absent (65 had zzso and zzso absent and 25 had other zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in 36 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of 412 patients required follow-up after addition of zzso analysis compared with 90 who would have required follow-up without zzso zzso 

The addition of zzso zzso zzso testing in zzso with absent zzso and zzso reduced the number of patient contacts by zzso and simplified the genetic testing for zzso leading to cost and time zzso
