This study tests the hypothesis that zzso of a zzso emergency department zzso protocol to rule out pulmonary embolism would increase the rate of evaluation without increasing the rate of pulmonary vascular imaging or zzso length of stay and that less than zzso of patients with a negative protocol would have an adverse zzso 

A baseline study was conducted on patients with suspected pulmonary embolism at an urban zzso to establish baseline zzso performed when only pulmonary vascular imaging was available to rule out pulmonary zzso The intervention protocol used zzso probability assessment, a zzso d zzso zzso and an zzso zzso measurement to rule out pulmonary zzso The main outcomes were diagnosis of zzso zzso or sudden unexpected death within 90 zzso 

During zzso 453 of zzso patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso underwent pulmonary vascular imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of scan results were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso discharged patients were zzso for zzso zzso or died unexpectedly within 90 zzso The median length of stay was 385 zzso After intervention, zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were evaluated for pulmonary zzso Seven hundred zzso patients had a negative protocol and 5 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso had zzso zzso within 90 days, none with unexpected zzso After intervention, the rate of pulmonary vascular imaging tended to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and more scans zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were read as zzso the length of stay decreased to 297 zzso 

A zzso pulmonary embolism zzso protocol doubled the rate of screening for pulmonary embolism in the zzso had a false negative rate of less than zzso did not increase the pulmonary vascular imaging rate, and decreased length of zzso
