Active zzso models are used to extract object boundary from digital image, but there is poor convergence for the targets with deep zzso We proposed an improved approach based on existing zzso zzso flow zzso Main contributions of this paper are a new zzso to determine the false part of active zzso with higher accuracy from the global force of zzso zzso flow and a new zzso to update the external force field together with the local information of zzso zzso Our method has a zzso external force field, which is adjusted only when the false active zzso zzso Thus, active contours have more chances to approximate the complex boundary, while the zzso cost is limited zzso The new zzso is tested on irregular shapes and then on real images such as zzso and ultrasound medical zzso Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of our method, and the zzso complexity is also zzso
