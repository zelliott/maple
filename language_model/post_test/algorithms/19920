The identification and functional understanding of the zzso that mediates alcohol and drug effects that are relevant for the development of addictive behavior is a fundamental challenge in addiction zzso Here we introduce an zzso construction of a zzso that mediates acute and chronic drug effects on neurotransmitter dynamics that is solely based on zzso zzso Two types of data were considered for constructing the zzso zzso information on the zzso and zzso connectivity of each brain region of interest obtained from different zzso zzso zzso information on the functional relevance of each region of interest with respect to alcohol and drug zzso We used mathematical data mining and zzso zzso methods to achieve the highest standards in the zzso of these zzso Using this approach, a zzso network of high molecular and spatial resolution containing 19 brain regions and seven neurotransmitter systems was zzso Further graph theoretical analysis suggests that the zzso is connected and cannot be separated into further zzso Our analysis also reveals the existence of a principal core zzso comprised of nine brain zzso the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, nucleus zzso zzso amygdala, thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso area and zzso zzso Finally, by means of zzso criteria for zzso of the zzso the suitability for in zzso modeling of acute and chronic drug effects is zzso Indeed, we introduced as an example a zzso system for modeling the effects of acute ethanol administration in rats and obtained an increase in zzso release in the nucleus zzso hallmark of drug zzso an extent similar to that seen in numerous zzso zzso We conclude that the present zzso provides a structural and zzso framework for large-scale mathematical models and will help to predict chronic drug effects on brain zzso
