We proposed to use three different zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso had a small zzso acceptance angle to provide zzso spatial resolution and the other two had larger zzso acceptance angles to achieve high zzso A new zzso reconstruction zzso that combined the data acquired from different zzso was derived to take advantages of both high resolution and high zzso The zzso was evaluated using a zzso zzso of zzso zzso For zzso data, the accuracy zzso determined by spatial zzso obtained from combination of the zzso acceptance angles of zzso zzso and zzso degrees (or zzso zzso and zzso zzso was slightly inferior to that obtained from three same zzso zzso (with a zzso degrees zzso acceptance zzso This is because the zzso transfer function zzso resulting from three different zzso decreases more quickly at low zzso but becomes comparable at high zzso as compared with the zzso of the zzso degrees zzso With noisy data, however, the image quality obtained with three different zzso was better than that resulting from any combinations of three same zzso The improvement was only achieved by using the derived algorithm, while the conventional zzso zzso did not improve image quality even with the same zzso zzso
