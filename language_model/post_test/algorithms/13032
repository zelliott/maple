zzso disease is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant zzso zzso accurate cardiac risk assessment in potential candidates is an important zzso The purpose of this review is to examine the existing research on the screening and management of zzso cardiovascular disease, with an emphasis on defining the optimal approach for zzso high-risk zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso in the general population demonstrate that zzso zzso in stable patients prior to major zzso surgery does not reduce cardiac events or improve survival zzso The benefit of zzso stress testing in this population is doubtful based on smaller zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or high-risk candidates appears to be beneficial but acute administration is zzso 

Investigation for coronary artery disease is warranted for kidney transplant candidates with symptoms of zzso zzso However, there is insufficient evidence to support routine cardiovascular screening in zzso candidates regardless of their cardiac risk factor zzso zzso specifically looking at this issue in zzso transplant candidates are a research zzso
