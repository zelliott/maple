zzso light interference zzso zzso is a recently developed method for the zzso imaging of live cells, using the quantitative optical path length through the sample as an zzso source of zzso In conventional zzso spatial resolution is limited by zzso and zzso This paper describes a novel constrained zzso method for improving resolution in zzso zzso zzso is enabled by experimental measurement of the system zzso function and the modeling of coherent image formation in zzso zzso using simulated and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed method leads to significant improvements in the resolution and contrast of zzso zzso The proposed method should prove useful for high-resolution zzso studies of biological cells and zzso zzso
