A novel method for fast and accurate evaluation of the generalized Born zzso in zzso zzso zzso calculations is proposed, based on the zzso accessibility of the first two zzso layers around an zzso The reverse generalized Born zzso calculated by the method have correlation zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with the values obtained using a precise but significantly slower zzso boundary element zzso The method is applied to derive an estimate of the free zzso energy difference between zzso and water and to predict zzso zzso A zzso model is zzso on an 81 compound training set and applied to predict zzso for an external evaluation set of 19 drug molecules with zzso of zzso The new zzso approximation is also tested in zzso Carlo zzso simulations of the fully flexible zzso zzso zzso to zzso The best energy solution found in the simulations has zzso of zzso A to the X-ray zzso
