It is known that in the early stages of zzso the concentration of zzso proteins decreases in zzso zzso This phenomenon is under active research to develop a means to characterize zzso accurately in the early stages of the disease, when still zzso However, no method of zzso has yet shown clear success in this zzso In this article, we propose a novel approach to detect zzso depletion using fast zzso zzso This technique was previously reported to allow zzso measurement of protein concentration via the zzso zzso relaxation in certain zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso cartilage exhibits clear zzso zzso that can be measured by a zzso fast zzso zzso device and which changes significantly between normal and diseased zzso zzso zzso zzso This signal is probably zzso zzso The method may have potential for early evaluation of zzso in patients on fast zzso scanners currently under evaluation in the zzso zzso
