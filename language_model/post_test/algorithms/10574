We present an zzso expression for the zzso zzso of a wet zzso zzso The influence of the liquid is modeled by a zzso interaction zzso For the dilute limit zzso zzso zzso we find a simple expression accounting for the contribution of both the scattering states and the bound states in arbitrary zzso It is shown that the system is significantly more chaotic than a gas of zzso hard zzso as reflected by a pronounced increase of the zzso zzso
