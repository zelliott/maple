We pose the problem of zzso an ancient zzso zzso into its constituent zzso despite fragmentation and noise caused by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We formulate this in terms of decomposition into zzso zzso zzso distinguished by location within the zzso We devise and implement a zzso zzso for solving realistic instances of the zzso An unusual focus of our method is the focus on zzso gene density or lack of gaps in the assembly of fragments into larger regions, rather than maximizing the number of zzso We validate the method against the grape zzso in which the ancient core zzso zzso is readily zzso and is already well zzso We then analyze the tomato zzso whose proposed status as a descendant of a more recent zzso zzso is controversial, and confirm this zzso The solution reveals unexpected information about the evolution of the zzso
