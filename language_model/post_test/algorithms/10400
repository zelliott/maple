zzso systems meant to operate in zzso environments are requested to adapt when the process generating the observed data zzso A straightforward form of adaptation implementing the instance selection approach suggests releasing the obsolete data onto which the zzso is configured by replacing it with novel samples before zzso In this direction, we propose an zzso zzso based on the intersection of confidence intervals rule for detecting a possible change in the process generating the data as well as identifying the new data to be used to zzso the zzso A key point of the research is that no assumptions are made about the distribution of the process generating the zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso zzso system is particularly effective in situations where the process is subject to abrupt zzso
