We determined the effect of zzso an inhibitor of zzso on the penetration of the zzso drug zzso into the zzso zzso was administered orally at 25 and 80 zzso 1 h before zzso zzso and zzso at 20 zzso 10 zzso and 1 h before zzso The zzso of zzso in plasma and zzso and of zzso in plasma were zzso by zzso liquid zzso The results revealed zzso and zzso higher zzso levels in the brain of zzso mice treated orally with 25 and 80 zzso zzso zzso However, complete zzso as in zzso knockout mice zzso zzso was not zzso zzso also increased the zzso zzso in plasma and zzso to levels similar to those observed in zzso knockout mice, suggesting selective zzso zzso of zzso When zzso was administered zzso 10 zzso before zzso the zzso levels in the brain of zzso mice increased by zzso whereas the increase was only zzso when zzso was administered 1 h before zzso This suggests that the zzso of zzso at the zzso barrier by zzso is rapidly zzso and that the zzso of zzso in the plasma have already declined to levels insufficient to inhibit zzso at the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is only moderately active as an inhibitor of zzso at the zzso zzso
