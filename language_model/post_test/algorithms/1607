zzso relationships were investigated for zzso the zzso zzso zzso and type of linkages of linear and zzso zzso using zzso chemical zzso For this study, 119 zzso zzso were used that are zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso bonded through a or b zzso linkages of types zzso zzso zzso or zzso as well as zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso learning experiments were performed for: zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the first unit, second unit and reducing end; zzso zzso of the type of first and second zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso reducing end, middle and first zzso and zzso zzso of the chain zzso Our previously model for predicting the structure of zzso was incorporated in this new model with an improvement of the zzso zzso The best results were achieved using Random zzso with 204 zzso and zzso for the training zzso could correctly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the test set zzso zzso for the nine tasks, respectively, on the basis of zzso chemical zzso
