To compare zzso images and zzso reconstructions with atomic structures in a quantitative way it is essential to model the electron scattering by zzso zzso or zzso that surrounds protein zzso The most rigorous method for determining the density of zzso water atoms for this purpose has been to perform zzso zzso simulations of the zzso zzso In this paper we adapt the ideas of zzso modeling that are used in the refinement of X-ray crystal structures to the zzso zzso zzso We present a zzso model for zzso density which matches zzso results to within sampling zzso However, we also find that the simple zzso model of zzso and zzso zzso performs nearly as well as the new zzso We conclude that several methods are now available for rapid and accurate modeling of zzso images and maps of zzso zzso
