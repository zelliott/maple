zzso probe zzso zzso is a promising candidate approach for zzso zzso but zzso in zzso cost, and resolution have limited its zzso The recent development of zzso scanning probe zzso has allowed researchers to define zzso patterns in a low-cost and high-resolution format, but with the limitation that these are zzso tools where each probe in the array creates a copy of a single zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso architecture that can generate 100 zzso molecular features using a zzso array of independently zzso zzso To physically zzso a probe, local heating is used to zzso expand the zzso film beneath a single probe, bringing it into contact with the patterning zzso Not only is this architecture simple and zzso but it addresses fundamental limitations of zzso zzso by allowing one to compensate for unavoidable imperfections in the zzso This zzso zzso zzso will enable the construction of surfaces with chemical functionality that is tuned across the zzso and zzso
