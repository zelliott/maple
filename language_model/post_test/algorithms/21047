zzso zzso identification is one of the most important components in zzso zzso We propose a method to properly combine the results from different database search methods to enhance the accuracy of zzso zzso The database search methods included in our analysis are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using two data sets, one collected in profile mode and one collected in zzso mode, we tested the search performance of all 21 combinations of two search methods as well as all 35 possible combinations of three search zzso The results obtained from our study suggest that properly combining search methods does improve retrieval zzso In addition to performance results, we also describe the theoretical framework which in principle allows one to combine many independent scoring methods including de zzso sequencing and spectral library zzso The correlations among different methods are also investigated in terms of common true zzso common false zzso and a global zzso We find that the average correlation strength, between any zzso combination of the seven methods zzso is usually smaller than the associated standard zzso This indicates only weak correlation may be present among different methods and zzso our approach in combining the search zzso The usefulness of our approach is further confirmed by showing that the average cumulative number of false positive peptides agrees reasonably well with the combined zzso The data related to this study are freely available upon zzso
