In collaboration with the Canadian Network of zzso Blood Disorder zzso we held the second Canadian Consensus discussion with our international colleagues in Toronto, Ontario, on February 3, 2006, and reviewed its content at the Fifth C1 zzso zzso Workshop in Budapest on June 2, zzso zzso were presented by international investigators, and this consensus zzso approach zzso 

This consensus zzso outlines the approach recommended for the diagnosis, therapy, and management of zzso which was agreed on by the authors of this zzso This document is only a consensus zzso approach and continues to require zzso As such, participants agreed to make this a living 2007 algorithm, a work in progress, and to review its content at future international zzso zzso 

There is a paucity of zzso zzso trials on the treatment of zzso making levels of evidence to support the zzso less than zzso Controlled trials currently under way will provide further insight into the management of zzso As with our Canadian 2003 zzso this 2007 International Consensus Algorithm for the zzso zzso and Management of zzso was formed through the meeting and agreement of patient care professionals along with patient group representatives and individual zzso
