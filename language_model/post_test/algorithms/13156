Many pattern analysis problems require zzso of examples into naturally ordered zzso In such cases, nominal zzso schemes will ignore the class order zzso which can have a zzso effect on zzso zzso This article introduces two novel zzso learning zzso zzso zzso schemes, with metric learning, specifically designed for zzso data items into ordered zzso In zzso zzso unlike in nominal zzso the class order information is used during training in selecting the class prototypes to be zzso as well as in determining the exact manner in which the prototypes get zzso zzso models in general are more amenable to interpretations and can often be constructed at a smaller zzso cost than alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the proposed zzso zzso zzso compare favorably with their nominal zzso Moreover, our methods achieve competitive performance against existing benchmark zzso zzso zzso
