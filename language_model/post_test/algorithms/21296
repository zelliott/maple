We tested the hypothesis that the zzso left zzso normally works at optimal external power as opposed to optimal efficiency by zzso data from five isolated, zzso cat hearts and 39 zzso zzso In the isolated hearts, we measured pump function, external steady power, zzso oxygen consumption, and zzso zzso external power and optimal efficiency were found at different left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso In the in zzso cat hearts the working point was found at an output of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas optimal external power was found at zzso zzso zzso zzso These values were not significantly zzso Assuming that the point of optimal efficiency was located at the same fraction of the zzso unloaded left zzso output zzso as in the isolated hearts, zzso zzso we found the point of optimal efficiency for the in zzso heart at a flow of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was significantly different zzso less than zzso from the flow in the working zzso Our data therefore indicate that the left zzso in the zzso cat is matched to the zzso load such that its external power output rather than efficiency is zzso
