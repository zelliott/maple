Living systems can adapt to injuries and even heal themselves, an ability desirable also in synthetic zzso A method is presented for zzso adapting the construction of an electronic circuit to hardware defects by zzso the process as a series of interactions between identical but specialized structures called zzso The circuit zzso including zzso can occupy any place in the hardware that has been determined to be free of zzso The circuit zzso is reduced to a connected zzso with no zzso information, and provided as a code repeated in each zzso Using the code, zzso differentiate into circuit components in a late stage of the process, with highly adaptable physical location and zzso zzso also form the wires between circuit zzso The structure and function of the system at three major levels is zzso the lowest cellular level, the zzso and the target circuit zzso zzso of circuit construction to defective hardware was observed for this zzso zzso obtained from this development process on simulated and real hardware with a variety of zzso types and zzso patterns are zzso as well as higher level simulations of the zzso and its response to a wider range of zzso patterns, amounts of hardware, and hardware to fault zzso
