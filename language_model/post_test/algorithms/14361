We propose two information zzso similarity measures that allow to incorporate tissue class information in zzso image zzso The first measure assumes that tissue class probabilities have been assigned to each of the images to be registered by prior zzso of both of zzso One image is then zzso zzso to match the other such that the fuzzy overlap of corresponding zzso object labels becomes similar to the ideal case zzso the tissue probability maps of both images are zzso Image similarity is assessed during registration by the divergence between the ideal and actual joint class probability zzso of both zzso A second registration measure is proposed that applies in case a zzso is available for only one of the images, for instance an zzso image that is to be matched to a study image to guide the zzso zzso zzso in one image are matched to the fuzzy class labels in the other image by minimizing the conditional zzso of the zzso in the first image given the class labels in the second zzso We derive zzso expressions for the zzso of each measure with respect to individual zzso zzso to derive a force field that drives the registration process, which is zzso by a viscous fluid zzso The performance of the zzso measures is evaluated in the context of zzso zzso registration and zzso zzso of MR brain images and compared with zzso of mutual information using only intensity zzso Our results demonstrate that incorporation of class information in the registration measure significantly improves the overlap between corresponding tissue classes after zzso zzso The methods proposed here open new perspectives for zzso zzso and registration in a single process, zzso the output of one is used to guide the zzso
