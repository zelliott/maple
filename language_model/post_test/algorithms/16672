Analysis of the function of zzso ligaments zzso during physical joint zzso is hindered by an inability to adequately image these zzso during the zzso This restricts functional zzso studies only to the zzso that may be zzso zzso There is, however, a clinical imperative to be able to investigate complex zzso that exacerbate symptoms but cannot be easily conducted physically in the zzso The aim of this study was to develop and validate an zzso for a computer simulation model that allows the zzso of zzso ligament lengths during zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pair were segmented to provide individual surface zzso of the bones and zzso points of each zzso ligament on both zzso An zzso was developed in which the zzso ligament zzso length was divided into two straight lines, plus an arc zzso the zzso wrapping zzso The model was validated by simulating two classical zzso studies from the literature and comparing zzso zzso from the model were zzso similar to the results of the two zzso studies by a factor of zzso and zzso zzso Algorithm application will allow investigation of functional loading of the zzso ligaments during simulated complex zzso This could then be used to provide diagnostic understanding and thus, inform surgical zzso
