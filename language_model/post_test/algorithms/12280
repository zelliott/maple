In this work, we investigated the effect of storage in zzso zzso on buck zzso zzso at 5 degrees zzso Furthermore, we studied the effect of addition of zzso to the zzso and the washing of seminal plasma on zzso zzso In zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso was used as a control to study the effect of solid media storage zzso and zzso supplementation zzso and the combination of both zzso on in zzso zzso survival of washed and zzso zzso zzso up to 72 h at 5 degrees zzso zzso zzso integrity zzso and zzso swelling tests zzso were evaluated to assess in zzso zzso zzso In zzso 2, an artificial zzso zzso field trial was performed to compare G versus zzso Solid media zzso maintained zzso of zzso during storage higher than any other zzso zzso G versus zzso zzso zzso M and 59% zzso zzso but there was no difference in zzso or zzso between zzso zzso No improvement in zzso viability was obtained by addition of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso improved zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso No significant differences in fertility were obtained between G and M zzso zzso versus zzso zzso In conclusion, washing of zzso and dilution in zzso milk zzso zzso zzso appears to be a successful method for goat zzso storage at 5 degrees zzso
