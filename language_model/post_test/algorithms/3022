In the zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso interactions zzso between N zzso particles are described by a zzso diffusion zzso This zzso has to be zzso at each time step with a zzso of zzso making the calculation of the correlated random zzso the bottleneck for zzso zzso Here we present a faster zzso for this step, which is based on a truncated expansion of the zzso zzso correlations as zzso zzso The comparison to the exact zzso and to the zzso approximation of zzso verifies that for zzso zzso this approximation yields about zzso of the zzso correlations at an improved zzso zzso of zzso and a reduced memory zzso The approximation is independent of the actual form of the zzso zzso and can be applied to arbitrary particle zzso This now allows to include zzso into large zzso zzso dynamics simulations, where until now the zzso zzso of the correlated random motion was zzso
