We demonstrate zzso zzso fluorescent imaging of transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso over an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a spatial resolution of zzso zzso This is the first time that a zzso zzso platform has successfully zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso In our zzso zzso imaging platform, the transgenic samples are excited using a zzso interface from the side, where the pump light is rejected through total internal reflection occurring at the bottom facet of the zzso The zzso fluorescent signal from zzso zzso samples is then recorded on a large area zzso zzso over an zzso of zzso zzso zzso without the use of any lenses, zzso interference filters or mechanical zzso Because fluorescent zzso rapidly zzso such zzso fluorescent images recorded on a chip look blurred due to broad zzso of our zzso To combat this resolution challenge, we use a zzso sampling zzso to uniquely decode the recorded zzso fluorescent patterns into higher resolution images, demonstrating zzso zzso zzso We tested the efficacy of this zzso decoding approach with different types of zzso sensors to achieve a similar resolution level, independent of the imaging zzso We further demonstrate that this wide zzso zzso fluorescent imaging platform can also perform sequential zzso imaging of the same samples using zzso zzso digital zzso zzso that is coupled from the top facet of the same zzso used in fluorescent zzso This unique combination permits zzso field zzso imaging of zzso zzso on a chip which could especially provide a useful tool for zzso screening applications in biomedical zzso
