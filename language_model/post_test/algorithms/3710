On the zzso the zzso zzso measures the time taken by an electrical impulse generated in the zzso zzso to zzso from zzso to zzso From mouse to zzso the zzso zzso increases approximately zzso whereas body mass zzso zzso approximately zzso Scaling of many biological processes zzso zzso rate, life span, zzso zzso is described by the zzso equation zzso zzso zzso where Y is the biological process and b is the zzso zzso that is an zzso multiple of zzso zzso branching networks have been proposed to be the underlying mechanism for the 1/4 power zzso zzso 

We first derived zzso the zzso equation for the zzso zzso We assumed that the heart behaves as a set of zzso networks that tend to minimize propagation time across the conducting system while ensuring a zzso optimal zzso zzso zzso Our derivation yielded the relationship zzso zzso zzso zzso We subsequently obtained previously published values of zzso zzso heart rate, and zzso of zzso zzso representing 33 zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso increases as heart rate zzso and both variables relate to zzso following the 1/4 power zzso Most important, the best fit for zzso versus zzso is described by the equation zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso determined zzso zzso is close to zzso as zzso 

We have demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso scales as the 1/4 power of the zzso following the universal law for zzso zzso to ensure an optimal zzso zzso zzso
