In this paper, a criterion for a fast automatic approach method in conventional atomic force microscope is zzso There are currently two approach zzso automatic and semiautomatic zzso However, neither of them provides a high approach speed to enable the avoidance of possible damage to tips or zzso Industrial atomic force microscope requires a high approach speed and good zzso for inspecting a large zzso Recently, a rapid automatic engagement method was reported to improve the approach zzso However, there was no information on how to determine the safe zzso This lack of information increases the chance for damage to occur in zzso optimal approach zzso In this paper, we show that the proposed criterion can be used for decision making in determining mode transitions from fast motion to slow zzso The criterion is calculated based on the average intensity of a zzso laser zzso The zzso distance where the average intensity becomes the maximum value is used for the zzso We explain the effects of the beam spot size and the window size on the average zzso From experimental results with an optical head used in a commercial atomic force zzso we observed that the mean and standard zzso (of the distance at which intensity is the maximum for the 25 zzso are zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for a zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso zzso for a triangular zzso zzso simulation and experimental results are in good zzso
