A drastic improvement in the analysis of gene expression has lead to new discoveries in zzso zzso In order to zzso the gene expression data, fuzzy zzso zzso are widely zzso However, the resulting analyses from these specific types of zzso may lead to confusion in hypotheses with regard to the suggestion of dominant function for genes of zzso Besides that, the current fuzzy zzso zzso do not conduct a thorough analysis of genes with low membership zzso zzso we present a novel zzso framework called the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso gene expression zzso The framework consists of four zzso fuzzy zzso zzso zzso achieving dominant cluster zzso improving confidence level zzso and combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso By employing double filtering in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso our new framework is capable of determining the dominant clusters and improving the confidence level of genes with lower membership values by means of which the unknown genes can be zzso
