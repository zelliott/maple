zzso resonance imaging studies have reported significant functional and structural differences between depressed patients and zzso Little attention has been given, however, to the abnormalities in anatomical connectivity in depressed zzso In the present study, we aim to investigate the zzso in connectivity of zzso anatomical networks in those suffering from major depression by using machine learning zzso Brain anatomical networks were extracted from diffusion magnetic resonance images obtained from both 22 zzso zzso adults with major depressive disorder and 26 matched healthy zzso Using machine learning approaches, we differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls based on their zzso anatomical connectivity patterns and identified the most discriminating features that represent zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso test, zzso of subjects were correctly classified via zzso zzso Moreover, the strengths of all the most discriminating connections were increased in depressed patients relative to the controls, and these connections were primarily located within the zzso network, especially the zzso zzso These results not only provide initial steps toward the development of zzso diagnostic markers for major depressive disorder, but also suggest that abnormal zzso anatomical networks may contribute to the anatomical basis of emotional zzso and cognitive zzso associated with this zzso
