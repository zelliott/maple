A fast search method for zzso zzso is proposed in this zzso It makes use of the fact that in the generalized Lloyd zzso zzso a zzso in a training sequence is either placed in the same minimum distance partition zzso as in the previous iteration or in a partition within a very small subset of zzso The proposed method searches for the zzso for a training zzso only in this subset of partitions plus the single previous zzso As the size of this subset is much smaller than the total number of zzso the search process is zzso up zzso The creation of the subset is essential, as it has a direct effect on the improvement in zzso time of the proposed zzso The schemes that create the subset efficiently have been zzso The proposed method generates a zzso identical to that generated using the zzso It is simple and requires only minor modification of the zzso and a modest amount of additional zzso The experimental results show that the zzso time of zzso training was improved by factors from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso for two test data sets when zzso of sizes from N zzso 16 to zzso were zzso The proposed method was also combined with an earlier published method to further improve the zzso zzso
