Six men performed a single ankle zzso zzso exercise in the zzso position with the zzso effort with counter movement zzso zzso zzso preceded by zzso and without counter movement zzso zzso zzso only) produced by a sliding table that controlled applied load to the ankle (40 % of the zzso voluntary zzso The reaction force at the foot and ankle joint angle were measured using a force plate and a zzso zzso From real-time zzso of the zzso zzso muscle during the movement, the zzso length was zzso The estimated peak force, average power, and work at the Achilles' zzso during the zzso zzso phase in CM were significantly greater than those in zzso In zzso in the zzso phase, zzso length initially increased with little zzso activity, then remained constant while the whole zzso unit zzso before decreasing in the final zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso length decreased throughout the movement and the zzso length at the onset of movement was longer than that of the corresponding phase in zzso It was concluded that during CM muscle zzso zzso work almost zzso by leaving the task of storing and releasing elastic energy for enhancing exercise performance to the zzso
