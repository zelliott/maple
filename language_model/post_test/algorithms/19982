zzso is an initiative to define a standard zzso of DNA to be used to assign sequences of unknown origin to existing known species whose sequences are recorded in zzso This is a difficult task when species are closely related and individuals of these species might have more than one zzso Using a previously introduced zzso statistical zzso assignment zzso based on segregating sites, we examine how it functions in the presence of hidden population subdivision with closely related species using zzso Not surprisingly, adding samples to the database from a greater proportion of the species range leads to a consistently higher number of accurate zzso Without such samples, query sequences that originate from outside of the sampled range are easily zzso as coming from other zzso However, we show that even the addition of a single sample from a different zzso is sufficient to greatly increase the probability of placement of unknown queries into the correct species zzso This study highlights the importance of broad zzso even with five reference samples per species, in the creation of a reference zzso
