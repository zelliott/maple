The aim of the study was to obtain information on the accuracy and precision of zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso and selection of an appropriate zzso of the measurement uncertainty of a single determination of these zzso 

In a simulation zzso zzso experiment, it was assumed that the recorded results of plasma and zzso zzso as obtained from 185 patients, provided authentic information about zzso zzso in the body over a wide range of the zzso zzso The time course zzso concentration in blood plasma has been described by means of zzso function with zzso values derived for each zzso For each patient, using these data and urinary zzso data, there had been zzso simulations zzso in each of the latter, the directly measured numbers have been zzso by simulated ones, obtained by means of varying the real ones, using random generated zzso These reflected errors of plasma and radioactive standard zzso (from 1 to zzso and zzso of counting radioactive zzso zzso The time of blood sampling and urine zzso was also zzso assuming realistic zzso The varied values were then used for zzso of the simulated zzso From the 5,000 calculated zzso for each patient, zzso were zzso as well as mean standard zzso standard zzso and mean uncertainty of zzso using a widely accepted rule of partial error zzso and, in addition, a modified rule of the zzso zzso of clearance zzso zzso zzso determination was assessed on the basis of comparison of mean values from simulations with those from directly recorded zzso Precision was identified with standard zzso of each of the zzso zzso The uncertainty thus obtained was compared with results of calculated traditional and modified zzso There was good agreement between standard zzso of the simulations with results of the modified calculation of total zzso zzso a zzso of variation from simulation zzso and a modified means of calculation of the zzso errors was accepted as a measure of uncertainty of a single zzso 

There was a very high correlation between the mean values from simulations and those from direct zzso zzso zzso zzso in each zzso The zzso lines practically corresponded to the lines of zzso These correlations were not affected by the assumed range of zzso zzso In conclusion, the methods of zzso clearance determination are zzso Precision of clearance zzso depends substantially upon uncertainty of zzso For plasma zzso the zzso of variations at zzso zzso 350 zzso and at zzso zzso amounted to 2 and zzso respectively, at zzso uncertainty of zzso Similarly, for zzso zzso of zzso of 300 zzso and 30 zzso zzso was zzso and zzso respectively (at the same uncertainty of zzso
