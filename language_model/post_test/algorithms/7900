zzso data suggest that clinical outcomes of human zzso zzso infection may be influenced by virus zzso zzso with multiple zzso or infection with novel intermediate zzso In this report, we propose a clinical zzso for detecting zzso zzso and intermediate zzso 

We zzso amplified and zzso zzso of the zzso and fiber genes of zzso zzso clinical specimens obtained from 14 surveillance zzso zzso were then compared with those from 52 zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens that showed zzso sequence identity with a corresponding zzso strain were designated as being of that zzso When zzso and fiber gene sequences zzso or sequence identity was low, the specimens were further characterized by viral culture, plaque zzso repeat zzso with sequencing, and zzso restriction zzso digest zzso 

Of the zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso were single zzso strain infections, 12 zzso were zzso and 2 zzso had intermediate zzso zzso specimens and intermediate zzso strains considered together were more likely to be associated with severe illness compared to other zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso 

The majority of severe cases of zzso illness cases occurred among zzso zzso The zzso zzso we describe here can be used to screen clinical specimens for evidence of zzso zzso and novel intermediate zzso zzso This zzso may be especially useful in investigating zzso outbreaks and clusters of unusually severe zzso zzso
