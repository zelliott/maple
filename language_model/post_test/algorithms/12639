This paper describes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso parameters by the zzso based on a zzso neural network zzso embedded in a hybrid system, which is modeled by the zzso zzso zzso After identifying full dynamics of the hybrid system, the zzso is used to estimate zzso derivatives of an objective function J with respect to the zzso parameters from the zzso information, which are trajectory zzso Then, the estimated zzso zzso is applied to the optimal tuning of a zzso zzso used in a practical engineering zzso
