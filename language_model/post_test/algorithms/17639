An alternative methodology based on artificial neural networks is proposed to be a complementary tool to other conventional methods to study controlled drug zzso Two systems are used to test the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes in a zzso zzso Two well-established mathematical models are used to simulate different release profiles as a function of fundamental zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug loading zzso and the height of the device zzso The models were tested, and the results show that these fundamental properties can be predicted after learning the experimental or model data for controlled drug release zzso The neural network results obtained after the learning stage can be considered to zzso predict ideal experimental zzso Overall, the proposed methodology was shown to be efficient for ideal experiments, with a relative average error of zzso in both zzso This approach can be useful for the experimental analysis to simulate and design efficient controlled zzso zzso
