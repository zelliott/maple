The zzso activity of the zzso zzso on the growth of zzso human breast cancer cells was evaluated using the zzso zzso blue exclusion method, zzso zzso and a total protein zzso zzso was evaluated over a concentration range from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso blue exclusion method and zzso incorporation were sensitive enough to demonstrate the zzso influence of tamoxifen on the proliferation of zzso cells at a concentration as low as zzso zzso A very good correlation of these two methods was observed in the zzso concentration range of zzso The total protein determination method was only sensitive enough to detect the zzso influence of tamoxifen at zzso above zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso incorporation method was found to be effective and much less time consuming than the zzso zzso blue exclusion method for evaluating the zzso effects of zzso in cultured zzso zzso However, when evaluating zzso which are zzso specific, the results of the zzso incorporation method should be interpreted with zzso
