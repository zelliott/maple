This paper addresses the problem of side information extraction for distributed coding of videos captured by a camera moving in a 3-D zzso zzso Examples of targeted applications are zzso reality, zzso robots operating in hazardous zzso or remote exploration by zzso It explores the benefits of the zzso paradigm for distributed coding of this type of video zzso Two zzso methods constrained by the scene zzso based either on block matching along zzso lines or on 3-D mesh fitting, are first zzso These techniques are based on a robust zzso for zzso matching of feature points, which leads to zzso zzso between key zzso However, their zzso zzso performances are limited by zzso between the side information and the actual zzso zzso frames due to the assumption of linear motion between key zzso To cope with this problem, two feature point tracking techniques are introduced, which recover the camera parameters of the zzso zzso A first technique, in which the frames remain zzso zzso performs tracking at the decoder and leads to significant zzso performance zzso A second technique further improves the zzso performances by allowing a limited tracking at the zzso As an additional benefit, statistics on tracks allow the zzso to adapt the key frame frequency to the video motion zzso
