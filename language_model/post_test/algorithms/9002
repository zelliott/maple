The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of zzso zzso skeletal reconstructions of lower limb in children using zzso and to assess uncertainty of clinical and anatomical parameters for children with cerebral zzso and for healthy zzso The zzso technique, using the zzso system zzso is based on the acquisition of two simultaneous digital zzso and lateral X-rays, from head to feet in standing position and at low radiation zzso This technique allows zzso skeletal zzso zzso Five children with cerebral zzso zzso and 5 typically developing children zzso were included in the zzso Two operators performed the lower limb reconstructions zzso zzso reconstructions were feasible for children over the age of 5 zzso The study of zzso of anatomical parameters defining skeletal alignment showed uncertainties under zzso for the neck zzso angle, the zzso mechanical angle, and for the zzso and zzso zzso The maximum degree of uncertainty was obtained for the zzso zzso rotation zzso for healthy children and zzso for children with zzso
