Because zzso cameras are generally susceptible to environmental conditions and system zzso they require routine evaluation of uniformity zzso The metrics for such evaluations are commonly zzso zzso Although these metrics are typically successful at identifying regional zzso they often do not adequately reflect subtle periodic zzso therefore, additional visual inspections are zzso The goal of this project was to zzso test, and validate a new uniformity analysis metric capable of accurately identifying structures and patterns present in nuclear medicine zzso uniformity zzso 

A new uniformity assessment zzso termed the structured noise index zzso was based on the zzso noise power spectrum zzso The contribution of quantum noise was zzso from the zzso of a zzso uniformity image, resulting in an zzso representing image zzso A visual response filter function was then applied to both the original zzso and the artifact zzso A single quantitative score was calculated on the basis of the magnitude of the zzso To verify the zzso of the zzso an observer study was performed with 5 expert nuclear medicine zzso The correlation between the zzso and the visual score was assessed with zzso rank correlation zzso The zzso was also compared with zzso zzso assessment metrics modeled on the National zzso Manufacturers Association standard for integral uniformity in both the useful field of view zzso and the central field of view zzso 

The zzso outperformed the zzso zzso metrics in terms of its correlation with the visual score zzso values for the zzso integral zzso and integral zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso had zzso sensitivity for identifying both structured and zzso zzso for the integral zzso and zzso zzso the sensitivities were only zzso and zzso zzso The overall positive zzso value of the zzso was zzso for the integral zzso and zzso zzso the positive zzso values were only zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso accurately identified both structured and zzso zzso zzso and correlated closely with expert visual zzso Compared with traditional zzso zzso analysis, the zzso showed superior performance in terms of its correlation with visual zzso The zzso method is effective for detecting and zzso visually apparent zzso and may reduce the need for more zzso visual zzso
