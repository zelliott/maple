Many cellular functions involve protein complexes that are formed by multiple interacting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a popular experimental method for detecting such zzso zzso However, current zzso methods that predict protein complexes from TAP data require converting the zzso relationships in TAP data into zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso interaction zzso network is then zzso for densely connected regions that are identified as putative protein zzso zzso the TAP data into zzso data not only introduces errors but also loses useful information about the underlying zzso relationships that can be exploited to detect the internal organization zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso In this article, we propose a method called zzso that detects protein complexes with zzso structures directly from zzso zzso zzso models the TAP data as a zzso graph in which the two zzso sets are the zzso and the zzso zzso The edges between the two zzso sets represent zzso zzso zzso first focuses on detecting high-quality zzso zzso from the zzso zzso To minimize the effects of false positive zzso the zzso relationships are zzso with reliability zzso Only zzso reliable zzso zzso from the TAP zzso graph are regarded as zzso zzso zzso zzso protein complexes by including attachment proteins into the zzso We applied zzso on large-scale TAP zzso and found that zzso outperformed existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy zzso zzso and functional zzso of predicted zzso In addition, the protein complexes predicted by zzso are equipped with zzso structures that provide useful biological insights into the inherent functional organization of protein zzso Our supplementary material can be found at zzso ; zzso zzso can also be found zzso zzso zzso is also available at zzso
