zzso of population size with missing zzso is an important problem that is encountered in zzso assessment zzso Fitting a zzso model to the observed data by the method of maximum likelihood and zzso of the population size based on this fit is an approach that has been widely used for this zzso In practice, however, the zzso assumption is seldom zzso zzso (1988) has proposed a robust zzso for zzso data that works well in a wide class of zzso zzso for count zzso In the work presented here, we extend this zzso to clustered zzso The zzso requires fitting a zzso homogeneous zzso model by maximum likelihood and thereby using a zzso zzso of population zzso This was found to work well, when the data follow the hypothesized homogeneous zzso zzso However, when the true distribution deviates from the hypothesized model, the population size was found to be zzso In the search of a more robust zzso we focused on three models that use all clusters with exactly one case, those clusters with exactly two cases and those with exactly three cases to estimate the probability of the zzso and thereby use data collected on all the clusters in the zzso zzso of population zzso Loss in efficiency associated with gain in zzso was examined based on a simulation zzso As a zzso between gain in zzso and loss in efficiency, the model that uses data collected on clusters with at most three cases to estimate the probability of the zzso was found to be preferred in zzso In applications, we recommend obtaining estimates from all three models and making a choice considering the estimates from the three models, zzso and the loss in zzso
