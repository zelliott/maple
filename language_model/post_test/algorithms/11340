zzso tests for zzso equilibrium are widely used in genetic association zzso We evaluate the mid zzso unknown in the zzso literature, as an alternative for the standard zzso in the exact zzso 

The type 1 error rate and the power of the exact test are calculated for different sample sizes, significance levels, minor zzso counts and degrees of zzso from zzso Three different zzso are zzso the standard zzso zzso the doubled zzso zzso and the mid zzso zzso implications of using the mid zzso are discussed with zzso zzso and a data set on colon zzso 

The mid zzso is shown to have a type 1 error rate that is always closer to the nominal level, and to have better zzso zzso between the standard zzso and the mid zzso can be large for insignificant results, and are smaller for significant zzso The analysis of empirical databases shows that the mid zzso zzso more significant zzso and that the equilibrium zzso distribution is not zzso for both zzso 

The standard exact zzso is overly conservative, in particular for small minor zzso zzso The mid zzso ameliorates this problem by bringing the rejection rate closer to the nominal level, at the price of occasionally exceeding the nominal zzso
