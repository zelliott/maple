Previous studies have shown that zzso fluid zzso plays an important role in the load support mechanism of zzso cartilage under normal step zzso These studies have demonstrated that zzso fluid zzso decreases with time if the applied load is maintained zzso In the present study, a theoretical solution is obtained for another common loading of zzso cartilage, namely the contact of surfaces in rolling zzso zzso rolling of symmetrical frictionless zzso cartilage layers is analyzed under steady zzso The linear zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso zzso is used to describe the mechanical response of zzso zzso The solution of this contact problem reduces to simultaneously solving a set of four integral zzso akin to the dual integral problem of elastic zzso It is found that the solution is dependent on four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where V is the surface zzso b the cartilage zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso v zzso ratio, k the zzso R the radius of zzso surfaces, and W the applied load per unit cylinder zzso For zzso zzso 1, zzso fluid zzso is found to be zzso and all the applied load is supported by the solid zzso phase of the zzso thus causing significant cartilage zzso As zzso increases to a zzso level zzso approximately zzso zzso fluid zzso may support more than zzso of the total applied load, shielding the solid zzso from high effective stresses and reducing zzso strains and zzso The protective effect of zzso fluid zzso is observed to increase with increasing joint zzso zzso similarly, as the applied load zzso zzso b) is increased, a greater proportion of it is supported by the zzso In degenerative cartilage, zzso may drop by one or more orders of zzso primarily as a result of increased zzso Thus, the protective zzso effect of zzso fluid zzso may become less effective in diseased zzso possibly setting a zzso for further tissue zzso
