Video games typically generate virtual zzso objects by texture mapping an image onto a zzso zzso zzso The feeling of movement is then achieved by zzso simulating camera movement relative to the zzso zzso We have built customized scripts that adapt video game zzso software to texture mapping images of gene expression data onto zzso based zzso zzso This approach, known as zzso zzso associates two-dimensional zzso and zzso coordinates within images to the three dimensions zzso Y, and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso model zzso were built either from zzso data or de zzso extracted from zzso images, once again using video game zzso zzso This system was then used to build zzso models of 182 genes expressed in developing zzso zzso and to implement these in a zzso zzso Models can be viewed via simple Internet browsers and zzso zzso hardware acceleration via a zzso zzso Not only does this database display zzso data in a dynamic and zzso manner, the zzso mapping system also serves as a method to align different images to a common zzso an approach that may make zzso automated comparisons of gene expression patterns zzso Finally, video game systems also have elegant methods for handling movement, allowing zzso zzso to drive the animation of zzso With further development, these zzso techniques offer practical methods for generating virtual zzso that zzso zzso
