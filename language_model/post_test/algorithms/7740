The elements of an zzso are presented which predicts for some simple forms zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso aspects of the zzso of the human wrist when these are drawn in any arbitrary plane of free, three-dimensional zzso The zzso is based on theoretical considerations and experimental data and specifies in a unique way the angular motion at the shoulder and elbow zzso by utilizing a coordinate zzso which is only zzso between the chosen zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso A way to extend the use of this zzso to generate any arbitrary complex movement in all possible planes of space is also zzso
