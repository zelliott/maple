We demonstrated that the zzso zzso reception field is zzso to zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso imaging experiments at zzso zzso We compared maps of the reception field and the zzso of a saline phantom in magnitude and zzso First, we measured the image using an zzso spin echo zzso sequence with homogeneous zzso That image zzso to a map of the reception zzso Next, we rotated the zzso zzso with the sample zzso around the vertical axis to measure the map of the transmission field that corresponded to zzso in the original zzso The magnitude of the distribution fields of the reception field and zzso maps was almost zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso images in the original and zzso zzso we observed almost the same distribution in both phase zzso which indicated the zzso of the reception field to zzso
