The zzso apparatus is an important zzso defense system that may provide significant protection of the underlying zzso from gases and zzso zzso calculations were performed to determine the significance of zzso zzso transport and chemical reaction for zzso zzso and ozone zzso in rat zzso respiratory zzso zzso Less than zzso of absorbed zzso can be bound to zzso groups zzso zzso after 20 zzso of zzso Thus, at the zzso measured zzso flow rates in rats, approximately 1 zzso a fluid element of zzso could travel more than 2 zzso before binding zzso of absorbed zzso by which time the element would probably leave the nose (the site of toxic zzso In other calculations, zzso removed by chemical reaction from a volume of zzso exposed for longer times was determined to be less than zzso of that removed by zzso flow zzso Given the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and estimates of total zzso flow, however, as much as zzso of zzso zzso may be removed by total zzso zzso zzso zzso dissolved in zzso would react completely with zzso fatty acids in zzso zzso zzso zzso in which time the zzso could flow no more than approximately zzso zzso at the maximum reported flow rate of 30 zzso Even if a volume of zzso is zzso by net flow in 1 zzso the amount of zzso removed by flow would only be zzso of that removed by chemical zzso Finally, based on the zzso of zzso less than zzso zzso zzso of zzso material could be removed from the nose by zzso zzso These results indicate which zzso processes are significant in zzso zzso zzso
