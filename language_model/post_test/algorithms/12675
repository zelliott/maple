Marginal zzso procedures for zzso zzso and testing the fit of a zzso model for speed and accuracy on test items are zzso The model is a composition of two zzso models for zzso responses and response times along with zzso normal models for their item and person zzso It is shown how the item parameters can easily be estimated using zzso zzso To test the fit of the model, zzso zzso tests of the assumptions of zzso zzso of the item parameters zzso no differential item zzso the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were zzso zzso studies were used to show the feasibility of the zzso and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the zzso In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized zzso test of language zzso
