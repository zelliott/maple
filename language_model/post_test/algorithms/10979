Over the past 20 years, the bulk of the literature and texts published about zzso membrane zzso zzso has been written by physicians and zzso The consensus of this body of printed information would suggest, among other things, that zzso despite significant zzso in zzso technology, the standard zzso circuit has remained fundamentally unchanged since originally described in 1982, and zzso zzso are nearly absent from the staffing zzso at most zzso While these conclusions may be representative of the zzso life support zzso reporting centers, they may not be representative of the field as a zzso We hypothesized that the use of modern zzso equipment and the involvement of zzso in zzso patient care is largely underreported in previous zzso To study this hypothesis, we developed a standard survey instrument and zzso zzso teams from the hospitals listed on the American Society of zzso Technology zzso zzso All centers were contacted by phone and were asked questions regarding their zzso circuitry, and staffing zzso Data are reported as a percentage of zzso zzso is used as a method of mechanical support after zzso open heart surgery in zzso of centers zzso For zzso of the centers, a silicone membrane zzso is used exclusively, whereas zzso of the centers have used a hollow fiber zzso zzso and of that group, zzso use a zzso routinely for zzso zzso bypass zzso Roller pumps are used exclusively at zzso of the centers, whereas zzso pumps are used routinely in zzso and zzso have used zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso and daily zzso zzso and provide zzso bedside care zzso at the surveyed zzso These data suggest that previously published zzso zzso studies may significantly underestimate the contemporary application of modern technologies and the involvement of zzso
