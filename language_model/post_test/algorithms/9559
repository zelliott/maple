It has been shown previously that most columns are not zzso homogeneous but exhibit zzso zzso of the mobile phase flow zzso and the local zzso Both zzso are best zzso by zzso zzso with the zzso in the column center being maximum for most packed columns and minimum for monolithic zzso These zzso may be an important source of tailing of zzso zzso The zzso calculation of zzso zzso shows how peak tailing is related to the characteristics of these two zzso An approach is proposed that permits zzso of the true efficiency and of the degree of column zzso zzso by zzso this calculation and using the tailing profiles of the zzso zzso that are zzso zzso This method was applied in two concrete cases of tailing peak profiles that had been previously reported and were analyzed by applying this new inverse zzso The results obtained prove its zzso and demonstrate that this zzso method is effective for zzso the true column efficiency from experimental tailing zzso
