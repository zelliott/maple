The development of models and methods for cure rate zzso has recently zzso into an important zzso of survival zzso Much of the literature focuses on the standard mixture zzso Recently, zzso models have been zzso We focus on several models based on first passage times for Wiener zzso Whitmore and others have studied these models in a variety of zzso Lee and Whitmore zzso zzso zzso 2006) give a comprehensive review of a variety of first hitting time models and briefly discuss their potential as cure rate zzso In this paper, we study the Wiener process with negative drift as a possible cure rate model but the resulting defective inverse zzso model is found to provide a poor fit in some zzso Several possible modifications are then suggested, which improve the defective inverse zzso These modifications include: the inverse zzso cure rate mixture zzso a mixture of two inverse zzso zzso incorporation of zzso in the drift zzso and the addition of a second absorbing barrier to the Wiener process, representing an immunity zzso This class of zzso models is a useful alternative to the standard model and provides an improved fit compared to the standard model when applied to many of the zzso that we have zzso Implementation of this class of models is facilitated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates for each of these zzso zzso are given and the proposed models are applied to both real and simulated data, where they perform zzso
