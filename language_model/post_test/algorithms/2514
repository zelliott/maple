The spectrum dose index zzso method was tested for use with data from plastic zzso detectors by irradiating a typical portal detector system using different gamma sources and natural zzso zzso were compared with exposure rates simultaneously measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that a modified zzso zzso could be used to calculate exposure rates for these detectors despite the lack of zzso in plastic zzso zzso
