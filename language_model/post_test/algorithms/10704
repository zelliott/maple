zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to widen traditional white light zzso zzso possibilities of early diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in high risk zzso The authors report their study on zzso with the aim of establishing its role in the early diagnosis of zzso zzso and its positive zzso value zzso compared and associated to zzso 

From May 2002 to May 2004 we performed zzso and zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso 36 zzso mean age zzso years zzso zzso zzso who were divided into 2 main groups zzso zzso patients at risk for zzso zzso zzso group B: patients to be operated on for zzso zzso zzso In total, 237 zzso were performed (101 in group A, 136 in group zzso and 77 zzso for pathological zzso 

The 2 tools zzso and zzso were zzso in 156 zzso and zzso in 81 zzso zzso Considering the zzso performed, we obtained a zzso of zzso for zzso visible with zzso of zzso for those visible with AFB, of 38% for those visible with the association of zzso In group A, in 56 patients of the follow-up zzso we found 2 zzso areas and 1 zzso in zzso In group B there was a zzso extension of the zzso area visible with zzso and with zzso in 30 cases which was positive in 18 of them at zzso zzso 

In our experience, zzso has revealed to be a valid tool for both early diagnosis of zzso zzso or a second primary lung zzso in patients in follow-up after zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso margins in patients candidate to zzso More studies are needed to widen its indications in the early diagnosis in high risk groups, to improve its zzso and zzso its learning curve in order to establish the procedural guide zzso
