In this article, we consider methods for zzso zzso within the context of brain imaging zzso In such studies, the complexity of the resulting data often zzso the use of sophisticated statistical zzso however, the large size of these data can pose significant challenges for model zzso We focus specifically on the zzso inverse problem in zzso which involves zzso the neural activity within the brain from zzso data measured across the zzso The relationship between the observed zzso data and the zzso neural activity can be represented through an zzso dynamic linear model, and we discuss zzso zzso for such models, where parameters represent the unknown neural sources of zzso We review the inverse problem and discuss zzso approximations for fitting zzso models in this zzso While zzso methods have been widely adopted for model fitting in zzso they have received very little attention in the statistical literature, where zzso chain zzso Carlo is often zzso We derive zzso approximations for fitting two models: a simple distributed source model and a more complex zzso mixture zzso We compare the approximations to zzso chain zzso Carlo using both synthetic data as well as through the analysis of a real zzso zzso examining the evoked response related to face zzso The zzso advantages of the zzso method are demonstrated and the accuracy associated with the resulting approximations are zzso
