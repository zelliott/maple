zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and T cell receptors zzso are generated from zzso V gene segments zzso At present, such zzso have been zzso only within the zzso of a few zzso We have developed a zzso tool that zzso the task of identifying functional zzso from zzso zzso zzso recognition is accomplished by recognizing key zzso signatures, such as zzso signal zzso size of the zzso region, and position of zzso acid motifs within the translated zzso This zzso also zzso extracted zzso into either zzso or zzso zzso We describe the zzso of the zzso and validate its accuracy by comparing zzso identified from the human and mouse zzso with known zzso zzso documented and available in public zzso The advantages and utility of the zzso are illustrated by using it to identify functional zzso in the rat zzso where zzso zzso is still zzso This allowed us to perform a comparative zzso zzso analysis based on zzso that supports the hypothesis that distinct evolutionary pressures shape the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our program, together with a user zzso zzso is available as zzso software, downloadable at zzso
