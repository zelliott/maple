To evaluate an zzso with zzso prediction capacity and continuous adaptation of patient zzso model zzso control zzso zzso control blood zzso concentration during zzso conditions in patients with Type 1 zzso In the subcutaneous zzso route within a closed loop zzso 

zzso experiments were performed in six zzso Over 8 h the zzso zzso was used to control zzso with zzso insulin administration and two different zzso monitoring zzso first, the zzso was provided with intravenous zzso zzso values for insulin dosage calculation directly zzso zzso Then, in the second experiment, zzso zzso values were fed to the zzso with a delay of 30 zzso to simulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In both experiments plasma zzso insulin zzso and serum insulin levels were zzso 

zzso concentration was brought from zzso to zzso and kept in the zzso range zzso zzso with both routes in all zzso Mean zzso concentration reached the threshold of 7 zzso approximately 2 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso hours after the start of zzso control with the zzso During the last 2 h of automated zzso control, mean zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso route, zzso zzso zzso insulin doses, and serum insulin levels did not differ significantly between routes zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is suitable for zzso control during zzso within an zzso artificial zzso in the subcutaneous route Type 1 diabetic zzso
