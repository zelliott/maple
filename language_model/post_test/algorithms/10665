The purpose of this study was to develop a method of kinetic analysis for picture zzso and communication system zzso management and zzso diagnostic application in dynamic chest zzso The main zzso technique used in this study was a new zzso that converts dynamic zzso into a zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso technique for kinetic information that uses the zzso transformation and the direction zzso in optical zzso The image made by the new zzso was defined as a zzso zzso and, by analysis using the kinetic map, a patient zzso system and zzso detection system were zzso By analysis that used an artificial neural network of certain feature zzso as kinetic map zzso the zzso system obtained good identification zzso zzso zzso processing between a zzso map with simulated zzso and zzso map detected the region of zzso as the simulated zzso It is expected that our method of analysis will be useful as a screening examination for risk management and zzso diagnostic application in dynamic chest zzso
