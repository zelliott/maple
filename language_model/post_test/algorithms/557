The main goal of this paper is to investigate a cure rate model that zzso some well-known proposals found in the zzso In our work the number of competing causes of the event of interest follows the negative zzso zzso The model is zzso zzso through the cured zzso which is then linked to zzso by means of the zzso zzso We explore the use of zzso chain zzso Carlo methods to develop a zzso analysis in the proposed zzso The procedure is illustrated with a zzso zzso
