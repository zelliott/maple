The zzso rapid zzso zzso sequence is well known and widely used for zzso structural brain zzso Here we present a new version, termed zzso spiral acquisition zzso zzso that employs zzso zzso zzso zzso to take advantage of the zzso nature of the zzso Resolution loss caused by zzso function zzso blurring is zzso by the use of variable flip angle zzso zzso zzso zzso The pulse train is calculated by means of an accurate new signal evolution theory that is derived from the extended phase graph zzso zzso Phantom results show excellent agreement between theory and experiment for substances with relaxation times similar to those of human brain zzso Both phantom and in zzso results show a strong enhancement of zzso and zzso compared to the standard zzso in high-resolution zzso The benefits for brain tissue zzso using images obtained with zzso are zzso
