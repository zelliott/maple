To understand the effects of dynamic shape distortion of red blood cells zzso as it develops under zzso conditions on the standard zzso and zzso methods of zzso pulmonary zzso capacity, we zzso the zzso of CO across a two-dimensional geometric zzso model containing a variable number of equally spaced zzso zzso are circular or parachute zzso with the same perimeter zzso Total CO zzso capacity zzso and membrane zzso capacity zzso were calculated by a finite element zzso zzso calculated at two levels of zzso zzso were used to estimate zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The same zzso model was subjected to zzso analysis by the random linear intercept method to obtain zzso estimates of zzso zzso show that shape distortion of zzso significantly reduces zzso zzso gas zzso Shape distortion exaggerates the conceptual errors inherent in the zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso errors are exaggerated at a high zzso zzso Shape distortion also introduces additional error in zzso estimates of zzso caused by a biased sampling distribution of random linear zzso errors are exaggerated at a low zzso zzso
