Using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso manufacturing method, which we have recently invented, we evaluated the possibility of its application to zzso zzso The manufacturing method for zzso is different from conventional methods in that zzso zzso can be made with only one zzso One of the major advantages of zzso is that we can expect to produce zzso which always contain the core exactly in the center of the whole zzso This characteristic means that the thickness of outer layer is constantly uniform, which is difficult to achieve with the conventional zzso zzso The effects of different outer layer thicknesses and various zzso pressures were examined using zzso to evaluate zzso zzso to zzso zzso We proved that the zzso can be adjusted only by changing the thickness of the outer layer without any arrangement of its ingredients, which is quite different from the conventional zzso Further, the zzso of each zzso prepared in the zzso zzso zzso pressure range was almost the same, indicating the zzso of zzso under these zzso pressures does not zzso The release rate of the drug zzso from the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso outer layer thicknesses was almost constant independent of zzso zzso On the other hand, the release rate of the zzso with a zzso zzso outer layer thickness was delayed compared to that of other zzso That is, in the zzso with zzso zzso outer layer zzso the release rate declined since its outer layer thickness was sufficient to form a zzso In conclusion, zzso could be a platform for zzso zzso which do not zzso the conventional method used for zzso zzso
