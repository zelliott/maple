We present a new application for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso method in which the zzso partition functions are introduced into the calculation of Transition State zzso zzso rate zzso In this way, an explicit treatment of zzso zzso is included in the zzso calculations and the magnitude of these effects can be zzso The new method is tested on the zzso + H hydrogen abstraction reaction and concerted hydrogen transfer in the zzso acid zzso for which we have developed zzso potential energy zzso For the zzso + H reaction the rate zzso are zzso at room temperature on including a treatment of zzso zzso while the effects are found to be much smaller for the hydrogen transfer reaction in the zzso acid zzso
