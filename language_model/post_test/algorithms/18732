One of the major challenges of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data analysis is to develop simple and reliable methods to correlate brain regions with zzso In this paper, we employ a zzso zzso method, called zzso fluctuation analysis zzso to identify brain activity from zzso zzso We perform three tasks: zzso zzso noise level from experimental zzso zzso zzso Assessing a signal model recently introduced by zzso et zzso and zzso Evaluating the effectiveness of zzso for discriminating brain zzso from zzso By computing the receiver operating characteristic zzso curves, we find that the zzso curve for experimental data is similar to the curve for simulated data with similar zzso ratio zzso This suggests that the proposed zzso for zzso noise level is very effective and that zzso model fits our experimental data very zzso The brain zzso maps for experimental data derived by zzso are similar to maps derived by zzso using a widely used software, zzso Considering that zzso explicitly uses the information about the experimental paradigm to extract the zzso patterns whereas zzso does not, it remains to be seen whether one can effectively integrate the two methods to improve accuracy for detecting brain areas related to functional zzso
