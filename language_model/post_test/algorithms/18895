zzso in many fields of science and engineering yield data in the form of time zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods are used widely to study the spectral characteristics of these time series zzso Here, we extend the framework of zzso spectral methods to include the zzso of zzso causality zzso for assessing directional zzso We illustrate the utility of the proposed methods using synthetic data from network models consisting of interacting zzso zzso
