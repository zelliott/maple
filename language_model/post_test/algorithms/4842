zzso To investigate if there exist any discrepancies between the values of vital signs charted by nurses and those recorded by bedside monitors for a group of patients admitted for zzso zzso zzso To investigate possible interpretations of discrepancies by exploring information in the alarm messages and the raw zzso data from zzso 

Each charted vital sign value was paired with a corresponding value from data collected by an archival program of bedside monitors such that the automatically zzso data preceded the charted data and had minimal time lag to the charted zzso Next, the absolute differences between the paired values were taken as the zzso between charted and zzso zzso zzso alarm messages were searched for technical alarms of zzso failure zzso Additionally, zzso zzso data around the place of large zzso were analyzed using signal zzso zzso zzso for zzso the quality of recorded zzso 

About zzso pairs of zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso pairs of zzso were zzso Seven and a half percent of zzso blood pressure pairs had a zzso greater than 20 zzso and less than one percent of the zzso pairs had a zzso greater than zzso We could not find any technical alarms from the monitors that could explain the large zzso However, zzso calculated for the zzso associated with this group of cases was significantly larger than the zzso values calculated for the control zzso data of the same patients with small zzso 

zzso vital signs reflect in large the raw data as reported by bedside zzso Poor signal quality could partially explain the existence of cases of large zzso
