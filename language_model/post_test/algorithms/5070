Acute intermittent zzso zzso represents the most frequent type of acute zzso The underlying cause is a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Diagnosis of zzso is crucial for preventing zzso acute attacks among both symptomatic and zzso zzso We established the diagnostic zzso high-resolution melting zzso for diagnosing zzso Of 13 zzso amplified by zzso in the presence of the zzso Plus zzso 4 showed zzso zzso The ability of the zzso method to detect DNA variations in the zzso gene was tested on a DNA sample with 10 known zzso by a curve shape scan using the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA zzso samples from 97 individuals with suspected zzso zzso were zzso All possible zzso from each of four zzso zzso were zzso Each of the 10 zzso tested had an altered melting profile compared with the melting profile of the zzso zzso the group of subjects with suspected zzso zzso revealed nine different DNA variations, four of which were zzso In conclusion, zzso is a fast, cost-effective zzso method for detecting DNA variations in the zzso zzso zzso the screening can be easily applied to a zzso family if zzso or rare dual zzso is zzso
