Since the Kalman filter and zzso Carlo techniques, much theoretical work has been put into the development of signal zzso zzso Among recent developments taking place in zzso are Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso Kalman zzso While there are exciting prospects to use these tools for Dynamic zzso Modeling and other analyses of networks, there has been comparatively little work to validate the zzso on controlled experimental zzso In this work, the latest evolution of these tools, the zzso zzso Kalman zzso zzso is tested for its effectiveness on zzso zzso zzso zzso intrinsic optical imaging and zzso zzso of zzso rats are used in combination with zzso zzso The zzso zzso balloon model is then zzso with the zzso zzso to obtain the estimated zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The estimated zzso zzso are compared to the stimulation protocol and a sensitivity and specificity analysis is carried zzso zzso succeeds in recovering most of the zzso Next, the estimated zzso are compared to actual measures of zzso activity: local field zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso Good sensitivity of the technique is obtained with both zzso and zzso over the whole recordings, with the area of the zzso zzso favoring zzso A weak correlation between zzso estimated zzso and zzso is found outside stimulation zzso significant at one standard zzso Finally, the accuracy of state reconstructions is studied and zzso reconstructed states are highly zzso with measured zzso
