Early detection is a major goal in the management of zzso zzso Besides clinical assessment many zzso technologies such as zzso digital zzso and in zzso laser scanner zzso are used as additional zzso zzso we tested a system to assess zzso zzso as a tool for early melanoma zzso 

zzso zzso flow zzso and mole zzso zzso score zzso were applied to zzso verified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Mean zzso and MA scores were significantly increased in melanoma compared to zzso However, applying an zzso determined threshold of zzso zzso increase only zzso of the zzso fulfilled the criterion of zzso whereas with the mole zzso score zzso of the zzso fulfilled the criterion of zzso 

zzso zzso imaging is a highly sensitive technology to assess skin and skin tumor zzso in zzso Although mean zzso is higher in zzso compared to zzso the high numbers of false negative results hamper the use of this technology for early melanoma zzso
