One of the most challenging problems in modern zzso is detailed characterization of zzso zzso spatial and zzso zzso patterns is an important component of this zzso These zzso signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as zzso zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso which manifest themselves in the same zzso zzso Here, we develop a novel zzso image zzso method zzso for maximizing the zzso within the space of zzso maps and provide the zzso equations necessary for this zzso We then turn to a careful evaluation of our zzso Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical zzso to contrast zzso performance with a related elastic method and with the standard zzso zzso of zzso Demons zzso The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is zzso We then report the correlation of volumes gained by zzso cortical zzso of zzso and control subjects with those gained by the manual zzso This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, zzso volume zzso are the most strongly correlated with volume zzso gained by expert zzso This study indicates that zzso with zzso is a reliable method for zzso and making anatomical zzso in zzso zzso of patients and zzso elderly zzso
