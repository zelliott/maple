zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is used as zzso staging for patients with newly diagnosed zzso cell lung cancer zzso Our purpose was to review the accuracy of zzso to predict adrenal zzso zzso explain the causes for zzso zzso and provide a diagnostic zzso 

Two patients with zzso discovered lung masses were found to have zzso adrenal activity by zzso with zzso standard zzso value zzso of zzso and zzso A zzso search was performed on the topic of zzso adrenal zzso zzso and zzso Literature was reviewed with regard to diagnosis, zzso zzso and alternative imaging or diagnostic zzso 

Both patients underwent zzso zzso zzso and were found to have zzso zzso without evidence of adrenal zzso A total of seven articles containing zzso patients were identified as having pertinent zzso information for zzso patients with adrenal zzso zzso and specificity of zzso for distant zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, but only zzso zzso of these patients had zzso confirmed adrenal zzso Based on this, a diagnostic zzso was created to aid in decision zzso 

Although zzso has high sensitivity and specificity for adrenal zzso in the setting of zzso adrenal biopsy or other secondary imaging should be considered to confirm the zzso zzso in lieu of biopsy may have both diagnostic and therapeutic benefit in cases where the adrenal mass is zzso with high PET maximum zzso zzso and zzso ratios zzso where zzso CT or chemical shift zzso is positive, or where zzso biopsy is deemed too difficult or zzso
