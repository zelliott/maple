The imaging properties of zzso designed zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by means of zzso Carlo zzso The evaluation was done with respect to total system spatial resolution and the overall image noise distribution in zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso with PC zzso assessed by the ratio of the zzso at zzso in the zzso and zzso directions, was reduced by about zzso as compared with a conventional zzso zzso for sources located 200 zzso away from the zzso of zzso Furthermore, the image noise distribution along the object radius became more uniform when the curved zzso was zzso The maximum increase in noise due to use of the curved zzso was about zzso close to the edge of the zzso where the hole length was about 3 times zzso We also showed with zzso Carlo simulations that the spatial resolution of the lateral zzso when using the curved zzso was significantly improved due to improved zzso zzso
