The property of a zzso that most reliably determines the magnitude of the zzso effect that it will experience is the number of zzso bonds it contains not the accessible surface area of its zzso zzso This conclusion follows from an examination of the standard free energies of transfer of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from water to zzso When the standard free energies of transfer for zzso in these different classes are plotted as a function of the number of zzso bonds they contain, all of the data fall upon the same zzso These standard free energies of transfer are also directly zzso to the number of zzso bonds the zzso zzso When the same standard free energies of transfer are plotted as a function of the accessible surface areas of the zzso the data do not fall upon the same line nor are the standard free energies of transfer directly zzso to the accessible surface zzso An examination of the standard free energies of transfer for the different classes of zzso from the gas phase to water and from the gas phase to zzso reinforces the conclusion that the number of zzso bonds in a zzso rather than its accessible surface area is the basis of the zzso zzso zzso estimates of the contribution of different functional groups to the zzso effect providing the free energy of folding of a zzso of protein or providing the free energy of zzso for the association of two proteins or the association of a zzso with a protein should be made by counting the number of zzso bonds excluded from water rather than computing the accessible surface areas excluded from zzso
