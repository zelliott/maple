As a severe chronic zzso disease and zzso disorder, type 1 diabetes zzso affects millions of people zzso Recent advances in zzso zzso have provided a great opportunity for further treating zzso with a high degree of zzso It is reported that zzso class II zzso in the non-obese diabetic zzso mouse and human zzso are strongly linked to zzso to zzso Thus, the identification of new zzso and zzso zzso would be of great help to further experimental and biomedical manipulation zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso software package was developed for the prediction of zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso identified zzso as the training data sets, a previously developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was adopted and zzso By extensive evaluation and comparison, the zzso performance was found to be much better than other tools of this zzso With this powerful zzso we predicted a number of potentially new zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we designed a zzso zzso database zzso for all of the zzso identified and predicted zzso zzso Taken together, this zzso prediction result and analysis provides a starting point for further experimental considerations, and zzso is demonstrated to be a useful tool for generating starting information for zzso The zzso is freely accessible for academic researchers at: zzso
