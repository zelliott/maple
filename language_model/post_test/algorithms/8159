We introduce a replica exchange zzso zzso method in which attempted zzso swaps are generated using zzso work zzso By effectively increasing phase space zzso this approach zzso the need for many zzso We illustrate our method by using a model system and show that it is able to achieve the zzso efficiency of ordinary replica exchange, using fewer zzso
