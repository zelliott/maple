A novel flow through zzso diffusion cell for assessing the zzso of compounds across the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was mounted between two chambers with flow through capacity in both the donor and zzso zzso The zzso of caffeine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined over 4 h and flux values were compared to those obtained using a modified zzso chamber zzso No significant differences in the flux of each probe compound were observed using either the zzso or the novel zzso zzso The design of the zzso cell allowed for monitoring appearance of zzso solution within the donor chamber during the initial zzso period, allowing for visual inspection of tissue zzso These zzso studies demonstrate that this zzso cell is a suitable alternative model for assessing drug zzso across the zzso zzso without the limitations associated with the zzso zzso This novel model was then zzso to determine whether zzso zzso zzso could zzso the zzso zzso at zzso expected in the oral cavity following zzso zzso studies demonstrated that SX permeates the zzso zzso via passive diffusion and that oral zzso zzso may contribute significantly to the overall systemic exposure of zzso zzso
