Clinical application of zzso evoked zzso zzso in zzso zzso monitoring still requires anywhere between 200 to 500 trials, which is excessive and introduces a delay during zzso In this study, the analysis was performed on the data recorded in 20 patients undergoing surgery during which the zzso zzso nerve was zzso and zzso response was recorded from zzso The first 10 trials were analyzed using an zzso decomposition technique, and a signal extraction zzso eliminated the common components of the signals not contributing to the zzso A unique Walsh transform operation was then used to identify the position of the zzso event within the clinical requirements of zzso time in zzso zzso and 50% zzso zzso zzso using only 10 zzso The zzso also shows consistency in the results in monitoring zzso in up to zzso surgical procedures even under this significantly reduced number of zzso
