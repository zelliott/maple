Time series are zzso converted into zzso via the horizontal visibility zzso algorithm, which zzso interest in its capability for capturing the nature of different classes of series in a network zzso We have recently shown zzso zzso et zzso PLoS ONE 6, 9 zzso that zzso systems can be studied from a novel perspective via the use of this zzso Specifically, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso that characterize zzso maps transform into families of zzso that turn out to be independent of map zzso or other zzso Here, we provide an in depth description of the zzso treatment of the zzso scenario, together with zzso zzso that relate to the degree zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso associated to the zzso zzso and their zzso zzso We describe how the zzso families of zzso can be framed into a zzso group scheme in which zzso zzso reveal their zzso zzso These fixed points are then zzso from an zzso zzso process defined for the graph sets, confirming a suggested connection between zzso group and zzso zzso Finally, we provide zzso and zzso results for the graph zzso and show that it zzso the zzso zzso of the map independently of its zzso
