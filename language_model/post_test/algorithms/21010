Insufficient vision information, such as zzso low zzso and a small field of view, represent important issues in zzso and zzso We propose an active optical system to solve problems related to insufficient vision information through the integration of zzso and zzso zzso The proposed system zzso a zzso system and a scanning mirror system to supply a compact flexible zzso The zzso of the imaging system is analyzed based on a simplified model initially to investigate the zzso and identify the zzso zzso A more rigorous analysis of zzso of the system is then made based on the ray tracing zzso The simulation results based on the preliminary design are provided for investigating the zzso and demonstrating the capability of the system in imaging with variable zzso
