One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find groups of zzso genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample zzso In this regard, a new zzso algorithm, termed as zzso supervised attribute zzso zzso is proposed to find such groups of zzso The proposed zzso is based on the theory of zzso sets, which directly incorporates the information of sample categories into the gene zzso zzso A new quantitative measure is introduced based on zzso sets that incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity among zzso The proposed zzso is based on measuring the similarity between genes using the new quantitative measure, zzso zzso among the genes is zzso The clusters are refined zzso based on sample zzso The effectiveness of the proposed zzso algorithm, along with a comparison with existing supervised and zzso gene selection and zzso zzso is demonstrated on six cancer and two arthritis data sets based on the class zzso index and zzso accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso neighbor rule, and the support zzso zzso
