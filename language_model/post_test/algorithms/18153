A major challenge, and thus opportunity, in the field of zzso interaction and specifically zzso engineering is designing effective user zzso for emerging technologies that have no established design guidelines or interaction metaphors or introduce completely new ways for users to perceive and interact with technology and the world around zzso Clearly, zzso reality is one such emerging zzso We propose a zzso engineering approach that employs zzso studies to inform design, by zzso inserting a series of zzso studies into a traditional zzso engineering zzso to better inform initial user interface zzso We present an zzso zzso study conducted to gain insight into how users perceive text in outdoor zzso reality settings and to derive implications for design in outdoor zzso zzso We also describe lessons learned from our experiences conducting zzso studies as part of the design zzso
