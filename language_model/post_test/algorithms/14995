Changes in zzso space zzso diffusion parameters in zzso tissue around a unilateral cortical stab wound were determined from zzso profiles of zzso zzso using zzso zzso Three diffusion zzso volume fraction alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso total tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where D is the free and zzso is the apparent diffusion zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso determined at 3, 7, 21, and 35 days zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso Following diffusion experiments, tissue sections were zzso for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the area zzso zzso around the zzso alpha was increased at 3, 7, and 21 zzso by about zzso but returned to control values at 35 zzso zzso was increased at all four zzso reaching a maximum at 7 zzso zzso was lower than in the zzso zzso at 7, 21, and 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso from the wound revealed only an increase in zzso at 7 zzso The time course of changes in zzso diffusion parameters closely correlated with increased zzso for zzso and zzso Our results show that zzso significantly changes the diffusion properties of nervous zzso making it less zzso Both zzso zzso processes and an enhanced formation of some zzso zzso molecules could zzso through changes in the diffusion of molecules in the zzso zzso communication, zzso between zzso zzso transmission, and zzso zzso
