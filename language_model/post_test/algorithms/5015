zzso zzso recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso are corrupted by large repetitive artifacts generated by the switched MR zzso Several methods have been proposed to remove these zzso by zzso of averaged artifact templates from the ongoing zzso Here, we present a modification of this approach which accounts for head movements to improve the extracted zzso Using the zzso analysis package statistical zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso the head displacement is determined at each half zzso The basic idea is to apply a moving average zzso for template extraction but to include only epochs that were obtained at the same head position as the zzso to be zzso This approach was derived from phantom zzso zzso demonstrating substantial variations of the zzso zzso in response to movements of the phantom in the zzso zzso To further reduce the residual noise, we applied a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso samples in a strict zzso manner to the zzso zzso Finally, we propose a new zzso to suppress residual artifacts such as those occasionally observed in case of brief strong movements, which are not reflected by the movement indicator because of the limited zzso resolution of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso recordings of six subjects these measures combined reduce the residual zzso activity zzso in terms of the spectral power at the zzso repetition rate and its zzso by roughly 20 to 50% zzso on the amount of zzso predominantly in zzso beyond 30 zzso
