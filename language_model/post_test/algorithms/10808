The probability to predict correctly a protein structure can be enhanced through introduction of spatial constraints - either from zzso experiments or from zzso zzso However, the additional constraints lead often to new local energy zzso and worse sampling efficiency in zzso In this work, we present a new parallel zzso zzso that zzso the energy barriers resulting from spatial constraints and therefore yields to an enhanced sampling in structure prediction zzso
