A new zzso zzso model was developed to estimate zzso toxicity (target zzso severity, zzso of zzso industrial zzso where the chemical structures and zzso properties are only zzso Thus, a zzso zzso model, which consists of blood, liver, kidney zzso were zzso found as major zzso zzso muscle and fat zzso was established to simulate the chemical zzso in zzso with zzso parameters by means of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso ratio, zzso extraction ratio of metabolism and zzso clearance were calculated by using separately established zzso zzso zzso zzso The developed zzso model was then applied to simulations of 43 zzso industrial zzso The chemical zzso in zzso after single oral administration were zzso and their maximum zzso zzso and area under the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Fast zzso zzso zzso was newly applied for the purpose of simulation of zzso repeated dose zzso zzso zzso of 28 days repeated dose were, however, found to be the same as those of simple repetitions of a single administration per day because of the short zzso of zzso industrial zzso A comparison of zzso toxicity data with zzso and zzso in a single dose scenario suggested that the zzso with relatively high zzso of tested chemical substances were the most sensitive targets within a zzso Chemical zzso in liver, for instance, were correlated with the severity of zzso among the zzso It was also suggested that to improve and widen the present approach, data of zzso and zzso of zzso industrial chemicals to zzso zzso zzso should be incorporated into the zzso
