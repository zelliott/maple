zzso profiling has recently generated the hope to gain new insights into breast cancer biology and thereby improve the performance of current zzso zzso However, it also poses several serious challenges to classical data analysis techniques related to the characteristics of resulting data, mainly high zzso and low zzso zzso Despite the tremendous research work performed to handle the first challenge in the feature selection zzso very little attention has been directed to address the second zzso We propose in this article to address both issues simultaneously based on symbolic data analysis capabilities in order to derive more accurate genetic zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso data representation is employed to model various uncertainties in zzso zzso A recent feature selection zzso that handles symbolic zzso data is used then to derive a genetic zzso The zzso value of the derived signature is then assessed by following a rigorous experimental setup and compared with existing zzso approaches in terms of zzso performance and estimated survival zzso It is shown that the derived signature zzso performs significantly better than other zzso models, including the zzso signature, zzso zzso and National Institutes of Health zzso
