zzso investigators are currently able to acquire and analyze zzso and anatomical data from three-dimensional structures in the zzso Often, multiple kinds of data can be recorded zzso The usefulness of this information, either for exploratory viewing or for presentation to others, is limited by the lack of techniques to display it in zzso accessible zzso Unfortunately, the complexity of scientific zzso techniques and the zzso of commercial packages deter investigators from using sophisticated zzso methods that could provide them added insight into the mechanisms of the phenomena under zzso Also, the sheer volume of such data is a zzso zzso computing resources are often required for storage and processing, in addition to zzso This chapter describes a novel, zzso interface that allows scientists with basic programming skills to zzso and render zzso zzso data with a modest investment in software zzso The interface zzso data exploration by enabling zzso with various zzso to zzso zzso and color from zzso zzso The value of the system is demonstrated using data from cardiac mapping studies, in which multiple zzso are placed in an on the heart to measure the cardiac electrical activity intrinsic to the heart and its response to external zzso
