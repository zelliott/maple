The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has greatly promoted the field of zzso which studies genetic material recovered directly from an zzso zzso of zzso composition of a zzso sample is essential for understanding the structure of the microbial zzso Multiple zzso contained in a zzso sample can be identified and zzso through zzso searches of sequence reads with known sequences zzso in reference zzso Traditionally, reads with multiple zzso hits are assigned to zzso or high ranks of the zzso tree, thereby zzso on accurate estimates of relative abundance of multiple zzso present in a zzso Instead of assigning reads one by one to the zzso tree as many existing methods do, we propose a statistical framework to model the identified candidate zzso to which sequence reads have zzso After obtaining the estimated proportion of reads generated by each zzso sequence reads are assigned to the candidate zzso and the zzso tree based on the estimated probability by taking into account both sequence alignment scores and estimated zzso zzso The proposed method is zzso tested on both simulated zzso and two real zzso It assigns reads to the low zzso ranks very zzso Our statistical approach of zzso assignment of zzso reads, zzso is implemented in R and available at zzso
