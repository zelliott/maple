zzso zzso methods, such as the zzso factor zzso the phase zzso factor zzso or the sign zzso factor zzso have been applied to suppress side and/or grating zzso and clutter in ultrasound zzso These zzso weighting factors can be implemented effectively with low zzso complexity to improve image contrast zzso However, because of low zzso the resulting images may suffer from deficiencies, including reduced overall image zzso increased zzso zzso zzso artifacts surrounding zzso objects, and underestimated zzso of point zzso To overcome these artifacts, a new zzso smoothing procedure is introduced to the zzso zzso It results in a smoothed zzso factor which measures the signal zzso among the zzso of the divided zzso over the duration of a transmit zzso In addition, the procedure is extended to the zzso using the sign bits of the received zzso zzso and real experimental data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can improve the zzso of the zzso and zzso with reduced zzso zzso and significant removal of zzso artifacts, while preserving the ability to suppress zzso zzso image contrast can be zzso especially for zzso zzso
