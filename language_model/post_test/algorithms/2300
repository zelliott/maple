The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate, zzso zzso procedure for registering zzso studies from different zzso in a short amount of time and with minimal operator zzso 

CT and PET studies were acquired from six zzso The zzso surfaces in both image sets were determined by zzso based on 50% of the maximum zzso value in the zzso These surfaces were converted into three-dimensional volumes and used to register the CT and PET studies in three dimensions using a sum of least squares fitting zzso The registered PET study was then displayed in a hot metal scale zzso on top of the gray scale CT zzso The accuracy of the fit was evaluated through a phantom study and preliminary clinical zzso 

A phantom study was performed to determine the limits of this zzso The accuracy was determined to be less than zzso zzso in the zzso and y direction and 3 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso clinical evaluation was also performed with encouraging zzso 

This technique accurately registers PET and CT images of the zzso zzso without the need for external zzso markers or other a zzso zzso
