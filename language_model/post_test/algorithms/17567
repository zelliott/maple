We report an zzso structural motif discovery algorithm, zzso which is able to detect global and local motifs in a database of proteins without the need for multiple structure or sequence alignments and without relying on prior zzso of proteins into zzso zzso which are discovered from zzso zzso of a query structure to a database of targets, are described zzso in terms of the conservation of each secondary structure zzso position and are used to improve detection of distant structural zzso During each iteration of the algorithm, the motif is defined from the current set of zzso and is used both to recruit additional zzso structures and to discard false zzso zzso thus achieves high specificity and sensitivity by distinguishing between zzso and zzso structures by the regions of the query to which they zzso We find that when two proteins of the same fold are zzso highly zzso secondary structure elements in one protein tend to align to highly zzso elements in the second zzso suggesting that zzso consistently identifies the same motif in members of a zzso zzso alignments are performed by an improved zzso algorithm, zzso 2, which detects distant structural relationships by placing increased emphasis on the alignment of secondary structure zzso zzso 2 obeys several properties essential in automated analysis of protein zzso It is zzso its alignments of secondary structure elements are zzso its alignments of zzso display a high degree of zzso and its scoring system is zzso found to behave as a zzso
