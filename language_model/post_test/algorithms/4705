We formalize the notion of style context, which accounts for the increased accuracy of the field zzso reported in this journal zzso We argue that style context forms the basis of all zzso field zzso zzso We distinguish between zzso style, which zzso most zzso zzso and zzso style, which is a manifestation of zzso dependence between the features of the patterns of a zzso We show how zzso zzso can be zzso either for field error zzso for short fields like zip zzso or for zzso error (for long fields, like business zzso We derive bounds on the reduction of error rate with field length and show that the error rate of the optimal zzso field zzso zzso zzso to the error rate of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
