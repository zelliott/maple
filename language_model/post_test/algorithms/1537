In this article, we present an overview of simulation strategies in the context of zzso zzso where zzso signaling plays an important zzso The presentation follows the spatial and zzso scales involved and represented by each zzso As an exemplary cell type, we will mainly cite work done on zzso muscle cells, zzso skeletal and cardiac zzso For these cells, a wealth of zzso zzso and zzso data is at zzso Moreover, these cells also express ubiquitous signaling pathways as they are found in many other cell types and thus, the zzso of the methods and results presented here is zzso models considered comprise the basic calcium signaling machinery as found in most excitable cell types including zzso zzso zzso and stationary buffer systems, and calcium regulated calcium release zzso zzso strategies can be differentiated in zzso and deterministic zzso Historically, deterministic approaches based on the zzso reaction rate equations were the first models zzso As experimental methods zzso highly localized zzso signaling events occurring in zzso volumes, zzso methods were increasingly zzso However, detailed simulations of single zzso zzso are rarely performed as the zzso cost implied is too zzso On the zzso level, zzso zzso is extensively used in the systems biology community and with increasing frequency also in models of zzso calcium zzso To increase zzso speed, fast approximations were derived from zzso exact algorithm, most notably the chemical zzso equation and the zzso zzso Finally, in order to integrate deterministic and zzso effects in zzso simulations, hybrid zzso are increasingly zzso These include zzso models of zzso channels combined with deterministic descriptions of the calcium zzso and diffusion system on the one hand, and zzso that switch between deterministic and zzso simulation steps in a zzso manner on the zzso The basic assumptions of the listed methods as well as zzso schemes are given in the zzso We conclude with a perspective on possible future developments of the zzso
