zzso electrical zzso zzso reconstruction zzso usually employ the zzso iteration scheme to image the zzso distribution inside the zzso For complex zzso problems, the application of this method is not feasible any more due to the large zzso involved and their high storage zzso In this paper we demonstrate the suitability of an alternative zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for zzso zzso imaging incorporating zzso mesh refinement and requiring less storage space than the zzso zzso We compare the reconstruction efficiency of both zzso for a simple zzso head zzso The results show that an increase in speed of about zzso is achievable with the zzso zzso method without loss of zzso
