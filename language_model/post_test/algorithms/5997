In many biomedical studies, interest is often attached to calculating effect measures in the presence of interactions between two continuous zzso Traditional approaches based on zzso zzso are limited by the degree of zzso involved in transforming these zzso into zzso variables or imposing a zzso form on the zzso zzso In this paper, we present: zzso a flexible zzso method for zzso effect measures through generalized additive models including zzso and zzso zzso techniques for zzso testing the significance of interaction terms, and zzso constructing confidence intervals for effect zzso The zzso of our methodology is supported by simulations, and illustrated using data from a study of possible risk factors for zzso zzso This application revealed a zzso zzso effect: for patients with high plasma zzso levels, increased risk is zzso not only with low, but also with high percentages of zzso
