Recognizing classes of objects from their shape is an zzso problem in machine vision that zzso the ability of a computer system to represent and zzso complex geometrical information on the basis of a finite amount of prior zzso A practical approach to this problem is particularly difficult to zzso not only because the shape zzso of relevant object classes is generally large, but also because standard sensing devices used to capture the real world only provide a partial view of a scene, so there is partial information pertaining to the objects of zzso In this work, we develop an zzso framework for recognizing classes of zzso shapes from range zzso The basic idea of our zzso approach is to zzso existing surface representations that have proven effective in recognizing specific zzso objects to the problem of object classes using our newly introduced zzso representation that is robust to zzso as opposed to a zzso representation that is often tied to a specific zzso Based on this approach, we present a system that is capable of recognizing and zzso a variety of object shape classes from range zzso We demonstrate our system in a series of large-scale experiments that were motivated by specific applications in scene analysis and medical zzso
