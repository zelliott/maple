One of the greatest challenges that modern molecular biology is facing is the understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating gene zzso A fundamental step in this process requires the characterization of regulatory motifs playing key roles in the regulation of gene expression at zzso and zzso zzso In particular, zzso is modulated by the interaction of zzso factors with their corresponding binding zzso zzso Web is a web interface to zzso an zzso for the automatic discovery of zzso motifs in a set of related regulatory DNA zzso The motifs found are in turn likely to be instances of binding sites for some zzso zzso Other than providing access to the program, the interface has been designed so to make usage of the program itself as simple as possible, and to require very little prior knowledge about the length and the conservation of the motifs to be zzso In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different zzso and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some zzso on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple zzso The web interface is available at the address zzso by following the zzso zzso
