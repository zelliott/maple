The aim of this study was to present a new approach to acquire a three-dimensional virtual skull model appropriate for zzso surgery planning without the use of plaster dental models and without deformation of the facial zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan procedure with triple zzso rigid registration was evaluated and validated on 10 zzso zzso First, the patient was scanned vertically with a wax bite zzso in place zzso scan zzso Second, a limited dose scan of the patient with a Triple zzso zzso impression in place was carried out zzso scan zzso Finally, a high-resolution scan of the Triple zzso zzso impression was done zzso scan zzso zzso and semiautomatic triple zzso rigid registration zzso was performed to augment the patient's skull model with accurate zzso and zzso data zzso version zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All registrations were based on the zzso of Mutual Information registration zzso Because the accuracy and stability of the zzso registration zzso between the Triple zzso zzso impression scan and the limited zzso patient scan were not known, this particular registration step needed to be zzso The accuracy of registration was measured on a synthetic skull and showed to be highly zzso A volume overlap of zzso was found for registered impression scan zzso The mean distance between registered impression scan zzso and registered impression scan zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As far as the stability of registration was concerned, successful registration with a stable optimal position was obtained with a maximum zzso of less than zzso zzso The results of this study showed that semiautomatic sequential triple zzso rigid registration of the triple zzso scans zzso the 3-D virtual skull model with detailed zzso and zzso data in a highly accurate and robust zzso The method is therefore appropriate and valid for 3-D virtual zzso surgery planning in the clinical zzso
