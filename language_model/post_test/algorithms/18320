We investigated a zzso zzso protocol and method of analysis in which sequential injections of zzso and zzso were used to map brain metabolism during two distinct experimental treatments in the same zzso In initial studies, brain sections from rats given only zzso or only zzso were exposed on zzso and on X-ray film with an zzso sheet of zzso zzso These studies were needed to determine whether, at the zzso zzso dose ratio used, zzso zzso would be revealed only in zzso images and zzso zzso only in zzso zzso We found that zzso images indeed showed only zzso zzso as zzso emissions were blocked by the protective coating of the film and the zzso By contrast, zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso pattern for both the zzso and zzso zzso We then examined zzso from zzso cases in which zzso and zzso were zzso given using a zzso zzso dose ratio, with a different treatment following each zzso As predicted from the zzso cases, activity in the zzso images corresponded to the treatment that followed the zzso injection, while the zzso images reflected both treatments and thus were not zzso representations of zzso zzso This paper provides a solution to the contamination of zzso by zzso label in that we devised a zzso zzso using a computerized imaging system which removes the zzso zzso from the zzso image, leaving a zzso image of zzso zzso zzso images revealed activity consistent with the treatment that followed the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and difference images separately zzso zzso activity for two different functional states in the same zzso By allowing a subject to serve as its own control, this zzso method greatly increases the zzso and power of the zzso zzso
