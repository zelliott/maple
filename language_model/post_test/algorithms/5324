In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso framework for modeling and analyzing computer zzso Working with this zzso we use a custom measurement infrastructure and zzso embedding to study the dynamics of these complex zzso zzso We find strong zzso from multiple corroborating methods, of zzso dynamics in the performance of a simple program running on a popular Intel zzso the first experimental evidence of chaotic dynamics in real computer zzso We also find that the dynamics change completely when we run the same program on a different type of Intel computer, or when that program is changed zzso This not only zzso our zzso it also raises important issues about computer analysis and zzso These engineered systems have grown so complex as to defy the analysis tools that are typically used by their zzso tools that assume zzso and zzso and essentially ignore zzso The ideas and methods developed by the zzso dynamics community, applied and interpreted in the context of the framework proposed here, are a much better way to study, understand, and design modern computer zzso
