This manuscript describes the zzso model and presents the results of an example zzso zzso links three subordinate models in order to predict zzso fate and transport through the crop root zone, zzso zone, and saturated zone to drinking water zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a one-dimensional zzso model which accounts for zzso fate and transport in the crop root zzso This release of zzso incorporates several features in addition to those simulated in the original zzso zzso specifically, soil temperature zzso zzso and vapor phase transport in soils, irrigation simulation and a method of characteristics zzso zzso to eliminate zzso zzso zzso is now capable of simulating fate and transport of the parent compound and up to two daughter zzso zzso is a one-dimensional zzso code which zzso the Richard's equation for flows in the zzso zzso The user may make use of zzso relationships between pressure, water content, and zzso zzso to solve the flow zzso zzso may also simulate the fate and transport of two parent and two daughter zzso zzso is a two-dimensional zzso model which simulates saturated zzso flow and transport in either an zzso or zzso zzso The codes are linked together with the aid of a flexible execution supervisor which allows the user to build models which are tailored to zzso zzso In order to perform exposure zzso the code is equipped with a zzso Carlo zzso and zzso The application of the model is to a potato field on Long Island, New zzso The results indicate that zzso is capable of realistically matching data observed in zzso monitoring zzso following 3 years of zzso zzso
