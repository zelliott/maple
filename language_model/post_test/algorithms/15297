Parallel imaging and compressed sensing have been arguably the most successful and widely used techniques for fast magnetic resonance imaging zzso Recent studies have shown that the combination of these two techniques is useful for solving the inverse problem of recovering the image from highly zzso zzso zzso In zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso the zzso problem involves data zzso zzso constraint and a number of zzso zzso terms zzso total variation or TV, and zzso zzso This makes the zzso problem difficult to solve due to the zzso nature of the zzso zzso In this paper, to effectively solve the zzso zzso zzso we zzso a new zzso method, called fast composite splitting zzso zzso which was developed for compressed sensing zzso By using a combination of variable splitting and operator splitting techniques, the zzso zzso zzso the large zzso problem into TV and zzso zzso which are then, solved efficiently using existing fast zzso The operator splitting separates the smooth terms from the zzso terms, so that both terms are treated in an efficient zzso The final solution to the zzso reconstruction is obtained by weighted solutions to the zzso through an zzso zzso zzso The zzso parallel zzso technique is tested on MR brain image reconstructions at various acceleration rates and with different sampling zzso The results indicate that, for zzso zzso zzso the zzso method is capable of achieving significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction zzso
