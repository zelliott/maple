To perform a long-term evaluation of 15 patients with unilateral essential zzso with the aim of determining the causes of bleeding and the response to zzso zzso To design a zzso zzso for patients with unilateral essential zzso 

We zzso review the clinical data of 15 patients with unilateral essential zzso evaluated by rigid zzso (15 zzso flexible zzso (15 zzso and zzso zzso (3 zzso In 4 patients electric zzso of the zzso zzso was carried zzso 

14 of the 15 patients were successfully treated zzso Only one patient presented recurrence of the zzso Mean follow-up time was 64 months zzso zzso No patient suffered any relevant complication secondary to the zzso zzso 

The cause of bleeding in patients with unilateral essential zzso is determined only in a few, but zzso treatment is successful in a high percentage of zzso We consider that upper urinary tract zzso mainly flexible zzso has strongly impacted the diagnosis and treatment of essential unilateral zzso We present a new zzso algorithm, based on the usefulness of flexible zzso
