The recent increased interest in information fusion methods for solving complex problem, such as in image analysis, is motivated by the wish to better exploit the multitude of information, available from different sources, to enhance zzso In this paper, we propose a novel method, that advances the state of the art of fusing image information from different views, based on a special class of zzso zzso models, called zzso independence zzso The strength of this method is its ability to systematically and naturally capture uncertain domain knowledge, while performing information fusion in a zzso efficient zzso We examine the value of the method for zzso analysis and demonstrate its advantages in terms of explicit knowledge representation and accuracy zzso of at least zzso and zzso of true positive detection rates at zzso and zzso false positive zzso in comparison with previous zzso and zzso systems, and benchmark fusion methods such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
