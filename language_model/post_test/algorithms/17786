The completion of human and mouse zzso sequences provides a valuable resource for decoding other zzso zzso The comparative mapping by zzso and sequence similarity zzso strategy takes advantage of the resource and has been used in several zzso zzso It uses existing comparative zzso maps based on zzso regions to predict map locations of a zzso An automated zzso zzso tool can facilitate in the zzso sequencing effort and comparative zzso study of other zzso zzso 

The prerequisite of zzso is a comparative map table between the reference zzso and the predicting zzso We have built and collected comparative maps among five species including human, zzso zzso mouse and zzso zzso and zzso comparative maps were built based on the positions of zzso markers and the zzso zzso groups between human and cattle and human and pig zzso zzso zzso and zzso comparative maps were based on the zzso sequence segments between the two zzso With a match to human zzso zzso the approximate location of a query sequence can be predicted in zzso zzso mouse and rat zzso based on the position of the match relatively to the zzso markers or the zzso zzso 

The zzso and databases are available at zzso
