zzso radiation produces both zzso and multiply damaged DNA zzso zzso damaged sites zzso have been implicated in zzso cell killing and zzso The spatial distribution of elementary damages zzso breaks and base zzso that constitute zzso is of special interest, since the complexity of zzso has an impact on damage zzso A fast and zzso zzso to simulate the local zzso of elementary damages produced by zzso radiation is zzso This zzso captures the major trends in the DNA damage spectrum predicted using detailed zzso structure zzso An attractive feature of the proposed zzso is that only four adjustable parameters need to be identified to simulate the formation of DNA zzso A convenient recipe to determine the parameters used in the fast zzso Carlo damage simulation zzso is provided for selected low- and zzso zzso The good agreement among the damage yields predicted by the fast and detailed damage formation zzso suggests that the small-scale spatial distribution of damage sites is determined primarily by independent and purely zzso events and zzso
