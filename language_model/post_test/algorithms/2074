zzso knowledge of the energy landscape of a zzso zzso is a prerequisite for understanding its folding zzso and its final spatial zzso In the case of zzso we consider the energy landscape defined on the set of all secondary structures that can be formed by a given zzso We show that the exploration of this energy landscapes is zzso zzso For this purpose we present a zzso zzso for computing the complete density of states and discuss its application to zzso zzso For shorter sequences a more detailed analysis of the energy surface is possible using a complete list of all secondary zzso In this case we identify zzso states and the zzso points that connect zzso
