An extensive zzso analysis of available sequence and crystal structure data was used to identify functionally important zzso interactions within the motor domain of the zzso molecular zzso Principal component analysis revealed that all current zzso crystal structures reside in one of two main zzso which differ at the active site, and in the position of a zzso zzso relative to a rigid central zzso This zzso consists of secondary structure elements zzso and contains a zzso zzso surface patch that may be involved in strong binding to zzso A hinge point for the zzso motion lies near a zzso zzso at position zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a network of zzso positions that link this region to the zzso site, via a highly zzso zzso in the switch I zzso The data are consistent with a model in which the zzso status of the active site shifts zzso between weak and strong binding zzso via reconfiguration of the identified zzso Our data provide a statistically supported framework for further examination of this and other zzso relationships in the zzso zzso
