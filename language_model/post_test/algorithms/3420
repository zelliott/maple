The zzso effect is the zzso at distances D multiple of zzso of the intensity downstream of a periodic zzso Earlier work with hard zzso radiation zzso showed the variation with D of the fundamental zzso component of intensity to be a good measurement of beam zzso Any zzso zzso zzso I zzso m zzso 1) would be periodic with a reduced period zzso zzso zzso for an zzso coherent incident beam zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso is sampled through the ratio of I zzso zzso at D zzso 0 and multiples of zzso This requires the zzso zzso for D zzso 0, which is not accessible for a phase object (no contrast at D zzso zzso However, the ratio of the slopes of I zzso zzso at D zzso 0 and D zzso zzso also provides this zzso Furthermore, a characterization of zzso is possible, provided an assumption is made on its shape, using only the ratio of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso of two images a distance zzso zzso zzso with one- and two-dimensional phase zzso and a mixed zzso and zzso two-dimensional grating confirm that the partial zzso effect approach is zzso It requires a reduced range of zzso and yields important results directly, obviating the need for computer zzso In particular, zzso of the beam intensity was found to have very low zzso in the vertical direction, probably due to zzso zzso
