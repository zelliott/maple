A new alternative data processing tool set, zzso is developed for automated zzso and zzso identification and concentration zzso of target compounds after analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional gas zzso with mass zzso zzso The tool set has been developed for and tested on zzso zzso The software is developed to run zzso (one thread per zzso zzso on a standard PC zzso zzso under different operating systems and is as such capable of processing multiple data sets zzso Raw data files are converted into zzso zzso Common Data zzso format using a fast conversion zzso They are then zzso using previously developed zzso originating from zzso zzso Next, the resulting reduced data files are searched against a zzso library zzso from user or commercial zzso zzso zzso Institute of zzso and zzso and the identified compounds, including an indicative zzso are reported in Excel zzso Data can be processed batch zzso The overall time needed for conversion together with processing and searching of 30 raw data sets for zzso compounds is routinely within an zzso The screening performance is evaluated for detection of pesticides and zzso in raw data obtained after analysis of soil and plant zzso zzso are compared to the existing zzso routine based on proprietary software zzso zzso The developed software tool set, which is freely downloadable at zzso greatly zzso zzso and offers more options for zzso automated identification toward specific application zzso The quality of the results obtained is slightly better than the standard processing and also adds a quantitative zzso The software tool set in combination with two-dimensional gas zzso coupled to zzso mass zzso shows great potential as a zzso and fast zzso instrumental screening zzso
