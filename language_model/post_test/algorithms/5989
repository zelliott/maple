zzso zzso of zzso drugs, shows a protective action against zzso zzso zzso Here, we used an zzso study of the pharmacological effects of zzso on zzso receptors to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso role of zzso The drug acted as a typical zzso inhibitor with neither zzso nor zzso and antagonized zzso responses in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso is not an open channel zzso Noise and single channel analyses showed that zzso zzso responses by reducing the number of zzso channels available for zzso and also reduced the channel open probability without changing single channel zzso Moreover, zzso accelerated zzso zzso without affecting the affinity of the zzso for zzso or zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso blocks the zzso response by reducing the number of zzso channels available for zzso This appears to occur via a zzso decrease in the channel open zzso and a zzso acceleration of the zzso response, which is likely associated with a reduced affinity for zzso zzso indeed decreased the zzso zzso response without binding directly to the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso
