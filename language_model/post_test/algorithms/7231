We present four novel zzso distances defined for fuzzy or zzso image data, two based on integration over zzso and two based on the fuzzy distance zzso We explore their theoretical zzso zzso the proposed zzso distances in existing definitions of zzso zzso among which are the zzso distance and the sum of minimal zzso we define a number of distances between fuzzy zzso These set distances are directly zzso for comparing zzso images or fuzzy segmented objects, but also for detecting patterns and matching parts of zzso The distance measures integrate shape and zzso of observed entities, providing a highly zzso tool for image processing and zzso Performance evaluation of derived set distances in real image processing tasks is conducted and zzso It is shown that the considered distances have a number of appealing theoretical properties and exhibit very good performance in template matching and object zzso for fuzzy segmented images as well as when applied directly on zzso intensity zzso Examples include recognition of hand written digits and identification of virus zzso The proposed set distances perform zzso on the zzso zzso zzso task, achieving the best reported error rate for zzso using only rigid body transformations and a zzso zzso
