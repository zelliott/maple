For a diabetes zzso patient, tight control of zzso level is zzso zzso are reported of an investigation of the suitability of existing zzso continuous insulin zzso controlled and adjusted by a control zzso using continuous zzso zzso as input to perform the functionality of an artificial zzso Special attention was given to the development of a continuous zzso monitor and to evaluate which quality of input data is necessary for the control zzso In clinical trials, it was found that for patients in a controlled environment an autonomously regulating control zzso leads to an improved adjustment of patient zzso values and less overall insulin infusion as compared with the best fixed zzso insulin infusion profiles of standard pump zzso For the limited number of cases studied here, functionality of the control zzso could tolerate some delay between the actual zzso values in the patient zzso fluid and the zzso input of up to 30 zzso A zzso zzso measurement delivering actual zzso values every zzso zzso seems to be suited to control an artificial zzso
