Advances in zzso biology have occurred primarily in the areas of software and zzso zzso new designs of hardware to support biological computing are extremely zzso This is due, we believe, to the presence of a zzso knowledge gap between molecular biologists and computer zzso The existence of this gap is zzso as it has long been known that for certain problems, special-purpose computers can achieve significant zzso gains over zzso zzso We describe one such computer here: a custom accelerator for gene sequence zzso The accelerator zzso a version of the zzso zzso for zzso sequence zzso zzso lengths are constrained only by available zzso the product of sequence lengths in the current zzso can be up to zzso The machine is implemented as two zzso boards connected to a Mac zzso using a mixture of zzso and zzso technology clocked at 10 zzso The boards are completely functional, and yield a zzso performance improvement over an zzso zzso
