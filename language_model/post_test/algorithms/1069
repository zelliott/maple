Mouse zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso PBS exhibit high zzso when frozen to zzso degrees C at zzso degrees zzso and then rapidly zzso However, survival is zzso when they are frozen at 260 or zzso degrees zzso presumably because, at those high rates, zzso water cannot leave rapidly enough to prevent extensive zzso and this zzso leads to nucleation and freezing in zzso zzso ice formation zzso The probability of zzso as a function of cooling rate can be zzso by coupled differential equations that describe the extent of the loss of cell water during freezing and from knowledge of the temperature at which the zzso zzso of the cell can zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso requires values for the zzso zzso zzso of the cell and for its zzso energy zzso Using literature values for these parameters in mouse zzso we calculated zzso of water volume versus temperature for four cooling rates between 250 and 2000 degrees zzso The zzso nucleation temperature was zzso to be zzso degrees C or above based on the greatly reduced zzso of zzso that underwent rapid cooling to a minimum temperature of between zzso and zzso degrees zzso Combining that information regarding nucleation temperature with the zzso zzso zzso leads to the conclusion that zzso freezing should occur only in cells that are cooled at 2000 degrees zzso and not in cells that are cooled at zzso degrees zzso The calculated rate of 2000 degrees zzso for zzso is approximately zzso higher than the zzso zzso value of 260 degrees zzso zzso reasons for the zzso are zzso
