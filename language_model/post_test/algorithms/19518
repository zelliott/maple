An approach for analysis of biological networks is zzso In this approach, named the connectivity zzso zzso method, all the zzso of interest are expressed in a zzso Then, a variety of analyses are performed on zzso zzso or zzso Each zzso in the network is expressed as a row zzso or zzso that carries information defining or zzso the zzso zzso Information about connectivity itself is also expressed as a row zzso or zzso Thus, connection of zzso zzso to zzso zzso through edge e is expressed as zzso zzso zzso a row zzso formed by the combination of three row zzso or zzso where zzso zzso and e indicate two different zzso and one zzso zzso All the zzso in any given network are expressed as a zzso zzso each row of which zzso to one zzso Using this CM method, zzso zzso connectivity is investigated in a model zzso network composed of the reactions for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid cycle, zzso zzso zzso and zzso
