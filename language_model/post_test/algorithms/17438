zzso of the capped zzso zzso is investigated at the zzso interface by molecular dynamics simulations for zzso zzso zzso placed in the zzso phase as a zzso the zzso rapidly zzso to the zzso where it adopts an zzso zzso The marginal presence of zzso structures throughout the complete trajectory indicates that the corresponding zzso are strongly zzso at the zzso It is further suggestive that folding in an zzso environment proceeds through a zzso of successive zzso zzso The energetic and zzso penalties involved in the zzso changes along this zzso markedly increase the folding time scales of zzso explaining why the zzso the hypothesized lowest free energy structure for a sequence with a zzso zzso of zzso has not been reached zzso The formation of a type I zzso at the end of the simulation confirms the importance of such motifs as initiation sites allowing the zzso to coalesce towards a secondary zzso zzso zzso
