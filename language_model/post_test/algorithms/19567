We previously showed that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Using functional analyses and zzso technology, we first tested whether this intriguing relationship was specific to zzso zzso or could be shared with other zzso zzso of zzso activity and gene profiling analysis of different zzso cells revealed that the latter hypothesis should be zzso These results encouraged us to pursue and to confirm our analysis with a zzso stem cell population, embryonic stem cells or zzso The zzso profiles of zzso and zzso were clustered together, unlike differentiated zzso In addition, zzso zzso displayed higher zzso activity than other zzso and they could zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and stem cells share some characteristics of zzso This opens new perspectives on understanding stem cell zzso and zzso such as a putative role of stem cells in tissue zzso by discarding dead cells but also their zzso or fusion zzso
