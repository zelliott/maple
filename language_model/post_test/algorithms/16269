zzso bone zzso are commonly used in zzso zzso However, bone removal may weaken the zzso bone and lead to deleterious zzso The aim of our study was to design a test protocol for characterization of the impact resistance of zzso bone before and after zzso bone graft harvest and to validate an zzso measurement of zzso bone zzso Twelve fresh human zzso heads were used for the validation zzso To evaluate impact resistance, we developed a zzso zzso impact testing zzso The impact force was gradually increased until failure zzso of the defined zzso bone zzso According to the zzso we measured the maximum zzso energy or impact force to zzso With our test setup, measurement of the impact resistance of zzso bone was accurate to within zzso zzso We defined a range of values and particularly a threshold zzso The initial zzso impact must not to exceed 4 zzso For more zzso we compared 5 zzso measurement methods using a surgical navigation system with zzso zzso We achieved an zzso based on 2 methods that ensured a measurement resolution of zzso zzso zzso of this protocol will allow us to evaluate the loss of strength resulting from bone removal and the correlation between strength and thickness of the zzso zzso
