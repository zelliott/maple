In this paper we present a zzso based on a hidden zzso model zzso that was applied to a gait treadmill zzso for gait phase detection and zzso zzso The gait events foot strike, foot flat, heel off, toe off were detected using a zzso zzso that measured the foot zzso angular zzso in the zzso zzso zzso activities were zzso by processing zzso data from each detected zzso zzso learning of the zzso was undertaken using reference data from an optical motion analysis zzso Remarkably good zzso properties were achieved across tested subjects and gait zzso zzso and specificity of gait phase detection exceeded zzso and zzso respectively, with timing errors that were less than 20 zzso on zzso the accuracy of zzso discrimination was approximately zzso
