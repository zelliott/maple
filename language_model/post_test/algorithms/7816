It is increasingly recognized that protein functions often require intricate zzso zzso which involves a network of key zzso acid zzso that couple zzso separated functional zzso zzso efforts have been made to identify these key zzso by experimental and zzso zzso 

We have performed a large-scale evaluation of the predictions of zzso important zzso by a variety of zzso protocols including three based on the zzso and correlation analysis of a zzso elastic zzso This study is performed for two lists of test cases with zzso pairs of protein zzso The zzso important zzso predicted by the zzso and correlation analysis are found to be strongly or moderately zzso in zzso of test zzso They form a sparse network of zzso which are clustered both in zzso space and along protein zzso Their overall conservation is attributed to their dynamic role rather than zzso binding or high network zzso 

By modeling how the protein structural fluctuations respond to zzso zzso our highly efficient zzso and correlation analysis can be used to dissect the functional zzso changes in various proteins with a zzso level of zzso The predictions of zzso important zzso serve as promising targets for zzso and functional zzso
