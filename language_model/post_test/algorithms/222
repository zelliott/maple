We investigated the problem of automatic depth of zzso zzso zzso from electroencephalogram zzso zzso We employed Time zzso Signal zzso And zzso zzso a zzso signal processing technique, in combination with zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso The presented system learns to discriminate between five zzso classes assessed by human experts whose zzso were based on zzso zzso auditory evoked zzso zzso and clinical zzso We found that our system closely zzso the behavior of the human expert, thus proving the utility of the zzso Further analyses on the features extracted by our technique indicated that information related to zzso is mostly distributed across frequency bands and that the presence of high zzso zzso 80 zzso which reflect mostly muscle activity, is beneficial for zzso zzso
