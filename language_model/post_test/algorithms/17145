zzso vigilance and sleep electroencephalogram zzso recordings from five healthy volunteers were analyzed using a method for identifying zzso and chaos which combines the zzso zzso approach with the surrogate data zzso A zzso component in the zzso was zzso however, inconsistent with the hypothesis of zzso zzso A possibility that a temporally zzso process may zzso or influence the zzso dynamics was zzso A process that zzso zzso zzso deterministic zzso with randomness is proposed for an explanation of observed properties of the analyzed zzso zzso Taking these results into consideration, the use of zzso and related zzso zzso in quantitative zzso analysis is critically zzso
