The conversion of the zzso zzso zzso number to electron density is one of the main processes that determine the accuracy of patient dose calculations in zzso treatment zzso However, the CT number and electron density of zzso cannot be generally interrelated via a simple zzso correspondence because the CT number depends on the effective atomic number as well as the electron zzso The purpose of this study is to present a simple conversion from the zzso CT number zzso by means of zzso CT zzso to the relative electron density zzso via a single linear zzso 

The zzso conversion method was demonstrated by performing zzso zzso image simulations that were intended to imitate a second-generation zzso CT zzso scanner with an additional tin zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso line was obtained from the image simulation with a 33 zzso electron density zzso phantom equipped with 16 zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso compositions of these three zzso were quite different to those of body zzso The zzso conversion method was also applied to previously published experimental CT data, which were measured using two different CT zzso to validate the clinical feasibility of the present zzso In addition, the effect of object size on zzso images was investigated by image simulations using a 25 zzso virtual phantom for two different zzso with and without the tin filter for the zzso zzso 

The simulated zzso plot exhibited a predictable linear relationship over a wide range of zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso values of the zzso of determination, zzso and intercept of the linear function fitted to the data were close to those of the ideal zzso The maximum difference between the ideal and simulated zzso values was zzso The satisfactory zzso of zzso was also confirmed from analyses of the experimental CT zzso In the experimental cases, the maximum difference between the nominal and simulated zzso values was found to be zzso after two zzso were zzso When compared with the case without the tin zzso the zzso conversion performed with the tin filter yielded a lower dose and more reliable zzso values that were less affected by the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso line with a simple zzso correspondence would facilitate the construction of a zzso zzso image from acquired zzso images, and zzso second generation zzso may be a feasible zzso for the clinical use of the zzso conversion zzso
