The number of human zzso that have been zzso completely for different individuals has increased rapidly in recent zzso zzso and transferring complete zzso between computers for the purpose of applying various applications and analysis tools will soon become a major zzso hindering the analysis zzso zzso there is a growing need to compress these data zzso Here, we describe a technique to compress human zzso based on zzso coding, using a reference zzso and known Single zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we explore several intrinsic features of zzso and information in other zzso databases to further improve the zzso zzso Using these methods, we compress James zzso zzso to zzso megabytes zzso improving on recent work by zzso Similar zzso is obtained for most zzso available from the 1000 zzso zzso Our biologically inspired techniques promise even greater gains for zzso of lower organisms and for human zzso as more zzso data become zzso
