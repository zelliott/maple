zzso - the evolutionary histories of groups of organisms - are one of the most widely used tools throughout the life sciences, as well as objects of research within zzso evolutionary biology, zzso zzso Almost every tool devised to date to reconstruct zzso produces zzso yet it is widely understood and accepted that trees zzso the evolutionary histories of many groups of zzso most prominently bacteria (because of horizontal gene zzso and plants (because of hybrid zzso Various methods and criteria have been introduced for zzso tree zzso zzso is one of the most widely used and studied criteria, and various accurate and efficient zzso for reconstructing trees based on zzso have been zzso zzso zzso suggested a straightforward extension of the zzso criterion to zzso zzso In this paper we formalize this concept, and provide the first experimental study of the quality of zzso as a criterion for constructing and evaluating zzso zzso Our results show that, when extended to zzso networks, the zzso criterion produces promising zzso In a great majority of the cases in our experiments, the zzso criterion accurately predicts the numbers and zzso of zzso zzso
