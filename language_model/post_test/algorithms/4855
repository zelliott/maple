We present a new application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for exciting directly zzso zzso zzso between the central transition of zzso zzso zzso zzso With respect to previously published zzso methods zzso Eden, zzso Zhou, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 431 zzso zzso the zzso sequence is used without zzso zzso zzso and with an original zzso This leads to an improved efficiency (a factor of two for zzso and to a much higher zzso to zzso field zzso and resonance zzso The zzso zzso performances are demonstrated zzso by zzso zzso experiments on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The two-dimensional zzso correlation experiments incorporating these zzso sequences allow the observation of zzso zzso between central zzso even at high magnetic field where the difference in offset between zzso and zzso zzso sites exceeds 10 zzso
