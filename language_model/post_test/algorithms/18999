zzso zzso zzso without contrast injection was explored for imaging cerebral blood volume zzso and tissue zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zone corresponding to zzso regions in zzso and to zzso regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were used to segment tumors into multiple zones of different zzso After removal of known zzso areas using zzso and zzso zzso the volume of overlap between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zone correlated with that of zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso Based on these zzso this remaining long zzso overlap area was tentatively assigned to zzso In one promising case the collective zzso approach accurately identified a zzso zzso despite the presence of contrast enhancement in zzso images consequential to zzso treatment zzso The results suggest that this collective zzso approach may provide useful information for regional assessment of zzso tumors and for guiding zzso decisions in patients with zzso
