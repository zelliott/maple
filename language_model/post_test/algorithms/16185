zzso is a branch of image processing that seeks to reduce image information by zzso texture zzso from the zzso zzso of MR images of zzso structures in mild zzso and zzso is not zzso Our objective was to attempt to find differences among patients with zzso and mild zzso and zzso subjects, by using zzso applied to the MR images of the zzso and the zzso of these groups of zzso 

zzso was applied to the MR images of 17 patients with zzso 16 patients with mild zzso and 16 zzso zzso The zzso approach was based on the zzso MR images were zzso and were obtained in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were manually segmented for each subject, and 44 texture parameters were zzso for each of these zzso 

zzso parameters showed differences among the 3 groups for the zzso and zzso A zzso comparison among groups showed differences for zzso and zzso for the zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso 

zzso is a useful technique to aid in the detection of tissue zzso in MR images of mild zzso and zzso and has the potential to become a helpful tool in the diagnosis and understanding of these zzso
