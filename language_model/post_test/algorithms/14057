In zzso gene expression studies, the number of zzso zzso is usually small because of cost and sample zzso resulting in unreliable zzso zzso and thus unreliable statistical hypothesis zzso The unreliable zzso zzso is further complicated by the fact that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso 

The zzso error model captures the zzso relationship for various types of zzso technologies, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso This error model conservatively estimates intensity error and uses this value to stabilize the zzso zzso We present two commonly used error models: the intensity zzso for zzso zzso and the ratio error model for zzso zzso or ratios built from two zzso zzso We present examples to demonstrate the strength of our error models in improving statistical power of zzso data analysis, particularly, in increasing expression detection sensitivity and specificity when the number of replicates is zzso
