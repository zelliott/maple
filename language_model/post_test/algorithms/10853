Mass zzso is a particularly useful technology for the rapid and robust identification of peptides and proteins in complex zzso zzso sequences can be identified by zzso their observed tandem mass zzso zzso with theoretical zzso of peptides from a sequence zzso Unfortunately, to perform this search the charge of the zzso must be known, and current zzso determination zzso only discriminate zzso zzso zzso distinguishing zzso from zzso for example, is zzso Thus, search software is forced to search zzso zzso multiple zzso To minimize this zzso we present a support zzso machine zzso that quickly and reliably zzso zzso zzso as having either a zzso or zzso precursor zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso we obtain a zzso reduction in search time while maintaining an average of zzso of zzso and zzso of protein identifications originally obtained from these zzso
