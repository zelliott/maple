The purpose of the present study is to introduce a zzso zzso for the CT zzso zzso data used in zzso Carlo zzso Performing simulations on the CT data implies large zzso costs as well as large memory requirements since the number of zzso in such data reaches typically into hundreds of millions zzso CT data, however, contain homogeneous regions which could be zzso to form larger zzso without affecting the zzso zzso Based on this property we propose a zzso zzso based on zzso in homogeneous regions the zzso replaces groups of zzso with a smaller number of larger zzso This reduces the number of zzso while keeping the critical zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained using the present zzso on both phantom and clinical data show that zzso rates up to zzso are possible without losing the zzso accuracy of the zzso
