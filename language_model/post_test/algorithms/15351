The effects of zzso channel fluctuations on the zzso zzso activity are potentially profound in zzso excitable membrane zzso Different groups have extended zzso equations into zzso differential equations to capture the effects of zzso channel noise zzso (Fox & zzso 1994; zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies have shown that the accuracy of zzso statistics by Fox and zzso model does not match well with the corresponding statistics from the exact microscopic zzso The models of both zzso et zzso and zzso however, were found to produce highly accurate zzso Here we extend the examination of these models to the case in which the rate functions for the opening and closing of gates are under the influence of zzso For that purpose, the usual rate functions are accompanied zzso by zzso zzso angular zzso Moreover, we argue that the existence of such noise in the rate functions is a plausible zzso phenomenon for zzso zzso It is observed that the presence of noise in the rates is not effective on the degree of zzso within the Fox and zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy is found to remain high as in the case of noise free zzso But the performance of zzso et zzso model is seen to degrade seriously with the increasing strength of the introduced rate function zzso We attribute this failure of zzso et zzso model to the use of the zzso function of open channels at the steady state, in its zzso
