The genetic zzso zzso as developed by Holland zzso zzso in Natural and zzso zzso Ann zzso University of Michigan Press) is an zzso technique based on natural zzso We use a modified version of this technique to investigate which aspects of natural selection make it an efficient search zzso Our main modification to zzso zzso is the zzso of the population into zzso zzso We consider two zzso One is a fitness landscape with many local zzso The other is a model of singing in birds that has been previously zzso using dynamic zzso Both examples have zzso zzso In the first example we show that the zzso can find the global optimum and that its success is improved by zzso the zzso In the second example we show that zzso can evolve to the optimal policy found by dynamic zzso
