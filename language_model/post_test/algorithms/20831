zzso model reduction is a long-standing technique used both to gain insight into model zzso and to reduce the zzso costs of simulation and zzso A reduced model must retain essential features of the full model, which, zzso have been the zzso of certain state zzso For biological zzso timing, or phase, characteristics must be zzso A key performance criterion for a clock is the ability to adjust its phase correctly in response to external zzso We present a novel model reduction technique that removes components from a zzso clock model and discover that four feedback zzso are redundant with respect to its phase response zzso Using a coupled zzso model of a zzso clock, we demonstrate that by preserving the phase response behavior of a single zzso we preserve timing behavior at the zzso zzso
