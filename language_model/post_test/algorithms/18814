As structural zzso efforts succeed in solving protein structures with novel zzso the number of proteins with known structures but unknown functions zzso Although experimental zzso can determine the functions of some of these zzso they can be expensive and time zzso zzso approaches can assist in identifying potential functions of these zzso zzso functions can be predicted based on sequence zzso zzso context, expression patterns, structure zzso and combinations of zzso We investigated whether simulations of protein dynamics can expose functional sites that are not apparent to the zzso function prediction methods in zzso crystal zzso Focusing on zzso zzso we coupled a machine learning tool that recognizes functional sites, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Treating molecules as dynamic entities can improve the ability of zzso function prediction methods to zzso possible functional zzso
