Recent clinical studies have proved that zzso diagnosis zzso systems are helpful for improving zzso detection by zzso in zzso However, these systems would be more useful if the zzso rate is zzso Current zzso systems generally detect and characterize suspicious abnormal structures in individual zzso zzso Clinical experiences by zzso indicate that screening with two zzso views improves the detection accuracy of abnormalities in the zzso It is expected that the fusion of information from different zzso views will improve the performance of zzso zzso We are developing a zzso matching method that zzso the geometric locations, and zzso and textural features to correlate objects detected in two different views using a zzso zzso First, a geometrical model is used to predict the search region for an object in a second view from its location in the first zzso The distance between the object and the zzso is used to define the search zzso After pairing the objects in two views, textural and zzso characteristics of the paired objects are merged and similarity measures are zzso Linear zzso analysis is then employed to zzso each object pair as a true or false mass zzso The resulting object correspondence score is combined with its zzso detection score using a fusion zzso The fusion information was found to improve the zzso zzso and reduce the number of zzso In a preliminary study, we used a data set of 169 pairs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso view zzso For the detection of zzso masses on current zzso the zzso detection sensitivity was found to improve from zzso with a zzso detection scheme to zzso with the new zzso zzso at a zzso rate of 1 zzso The corresponding zzso detection sensitivity improved from zzso to zzso
