zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contextual constraints over spatial intensity distribution and zzso zzso shape in the feature space are incorporated into the fuzzy zzso zzso for zzso of three-dimensional zzso MR zzso The bias field is modeled by a linear combination of smooth zzso basis functions for fast zzso in the zzso zzso zzso terms for the neighborhood continuity of either intensity or membership are added into the zzso cost zzso Since the feature space is not zzso distance measures, other than the zzso distance, are used to account for the shape and zzso effects of clusters in the feature zzso The performance of zzso is improved by combining the zzso zzso scheme with the criteria used in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through the inclusion of the cluster scatter zzso The performance of this integrated approach is zzso evaluated on normal MR brain images using the similarity zzso The improvement in the quality of zzso obtained with our method is also demonstrated by comparing our results with those produced by zzso zzso Software zzso a software package that is commonly used for tissue zzso
