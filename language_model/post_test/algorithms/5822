X-ray zzso zzso zzso images in the zzso region are sometimes rendered zzso for diagnostic purposes due to the appearance of streak zzso The purpose of the study is to reduce streak artifacts appeared on dental and maxillofacial X-ray CT images by the application of modified zzso restoration zzso 

We took advantage of the aspect that adjacent CT images often depict very similar anatomical structures within the resulting collection of zzso zzso CT images having streak artifacts were processed using the projection data of adjacent CT zzso A modified zzso zzso the maximum zzso zzso zzso reconstruction algorithm, was employed to reduce the streak artifact caused by metallic materials in the oral zzso It zzso between the processed image and the original projection zzso First, the projection data of an intact image were zzso and then, the next image that had streak artifacts was zzso The projection data of the processed image were zzso and the zzso method was applied to the next image zzso Then, the successive zzso restoration was carried zzso 

Twelve adjacent images were zzso Each zzso restoration was carried out fifty zzso zzso artifacts were observed on processed images at the initial stage, but some of them either suppressed or disappeared as the iteration zzso 

The modified zzso method was effective to reduce streak artifacts in X-ray CT images in zzso zzso
