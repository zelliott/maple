The promise of personalized zzso for common complex diseases zzso in part, on the ability to predict genetic risks on the basis of single zzso zzso We examined and compared the methods of three companies zzso zzso and zzso that have offered zzso personal zzso zzso 

We simulated zzso data for 100,000 individuals on the basis of published zzso zzso and predicted disease risks using the methods of the zzso zzso ability for six diseases was assessed by the zzso 

zzso values differed among the diseases and among the zzso The highest values of the zzso were observed for age-related zzso zzso zzso disease, and zzso zzso The largest difference among the companies was found for zzso disease: the zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso risks differed substantially among the companies as a result of differences in the sets of single zzso zzso selected and the average population risks selected by the companies, and in the formulas used for the calculation of zzso 

Future efforts to design zzso models for the zzso of common complex diseases may benefit from understanding the strengths and limitations of the zzso zzso designed by these early zzso
