zzso research is zzso to improve the delivery of tight zzso control at the intensive care zzso A major component is the development of safe, zzso and effective insulin zzso zzso which are normally evaluated in time-consuming zzso clinical zzso zzso studies with virtual critically ill patients can substantially accelerate the development zzso For this purpose, we created a model of zzso in the critically zzso The model includes five zzso a zzso of zzso insulin zzso a zzso of insulin zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of insulin action and a zzso of zzso zzso Model parameters are estimated utilizing prior knowledge and data collected routinely at the intensive care unit to represent the high zzso and zzso variation in insulin needs in the critically zzso zzso zzso combined with the zzso method is used to estimate zzso zzso model parameters and zzso a zzso zzso the zzso insulin zzso which represents the zzso variation in insulin zzso We propose a validation process to validate virtual patients developed for the purpose of testing zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the validation are exemplified using data collected in six critically ill patients treated at a medical intensive care zzso In conclusion, a novel zzso model has been developed to create a virtual population of critically ill zzso in zzso testing of zzso controllers at the intensive care zzso
