An zzso using serum as soluble zzso zzso source was developed for zzso zzso Two sandwich zzso were run in zzso The first zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso reacting with a zzso expressed by both zzso and zzso zzso the other zzso zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso After incubation with serum samples, bound zzso zzso was detected using an zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of each well was measured at zzso zzso Based on analysis of zzso obtained with panels of specimens of known zzso zzso a mathematical zzso was developed to derive the zzso zzso zzso from its zzso zzso zzso Despite the lack of zzso zzso an accurate zzso typing was zzso 362 specimens (including 151 zzso were zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso No correlation between the level of zzso zzso zzso and the amount of total zzso class I zzso in serum was zzso This report demonstrates the possibility of using zzso zzso zzso and zzso technology for zzso zzso The zzso offers several significant advantages over zzso no need for cell preparation, batch testing capabilities and objective, zzso interpretation of zzso
