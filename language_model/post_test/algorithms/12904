Based on truncated inverse zzso a theory for zzso of complex fields is zzso The zzso of the theory is verified by comparing with experimental data from digital holographic zzso zzso using a zzso system zzso zzso with standard intensity zzso reveals that only complex zzso deals correctly with coherent zzso With improved image resolution, complex zzso is demonstrated to exceed the zzso zzso zzso in resolution arises by zzso the objects complex field - containing the information zzso in the phase - and zzso it with the reconstructed complex transfer function zzso zzso (based on zzso theory modeled with experimental parameters of zzso and experimental zzso point spread functions zzso are used for the zzso reconstruction and zzso Thus, the optical system used for zzso is characterized zzso by its zzso The role of noise is discussed in the context of complex field zzso As further results, we demonstrate that complex zzso does not require any additional zzso in the zzso setup while extending the limit of resolution with coherent zzso by a factor of at least zzso
