zzso spectrum imaging reveals detailed local diffusion properties at the expense of substantially long imaging zzso It is possible to accelerate acquisition by zzso in zzso followed by image reconstruction that exploits prior knowledge on the diffusion probability density functions zzso Previously proposed methods impose this prior in the form of zzso under zzso and total variation zzso or under zzso zzso that are trained on example zzso to maximize the zzso of the zzso These compressed sensing zzso methods require zzso processing times on the order of hours using zzso running on a zzso This work presents two zzso reconstruction techniques that use zzso solutions, and are two orders of magnitude faster than the previously proposed zzso zzso zzso The first method generates a dictionary from the training data using principal component analysis zzso and performs the reconstruction in the zzso zzso The second proposed method applies reconstruction using zzso with zzso zzso with respect to a zzso This dictionary can either be obtained using the zzso algorithm, or it can simply be the training zzso of zzso without any zzso All of the proposed methods achieve reconstruction times on the order of seconds per imaging zzso and have reconstruction quality comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso
