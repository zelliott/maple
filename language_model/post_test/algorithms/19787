Professional judgment is necessary to assess occupational exposure in zzso zzso zzso however, the assessments lack transparency and are time-consuming to zzso To improve transparency and efficiency, we systematically applied decision rules to questionnaire responses to assess diesel exhaust exposure in the zzso zzso New England zzso Cancer zzso 

zzso participants reported 14 zzso zzso zzso jobs were administered questionnaires zzso with zzso zzso We applied decision rules to assign exposure metrics based either on the occupational history zzso responses zzso zzso or on the module responses zzso zzso we then combined the separate OH and module estimates zzso zzso Each job was also reviewed individually to assign exposure zzso review zzso We evaluated the agreement between the OH, zzso and zzso review zzso 

The proportion of exposed jobs was zzso for all jobs, depending on approach, and zzso for jobs with zzso zzso The zzso and zzso review estimates had moderately high agreement for all jobs zzso and for jobs with zzso zzso zzso for the zzso intensity and frequency zzso For exposed subjects, the zzso correlation statistic was zzso between the cumulative zzso and zzso review zzso 

The agreement seen here may represent an upper level of agreement because the zzso and zzso review estimates were not fully zzso This study shows that applying zzso rules can reproduce a zzso review, increase transparency and efficiency, and provide a mechanism to replicate exposure decisions in other zzso
