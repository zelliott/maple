The effect of zzso out the global average signal zzso in resting state zzso data has become a concern for interpreting functional connectivity zzso It is not clear whether the reported zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso Attention Networks are intrinsic to the brain, or are artificially created by zzso out the zzso Here we introduce a concept, Impact of the Global Average on zzso zzso zzso for zzso the sensitivity of zzso correlation analyses to the zzso of the zzso This zzso zzso index is defined as the product of two correlation zzso the correlation between the zzso and the zzso time course of a zzso times the correlation between the zzso and the seed time zzso This definition enables the calculation of a threshold at which the impact of zzso the zzso would be large enough to introduce zzso negative zzso It also yields a zzso impact correction procedure via zzso which eliminates zzso correlations introduced by zzso out the zzso In addition, we introduce an zzso zzso zzso Index zzso defined as the absolute difference between the zzso index and the impact zzso The zzso allows a graded confidence scale for ranking zzso according to their likelihood of showing artificial zzso By applying this method, we observed regions in the zzso zzso and zzso Attention Networks that were zzso These findings confirm that the previously reported negative correlations between the zzso Attention and zzso zzso Networks are intrinsic to the brain and not the result of statistical zzso Our proposed zzso of the impact that a confound may have on functional connectivity can be generalized to global effect zzso other than the zzso It can be readily applied to other zzso such as systemic zzso or head movement zzso in order to zzso their impact on functional connectivity in the resting zzso
