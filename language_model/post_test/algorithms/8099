A method for enhancing the signal to noise ratio zzso in zzso volume coils is zzso By introducing zzso made of zzso high zzso constant material into specific locations in the zzso the zzso can often be enhanced by up to zzso while zzso zzso is hardly zzso A model for predicting the limit of the zzso improvement is also zzso The model accurately predicts the zzso gain obtained in both zzso simulations and zzso An experiment was conducted on a zzso zzso Experimental results are in very good agreement with the simulations in regard to both zzso improvement and zzso enhancement in zzso zzso made of ultra high zzso constant materials can be as thin as few zzso thus, zzso fitting into existing zzso gaps in volume zzso
