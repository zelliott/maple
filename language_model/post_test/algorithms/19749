This paper describes the use of ocean color remote sensing data from the zzso Resolution Imaging zzso zzso onboard the zzso satellite to characterize zzso in Lake zzso and its primary drainage zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso from 2002 to zzso zzso modification and agricultural development in southern Florida transport sediments and nutrients from watershed agricultural areas to Lake zzso As a result of development around Lake zzso and the zzso that are connected to Lake zzso zzso conditions have also been adversely zzso resulting in zzso and zzso zzso The measurement of water zzso in zzso and zzso zzso allows researchers to understand important factors such as light limitation and the potential release of nutrients from zzso zzso Based on a strong correlation between water zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso band zzso a new satellite water zzso zzso has been developed for Lake zzso This study has shown important applications with zzso zzso data for water quality monitoring and zzso for zzso inland zzso zzso water property data are derived using the shortwave infrared zzso atmospheric correction zzso in order to remotely obtain zzso zzso data in Lake zzso and zzso zzso zzso using the red band zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found zzso but distinct seasonal, zzso and event driven zzso trends in Lake zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Wind waves and hurricanes have the largest influence on zzso trends in Lake zzso while zzso zzso wind waves, and hurricanes influence the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
