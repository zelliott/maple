zzso zzso Ion zzso zzso mass zzso exhibit improved resolving power, mass accuracy and zzso ratio when presented in zzso zzso a process which requires calculation of a phase correction zzso Mass zzso images can contain many thousands of zzso hence methods of decreasing the time required to solve for a phase correction function will result in significant improvements in this zzso 

A genetic zzso approach for zzso the phase correction function has been developed and compared with a previously described zzso iteration zzso 

The genetic zzso method has been shown to offer a zzso improvement in processing speed compared with the previous zzso approach used in the zzso algorithm, while maintaining the levels of zzso This translates to an 11 hour improvement in processing for a 20 zzso zzso mass zzso zzso 

The genetic zzso method described in this manuscript offers significant processing speed advantages over the previously described zzso iteration zzso This improvement is key to allowing the future routine use of zzso mode mass zzso zzso
