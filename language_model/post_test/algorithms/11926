zzso major zzso sites in zzso cells, play an important part in major zzso class I zzso I) zzso generation and thus in the regulation of specific immune zzso Their zzso specificity is of outstanding interest for this zzso In order to zzso previously determined zzso motifs of 20 S zzso we developed network-based model zzso trained by an evolutionary zzso with experimental zzso data of zzso and human 20 S zzso A window of ten zzso zzso acid zzso proved sufficient for the model zzso to reproduce the experimental results with zzso % zzso zzso experimental data were reproduced significantly better than randomly selected zzso sites, suggesting that our model zzso were able to extract rules inherent to zzso zzso zzso The affinity parameters of the model, which decide for or against zzso zzso with the zzso motifs determined zzso The zzso power of the model was verified for unknown (to the zzso test conditions: the prediction of zzso numbers in proteins and the generation of zzso I zzso from short zzso In zzso our model zzso reproduce and predict zzso zzso with high degree of zzso They present a promising approach for predicting zzso zzso products in future attempts and, in combination with existing zzso for zzso I zzso zzso will be tested to improve zzso T zzso zzso zzso
