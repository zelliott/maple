If it were possible to zzso an ideal high temperature therapy or zzso treatment would involve a single heating session and yield a desired zzso dose distribution in the zzso that would be attained in the shortest possible treatment time without heating critical normal zzso zzso zzso achieving all of these goals is impossible in practice, thus requiring zzso that allow clinicians to approach more closely some of these ideal goals at the expense of zzso To study the basic nature of a subset of these zzso the present simulation study looked at a simple, ideal case in which the zzso is heated by a single, zzso (with respect to zzso power pulse, with no power deposition in the normal zzso zzso were obtained for two different clinical strategies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso approach, wherein the zzso uniform zzso dose is completely delivered to the zzso during the zzso zzso This approach gives the zzso the satisfaction of knowing that the zzso was treated completely while power was being delivered, and yields the shortest zzso zzso dose delivery zzso However, that benefit is attained at the cost of both zzso the zzso during the subsequent cool down period and, zzso requiring a longer, overall treatment zzso Here, the treatment time is considered as that time zzso from the initiation of the heating pulse to the time at which the entire zzso has decayed to a specified zzso zzso 43 degrees C for our zzso And, zzso a zzso approach is considered, wherein the desired uniform dose is attained at the zzso time at which the complete zzso zzso back down to zzso conditions, taken as 4 h in this zzso This conservative approach requires less applied power and energy and avoids the zzso problem, but at the cost of having a zzso dose delivery time that can be significantly longer than the heating pulse zzso This approach can require that clinicians wait a significant time after the power has been turned off before being able to confirm that the desired zzso zzso dose was zzso The present findings show that: zzso for both clinical strategies, an optimal power deposition shape (with respect to position in the zzso can always be found that provides the desired uniform zzso dose in the zzso regardless of the heating pulse duration chosen or the zzso zzso zzso and zzso shorter heating zzso are preferable to longer ones in that they require less total energy, take less total time to treat the patients, and have optimal power deposition patterns less influenced by zzso On the other hand, shorter zzso always require higher temperatures, and for the zzso clinical approach, they give significantly larger excess zzso doses in the zzso The aggressive approach always requires longer treatment times than comparable conservative zzso The optimal power patterns for both strategies involve a zzso density at the zzso boundary, which frequently creates a zzso zzso that contributes significantly to the final zzso dose distribution zzso
