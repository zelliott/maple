A common complaint of the hearing impaired is the inability to understand speech in noisy environments even with their hearing zzso zzso Only a few single-channel zzso have significantly improved speech zzso in noise for zzso zzso The current study introduces a cochlear noise reduction zzso It is based on a cochlear representation of acoustic signals and real-time derivation of a zzso speech zzso The contribution of the zzso for enhancing word recognition in noise was evaluated on a group of 42 zzso subjects, 35 hearing-aid users, 8 cochlear implant recipients, and 14 participants with zzso zzso zzso scores of Hebrew monosyllabic words embedded in zzso noise at several zzso ratios zzso were obtained with processed and zzso zzso The zzso was not effective among the zzso zzso However, it yielded a significant improvement in some of the zzso subjects under different listening zzso Its most impressive benefit appeared among cochlear implant zzso More than zzso improvement in recognition score of noisy words was obtained by 12, 16, and 26 zzso at zzso of 30, 24, and 18 zzso zzso The zzso has a potential to improve speech zzso in background noise, yet further research is required to improve its zzso
