zzso is a second-generation zzso reverse zzso inhibitor zzso with a pattern of resistance zzso quite distinct from the current zzso 

We collected all routine samples of zzso patients followed in the AIDS reference laboratory of zzso (in 2006 and 2007) carrying zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso was estimated using three different drug resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Stanford zzso zzso We also verified whether the zzso described as resistance zzso are not due to virus zzso by the study of 58 zzso of zzso zzso 

Sixty one samples zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso had at least one resistance zzso to zzso according to zzso zzso zzso samples had at least one resistance zzso to zzso according to the Stanford zzso 48 and 53 cases were fully sensitive to zzso according to zzso and Stanford zzso zzso Three cases zzso more than three zzso and presented a pattern of zzso resistance to zzso according to zzso algorithm, while one case zzso more than three zzso and presented high degree resistance to zzso according to the Stanford zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were more frequent in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso 

According to the currently available zzso zzso can still be used in the majority of patients with virus showing resistance to zzso and/or zzso if a combination of other active drugs is zzso
