zzso patient databases zzso are used to distinguish between normal and abnormal zzso in zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and have gained wide acceptance in the clinical environment, yet there are limitations to this zzso This study introduces a zzso method for zzso zzso which attempts to overcome some of the NPD zzso 

Our approach involves the construction of a zzso digital healthy heart template from the zzso of the patient's left zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso template of the heart, filled with uniform activity, is then zzso projected and reconstructed using the same zzso as the original zzso zzso to generating zzso maps for the patient image zzso and the template image zzso a ratio zzso is zzso which produces a zzso corrected image zzso Finally, a threshold is used to define defects within CB enabling zzso of the zzso zzso extent zzso The zzso template zzso zzso were compared to those of a zzso zzso template zzso Twenty digital zzso were zzso male and female, each with one healthy heart and nine hearts with various zzso Four physical phantom studies were performed modeling a healthy heart and three hearts with different zzso The phantom represented a zzso with spine, zzso and left zzso zzso Images were acquired on General zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso camera using standard clinical zzso zzso Finally, our method was applied to 14 patient zzso zzso studies acquired on the GE zzso zzso zzso camera and compared to the results obtained from zzso zzso zzso 

In the simulation studies, the true zzso correlated well with the zzso zzso zzso offset zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso offset zzso zzso r zzso zzso methods with no significant differences between zzso Similarly, strong correlations were measured for zzso obtained from zzso and the template method for patient studies zzso zzso offset zzso zzso r zzso zzso Mean errors in extent for the zzso method using zzso physical zzso and patient data were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The authors introduced a method for zzso zzso zzso which offers a zzso approach to define the zzso zzso regions within the heart, as opposed to the zzso NPD zzso
