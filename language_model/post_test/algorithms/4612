Recently, several efficient zzso zzso coding zzso have been developed successfully for zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we first present a novel zzso and zzso approach to train the zzso according to the most representative texture zzso Based on the trained multiple template, we next present an efficient zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso In our proposed zzso algorithm, the input image is divided into many blocks and for each block, the best template is zzso selected from the zzso based on the texture feature of that zzso Under 20 testing zzso images and the personal computer with Intel zzso zzso zzso experimental results demonstrate that with a little zzso time degradation, zzso s zzso zzso on average, the zzso improvement ratio of our proposed zzso zzso over the joint zzso image group zzso standard zzso the previous block zzso coding for image zzso zzso zzso proposed by zzso and zzso is zzso zzso Under the same condition, the zzso improvement ratio of our proposed zzso over the previous zzso by Lee and Park is zzso and still only has a little zzso time degradation zzso s on zzso In addition, the zzso time required in the previous free zzso zzso is zzso s on average while our proposed zzso takes zzso zzso the average zzso ratio of our proposed zzso algorithm, zzso is quite competitive to that of the free zzso algorithm, zzso
