zzso molecular design supports drug discovery by suggesting novel zzso and compound modifications for lead structure zzso While the aspect of synthetic feasibility of the automatically designed compounds has been neglected for a long time, we are currently witnessing an increased interest in this zzso Here, we review state-of-the-art software for de zzso drug design with a special emphasis on zzso techniques that generate zzso zzso accessible zzso The importance of scoring functions that can be used to predict compound zzso and potency is zzso and several promising solutions are zzso Recent practical validation studies are presented that have already demonstrated that zzso zzso assembly can result in novel zzso compounds with zzso properties and a desired biological zzso
