The goal of feature selection is to identify the most zzso features for compact zzso whereas the goal of active learning is to select the most zzso instances for zzso Previous studies separately address these two problems, despite of the fact that selecting features and instances are dual operations over a data zzso In this paper, we consider the novel problem of simultaneously selecting the most zzso features and instances and develop a solution from the perspective of optimum experimental zzso That is, by using the selected features as the new representation and the selected instances as training data, the zzso of the zzso estimate of a learning function can be zzso Specifically, we propose a novel approach, which is called zzso criterion for Feature and zzso selection zzso to simultaneously identify the most zzso features and instances that minimize the trace of the zzso zzso zzso A greedy zzso is introduced to efficiently solve the zzso zzso Experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed zzso
