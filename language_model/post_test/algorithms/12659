The purpose of our study is to identify and zzso the association between high breast mass density and breast zzso using zzso logic programming zzso and conditional zzso and validate this association in an independent zzso We ran our zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso We set the zzso zzso system to generate 10,000 rules per zzso finding with a recall zzso and precision zzso zzso reported the best rule for each zzso zzso A total of 80 unique rules were zzso A zzso reviewed all rules and identified potentially interesting zzso High breast mass density appeared in zzso of the learned zzso We confirmed each interesting rule by calculating the probability of zzso given each zzso zzso High mass density was the fifth highest ranked zzso To validate the association between mass density and zzso in an independent zzso we collected data from 180 consecutive breast zzso performed between 2005 and zzso We created a zzso model with benign or zzso outcome as the dependent variable while controlling for potentially zzso zzso We calculated odds ratios based on zzso zzso In our zzso zzso model, the independent zzso high breast mass density zzso zzso zzso zzso irregular mass shape zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass margin zzso zzso zzso zzso and subject age zzso zzso significantly predicted zzso Both zzso and conditional probabilities show that high breast mass density is an important adjunct predictor of zzso and this association is confirmed in an independent data set of zzso collected zzso zzso
