We have developed a zzso zzso that incorporates a zzso system that uses both acceleration and angular zzso signals to trigger inflation of the zzso The zzso zzso was devised using a zzso technique with an zzso and gyro zzso Sixteen subjects zzso falls, and their acceleration zzso were zzso Then, we developed a zzso zzso that could detect signals 300 zzso before the zzso This signal was used as a trigger to zzso the zzso to a capacity of zzso zzso Although the proposed system can help to prevent zzso injuries, further development is needed to zzso the inflation zzso
