This study investigated the possibility of using zzso zzso to develop a simple portable gait analysis zzso zzso were attached on the skin surface of the shank and thigh segments and the angular zzso for each segment was recorded in each zzso zzso inclinations and knee angle were derived from segment angular zzso The angular signals from a motion analysis system were used to evaluate the angular zzso and the derived signals from the zzso There was a good correlation between these zzso When performing a turn the signals of segment inclination and knee angle zzso Two methods were used to solve this: automatically zzso the system to zzso the angle in each gait cycle, and zzso zzso They both successfully corrected this zzso A single zzso on the shank segment could provide information on segment inclination range, zzso number of steps, and an zzso of stride length and walking zzso
