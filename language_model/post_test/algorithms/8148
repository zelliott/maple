Smoothly varying and zzso intensity variations within MR images that are zzso can reduce the accuracy of automated brain zzso Fortunately, these can be zzso Among existing correction approaches, the zzso zzso intensity zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evans, zzso zzso zzso method for automatic correction of intensity zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso is one of the most frequently zzso However, at least one recent study zzso zzso Gunter, zzso Frost, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hill, zzso Bernstein, zzso Thompson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Alexander, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jack, zzso Fox, zzso zzso zzso zzso correction using zzso on zzso scanners with zzso phased array zzso zzso 39, zzso suggests that its performance on 3 T scanners with zzso zzso receiver coils can be improved by zzso a zzso that controls the zzso of the estimated bias zzso The present study not only confirms this finding, but additionally demonstrates the benefit of reducing the relevant zzso values to zzso zzso zzso value is 200 zzso on white matter surface zzso as well as the measurement of cortical and zzso structures using zzso zzso Imaging Centre, Boston, zzso This finding can help enhance precision in studies where zzso of cerebral zzso thickness is critical for making zzso
