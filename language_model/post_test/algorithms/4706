In this paper, a novel local surface zzso is proposed and applied to the problem of aligning partial views of a zzso zzso The zzso is based on taking zzso of the surface over each point using a virtual camera oriented zzso to the zzso This representation has the advantage of imposing minimal loss of information be robust to zzso and also be very efficient to zzso Then, we describe an efficient search technique to deal with the rotation ambiguity of our representation and zzso demonstrate the benefits of our approaches which are pronounced especially when we align views with small zzso
