A novel method for the trace analysis of natural and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in river water sample was developed, which involved stir bar zzso extraction zzso with in zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso conditions with zzso acid zzso and the zzso conditions such as sample volume and extraction time were zzso In addition, the single and zzso modes in TD were zzso The detection limits of zzso zzso and zzso in river water sample were zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso mode using five stir zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were linear and had correlation zzso zzso The average zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from all sample volumes were higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso with correction using an added surrogate standard such as zzso zzso or zzso This simple, accurate, sensitive and selective zzso method may be zzso to the determination of trace amounts of zzso in water zzso
