zzso networks are often employed as tools in zzso zzso The use of large networks increases the likelihood of the zzso being learned, although it may also lead to increased zzso zzso is an effective way of reducing the complexity of large zzso We present zzso components pruning zzso a method of pruning zzso of summed contributions between layers of a neural zzso zzso to interpret the underlying functions learned by the network can be aided by pruning the zzso zzso performance should be maintained at its optimal level following zzso We demonstrate zzso effectiveness at maintaining zzso performance, zzso to a wider range of problems, and the usefulness of such pruning for network zzso zzso enhancements are discussed for the identification of the optimal reduced rank and inclusion of zzso neural zzso functions in the pruning zzso
