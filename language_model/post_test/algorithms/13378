We have recently identified a number of active regulatory networks involved in diabetes progression in zzso zzso rats by network zzso The networks were quite consistent with the previous knowledge of the regulatory relationships between zzso factors zzso and their regulated zzso To study the underlying molecular mechanisms directly related to zzso changes, such as diseases, we also previously developed a zzso procedure for identifying zzso master regulators zzso in conjunction with network screening and network zzso by effectively zzso the zzso zzso 

In this work, we further improved our previous method for identifying MR candidates, by listing them in a more reliable manner, and applied the method to reveal the MR candidates for diabetes progression in zzso rats from the active zzso Specifically, the active zzso pairs for different time periods in zzso rats were first extracted from the networks by network zzso Another set of active zzso pairs was selected by network zzso by considering the gene expression signatures for those periods between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso pairs extracted by the two methods were then further selected, from the viewpoints of the emergence specificity of zzso in zzso rats and the zzso coverage of zzso in the expression zzso Finally, we narrowed all of the genes down to only 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the candidates of zzso with 54 regulated zzso by merging the selected zzso zzso 

The present method has successfully identified biologically plausible MR candidates, including the zzso related to diabetes in previous zzso Although the experimental zzso of the candidates and the present procedure are beyond the scope of this study, we narrowed down the candidates to 5 zzso which can be used to perform the zzso experiments relatively zzso The zzso results showed that our zzso method is an efficient way to detect the key molecules responsible for biological zzso
