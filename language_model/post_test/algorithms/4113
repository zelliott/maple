zzso generation zzso imaging can help reveal interactions between collagen fibers and cancer zzso zzso analysis of zzso images of collagen fibers is challenged by the zzso of collagen structures and low zzso ratio often found while imaging collagen in zzso The role of collagen in breast cancer progression can be assessed post acquisition via enhanced zzso To facilitate this, we have implemented and evaluated four zzso for zzso fiber information, such as number, zzso and zzso from a variety of zzso images of collagen in breast zzso The zzso zzso included a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are then extracted using an automated tracking zzso called fiber extraction zzso We evaluated the zzso performance by comparing zzso angle and position of the automatically extracted fibers with those of manually extracted fibers in zzso zzso images of breast zzso We found that the zzso filter followed by FIRE, a process we call zzso zzso the other zzso under zzso zzso was then successfully applied to track collagen fiber shape changes over time in an in zzso mouse model for breast zzso
