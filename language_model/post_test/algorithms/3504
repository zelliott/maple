We present a new zzso zzso method for zzso head detection in CT zzso The principal idea underlying our approach is to represent the zzso using active zzso Each ray has internal energy zzso and zzso zzso as well as external energy zzso edges and global zzso zzso The zzso nature of this representation allows a globally zzso zzso solution to be found using dynamic zzso Moreover, even pathological bone structures can be automatically zzso Several clinical situations on pelvis CT scan with hip degenerative change shows that this approach is more efficient than conventional zzso In this paper, we describe our method and discuss how it can be used to create zzso zzso models of the hip that are suitable for zzso zzso
