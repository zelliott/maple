One of the widely used methods for zzso that is a decision-making process is artificial immune zzso zzso immune systems based on natural immunity system can be successfully applied for zzso zzso recognition, and learning in real-world zzso In this study, a reinforcement learning based artificial immune zzso is proposed as a new zzso This approach uses reinforcement learning to find better zzso with immune zzso The proposed new approach has many contributions according to other methods in the literature such as effectiveness, less memory cell, high zzso speed, and data zzso The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results using real data in zzso and zzso Some benchmark data and remote image data are used for experimental zzso The comparative results with zzso based artificial immune system, negative selection zzso and resource limited artificial immune zzso are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new zzso
