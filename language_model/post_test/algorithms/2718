There are no objective selection criteria described in the literature for the zzso zzso zzso zzso versus lateral zzso zzso approach in a given zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the zzso we have been using in our zzso 

Within 11 years, 219 patients underwent zzso zzso at one zzso The zzso zzso technique was used in patients with unilateral tumors zzso zzso In those patients with unilateral tumors zzso zzso zzso parameters were used to select between zzso zzso and zzso zzso These parameters were zzso for 82 patients from zzso zzso scans and their effects on operative time were zzso zzso analyses were performed by use of the zzso test and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso zzso and 30 patients underwent zzso zzso Patients were selected for the zzso approach if the distance from zzso zzso to the skin was less than zzso and the 12th rib was at or zzso to the level of zzso zzso On zzso analysis, total operative time correlated with body mass index in the zzso approach and thickness of the zzso fat and the distance between the adrenal tumor and the upper pole of kidney in the zzso zzso 

In this study, we have described an objective zzso that can be used to select patients with unilateral adrenal tumors zzso zzso for a zzso zzso or zzso approach with favorable zzso zzso
