zzso zzso was investigated in zzso human zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso as a probe zzso zzso kinetic parameters zzso the zzso rate of zzso and zzso the inhibitor concentration at half the zzso zzso rate, were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were confirmed, and the influence of different elements of study design zzso cell number, stability of zzso dilution after zzso on estimated kinetic parameters were zzso zzso factors zzso of zzso 5 or total removal of inhibitor (by washing cells after zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that insufficient dilution may lead to zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso depletion during the zzso corrected zzso values were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso 5, and zzso zzso zzso efficiency in zzso as measured by zzso was zzso less than that previously reported in human liver zzso or zzso expressed zzso zzso causes for the observed differences between in zzso systems warrant further zzso These may include differences in zzso consumption of zzso in each system, zzso binding and presence of active zzso in zzso
