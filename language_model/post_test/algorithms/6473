A method for commissioning an zzso zzso Carlo simulation of medical zzso zzso beams through zzso lateral profiles at moderate depth in a water phantom is zzso Although zzso profiles are commonly used for nominal energy determination, our study shows that they are quite insensitive to energy changes below zzso zzso zzso zzso for a 6 zzso (15 zzso zzso zzso Also, the zzso profile dependence on beam radius adds an additional uncertainty in their use for tuning nominal zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso 40 zzso lateral profiles at 5 zzso depth in a water phantom show greater sensitivity to both nominal energy and zzso zzso parameters could be determined by comparing only these zzso with measured zzso
