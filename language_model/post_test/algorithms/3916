We examine the accuracy of a modified finite volume method compared to zzso and zzso Carlo solutions for solving the zzso transfer zzso The model is used for predicting light propagation within a two-dimensional absorbing and highly zzso medium such as biological tissue subjected to a zzso light zzso zzso simulations for the zzso resolved zzso and zzso are presented considering zzso index mismatch with zzso reflection at the zzso homogeneous and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso cases are zzso In the steady state, it is found that the modified finite volume method is in good agreement with the other two zzso The relative differences between the solutions are found to decrease with spatial mesh refinement applied for the modified finite volume method obtaining zzso In the time domain, the zzso zzso method is used for the time zzso of the zzso transfer zzso An agreement among the modified finite volume method, zzso method, and zzso Carlo solutions are zzso but with relative differences higher than in the steady zzso
