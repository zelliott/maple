We have previously shown zzso of zzso receptors increases zzso pump current zzso in guinea pig zzso zzso and the increase is eliminated by zzso of zzso C zzso In this study we examined the effect of zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso increased zzso at each test potential without shifting its zzso zzso The concentration required for a zzso response zzso was 6 zzso at 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso at 314 zzso zzso The zzso increase at either zzso was about zzso Another zzso of zzso 1, zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso was eliminated by the zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects both were sensitive to zzso blocked by zzso zzso unaffected by zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso at all zzso However, they differed in that zzso caused a maximum increase of zzso vs zzso via zzso and zzso were less sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso causes an increase in zzso in guinea pig zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso is entirely through zzso however zzso may be coupled to a specific population of zzso whereas zzso is a more global zzso
