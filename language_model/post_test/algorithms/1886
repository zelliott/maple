zzso proteins are a major class of proteins and zzso by approximately zzso to zzso of genes in most zzso In this work, a zzso novel membrane protein prediction system, called zzso is zzso It is able to first identify the protein query as a membrane or zzso zzso In the second level, it further identifies the type of membrane zzso The proposed zzso prediction system is based on hybrid features, zzso a fusion of both the zzso and split zzso acid zzso features is zzso This enables the proposed zzso to exploit the discrimination capabilities of both types of feature extraction zzso In addition, minimum zzso and maximum relevance has also been applied to reduce the zzso of a feature zzso We employ random forest, zzso zzso neighbor, and support zzso machine zzso as zzso and analyze their performance on two zzso zzso using hybrid features yields the highest accuracy of zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso for zzso and independent zzso tests, zzso The enhanced prediction performance of zzso is largely attributed to the exploitation of the discrimination power of the hybrid features and of the learning capability of zzso zzso is accessible at zzso
