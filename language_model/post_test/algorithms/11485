Using an improved version of an evolutionary zzso originally proposed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 101, 580 zzso we generated small gene regulatory networks in which the concentration of a target protein zzso in zzso These networks may serve as candidates for zzso zzso to be found in larger regulatory networks and protein interaction zzso The zzso was run for zzso times to produce a large set of zzso zzso which were systematically classified and zzso The zzso of the zzso against variations of the kinetic rates was also determined, to filter out the least robust zzso Furthermore, we show that the set of evolved networks can serve as a database of models whose behavior can be compared to zzso observed zzso The zzso found three smallest zzso zzso in which zzso and number of components are zzso Two of those are zzso zzso the mixed feedback loop, already discussed in the literature, and an zzso gene coupled with a zzso The third one is a single gene module which is competitively regulated by a zzso and a zzso The evolutionary zzso also generated larger zzso networks, which are in part extensions of the three core zzso and in part genuinely new zzso The latter includes zzso which do not rely on feedback induced by zzso factors, but are purely of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso mechanisms of zzso may provide useful information for zzso clock research, as recent experiments showed that zzso rhythms are maintained even in the absence of zzso
