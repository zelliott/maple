We report on observations of zzso that occurs when two zzso zzso fibers come together side by zzso A transient zzso object is formed which zzso zzso zzso We have been able to show how the strength of the interactions that drive this may be estimated by studying the frustrated structures sometimes formed between several zzso Our zzso when combined with mechanical zzso determined by an analysis of zzso zzso allow us to make the first estimate of the magnitude of these zzso of the order of zzso zzso zzso volume zzso of tens of zzso lead to significant depletion zzso We estimate the magnitude of both the depletion and Van der zzso forces between pairs of single zzso We study how these are zzso by the zzso nature of the fibers and zzso by zzso zzso calculations that could have wider applications beyond zzso zzso zzso Our theoretical analysis of single fibers is in encouraging, although not fully zzso agreement with our zzso We conclude that the physics and zzso of the zzso zzso as well as the pathology of zzso cell anemia itself, may be influenced by depletion zzso
