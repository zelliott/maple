The zzso of zzso zzso from zzso surveys using tests for recent infection has attracted much zzso It is increasingly recognized that the lack of high performance recent infection tests is hindering the zzso of this surveillance zzso With growing funding opportunities, test developers are currently trying to fill this zzso However, there is a lack of consensus and clear guidance for developers on the evaluation and zzso of candidate zzso A fundamental shift from conventional thinking about test performance is zzso away from metrics relevant in typical public health settings where the detection of a condition in individuals is of primary interest zzso zzso and zzso zzso and toward metrics that are appropriate when zzso a zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The inappropriate use of zzso zzso performance measures could lead to zzso assessments and zzso designs of tests for zzso zzso In some zzso such as zzso application to zzso zzso bias of estimates is essentially zzso and all that remains is the zzso of zzso The zzso of the precision of zzso estimates provides a completely general criterion for test developers to assess and zzso test zzso Summarizing the test dynamics into the properties relevant for zzso zzso high precision estimates are obtained when zzso the mean duration of recent infection is large, and zzso the zzso rate is zzso The optimal zzso between these two test properties will produce the highest precision, and therefore the most zzso useful zzso zzso
