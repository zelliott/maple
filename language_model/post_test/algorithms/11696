zzso zzso and anatomical signatures of disease in signals and images is one of the fundamental challenges in biomedical zzso The challenge is most apparent given that such signatures must be identified in spite of tremendous zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for uncovering these signatures has been the development of methods that exploit general statistical properties of natural zzso The signal processing and applied mathematics communities have developed, in recent years, signal representations which take advantage of zzso and zzso functions that zzso signal energy in a joint zzso and/or zzso zzso These techniques can be expressed as zzso zzso of which perhaps the best known is the zzso zzso In this paper we review zzso and other related zzso zzso within the context of identifying signatures for zzso These zzso construct a general representation of signals which can be used in zzso diagnosis and treatment zzso We present several examples where these zzso are applied to biomedical signal and imaging zzso These include zzso diagnosis in zzso real-time zzso of zzso zzso imagery, characterization of heart disease via zzso predicting zzso zzso and signature analysis of the zzso and reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso
