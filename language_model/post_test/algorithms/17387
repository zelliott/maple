zzso properties of zzso were studied in zzso by exposure of differentiated zzso human zzso cells for 72 zzso The number of zzso per cell and the total cellular protein content were determined every 24 h throughout the exposure and the subsequent zzso recovery zzso Using kinetic data on the metabolism of zzso in zzso a zzso model was constructed in which the in zzso toxicity data were zzso Using this model, we estimated the acute and zzso toxicity of zzso for the rat in zzso These zzso were compared to zzso derived lowest observed effect doses zzso for daily zzso exposure zzso 10, 30, and 90 zzso to zzso The estimated zzso differed zzso twofold from the experimental zzso and the zzso response to zzso exposure over time was simulated zzso It is concluded that the integration of the present in zzso toxicity data with kinetic data gives adequate estimates of acute and zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso
