Based on digital signal method, we propose a new representation of DNA primary zzso The representation can completely avoid loss of information in the transfer of data from a DNA sequence to its mathematical zzso zzso we suggest one such approach to reach zzso of similarities based on digital signal similarity zzso The examination of zzso among the coding sequences of the first zzso of zzso gene of 11 species shows the utility of the zzso
