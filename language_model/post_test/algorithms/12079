In a recent article zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso some interesting zzso properties of a series zzso with zzso zzso groups between the terminal zzso and zzso group were zzso In view of the practical importance of these zzso zzso zzso and their interesting biological properties a detailed zzso analysis was undertaken for the series with zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and terminal zzso zzso The puzzle posed by the reversal of the measured water zzso and zzso could be resolved by using the zzso Carlo approach to searching the zzso space of the molecules in this zzso We have found that the increase in water zzso and drop in zzso when the number of zzso groups is increased from 5 to 6 can be attributed to the change in zzso zzso in the zzso family as described by the zzso distribution of zzso Notwithstanding this, we point out the changes in biological response coupled to the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso
