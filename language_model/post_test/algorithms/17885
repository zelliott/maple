The mathematical theory of evidence is a zzso of the zzso theory of zzso It is one of the primary tools for knowledge representation and uncertainty and zzso reasoning and has found many zzso Using this theory to solve a specific problem is critically dependent on the availability of a mass function (or basic belief zzso In this paper, we consider the important problem of how to systematically derive mass functions from the common zzso data spaces and also the ensuing problem of how to zzso the various forms of belief function zzso We also consider how such a systematic approach can be used in practical pattern recognition zzso More specifically, we propose a novel method in which a mass function can be systematically derived from zzso data and present new methods that exploit the zzso structure of a zzso data space to zzso various belief functions including the belief, zzso and zzso functions in zzso We further consider the use of zzso as an equality zzso We also develop a zzso zzso zzso show that the equality checker and the zzso are comparable to state-of-the-art zzso
