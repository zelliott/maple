In this study, a zzso zzso feature extraction and decision tree induction protocol for breast cancer diagnosis using zzso images was zzso First, zzso field morphing and linear zzso transformation were applied in geometric zzso for whole body and partial region zzso Gray levels of zzso population at the same anatomical position were statistically analyzed for abnormal region zzso zzso closing and opening operations were used to identify unified abnormal zzso Three types of 25 feature parameters zzso 10 geometric, 7 zzso and 8 zzso were extracted for zzso factor zzso Positive and negative abnormal regions were further reclassified by decision trees to induce the zzso diagnostic zzso Finally, anatomical organ matching was zzso to identify the corresponding organ with the positive abnormal zzso To verify the zzso of the proposed zzso diagnostic zzso 71 and 131 female patients with and without breast cancer were zzso Experimental results indicated that 1750 abnormal regions zzso positive and zzso zzso were detected and zzso branches were broken down into the decision zzso Fourteen branches were found to have more than 4 positive abnormal zzso These critical diagnostic paths with less than zzso of positive abnormal regions zzso can effectively zzso more than half of the cancer patients zzso in the zzso 14 zzso
