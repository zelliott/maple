We describe a new zzso zzso based transcript zzso problem for zzso data that involves assembling novel transcripts in the context of an existing zzso This problem arises in the analysis of expression in model organisms, where it is desirable to leverage existing zzso for discovering novel zzso We present an zzso for reference zzso transcript assembly and show how it can be used to rapidly investigate novel transcripts revealed by zzso in comparison with a reference zzso 

The methods described in this article are implemented in the zzso suite of software for zzso freely available from zzso The software is released under the zzso zzso
