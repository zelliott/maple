zzso long-range dissemination of infectious diseases is a key issue in their dynamics and zzso Here, we use zzso mortality data to analyze the zzso progression of zzso influenza in the United States over the past 30 zzso zzso show zzso spatial spread evidenced by higher zzso zzso between more zzso zzso Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild zzso The regional spread of infection zzso more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their zzso zzso than with geographical zzso zzso are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid zzso of commuting up to around 100 zzso and a long tail of rare longer range zzso A simple zzso model, based on the gravity zzso captures the observed increase of influenza spatial zzso with zzso high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial zzso
