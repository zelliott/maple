An zzso zzso zzso system for zzso and small animal imaging was built and zzso The system used zzso zzso detector zzso (a charge coupled device zzso and zzso acquisition zzso Images were acquired using 540 zzso and 400 zzso The zzso transfer function zzso of the zzso zzso images demonstrated 50 zzso limiting resolution, with zzso zzso zzso for objects larger than 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso While soft tissue discrimination was compromised by a low zzso ratio, zzso zzso bone core samples and the zzso skeleton were well zzso The incorporation of multiple detector zzso provided a zzso improvement in zzso efficiency, which is a very important step toward improving the potential of zzso as a scientific zzso
