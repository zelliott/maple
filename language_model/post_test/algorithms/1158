Little is known about the design principles of zzso regulation networks that control gene expression in zzso Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation zzso To understand these complex wiring zzso we sought to break down such networks into basic building zzso We zzso the notion of zzso widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of zzso We define zzso zzso as patterns of zzso that recur in many different parts of a network at zzso much higher than those found in zzso zzso We applied new zzso for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the zzso regulation networks, that of direct zzso interactions in zzso zzso We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant zzso Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene zzso such as generating zzso expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external zzso The motif structure also allows an easily zzso view of the entire known zzso network of the zzso This approach may help define the basic zzso elements of other biological zzso
