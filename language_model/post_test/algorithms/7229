zzso images such as zzso color images or zzso medical images show a strong zzso zzso which is not exploited by most image processing zzso We propose a new notion of treating zzso images which is based on the angle between the spatial zzso of their zzso Through minimizing a cost functional that penalizes large angles, images with parallel level sets can be zzso After formally introducing this idea and the corresponding cost zzso we discuss their zzso derivatives that lead to a zzso zzso descent zzso We illustrate the properties of this cost functional by several examples in zzso and zzso of zzso color zzso They show that parallel level sets are a suitable concept for color image zzso zzso with parallel level sets gives visually perfect results for low noise zzso Furthermore, the proposed functional yields sharper images than the other approaches in zzso
