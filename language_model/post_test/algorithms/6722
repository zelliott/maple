Conventional measures of model fit for zzso data zzso time series or spatial zzso zzso errors in zzso for instance by zzso (or zzso the squared difference between predicted and measured values over a range of zzso We propose an approach which recognizes that errors can occur in the zzso as zzso Instead of just measuring the difference between the predictions and observations at each site (or time), we first zzso the predictions, stretching or zzso along the zzso or directions, so as to improve the agreement between the observations and the zzso zzso zzso is then summarized by zzso the amount of deformation in zzso and zzso the remaining difference in y between the data and the zzso predictions zzso the residual error in y after the zzso A zzso zzso controls the zzso between zzso and zzso so that as zzso no deformation is allowed, whereas for zzso the deformation zzso the errors in zzso In some applications, the deformation itself is of interest because it characterizes the zzso or zzso structure of the zzso The optimal deformation can be zzso by solving a system of zzso partial differential zzso or, for a zzso index, by using a dynamic programming zzso We illustrate the procedure with examples from zzso time series and fluid zzso
