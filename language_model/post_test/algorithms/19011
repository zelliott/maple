A new zzso universal model for the calculation of steady state zzso partition zzso zzso of organic chemicals in zzso species was zzso The approach allows the zzso of zzso based on the composition of the zzso in terms of water, neutral zzso neutral and zzso zzso and proteins using the zzso the binding to zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso fraction in blood plasma as compound specific zzso Taking explicitly into account the sign and fraction of the charge of the compounds at the zzso pH the method is universally zzso to neutral, zzso basic or multiply charged substances and has thus a significantly extended zzso compared to previously published zzso The model was applied to 59 chemically diverse drug compounds for which zzso partition zzso are reported in the zzso In total zzso zzso observed zzso values for 12 zzso and the red blood cells were available and could be compared to model zzso For zzso of the calculated values a zzso less than zzso from the respective observed value was found, proving the zzso of the zzso
