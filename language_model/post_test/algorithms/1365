A system is described that rapidly produces a regular zzso zzso data block suitable for processing by conventional image analysis and volume measurement zzso The system uses electromagnetic spatial location of zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso images, zzso zzso hardware, zzso computer processing and an efficient 3-D reconstruction zzso zzso of images from multiple angles of zzso zzso reduces zzso contrast, improves structure zzso within the reconstructed zzso image and enhances the ability to detect structure boundaries and to segment and zzso zzso Volume zzso using a series of zzso latex and zzso foam rubber zzso with volumes down to zzso zzso show that a high degree of zzso precision and zzso can be zzso Extension of the technique to handle in zzso data sets by allowing zzso criteria to be taken into account in selecting the images used for construction is also zzso
