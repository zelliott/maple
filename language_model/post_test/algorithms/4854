zzso induced dynamic nuclear polarization zzso of zzso other than zzso offers a tremendous potential for sensitivity enhancement in liquid state zzso under mild, zzso relevant zzso zzso enhancements of zzso zzso are much larger than those typically observed for zzso However, the low zzso ratio of zzso prevents a full fruition of the potential zzso gains zzso via zzso zzso Here, we propose two novel pulse zzso zzso and zzso tailored to overcome the above zzso zzso exploits the strong zzso polarization and its subsequent transfer to zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso combines zzso and zzso zzso The above pulse zzso tested on zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso were found to display up to zzso higher sensitivity than the reference zzso pulse train (based on simple zzso zzso followed by zzso polarization zzso and up to a zzso zzso increase in sensitivity over the corresponding dark pulse schemes zzso laser zzso The observed effects are consistent with the predictions from a theoretical model of zzso and prove the potential of zzso and zzso zzso in liquid state zzso correlation zzso
