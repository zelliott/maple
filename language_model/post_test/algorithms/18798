To determine zzso the current standard of reporting for studies of zzso detection zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso by systematically reviewing published zzso 

zzso was searched to identify study articles meeting the inclusion criteria for describing zzso for CT zzso in human zzso Data were extracted from eligible articles, grouped into five zzso technical description of zzso algorithm, description of subjects, acquisition of data, evaluation strategy used, and presentation of zzso zzso studies were scored for each domain and overall findings plotted as star zzso 

Although 21 zzso of the 23 studies included presented technical details of the zzso algorithm, zzso details used for model development and zzso were generally zzso Investigators in six zzso studies described the evaluation data set sufficiently for zzso investigators in eight zzso studies described age and sex demographics for subjects in whom zzso was zzso Investigators in 11 zzso studies presented zzso per zzso Investigators in 12 zzso studies described the reference standard against which zzso was zzso 11 zzso studies explicitly distinguished between development and evaluation zzso In nine zzso studies, the evaluation strategy used to test zzso could not be deduced at zzso zzso of subjects included for zzso development and evaluation was most poorly reported, with an average score per study of zzso in this zzso 

The reporting quality for studies of zzso for CT zzso is highly zzso key zzso details needed for informed assessment of the zzso of results are frequently zzso for which a minimum data set based on the observations is zzso
