In zzso scanning zzso imaging, light from a scene is focused onto a zzso mask using zzso scan zzso and collected on a single element zzso zzso one or several detectors replace the zzso zzso processing techniques are then applied to the one-dimensional signal to reproduce a two-dimensional zzso The zzso technique is presented in detail, including its mathematical foundations and some of its zzso It is shown how zzso imaging can be used in a zzso zzso and compares well with more conventional alternatives both in simplicity and zzso Examples of image reconstruction using zzso techniques are zzso
