In this paper, we propose a new reduced complexity model by expanding a zzso zzso model on zzso zzso zzso To ensure an efficient complexity reduction, the zzso associated to the input and the output of the zzso model are expanded on independent zzso zzso to develop a new black-box linear zzso model with filters on model input and zzso The zzso complexity reduction with respect to the classical zzso model is proved zzso The structure and zzso identification of the zzso model is achieved by a new proposed approach which consists in solving an zzso problem built from the zzso model without using system zzso zzso The performances of the resulting zzso model and the proposed identification approach are illustrated by zzso simulations and validated on benchmark manufactured by Feedback known as zzso zzso zzso A possible extension of the proposed model to a multivariable process is zzso
