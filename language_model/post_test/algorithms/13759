We examined the zzso zzso hypothesis in zzso using dynamic programming zzso matching zzso The zzso matching zzso was originally developed for the speech recognition to eliminate fluctuations of time axis caused by different speech zzso This zzso can determine the optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso between the standard zzso pattern and different zzso We found that this zzso worked well for various zzso patterns, even when their total writing time was different from the standard zzso Only 30 to 50 percent of handwriting movements showed zzso zzso The writing movements which didn't show zzso zzso consisted of several zzso zzso The borders between the units were not limited near the end of each zzso The results suggest that handwriting of a word does not show the zzso zzso and that it is executed by some discrete zzso zzso
