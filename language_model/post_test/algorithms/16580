The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of genetic tables and formal zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso based on zzso equations can predict zzso dose, but they require detailed mathematical zzso A simpler alternative, recently added to the zzso label by the zzso Food and Drug Administration, is to use zzso tables to estimate zzso zzso This table may potentially increase the use of zzso zzso dosing in clinical practice; however, its accuracy has not been zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of zzso patients from 3 zzso centers was zzso zzso criteria were stable therapeutic zzso dose and complete genetic and clinical zzso Five dose prediction methods were zzso 2 methods using only clinical information zzso 5 zzso dosing and a formal clinical zzso 2 genetic tables (the new zzso label table and a table based on mean dose zzso by zzso and 1 formal zzso algorithm, using both clinical and genetic zzso For each method, the proportion of patients whose predicted doses were within zzso of their actual therapeutic doses was zzso zzso methods were compared using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dose prediction was significantly more accurate (all p zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso than with all other zzso zzso dosing zzso odds ratio zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso label zzso zzso zzso and zzso mean dose table zzso zzso zzso 

Although genetic tables predicted zzso dose better than zzso zzso formal zzso zzso were the most zzso
