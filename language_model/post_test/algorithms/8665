The application of zzso networks to speech recognition is assessed using a set of eight representative phonetic discrimination problems chose with respect to a theory of zzso A zzso network model called the zzso flow model zzso is defined which represents zzso relationships using delay links and permits general patterns of zzso It is argued that the model has properties appropriate for time varying signals such as zzso Networks are trained using zzso descent methods of zzso zzso zzso to reduce the zzso error between the actual and the desired response of the output zzso Separate network solutions are demonstrated for all eight phonetic discrimination problems for one male zzso The network solutions are analyzed carefully and are shown in every case to make use of known acoustic phonetic zzso The network solutions vary in the degree to which they make use of zzso cues to achieve zzso zzso The network solutions were tested on data not used for training and achieved an average accuracy of zzso It is concluded that acoustic phonetic speech recognition can be accomplished using zzso zzso
