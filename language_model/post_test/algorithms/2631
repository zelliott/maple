zzso to zzso carriers is a proven strategy for improving the zzso of drugs, with many stable zzso zzso zzso having reached the zzso zzso zzso suffer several zzso loss of drug potency due to zzso zzso the drug to the zzso space, and the requirement for a circulating zzso Current research is directed toward overcoming such limitations through zzso zzso in which the drug is zzso linked to the carrier through a zzso zzso zzso zzso that provide predictable zzso rates zzso over a wide time range that are useful for both circulating and zzso zzso are not yet zzso We describe such zzso zzso on the basis of a zzso zzso reaction with zzso highly zzso zzso zzso A set of modular zzso is described that bears a zzso zzso group for attachment to an zzso drug or zzso an zzso group for zzso to the carrier, and a zzso zzso that controls the rate of zzso zzso The zzso provide zzso zzso release rates of zzso from zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso with zzso spanning from a range of hours to zzso y at zzso zzso A circulating zzso zzso achieved a zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso zzso in rats, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the latter may provide a generic format for zzso dosage forms of potent zzso The zzso zzso provide additional benefits that include lowering zzso and zzso coordination of drug zzso
