zzso and characterizing the zzso factor binding site zzso patterns of zzso elements represents a challenge, but holds promise to reveal the regulatory language the zzso uses to dictate zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that regulatory zzso are under positive selection and, therefore, are often zzso between related zzso Using this evolutionary principle, we have created a comparative zzso zzso for analyzing the regulatory potential of zzso zzso Our ability to zzso identify functional zzso sequences is extremely zzso therefore, zzso attempts to fill this great gap in zzso analysis by offering a powerful approach for eliminating zzso least likely to be biologically zzso The zzso tool combines zzso predictions, sequence comparisons and cluster analysis to identify zzso DNA regions that are zzso zzso and present in a specific zzso within zzso zzso Here, we present the newly developed version zzso of the zzso zzso which can process alignments generated by both the zzso and zzso alignment programs or use zzso zzso alignments of several zzso zzso available from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso web server is closely interconnected with the zzso database, allowing users to either search for zzso present in the zzso library collection or search for zzso consensus zzso The zzso tool is publicly available at zzso
