zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso treatment zzso that allows the delivery of intensity modulated radiation in a zzso zzso Due to the complexity of the treatment approach, it is desirable to have a simple tool for treatment delivery zzso zzso film placed under the patient is exposed to dose from most of the possible beam projections and therefore constitutes a useful in zzso zzso record of the whole zzso zzso were performed during the initial clinical zzso of zzso at the London Regional Cancer Centre on all patients during the first treatment zzso It was possible to predict the optical density of the film using a dose calculation on a phantom of similar size to the zzso The comparison of expected and delivered dose allows the zzso of dose delivery patterns which was found to be particularly useful in the case of treatment zzso The absolute dose measured with film differed in general by less than zzso from the expected one despite the fact that no zzso was used on the zzso The agreement improved with proximity of the primary target to the location of the film on the treatment zzso Due to the zzso delivery mode, zzso film was shown to be a useful, cheap and convenient method to verify dose delivery in zzso zzso
