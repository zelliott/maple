We report some basic results regarding transport in zzso zzso systems with birth zzso death zzso and zzso competition zzso zzso We consider a model in which the growth process is only allowed to take place in certain zzso the rest of zzso zzso hostile to zzso In the limit of low oasis density, transport is zzso through rare zzso events, zzso the inclusion of zzso effects in the zzso By first considering transport between two zzso we are able to derive an approximate expression for the average time taken for a population to traverse a zzso zzso
