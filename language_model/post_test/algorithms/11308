For most complex traits, results from zzso association studies show that the proportion of the zzso zzso attributable to the additive effects of individual zzso that is, the zzso explained by the zzso is substantially less than the estimate of zzso obtained by standard methods using correlations between zzso This difference has been called the zzso zzso One explanation is that zzso estimates from family (including zzso studies are biased zzso zzso et zzso revisited zzso of narrow sense zzso from twin studies as a result of zzso with zzso genetic zzso They propose a limiting zzso zzso model that generates significant zzso variation and its simple zzso provides a convenient way to explore implications of zzso They conclude that zzso of narrow sense zzso from family data zzso zzso may explain an important proportion of missing zzso We show that for highly zzso quantitative traits large phantom zzso estimates from twin studies are possible only if a large contribution of common environment is zzso The LP model is underpinned by strong assumptions that are unlikely to hold, including that all contributing pathways have the same mean and zzso and are zzso Here, we relax the assumptions that zzso the LP model to be more biologically zzso Together with zzso zzso and pragmatic arguments we conclude that in zzso populations the contribution of additive genetic zzso is likely to be much more important than the contribution of zzso zzso
