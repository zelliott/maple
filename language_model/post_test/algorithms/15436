In this paper, a new mathematical equation of zzso which was used to obtain interaction parameters (the binding constant zzso and the number of binding sites zzso between the protein and the small zzso zzso by using the zzso as a zzso zzso probe, was constructed for the first zzso The interaction parameters between zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso and zzso were obtained by this equation with zzso used as a FL probe, showing that the binding zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the number of binding sites zzso approximately equaled to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso were also studied by this zzso The binding zzso zzso were at zzso level, and the number of binding sites zzso mostly approximately equaled to zzso The binding ability of zzso to the studied proteins followed the zzso zzso
