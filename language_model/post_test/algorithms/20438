zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso involves a coordinated action of zzso on two zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have suggested that zzso zzso at zzso is required for opening of the channel, while zzso of zzso at zzso controls channel zzso We studied zzso gating of zzso in excised zzso patches from zzso zzso zzso zzso Single channel zzso of zzso gating at different zzso were zzso The closed time constant zzso decreased with increasing zzso to a minimum value of approximately zzso s at zzso zzso zzso The open time constant zzso increased with increasing zzso with a minimal zzso of approximately 260 zzso zzso analysis of zzso a zzso that zzso zzso zzso at zzso reveals the presence of two open zzso A short open state with a time constant of approximately 250 zzso is dominant at low zzso zzso (10 zzso and a much longer open state with a time constant of approximately 3 zzso is present at zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso binding and zzso at zzso is coupled to channel opening and that the channel can close without zzso interaction with zzso A quantitative zzso gating scheme with microscopic zzso was constructed based on the kinetic parameters derived from single-channel zzso The estimated values of the kinetic parameters suggest that zzso and zzso are neither functionally nor zzso zzso
