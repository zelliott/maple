Recently, zzso band signals have become attractive for their particular advantage of having high spatial resolution and good penetration ability which makes them suitable in medical zzso One of these applications is wireless detection of heart rate and zzso zzso Two hypothesis of zzso environment and fixed patient are considered in the method presented in previous zzso which are not valid for long term monitoring of zzso zzso In this article, a new method to detect the zzso rate of a moving target is zzso The first zzso is applied to the simulated and experimental data for detecting zzso rate of a fixed zzso Then, the second zzso is developed to detect zzso rate of a moving zzso The proposed zzso uses correlation for body movement zzso and then detects the zzso rate based on energy in frequency zzso The results of zzso prove an accuracy of zzso and zzso in simulated and experimental data, zzso
