zzso type I zzso 1) is a severe disorder causing early death if left zzso While zzso can be determined in dried blood spots zzso it is not a specific marker for zzso 1 and most often associated with benign transient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a specific marker for zzso 1 but not zzso by routine newborn zzso We developed a new zzso that determines zzso in zzso by zzso tandem mass zzso zzso 

Whole blood is zzso from a zzso zzso by an zzso solution containing zzso labeled zzso as internal standard zzso zzso and IS are zzso then zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso is from zzso spiked zzso zzso over the range zzso zzso using selected reaction monitoring of transitions zzso 212 to 156 and zzso 214 to 140 for zzso and zzso zzso Analysis time is 5 zzso To assess the effectiveness of a two-tier screening approach for zzso 1 we applied this zzso to our newborn screening program over the last 15 zzso 

The zzso precision was determined for three different levels of zzso zzso 20, and 50 zzso and the zzso calculated to be zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso precision zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively on the same zzso zzso levels in zzso from 10 confirmed zzso 1 cases not treated with zzso zzso were clearly abnormal zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso Over a zzso period, zzso was determined in newborn screening samples with elevated zzso zzso when applying different cut off values until it was settled at 150 zzso No case of zzso 1 was detected in zzso newborns zzso 

We have developed a new zzso based method for the determination of zzso in zzso This zzso has the potential to significantly reduce the number of false positive results in newborn screening for zzso 1 and can also be used for the laboratory follow up of patients treated for zzso zzso
