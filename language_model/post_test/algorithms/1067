We sought to assess the efficacy of a clinical protocol to reduce the zzso of zzso zzso group B zzso zzso zzso 

We assessed zzso zzso from zzso and other organisms with use of a zzso study design to evaluate the effects of zzso of combined zzso zzso prophylaxis given selectively to mothers with zzso risks and zzso G given to all zzso 

In 1994, zzso zzso infection developed in 31 of zzso live zzso zzso 13 zzso and 18 term zzso After zzso of the prophylaxis protocol zzso 6 of zzso live zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no zzso zzso zzso and 6 term zzso cases zzso zzso The efficacy continued through 1999 zzso without an increase in zzso infections from other zzso 

Combined maternal and infant zzso prophylaxis can significantly and safely reduce rates of zzso zzso infection in both zzso and term zzso
