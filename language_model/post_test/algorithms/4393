zzso in zzso feature density allow the construction of so-called zzso zzso These zzso or sets of zzso contain zzso targeting regions of zzso zzso at regular zzso zzso The unbiased nature of this approach allows for the identification of novel transcribed zzso the zzso of zzso factor binding sites zzso and high resolution comparative zzso zzso among other zzso These applications are quickly growing in popularity as zzso zzso become more zzso To reach maximum utility, the zzso zzso platform needs be developed to the point that 1 zzso resolutions are achieved and that we have confidence in individual zzso taken at this fine of zzso Any biases in zzso array signals must be systematically removed to achieve this zzso 

zzso this end, we investigated the importance of probe sequence composition on the efficacy of zzso zzso for identifying novel zzso and zzso factor binding zzso We found that zzso are highly sequence dependent and can greatly influence zzso We developed three metrics for assessing this sequence dependence and use them in evaluating existing zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we applied three new techniques for addressing this problem; one method, adapted from similar work on zzso brand zzso is based on modeling array signal as a linear function of probe zzso the second method extends this approach by zzso weighting and zzso of the model, and the third technique zzso the popular zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso to probe sequence zzso These three methods perform favorably to existing strategies, based on the metrics defined zzso
