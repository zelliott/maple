zzso pressure-sensitive paint zzso uses the dipping deposition method to apply a zzso on a porous zzso zzso We study the dipping zzso one of the parameters of the dipping deposition related to the characterization of zzso The dipping duration was varied from 1 to 100,000 zzso The properties characterized are the pressure sensitivity, temperature dependency, and signal zzso The maximum pressure sensitivity of zzso is obtained at the dipping duration of 100 zzso the minimum temperature dependency is obtained at the duration of 1 zzso and the maximum signal level is obtained at the duration of 1,000 zzso zzso Among the zzso the dipping duration most influences the signal zzso The change in the signal level is a factor of zzso By introducing a weight zzso an optimum dipping duration can be zzso Among all the dipping zzso such as the dipping zzso dipping zzso and zzso zzso the pressure sensitivity and signal level are most influenced by the dipping zzso
