A model of knee mobility able to predict the range and pattern of movement in the unloaded joint was proposed by Wilson et zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso The zzso surfaces in the lateral and zzso compartments and zzso zzso in three of the knee ligaments were represented as five constraints on motion between the zzso and zzso in a single zzso parallel spatial zzso The path of movement of the bones during passive zzso was found by solving the forward zzso of the mechanism using an zzso zzso The present paper shows that such a zzso solution approach can lead to an zzso of the zzso zzso This is due to the mechanism reaching a zzso zzso and zzso A new, zzso approach to the solution of the model joint displacement is zzso It avoids the representation of ligaments and zzso surfaces by zzso equivalent chains of one zzso pairs which are prone to zzso It relies instead on a zzso solution of five zzso constraint equations to find the relative positions of the bones at a series of zzso zzso The method is successful both in its ability to predict motion through a zzso range and in its efficiency with a solution rate zzso times faster than the original zzso The new approach may be extended to include more complex joint surface zzso allowing a study of the effects of zzso surface shape and ligament arrangement on joint zzso
