Previous works investigated a range of zzso models for zzso data analysis to provide robust determination of functional zzso zzso We present a novel zzso zzso model that is suitable for identifying a number of distinct zzso patterns and their spatial support in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signals on a single zzso are modeled as a zzso zzso of those zzso zzso The zzso varying influence of individual patterns is defined in terms of a zzso zzso The zzso pattern is zzso by both the underlying zzso response function zzso and a time series of the individual zzso zzso which makes the proposed model particularly suitable for modeling rapid zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso approach is adopted to represent the zzso The resulting methodology is zzso zzso and zzso zzso We first verify the proposed model in a controlled experimental setting using synthetic zzso The model is further applied to analyzing real zzso data, with focus on functional zzso within individual zzso
