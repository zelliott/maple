zzso are a group of zzso zzso that have a diverse zzso minimal nutritional requirements and zzso plasticity that has made them attractive organisms to use in zzso zzso The use of these organisms as cell factories requires the knowledge of their physiology and metabolism at a systems zzso For the zzso of gene transcripts real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso is the standard zzso However, to obtain reliable zzso results the use and validation of reference genes is zzso zzso this goal we have selected and analyzed twelve candidate reference genes from three zzso distinct zzso grown under routinely used laboratory zzso The six genes exhibiting less variation in each zzso were evaluated in terms of their expression stability using zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the minimum number of reference genes required for zzso was zzso Based on the three zzso we provide a list of genes for zzso zzso data zzso To our knowledge, this is the first work on the validation of reference genes for zzso zzso a valuable starting point for future zzso
