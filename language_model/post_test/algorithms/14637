zzso reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural zzso We discuss zzso decoding methods based on an zzso generalized linear model zzso that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of zzso The form of the zzso likelihood ensures that the zzso distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log zzso so long as the prior zzso This allows the maximum a zzso zzso stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient zzso zzso Unfortunately, the zzso estimate can have a relatively large average error when the zzso is highly zzso Here we compare several zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso that allow for the calculation of general zzso zzso involving zzso expectations zzso on model zzso An efficient version of the hybrid zzso Carlo zzso zzso was significantly superior to other zzso methods for zzso zzso When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the zzso zzso performed better than other zzso zzso Using these zzso we show that for this latter class of zzso the zzso mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than zzso whereas for zzso zzso the two zzso have roughly equal zzso We also address the application of zzso methods for zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso For example, by using zzso to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the zzso of a zzso efficient zzso approximation to this quantity for zzso zzso in a wide range of model zzso this makes direct zzso zzso of the mutual information zzso even in the case of large observed neural zzso where methods based on zzso the spike train zzso Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the zzso parameters on the zzso zzso
