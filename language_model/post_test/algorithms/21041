The aim of genetic mapping is to locate the zzso responsible for specific traits such as complex zzso These traits are normally caused by zzso at multiple zzso of unknown locations and zzso In this work, we model the biological system that relates DNA zzso with complex traits as a linear mixing zzso Given this model, we propose a new zzso genetic mapping method based on independent component zzso The proposed method zzso both independent associated groups of zzso in addition to specific associated zzso with the zzso It is applied to a clinical data set for the zzso disease with 368 individuals and 42 zzso It is also applied to a simulation study to investigate in more depth its zzso The obtained results demonstrate the novel characteristics of the proposed method compared to other genetic mapping zzso Finally, we study the zzso of the proposed method with missing zzso values and limited sample zzso
