zzso breast density is a strong breast cancer risk factor but is not used in the clinical setting, partly because of a lack of zzso and zzso We developed an automated and objective measurement of the zzso value variation within a zzso evaluated its association with breast cancer, and compared its performance with that of percent density zzso 

Three zzso studies were zzso a zzso study of 217 breast cancer case subjects and zzso zzso subjects and two zzso studies zzso zzso case subjects and 1039 control subjects and 246 case subjects and 516 control subjects, zzso zzso density was estimated from digitized zzso using the zzso zzso zzso program, and variation was estimated from an automated zzso We estimated hazards ratios zzso odds ratios zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso using Cox zzso hazards models for the cohort and zzso zzso for zzso studies, with adjustment for age and body mass zzso We performed a zzso using random study effects to obtain pooled estimates of the associations between the two zzso measures and breast zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

The variation measure was statistically significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer in all three studies zzso vs lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso all P zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk estimates and zzso for the variation measure were similar to zzso those for percent density zzso for variation zzso zzso and zzso zzso for percent density zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the three studies demonstrated similar associations zzso between variation and breast cancer zzso vs lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso percent density and breast cancer zzso vs lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

The association between the automated variation measure and the risk of breast cancer is at least as strong as that for percent zzso Efforts to further evaluate and translate the variation measure to the clinical setting are zzso
