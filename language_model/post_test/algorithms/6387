The present study investigated the effects of zzso and zzso upon repeating and varying sequences of zzso zzso were exposed to a multiple schedule with two zzso Under the zzso zzso water was provided if the current sequence of four responses differed from each of the five previous zzso under the zzso zzso water delivery was contingent upon a particular zzso zzso Each component was signaled by specific zzso zzso Overall, sequence zzso was affected by zzso and to a lesser degree, by zzso With the zzso zzso drug administration increased behavior variation, thus reducing zzso with the zzso zzso behavior variation and accuracy were not zzso These results were explained on the basis of the disruptive effects of both drugs upon the zzso control exerted by previous responses within a sequence and by zzso zzso
