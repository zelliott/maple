In zzso studies where subjects experience zzso incidents over a period of time, such as respiratory infections, fever or zzso statistical methods are required to take into account the zzso zzso 

For repeated events data with censored failure, the independent zzso zzso marginal zzso and conditional zzso models are three multiple failure models that zzso Cox's zzso hazard zzso In this paper, we revise the efficiency, accuracy and zzso of all three models under simulated scenarios with varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso levels, maximum number of possible zzso and sample zzso We also study the methods performance on a real zzso from a cohort study with zzso zzso 

We find substantial differences between methods and there is not an optimal zzso AG and zzso seem to be preferable to zzso for low correlation levels but the situation reverts for high zzso 

All methods are stable in front of zzso zzso with increasing recurrence levels and share a bias problem which, among other consequences, makes zzso normal confidence intervals not fully reliable, although they are well developed zzso
