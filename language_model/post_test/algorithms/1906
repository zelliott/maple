zzso inverse scattering zzso for zzso zzso objects are presented using zzso decomposition to form zzso representations of the scattering zzso These zzso extend zzso methods that are not zzso to zzso zzso scattering objects because the scattering operators for these objects do not have zzso zzso zzso A method of local reconstruction by segregation of scattering contributions from different local regions is also zzso zzso from each region is isolated by forming a zzso representation of the scattering operator that has domain and range spaces comprised of zzso patterns with zzso fields that focus on the local zzso zzso for the zzso of the boundary, average sound speed, and average zzso slope of the scattering object are also zzso These methods yielded approximations of scattering objects that were sufficiently accurate to allow residual variations to be reconstructed in a single zzso zzso scattering from a zzso elliptical object with a random background, internal features, and white noise is used to evaluate the proposed zzso Local reconstruction yielded images with spatial resolution that is finer than a half wavelength of the center frequency and reproduces sound speed and zzso slope with relative zzso errors of zzso and zzso zzso
