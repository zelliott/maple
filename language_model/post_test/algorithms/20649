The detection of zzso control elements in DNA sequences became both more important and more complicated by the completion of the first full zzso sequencing zzso Rapid evaluation of potential regulatory elements in large amounts of sequence data requires specific methods preferably available as zzso computer zzso However, many more zzso and methods have been published than programs are available, creating problems for scientists who try to select an appropriate method for their needs from the zzso The Internet provides a worldwide and relatively easy access to computer software if the user knows where to zzso One of the major problems remaining is how to find the appropriate zzso We have compiled a guide detailing where software is available and what is to be expected in terms of interface and data zzso with other zzso We also show results obtained with each program for several zzso The summarized features of each program should allow scientists to select quickly the method of their choice and inform them where to download the zzso
