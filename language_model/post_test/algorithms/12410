Single zzso zzso zzso constitute the most fundamental type of genetic variation in human zzso About 75 zzso of these reported variations cause an zzso acid change in the translated zzso An important goal in zzso research is to understand how this zzso affects protein function, and whether or not particular zzso are associated to disease zzso zzso the zzso database uses zzso and zzso zzso tools to predict the effect of zzso zzso on the molecular zzso of zzso zzso analyses the effect of zzso on three categories of functional zzso zzso structural and zzso properties affecting protein dynamics and stability zzso the integrity of functional and binding sites and zzso changes in zzso processing and cellular zzso of zzso The search interface of the database can be used to search specifically for zzso that are predicted to cause a change in one of these zzso Now based on the zzso human databases, the zzso database has been remodeled to better fit an automatically zzso zzso The current edition holds the molecular zzso of 74 zzso zzso in 23 zzso zzso 

zzso can be zzso through zzso
