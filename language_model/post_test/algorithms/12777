A general mathematical model is proposed to study the impact of group mixing in a zzso host population on the spread of a disease that zzso temporary immunity upon zzso The model contains general distribution functions that account for the probabilities that individuals remain in the recovered class after zzso For this model, the basic reproduction number zzso is zzso It is shown that if zzso zzso 1, then the disease dies out in the sense that the disease free equilibrium is globally zzso zzso whereas if zzso zzso 1, this equilibrium becomes zzso In this latter case, depending on the distribution functions and the group mixing strengths, the disease either persists at a constant endemic level or exhibits sustained zzso zzso
