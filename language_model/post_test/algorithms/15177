A novel method for acquiring and processing quality zzso zzso resolved zzso images in a single shot is introduced and zzso By contrast to the majority of zzso zzso imaging sequences developed so far, the method here discussed is not based on the acquisition of echo zzso data in the zzso but rather on the use of recently proposed zzso zzso zzso These techniques provide a robust alternative to classical techniques, as they can scan two spatial plus one spectral dimension by zzso a single imaging zzso This work demonstrates that the use of extended zzso zzso zzso coupled to new experimental zzso zzso zzso based on swept zzso rather than on chirped zzso can lead to novel zzso zzso tools for resolving complex zzso zzso images according to the chemical shifts in zzso zzso A number of zzso models were explored to clarify the relative merits of this technique and estimate its sensitivity zzso In zzso results of fat and water separation on abdominal imaging of mice at 7 T and on human breast imaging at 3 T are zzso
