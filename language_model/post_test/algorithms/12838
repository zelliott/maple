We have developed an zzso for zzso zzso diameter measurement by means of ultrasound and evaluated the zzso on zzso vessel zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso relative threshold detection on the inner slopes of the zzso walls before the resolution is improved by solving the equation of a straight line between the samples around the threshold zzso Further, correction distances added to compensate for the zzso when using the inner slopes were found to be 304 zzso for the near wall and 415 zzso for the far zzso The measured mean diameters of ten consecutive images of zzso 6- and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean differences between the images were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
