Recent development of zzso technology has accelerated interest in the development of molecular zzso zzso for safety assessment, disease zzso and zzso and prediction of response for patient zzso This article reviews and evaluates some important aspects and key issues in the development of zzso zzso Development of a zzso zzso for zzso data involves two zzso zzso model building and zzso performance zzso This article focuses on feature selection in model building and cross validation for performance zzso A zzso approach to feature selection is presented and compared to the zzso approach in terms of the zzso accuracy and stability of the selected feature zzso The two approaches are compared based on four zzso zzso each with a different feature selection method and well-known zzso zzso In each of the four zzso the feature predictor set selected by the frequency approach is more stable than the feature set selected by the conventional zzso
