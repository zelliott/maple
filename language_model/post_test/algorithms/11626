zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel expressed on sensory nerves that responds to noxious heat, zzso and chemical stimuli such as zzso zzso we have examined the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in models of inflammatory and zzso pain in the zzso zzso and guinea zzso In zzso animals, subcutaneous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect withdrawal thresholds to noxious zzso or mechanical zzso However, zzso with zzso prevented the development of mechanical zzso induced by zzso injection of zzso with a similar potency in all three zzso zzso (up to 100 zzso zzso did not affect mechanical zzso in the zzso complete zzso zzso hind paw of the rat or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced up to zzso reversal of zzso mechanical zzso in the guinea zzso zzso also produced significant reversal of zzso zzso zzso in the guinea pig at 30 zzso zzso but was ineffective in the zzso Similarly, in the partial zzso nerve zzso model of zzso pain, zzso was surprisingly effective in the guinea zzso producing up to zzso reversal of mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso but had no effect in the rat or zzso These data show that zzso zzso have zzso activity in animal models of chronic inflammatory and zzso pain, and illustrate species differences in the in zzso pharmacology of zzso that correlate with differences in pharmacology previously seen in zzso
