The objective was to compare zzso chest zzso zzso zzso reconstructed with filtered back projection zzso versus zzso images with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso mean body mass index, zzso zzso zzso referred for initial chest CT with zzso examinations zzso zzso product zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and follow-up chest CT with zzso examinations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso protocol was reconstructed with zzso the zzso protocol was reconstructed with zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction zzso Noise and zzso ratio were compared using a paired zzso zzso zzso zzso image quality and zzso zzso were compared using zzso signed ranks zzso 

zzso radiation dose of follow-up CT was about 50% zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Compared to zzso images with zzso there was no significant difference in zzso images with zzso in the objective noise zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso trachea on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso trachea on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Noise was significantly lower zzso and zzso was significantly higher zzso in zzso images with zzso on lung zzso Noise was significantly higher zzso and zzso was significantly lower zzso in zzso images with zzso zzso image quality was similar on both zzso images zzso and lung images zzso of zzso zzso images versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso image quality was significantly lower on both zzso images zzso and lung images zzso of zzso zzso images versus zzso zzso zzso The zzso of some zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung cyst, zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso CT images reconstructed with the conventional zzso algorithm, zzso with three zzso could provide similar or better image quality at 50% less zzso
