A proof of zzso for a general, standard, one-dimensional zzso and a zzso decreasing neighborhood function such that W zzso or zzso zzso is given, where N is the total number of zzso and W the zzso of the neighborhood zzso It is the zzso of already existing zzso for two specific cases with W zzso or zzso zzso zzso continuity of the distribution of the input is not a zzso The order p of the zzso where p zzso zzso + 1, if N mod W not zzso 0 or else p zzso zzso is fundamental to the zzso A total of zzso basic intervals of zzso probability on the support of the input are sufficient for zzso These basic intervals are separated by minimum distances which depend on parameters of the zzso zzso gain, neighborhood zzso The result gives a relationship which in a practical situation can be used to zzso for a given number of zzso and neighborhood function, the minimum number of discrete data points which can guarantee zzso
