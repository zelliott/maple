Drop zzso reactions were studied for group identification of zzso referring to as viral zzso bacterial zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso For their determination, the authors proposed a number of well-known reactions for preliminary detection of zzso if there was protein or protein components in a sample, as well as a series of reactions characteristic of some groups of zzso and their vital zzso The list was proposed to include not only tests for zzso and zzso activities and for zzso zzso but also those for the ability of suspension production, zzso which were specific signs of the presence and vital ability of zzso Drop reactions were made with eight indicator papers and a set of zzso used for control of the zzso and with a set of zzso solutions for zzso zzso A set of zzso and accessories provided the identification of 40 samples of zzso the analysis of one unknown sample took less than an zzso The authors developed an zzso for the sequence of tests depending on the combination of positive and negative effects of indicator means, namely an zzso for relating zzso to the above zzso zzso
