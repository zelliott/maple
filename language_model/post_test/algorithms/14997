A better understanding of the biological phenomena observed in cells requires the creation and analysis of mathematical models of cellular metabolism and zzso The zzso and study of such models must also be simplified as far as possible to cope with the increasing complexity demanded and exponential zzso of the zzso reconstructions zzso from zzso zzso 

A mathematical simulation zzso zzso has been developed to simplify the derivation and analysis of mathematical zzso It zzso zzso derivation of large-scale mathematical models from zzso reconstructions and other data zzso zzso solving and zzso continuation of zzso zzso equations zzso including zzso control zzso zzso solving the zzso stiff systems of ordinary differential equations zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso fitting to experimental data or functional criteria based on constrained zzso The zzso has been successfully used for dynamic zzso modeling of some typical zzso networks zzso et zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso Goldstein and zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso including microbial zzso zzso signal zzso pathways and zzso zzso
