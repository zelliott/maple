zzso zzso or zzso is a new drug, structurally related to zzso and to zzso zzso Its effects on cardiac zzso zzso current (I zzso were studied in pig single zzso zzso at 22 degrees C using the zzso (with zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly slowed I Na zzso due to the development of a zzso component zzso slow approximately equal 50 zzso at the expense of the normal, zzso component zzso fast approximately equal 2-3 zzso The effect was zzso with a zzso effective concentration zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also slowed the recovery from zzso and shifted the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to more negative zzso zzso cell dialysis with 10 zzso M zzso had marginal or no effect on zzso and did not prevent the effect of zzso applied zzso In zzso patches, zzso zzso prolonged zzso channel zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso and 10 zzso M zzso acid had no effect on zzso and did not prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso also had no effect on zzso but at 10 zzso M it increased I Na zzso and partially prevented the slowing of zzso by zzso These data suggest the existence of a binding site for zzso and zzso on zzso zzso
