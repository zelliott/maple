The establishment of a safe distance between sources of pollution and air zzso is based on a complex exercise that should take into account several wind, physical, and topographical zzso To estimate the maximum zzso of the pollutants as a function of the distance from the zzso source, some heating, zzso and air conditioning zzso system designers use the atmospheric zzso models suggested by the American Society of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two of these models, the zzso and zzso models, have been developed and evaluated mainly with laboratory zzso There have been relatively few evaluations with zzso field zzso The objective of this study, carried out on a building in downtown Montreal, zzso Canada, was to compare the measured zzso of a zzso gas zzso by an exhaust stack with those predicted by these zzso The results indicate that the zzso model gives lower than actual zzso while the zzso model generally gives acceptable estimates, with occasional zzso of the zzso
