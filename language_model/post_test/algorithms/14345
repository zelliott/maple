A geometrical method for computing overlap between vowel zzso the spectral overlap assessment metric zzso is applied to an investigation of spectral zzso zzso and zzso zzso relations in three different types of zzso one claimed to exhibit primary quality (American zzso one primary quantity zzso zzso and one about which no claims have been made zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of pairs of vowel zzso involved in zzso zzso are modeled using zzso zzso (in F1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each pair suggest that spectral and zzso features interact differently in the three varieties and zzso Under a two-dimensional analysis, two of three American English zzso show no zzso the third shows partial zzso All Jamaican Creole zzso exhibit complete overlap when F1 and zzso alone are zzso but no or partial overlap with incorporation of a factor for zzso Jamaican English three-dimensional overlap zzso resemble two-dimensional results for American zzso A zzso analysis tool such as zzso appears to provide a more objective basis for simultaneously investigating spectral and zzso relations within vowel zzso zzso methods and the zzso method are described in an extended zzso
