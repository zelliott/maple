Recent experiments on behaving monkeys have shown that learning a visual categorization task makes the zzso in zzso zzso zzso more selective to the zzso features of the stimuli zzso and zzso in Nature 415 zzso zzso We zzso that such a selectivity zzso emerges from the interaction between zzso and other cortical area, presumably the prefrontal zzso zzso where the previously learned stimulus categories are zzso We propose a biologically inspired model of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with plastic zzso modified according to a reward based zzso learning rule, to explain the experimental results and test the zzso of our zzso We assume that the zzso zzso receiving feature selective zzso form stronger connections with the category specific zzso to which they are consistently associated in rewarded zzso After learning, the zzso influence of zzso zzso enhances the selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso relevant features of the zzso as observed in the zzso We conclude that the zzso representation in visual areas like zzso can be strongly affected by the interaction with other areas which are devoted to higher cognitive zzso
