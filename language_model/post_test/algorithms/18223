zzso diffusion zzso with zzso zzso zzso are hampered by zzso of the zzso and background zzso For experiments based on a zzso echo pulse zzso that is preferred for samples with a zzso short compared to the diffusion time, a zzso scheme has been presented that avoids these zzso in each of the zzso and decoding periods zzso However, this approach suffers from a reduced zzso efficiency because the two zzso applied in each of the periods have effectively opposite zzso leading to a partial zzso An extension of this scheme is presented that involves an additional zzso pulse in each period and delivers an improved zzso efficiency without sacrificing the zzso zzso zzso expressions for the zzso pulse lengths and zzso are given for arbitrary timing zzso MR zzso with artificial zzso background zzso were performed to test the zzso compensation capability of the proposed zzso The results show that considerably higher zzso and b values can be achieved with the extension without changing the timing zzso The MR zzso yielded identical diffusion zzso without, with the same, and with different background zzso in the zzso and decoding periods demonstrating the zzso compensation of the presented zzso
