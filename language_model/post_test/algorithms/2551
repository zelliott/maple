The type of zzso oxygen species zzso is a major factor that determines the specificity of biological zzso These responses may be zzso by zzso of zzso factors that recognize zzso zzso elements in target zzso In search for zzso promoter motifs specific for particular types of zzso zzso zzso expression profiles for 283 zzso stress-related conditions were subjected to cluster analysis to identify gene groups induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these gene groups were analyzed to identify zzso elements that are associated with specific types of zzso Eleven zzso de zzso identified zzso seven known promoter motifs and several sequences enriched in zzso clusters but lacking in specificity are zzso The conservation of the identified motifs was determined in zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, biological functions were attributed to the motifs by calculation of zzso enrichment for genes with zzso zzso zzso
