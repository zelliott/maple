The high potential of zzso as modeling elements for image zzso tasks has been pointed out since years in the computer vision zzso In this work we employ zzso as modeling elements for multiple object zzso in range zzso zzso is executed in two zzso zzso a hypothesis about the values of the zzso parameters is zzso zzso the hypothesis is refined zzso In both zzso object boundary and region information are zzso zzso information is derived via zzso edge detection in the input range zzso zzso generation uses boundary information to isolate image regions which can be accurately described by zzso Within hypothesis zzso a zzso framework is used to fuse the two information sources by zzso an objective function to each information zzso zzso zzso of the two objective functions in succession, zzso a precise description of all image zzso We demonstrate zzso that this approach substantially improves the most established method in zzso zzso in terms of accuracy and zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso of our zzso framework in real world applications by constructing a novel robotic system for automatic unloading of zzso zzso objects from zzso
