A zzso zzso experiment is described for zzso spin zzso The experiment causes the net zzso zzso of the S spin to evolve only under the influence of one of the I zzso The experiment is based on a single pair of appropriately phased 90 degrees zzso zzso and the I spin causing the zzso zzso zzso is determined by the relative zzso between the two 90 degrees zzso The experiment is demonstrated on a sample of zzso
