How do we retrieve cartoon characters zzso Or how to zzso new cartoon clips smoothly and efficiently from the cartoon library? Both questions are important for animators and cartoon enthusiasts to design and create new cartoons by utilizing existing cartoon zzso The first key issue to answer those questions is to find a proper representation that describes the cartoon character zzso In this paper, we consider multiple features from different views, zzso color zzso zzso edge feature, and skeleton feature, to represent cartoon characters with different colors, shapes, and zzso Each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic of a cartoon character, and they are complementary to each other for retrieval and zzso However, how to combine the three visual features is the second key issue of our zzso By simply zzso them into a long zzso it will end up with the so-called zzso of zzso let alone their zzso embedded in different visual feature zzso Here, we introduce a zzso zzso zzso learning zzso algorithm, to zzso different features in a unified zzso Specifically, under the patch alignment zzso zzso uses the zzso information from labeled cartoon characters in the construction of local patches where the zzso structure revealed by zzso cartoon characters is zzso to capture the geometric zzso The experimental evaluations based on both cartoon character retrieval and clip synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cartoon zzso Moreover, additional results of zzso image retrieval on benchmark data suggest the zzso of zzso for other zzso
