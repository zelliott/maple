zzso up to zzso Natural products are of tremendous importance in both traditional and modern zzso For medicinal chemistry natural products represent a challenge, as their chemical synthesis and modification are complex zzso which require many, often zzso synthetic zzso A prerequisite for the design of zzso of natural products, with more accessible synthetic routes, is the availability of their zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso are the two techniques of choice to investigate the structure of natural zzso In this review, I describe the most recent advances in zzso to study the zzso of natural products either free in solution or bound to their cellular zzso In chapter 2, I focus on the use of residual zzso zzso zzso On the basis of a few examples, I discuss the benefit of zzso classical zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso to simultaneously determine both the zzso and the relative zzso of natural products in zzso Chapter 3 is dedicated to the study of the structure of natural products in complex with their cellular receptors and is further divided in two zzso In the first section, I describe two zzso zzso zzso to investigate the binding mode of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The first approach, zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is based on the observation of zzso zzso between two small molecules binding competitively to a common zzso zzso reveals the relative binding mode of the two zzso thus allowing zzso zzso The second approach is based on zzso relaxation enhancement zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso containing a zzso zzso In the second section, I focus on solid-state zzso zzso as a tool to access the zzso zzso of natural products in complex with zzso zzso
