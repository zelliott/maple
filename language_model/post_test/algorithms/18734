zzso triggering zzso is the most common manifestation of zzso zzso in mechanically zzso zzso IT in the zzso phase zzso accounts for the majority of IT and is associated with characteristic features of flow and airway pressure zzso caused by ineffective effort from the zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the characteristics of flow and airway pressure zzso of zzso and, using a computerized algorithm, to evaluate their usefulness in the detection of zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

Medical intensive care unit in a zzso university zzso 

A total of 14 mechanically zzso adult patients with zzso zzso 

zzso 

We analyzed zzso breaths and found that zzso were zzso The average values for maximum flow zzso zzso and maximum airway pressure zzso zzso in zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With a starting value of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of zzso and zzso for the detection of zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso and specificity for the detection of zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso respectively, for a zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso for a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that accurately detecting and zzso zzso is feasible using a computerized zzso based on zzso and zzso Such a computerized zzso of zzso interaction might be helpful for adjusting zzso settings in an intensive care zzso
