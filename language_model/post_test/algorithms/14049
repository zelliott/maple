zzso zzso zzso experiments are useful approaches for exploring biological zzso In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental zzso The large amount of data, zzso of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data zzso 

In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across zzso groups in zzso zzso The method is a zzso step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy zzso The procedure first adjusts a global zzso model with all the defined variables to identify zzso expressed zzso and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different zzso The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated zzso zzso
