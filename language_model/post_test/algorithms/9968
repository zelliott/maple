We investigate a zzso model with a large number of open zzso channels in order to describe avoided level crossing statistics in open chaotic zzso This model allows us to describe the fundamental changes in the probability distribution of the avoided level crossings compared with the closed zzso zzso expressions are derived for systems with preserved and broken zzso zzso We find that the zzso process zzso a modification at small zzso of the probability distribution of the avoided level crossings due to an attraction of the zzso The theoretical predictions are in complete agreement with the recent experimental results of zzso zzso zzso E 73, zzso zzso
