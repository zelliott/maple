zzso of zzso arteries are zzso resulting from incomplete fusion of primitive zzso An association with zzso is suggested in many zzso On conventional zzso zzso are rarely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides improved zzso of cerebral vessels from any desired zzso We used zzso to assess the frequency and location of zzso of zzso arteries and a possible relationship with zzso 

In 208 patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso of 1, 2, or 3 cerebral vessels (in zzso 16, and 49 zzso was reviewed for the presence and location of zzso and zzso When zzso were present in combination with zzso we noted the relationship of the zzso 

In 59 of 208 patients, 61 zzso were detected zzso zzso were more frequent in the anterior than in the zzso circulation zzso versus zzso and the most common location was the anterior zzso artery zzso zzso of 61, zzso The frequency of zzso in 185 patients with zzso was not different from the frequency in 23 patients without zzso Of 220 zzso present in 208 patients, 10 zzso zzso were located on a zzso Of 61 zzso 51 zzso were not associated with an zzso 

With zzso zzso were found in zzso of zzso In our study, zzso occurred more often in the anterior than in the zzso zzso and the most common location was the zzso A zzso relationship between zzso and zzso cannot be concluded from our zzso
