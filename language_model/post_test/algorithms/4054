zzso gel image analysis is widely recognized as a particularly challenging and arduous process in zzso zzso The detection and zzso of protein spots are two significant stages of this process as they can considerably affect the final biological conclusions of a zzso zzso The available techniques and commercial software packages deal with the existing challenges of zzso gel images in a different degree of zzso Furthermore, they require extensive human intervention which not only limits the zzso but unavoidably questions the objectivity and zzso of zzso This paper introduces a novel approach for the detection and zzso of protein spots on zzso gel zzso The proposed approach is based on zzso image zzso as well as on 3-D spots zzso It is automatic and capable to deal with the most common deficiencies of existing software programs and techniques in an effective zzso Experimental evaluation includes tests on several real and synthetic zzso gel images produced by different technology zzso containing a total of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the proposed approach has been compared with two commercial software packages as well as with two state-of-the-art zzso zzso have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority against compared software packages and zzso
