The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of liver zzso in patients with chronic zzso C by use of a method in which the zzso of the tissue texture of the liver on zzso ultrasound images is analyzed on the basis of results of a statistical zzso test of the echo zzso The method includes an zzso for removing small structures, such as cross sections of the thin vessels, in the background texture to minimize differences in analysis results between zzso 

Analysis was performed on images of 148 patients with zzso proven chronic zzso C without zzso The peak value of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was calculated from zzso ultrasound images, and the resulting value was compared with the zzso zzso zzso 

The peak zzso zzso value for grade F3 zzso was higher than that for grades zzso and F1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The value for grade zzso was higher than that for grades zzso and F1 zzso zzso zzso The values gradually increased with an increase in liver zzso grade, although no difference was found between grades zzso and zzso 

The grades of liver zzso in patients with chronic zzso C are well zzso with the zzso zzso analysis zzso without discrimination between grades zzso and zzso zzso on conventional ultrasound images may reflect progression of liver zzso even in the absence of zzso
