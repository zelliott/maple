zzso network analysis is an attractive approach for studying the functional integration of brain networks, as it includes both the locations of connections between regions of the brain zzso zzso and more zzso the direction of the zzso relationship between the regions zzso functional zzso Further, these approaches are more attractive than other functional connectivity analyses in that they can often operate on larger sets of zzso and run searches over a wide range of candidate zzso An important study by Smith et zzso zzso illustrated that many zzso network approaches did not perform well in identifying the zzso of connections in simulated zzso zzso Since then, new zzso network approaches have been developed that have overcome the failures in the Smith zzso Additionally, an important discovery was made that shows a zzso step used in the Smith data puts some of the zzso network methods at a zzso This work provides a review of zzso network zzso focusing on the methods used in the Smith work as well as methods developed since 2011 that have improved zzso zzso zzso only approaches that have been specifically designed for zzso data perform well, as they have been tailored to meet the challenges of zzso zzso Although this work does not suggest a single best model, it describes the class of models that perform best and highlights the features of these models that allow them to perform well on zzso zzso Specifically, methods that rely on zzso to direct zzso relationships in the network perform zzso
