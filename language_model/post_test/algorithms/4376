zzso sex zzso tumors zzso are rare and their diagnosis is often difficult to zzso Recently, zzso and molecular analysis for zzso box zzso zzso have been developed in this zzso This study aims to assess the benefit of an zzso incorporating these new tools for a better diagnosis and zzso of zzso 

zzso tumors with a potential diagnosis of zzso were addressed by 37 different zzso to one French rare zzso tumor expert center, member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso network zzso Then a zzso zzso zzso through an zzso incorporating zzso zzso and molecular analysis of zzso was performed for all these zzso This zzso was then validated by all zzso of the zzso zzso 

After a second opinion including molecular analysis and zzso for zzso the initial diagnosis was changed in 15 of 72 samples zzso zzso zzso was present in 44 out of 47 adult zzso cell tumors zzso in 3 out of 8 zzso zzso in 1 out of 10 zzso cell tumors zzso zzso and in 3 out of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was available in 45 cases of zzso zzso was expressed in 44 of them zzso 

A second opinion in an expert center for all cases of zzso is fundamental to get an optimal zzso of these rare zzso This second opinion could be performed with an zzso which zzso zzso zzso and expression status of zzso in order to zzso the zzso
