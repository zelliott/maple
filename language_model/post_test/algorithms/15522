The inverse problem of zzso aims to reconstruct the electrical activity occurring within the heart using information obtained zzso on the body zzso zzso obtained on the torso surface can be used as input for the inverse problem and an electrical image of the heart zzso There are a number of different inverse zzso currently used to produce electrical images of the zzso The relative performances of these inverse zzso at this stage is largely zzso Although there have been many simulation studies investigating the accuracy of each of these zzso to date, there has been no comprehensive study which compares a wide variety of inverse zzso By performing a detailed simulation study, we compare the performances of zzso potential zzso zzso singular value decomposition zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inverse simulations along with different methods of choosing the appropriate level of zzso zzso zzso composite residual and smoothing operator, zzso to apply to each of these inverse zzso We also examine the effects of a variety of signal error, material property error, geometric error and a combination of these errors on each of the zzso inverse zzso zzso from the simulation study show that the zzso method is able to produce solutions which are more accurate and stable than zzso methods especially in the presence of correlated errors such as geometric zzso In general, the zzso method produced the most realistic zzso solutions while the zzso and zzso were the preferred method for determining the zzso zzso The presence of signal or material property error has little effect on the inverse solutions when compared with the large errors which resulted from the presence of any geometric zzso In the presence of combined zzso and correlated errors representing conditions which may be encountered in an experimental or clinical environment, there was less zzso between zzso solutions produced by each of the inverse zzso
