zzso for discrete zzso of proteins play a central role in recent advances in protein structure prediction and zzso We wish to improve the resources available for zzso biologists to rapidly zzso such zzso and to easily scale these zzso to many zzso To that end, we describe the zzso and use of two new open source resources, citing potential benefits over existing zzso We discuss zzso a new zzso library for zzso zzso and zzso a framework for zzso zzso scripts to many zzso These tools allow users to develop new zzso for a variety of applications including protein zzso zzso zzso loop zzso or zzso model zzso zzso care was taken to allow modular energy function zzso protein zzso may currently be scored using either the zzso molecular mechanical energy function or an zzso zzso energy function employed by zzso
