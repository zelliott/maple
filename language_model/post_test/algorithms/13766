zzso is a self-contained package of tools for three-dimensional zzso analysis, written in the C language for Unix zzso It can evaluate direct zzso of three-dimensional real functions, inverse zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The library has been developed to support three-dimensional reconstructions of biological structures from projections obtained in the electron zzso This paper discusses some features of the library, which has been implemented in such a way as to profit from the resources of modern zzso A table of elapsed times for jobs of different dimensions with different zzso buffers is reported for the particular hardware used in the zzso zzso
