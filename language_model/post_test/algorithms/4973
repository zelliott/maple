zzso fluctuations of zzso zzso signal have been suggested to reflect functional connectivity among the involved zzso However, large-scale correlations are especially prone to zzso global zzso induced by coherent zzso zzso zzso and respiratory rhythms are the most offending zzso and a tailored zzso is needed in order to reduce their zzso Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, generally based on the use of zzso recordings acquired during the functional scans, or on the extraction of the relevant information directly from the zzso In this paper, the performances of the zzso approach based on general linear fitting of global signals of zzso extracted from the functional scans were zzso zzso suggested that this approach is sufficiently accurate for the zzso of functional connectivity zzso
