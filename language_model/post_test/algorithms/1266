This is a continuation of earlier studies on the evolution of infinite populations of zzso zzso within a genetic zzso zzso We had previously explored the evolutionary consequences of the existence of zzso where a plastic locus had a finite probability in each generation of functioning zzso switched zzso or not functioning zzso switched zzso The relative probabilities of the two outcomes were assigned on a zzso zzso The present paper examines what happens when the transition probabilities are biased by the presence of regulatory zzso We find that under certain conditions regulatory genes can improve the adaptation of the population and speed up the rate of evolution (on occasion at the cost of lowering the degree of zzso Also, the existence of regulatory zzso zzso selection in zzso of zzso There is a synergistic effect of regulatory genes on plastic zzso the frequency of such zzso increases when regulatory zzso are zzso Thus, zzso selection alone can be a zzso factor in a zzso of better zzso
