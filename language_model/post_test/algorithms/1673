The phenomenon of zzso resonance zzso is investigated in zzso and zzso zzso systems with zzso zzso It is found that the zzso zzso can induce change in the number of the steady stable states and then lead to zzso or zzso zzso Compared with zzso resonance in the ordinary systems, the following new results are found in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso system with zzso potential and ordinary zzso there is only one kind of zzso whereas there are zzso and two kinds of zzso for the case of zzso zzso The necessary condition for these new resonance behaviors is the value of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso system with zzso potential and ordinary zzso there is no zzso whereas there is a zzso for the case of zzso zzso The necessary condition for the new result is zzso zzso In the zzso system with zzso potential and ordinary zzso there are zzso and one kind of zzso whereas there are zzso and two kinds of zzso for the case of zzso zzso The necessary condition for the new zzso is zzso zzso In the zzso system with zzso potential, there is at most a zzso existing for both the cases of ordinary and zzso zzso In the zzso systems, varying the value of the zzso is equivalent to change the zzso zzso for some zzso
