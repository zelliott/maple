zzso zzso zzso zzso is a frequently used typing method for the analysis of the zzso relationships among strains of several clinically relevant microbial zzso zzso is based on the sequence of zzso genes that result in each strain having a distinct zzso zzso profile, which is zzso to a unique zzso the sequence type zzso The zzso between two strains can then be zzso by the differences between zzso zzso For a more comprehensive analysis of the possible patterns of evolutionary zzso a set of rules were proposed and implemented in the zzso zzso These rules allow the division of a data set into several clusters of related zzso dubbed zzso complexes, by implementing a simple model of zzso expansion and zzso Within each zzso complex, the rules identify which links between zzso zzso to the most probable pattern of zzso However, the zzso zzso is not globally zzso which can result in zzso within the zzso complexes, that violate the rules zzso 

Here, we present a globally zzso zzso of the zzso zzso - zzso The search for a global optimal solution led to the zzso of the problem as a graphic zzso for which greedy zzso that provide an optimal solution zzso Several public data sets of zzso data were tested and differences between the two zzso were found and are discussed for five bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A novel feature implemented in zzso is the representation of the level of zzso rule reached before deciding if a link should be drawn, which can used to visually evaluate the reliability of the represented hypothetical pattern of zzso 

zzso is a globally zzso zzso of the zzso algorithm, that identifies alternative patterns of descent for several bacterial zzso Furthermore, the zzso can be applied to any zzso typing data based on the number of differences between zzso zzso A software zzso is available at zzso
