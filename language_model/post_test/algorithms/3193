zzso projection reconstruction zzso techniques provide contrast enhanced MR zzso zzso with high zzso resolution, but sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso error and zzso zzso It is desirable to combine the time efficiency of zzso zzso acquisition with the zzso of Cartesian zzso In this work we present a technique designed to do this termed time resolved projection sampling with three-dimensional zzso Cartesian phase and slice zzso zzso where zzso Cartesian zzso is zzso into multiple half projections in the zzso zzso The phase and slice zzso are performed along zzso zzso zzso zzso The whole set of half projections is zzso into multiple groups of half projections, with each group sparsely but zzso covering the zzso zzso A view sharing sliding window reconstruction zzso is adapted to reconstruct the dynamic zzso The feasibility of the zzso technique for zzso was demonstrated on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of healthy volunteers with a high zzso resolution of 2 zzso
