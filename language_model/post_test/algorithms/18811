Recent advances in zzso promote zzso methods that aim to reduce zzso zzso zzso methods are required to identify the optimal zzso zzso drug zzso whose zzso will achieve the required effect of eliminating a given target set of compounds, while incurring minimal zzso We formulate the optimal zzso identification problem as an zzso problem on zzso zzso We define a graph based zzso damage model that encapsulates the impact of zzso onto compounds in zzso zzso We develop a zzso algorithm, named zzso to explore the search space zzso We also develop two filtering strategies to prune the search space while still guaranteeing an optimal zzso They zzso an upper bound to the number of target compounds eliminated and a lower bound to the zzso zzso Our experiments on the human zzso network demonstrate that the proposed zzso can accurately identify the target zzso for known successful drugs in the zzso Our experiments also show that zzso can reduce the total search time by several orders of magnitude as compared to the exhaustive zzso
