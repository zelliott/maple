zzso binding of zzso factors to DNA is crucial for gene zzso We derived models for the binding specificity of zzso factors of the nuclear zzso family to DNA using two zzso zzso a zzso method and zzso zzso Energy zzso zzso The analysis is based on experimental data for the interaction of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 16 different response elements in a total of 320 complexes zzso zzso Wright, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, 21, zzso The zzso abilities of the models obtained by the two methods are zzso The zzso analysis indicates that the most important properties for determining binding specificity for this zzso are the changes upon binding of the zzso free energies of the bases that are zzso in the zzso and the zzso interactions of the zzso zzso with certain charged zzso zzso Further important zzso are the changes of zzso free energy and surface area of the side chain of the zzso zzso It is clear, however, that there are additional features important for the specificity of binding that are not included in the models, such as differences in zzso zzso of the zzso
