With the increasing interest of using zzso measurement units zzso in human zzso studies, methods dealing with zzso sensor measurement errors become more and more zzso zzso zzso and zzso error compensation are commonly used to minimize the sensor errors and improve the accuracy of the walking speed zzso zzso However, the performance of a given sensor error compensation method does not only depend on the accuracy of the zzso or the sensor error zzso but also strongly relies on the selected sensor error zzso The best performance could be achieved only when the essential components of sensor errors are included and zzso Two new sensor error models, with the concerns about sensor acceleration measurement biases and sensor attachment zzso have been zzso The performance of these two error models were evaluated in the zzso zzso walking zzso zzso zzso with a comparison of an existing error zzso The treadmill walking experiment, conducted at both level and zzso conditions, demonstrated the importance of sensor error model selection on the zzso gait zzso zzso zzso zzso walking inclination zzso was made possible with a newly developed sensor error zzso
