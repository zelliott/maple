To assess whether the development and expression of behavioral zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is influenced by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats received every zzso days for a total of 10 treatments an injection of zzso zzso zzso together with an injection of either a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso locomotor activity was measured after each zzso Control rats were injected as appropriate with zzso zzso and zzso Following chronic treatment, zzso profiles to zzso were obtained to assess the expression of zzso the effect of zzso on locomotor activity in animals already zzso to zzso was also zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso with a zzso dose of zzso doubled the speed and magnitude of zzso to zzso while zzso zzso with a zzso dose of zzso switched the effects of zzso from locomotor depression to locomotor zzso However, zzso zzso with a zzso dose of zzso changed a different set of measures of zzso than did zzso with a zzso dose of the zzso zzso Together, findings suggest that zzso to zzso is not a zzso phenomenon but has components that are relatively independent, zzso by distinct zzso and zzso mechanisms and modulated by zzso zzso zzso
