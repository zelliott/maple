Often diagnosed at birth or in early childhood, zzso disease presents with a variety of clinical symptoms, particularly in zzso and zzso that require high energetic demand such as brain, heart, liver, and skeletal zzso In a group of pediatric patients identified as having complex I or zzso deficits on muscle biopsy but with white matter tissue appearing zzso normal for age, we hypothesized that quantitative zzso analyses might zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

In a retrospective study, zzso and structural MR brain imaging data from 10 pediatric patients with confirmed zzso disease and 10 clinical control subjects were matched for age, sex, scanning zzso and date of zzso zzso zzso was performed to evaluate differences in zzso MD, and the separate diffusion direction terms zzso and zzso 

In patients with zzso disease, significant widespread reductions in zzso values were shown in white matter zzso Mean zzso values were significantly increased in patients, having a zzso distribution of affected regions compared with zzso Separate diffusion maps showed significant increase in zzso and no significant changes in zzso 

Despite zzso zzso white matter zzso patients with complex I or zzso zzso have widespread zzso changes measurable with quantitative zzso
