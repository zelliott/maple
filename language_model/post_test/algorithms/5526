The effectiveness of peripheral nerve blocks is highly dependent on the accuracy at which the needle tip is zzso to the target injection zzso Even when electrical stimulation is zzso in combination with ultrasound guidance, determining the proximity of the needle tip to the target region close to the nerve can be zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide additional information about zzso that is complementary to these navigation zzso We demonstrate a novel needle zzso for acquiring zzso from tissue at the tip of a commercial zzso zzso The zzso has integrated optical fibers that deliver broadband light to tissue and receive scattered zzso Two zzso resolve the light that is received from tissue across the wavelength range of zzso zzso In our pilot study, zzso are acquired from a zzso dissection of the zzso zzso of a zzso Clear differences are observed between zzso acquired from nerves and those acquired from adjacent tissue zzso We conclude that zzso acquired with the zzso have the potential to increase the accuracy with which peripheral nerve blocks are zzso
