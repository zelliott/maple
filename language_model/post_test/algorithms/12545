Previous research has shown that zzso waves in the zzso are generally of long spatial wavelength and form smooth patterns of phase zzso at particular zzso This paper describes a method to measure smooth phase zzso of long spatial wavelength in the zzso The method depends on the global pattern of phase at a given frequency and time and is therefore robust to variations, over time, in zzso between particular zzso zzso were estimated in the zzso signal using zzso or short zzso zzso zzso During an auditory oddball task, zzso across the scalp tend to fall within a limited circular range, a range that is not indicative of zzso nor waves with multiple zzso At times the zzso tended to maintain a zzso and temporally ordered zzso The relative zzso were zzso using three phase zzso basis functions, providing a measure of the amount of zzso explained, across the electrodes, by smooth changes in relative phase from a single minimum or single zzso The data from zzso adult subjects were zzso and it was found that the probability of phase zzso events varies with time and frequency in the zzso average, and with task zzso The zzso extent of zzso waves was measured by detecting smoothly changing patterns of phase zzso across the zzso The specific spatial pattern and timing of phase zzso zzso closely to the zzso zzso of certain zzso
