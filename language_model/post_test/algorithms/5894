This study assessed the zzso effects of zzso in combination with zzso and zzso in a panel of human cancer cell zzso 

Growth zzso studies were performed using the human zzso colon cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso and zzso cancer line zzso zzso combinations were compared with zzso combinations in the same cell lines using similar experimental zzso zzso were exposed for 1 h to zzso and then for 24 h to zzso or zzso and vice zzso 

Single agent zzso displayed zzso effects against human colon zzso cells, human breast cancer cell lines including zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being the most sensitive cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso In all tested cell lines the zzso combination led to clear evidence of synergistic zzso In zzso and zzso the sequence zzso followed by zzso appears to be the most effective whereas in zzso cells, zzso given prior to or simultaneously with zzso is more effective than the other zzso The combination displays additive activity toward zzso zzso cells when zzso was administered prior to or simultaneously with zzso and partially synergistic when zzso was followed by zzso In most of the cell lines, the sequence zzso followed by zzso appears to be the most effective as compared to other zzso A combination of zzso with zzso has the same efficacy as with zzso for the same cell zzso Cell cycle studies show that zzso increases the proportion of cells in the S zzso zzso and zzso combinations block cells in zzso and zzso induce zzso 

zzso displays synergistic zzso and zzso effects when combined with zzso over a broad range of zzso in human colon and breast cancer zzso zzso resistance to zzso has limited impact on the effects of zzso and zzso zzso Based on these data, zzso and zzso combinations will be further explored in clinical trials, favoring the use schedules of zzso given prior to zzso in patients with zzso
