We present a method for zzso and zzso of magnetic resonance images zzso to zzso sections for comparison zzso This methodology consists of a modified head and hat zzso registration zzso followed by a new automated zzso approach using zzso thin plate zzso to compensate for zzso between the data zzso To test the methodology, 15 male zzso rats were subjected to focal cerebral zzso via permanent zzso of the middle cerebral zzso The zzso images were acquired in separate groups of animals at zzso h zzso zzso 9) and zzso h zzso zzso 6) zzso After imaging, animals were immediately sacrificed and zzso and zzso brain sections were obtained for zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and warped to zzso zzso The zzso zzso areas were defined using the zzso zzso filter zzso The zzso is a linear filter that zzso the projection of a desired tissue zzso zzso while it zzso the projection of zzso zzso zzso zzso onto a composite image called an zzso When using zzso without zzso the zzso zzso area demonstrated poor correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with a percent difference between the two zzso areas of zzso zzso zzso After zzso the zzso and zzso had significant correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a decreased percent difference of zzso zzso zzso This methodology is simple and robust for zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso sections and can be zzso in many applications for comparison of zzso to zzso zzso
