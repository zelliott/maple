Sample zzso and approximate zzso are measures that have been successfully zzso to study the deterministic dynamics of heart rate zzso A complementary zzso point of view and a zzso argument using the Central zzso zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso is a complementary measure of the zzso complexity of the underlying signal zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso is a widely used measure of zzso in many zzso Particularly important members of this family are differential (or zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We introduce the concepts of differential and conditional zzso zzso rate and, in conjunction with zzso zzso develop a measure of the zzso of a linear random zzso zzso zzso for zzso these quantities are presented along with estimates of their standard zzso
