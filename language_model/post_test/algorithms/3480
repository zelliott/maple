Construction of population zzso is a key issue in medical image analysis, and particularly in brain zzso Large sets of images are mapped into a common coordinate system to study zzso zzso and zzso differences, to provide zzso mapping of functional sites, and help tissue and object zzso via registration of anatomical zzso Common techniques often include the choice of a template image, which inherently introduces a zzso This paper describes a new method for unbiased construction of zzso in the large deformation zzso zzso A child zzso zzso study serves as a driving zzso There is lack of zzso data that explains average brain shape and zzso at this early stage of zzso We present work in progress toward constructing an unbiased zzso zzso of 2 years of children and the building of a zzso zzso of anatomical structures, here the zzso zzso Further, we demonstrate the zzso of new subjects via zzso zzso zzso of the methodology is performed by comparing the zzso zzso zzso with existing manual zzso
