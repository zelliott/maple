It is a challenging work to develop efficient zzso protocols for zzso zzso Mobile Sensor Networks zzso which have several unique characteristics such as sensor mobility, intermittent zzso energy limit, and delay zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso protocol called Minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso tailored for zzso zzso achieves a good zzso performance by finding and using the connected paths formed zzso by mobile zzso In zzso each sensor maintains two important zzso Minimum zzso zzso zzso and its expiration zzso According to zzso messages will be delivered to the sensor that has at least a connected path with their hosting zzso and has the shortest expected delay to communication directly with the sink zzso Because of the changing network zzso the path is fragile and volatile, so we use the expiration time of zzso to indicate the valid time of the path, and avoid wrong zzso zzso results show that the proposed zzso achieves a higher message delivery ratio with lower transmission overhead and data delivery delay than other zzso zzso zzso
