The index of refraction structure constant, zzso indicates how strongly the index of refraction varies in a region of the zzso These variations usually arise through turbulent motions, creating an zzso distribution of species, density, temperature and zzso Because the index of refraction also depends on zzso the measured value of zzso will depend on zzso This zzso difference generally becomes more pronounced as the difference in wavelength zzso This paper describes a technique for converting between zzso of zzso at different zzso and gives an example for converting from zzso to visible and near zzso zzso
