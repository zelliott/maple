The zzso system discriminates many different zzso although membrane zzso and zzso that bear them, are only broadly tuned to volatile zzso We investigated how mixed and redundant information carried by zzso could be efficiently coded by output zzso in the second zzso layer in the zzso We showed that a good discrimination is yielded if zzso that terminate on the same output zzso belong to several types, if these types are in different proportions for each output zzso and if each output zzso exerts an action on all others so that their independence is zzso according to the zzso and zzso zzso for separating linear zzso of independent zzso The proposed model details the zzso made by zzso and leads to a better understanding of several observed properties of the zzso system, among which the zzso actions of local zzso of the second layer and the zzso of insect zzso
