For the determination of material zzso it is a common practice to extract specimens with zzso zzso The design of the samples and the choice of the applied load are meant to lead to a homogeneous stress and strain distribution in a part of the zzso When applied to biological materials, this raises a number of problems: homogeneous strains cannot be obtained because the materials have zzso properties, and the manufacturing of samples is hard or sometimes zzso In this technical note a different approach is zzso based on the use of a digital image technique for the measurement of zzso strain zzso finite element modeling and the use of a zzso zzso The method is tested by means of experiments on an zzso elastic membrane of a woven and zzso zzso Five parameters are identified using the experimental data of one single zzso
