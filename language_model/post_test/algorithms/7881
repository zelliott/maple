zzso proteins play an essential role in regulating a balance between cell proliferation and zzso The successful prediction of zzso zzso of zzso proteins directly from primary sequence is much benefited to understand programmed cell death and drug zzso In this paper, by use of zzso zzso zzso acid composition zzso a total of 317 zzso proteins are predicted by support zzso machine zzso The zzso zzso is applied to test zzso capability of proposed zzso The zzso results show that overall prediction accuracy is zzso which is higher than previous zzso Furthermore, another zzso containing 98 zzso proteins is examined by proposed zzso The overall predicted successful rate is zzso
