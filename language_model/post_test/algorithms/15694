The equilibrium and zzso phase behavior of a protein suspension is investigated as a function of strength of zzso attraction and protein zzso The equilibrium phase behavior suggests that the range of the particle attractions is a small fraction of their zzso At volume zzso and strengths of attractions smaller than those characterizing the zzso of a zzso zzso transition, the suspensions gel before they zzso At higher volume zzso and lower strengths of attraction, gels are formed first from which zzso zzso over a period of zzso However, at higher strength of attraction, zzso form first at lower volume zzso while gels are observed at higher volume zzso We zzso that this behavior results from the competition between the rates of zzso and crystal zzso The location of the gel line is well predicted by mode zzso theories adapted for low volume zzso and square well zzso At low strength of attraction, the gel line occurs at small zzso suggesting gels will be seen before zzso However, at higher strengths of attraction the gel line occurs at greatly increased zzso such that crystal nucleation can occur before the gel line is zzso That mode zzso theories should predict zzso when zzso does not intervene is tested by investigating the gel zzso
