In electrical zzso zzso many factors affect the image reconstruction zzso Among them are the number of zzso zzso and the number of zzso basis functions zzso for image zzso The zzso generally reflects the density of the mesh with which images are zzso How and to what extent do these factors affect the image reconstruction and corresponding zzso In this area detailed analysis is still zzso This study aims to address the above zzso In this study, image reconstruction and its zzso condition were zzso by singular value decomposition zzso and spectral expansion theory with different zzso of zzso and zzso The results in this study indicate that for a circular zzso plane object with zzso evenly located around the zzso zzso Under certain conditions, increasing the zzso enables us to improve the zzso condition in image reconstruction and hence improve the image zzso Generally more improvement is expected near the image periphery than in the image zzso zzso zzso the zzso generally worsens the zzso zzso But it enables the solution to be sought in a finer zzso and may be able to improve the image quality on the zzso while generally the result in image zzso depends more on the prior information incorporated in the zzso
