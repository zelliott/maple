The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer zzso zzso has been recently validated as the best system for treatment guidance for zzso zzso zzso The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the usefulness of zzso in the treatment of zzso comparing our treatment decision and the zzso zzso zzso 

In 102 patients affected by zzso observed from 1991 to 2002 a retrospective analysis was zzso The choice of treatment was compared with the treatment schedule proposed by zzso Whereas the second group of 62 patients observed from 2008 to 2010 was zzso both zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso 

We found a disagreement in between our decision making and the choices suggested by zzso We only found a statistical significance for age and performance status zzso In surgical patients the median age and the zzso class were lower with a statistically significant p value zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso system would not have changed our decision either in the past, or in present days, especially in surgical zzso Even if the decision making is affected by zzso actually that process still needs the support of the experience of each clinical zzso zzso
