zzso is an iris recognition zzso developed in 1993 and continuously improved by zzso zzso zzso properties is extremely important because over 60 million people have been zzso enrolled by the zzso In this paper, zzso is proved to be a zzso algorithm, which is to say its templates are compressed iris zzso In our experiments, the zzso ratio of these images is zzso An zzso is designed to perform this zzso by exploiting a graph composed of the bit pairs in zzso prior knowledge from iris image databases, and the theoretical zzso To remove artifacts, two zzso techniques that carry out zzso in the zzso domain are zzso zzso iris images obtained from two public iris image databases are evaluated by visual comparison, two objective image quality assessment zzso and eight iris recognition zzso The experimental results show that the zzso iris images retain iris texture that their quality is roughly equivalent to a zzso quality factor of 10 and that the iris recognition methods can match the original images with the zzso zzso This paper also discusses the impacts of these theoretical and experimental findings on privacy and zzso
