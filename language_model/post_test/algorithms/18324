The zzso zzso and zzso functions of zzso zzso point process, used for zzso analyzing zzso spike trains, were derived from the corresponding functions of general zzso process using zzso delta zzso The zzso and zzso properties can be described as zzso differences on a zzso scale ranging from zzso zzso to zzso A zzso integration method and a significance test for the zzso zzso function estimate are zzso Examples from real spike trains are zzso and zzso Carlo methods are used for controls and for testing the zzso and computer zzso
