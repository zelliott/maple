zzso construction of zzso genes by in zzso zzso zzso precise building blocks from multiple parent zzso generating libraries of hybrids to be tested for zzso relationships and/or screened for favorable properties and novel zzso zzso A direct zzso and zzso method can construct zzso genes without requiring sequence identity between parents, except for the short zzso 3 zzso sequences of the zzso zzso used for specific zzso zzso planning of the assembly process is necessary, though, in order to ensure effective construction of desired zzso zzso and to avoid zzso zzso zzso repetition of fragments, fragments out of zzso We develop zzso for specific planned zzso of short zzso zzso that efficiently explore possible assembly plans, varying the zzso zzso and the order of zzso steps in the assembly zzso While there is a zzso explosion in the number of possible assembly plans as the number of zzso and parent genes increases, we employ a dynamic programming approach to find globally optimal ones in zzso zzso time (in practice, taking only seconds for basic assembly zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our zzso in planning the assembly of hybrid libraries, under a variety of experimental options and zzso including flexibility in the position and zzso acid sequence of zzso Our method promises to enable more effective application of zzso zzso to protein investigation and zzso
