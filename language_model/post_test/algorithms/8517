We study atomic models of the thermodynamics of the structural transition of peptides that form zzso The effect of sequence variation on zzso formation for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is investigated by atomic simulation studies of the thermodynamics of the zzso transition in explicit zzso The simulations show that the zzso group in the zzso side chains in the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso group four zzso acids upstream in the chain and zzso backbone hydrogen zzso This zzso can be directly correlated with a higher probability of hydrogen bond zzso We find that zzso has higher zzso content than zzso at all zzso A small modification in the amber force field reproduces the experimental zzso content and zzso transition temperatures for the zzso zzso
