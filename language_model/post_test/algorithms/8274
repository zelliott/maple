An emerging body of evidence suggests that ambient levels of air pollution during pregnancy are associated with zzso zzso 

To further investigate these relationships we used vital record data to construct a retrospective cohort of zzso zzso occurring between 1994 and 2004 in 5 central counties of metropolitan zzso Using a zzso approach, we examined zzso daily counts of zzso birth in relation to ambient levels of carbon zzso nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, zzso particulate matter zzso zzso in diameter zzso particulate matter zzso zzso in diameter zzso and zzso PM zzso Daily zzso levels in zzso Atlanta were characterized using a zzso spatial average of air quality monitors in the study zzso We also examined ambient zzso at individual monitors in analyses limited to mothers with residential zzso within 4 miles of each zzso zzso between average pollution levels during 3 zzso windows of interest were modeled using zzso generalized linear zzso zzso were adjusted for seasonal and long-term time zzso 

Although most results were zzso there were 3 positive associations between ambient pollution levels and zzso birth in the zzso zzso zzso Daily zzso birth rates were associated with average zzso zzso in the preceding 6 weeks and with average zzso zzso and zzso zzso metal zzso in the preceding zzso 

zzso provide limited support for zzso effects of ambient air pollution on zzso zzso
