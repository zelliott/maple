Two zzso zzso and zzso have been simultaneously determined using zzso kinetic zzso zzso upon alkaline zzso zzso In spite of the complexity of the system and of the serious spectral overlap among the zzso and products, zzso and prediction is possible thanks to the power of zzso zzso zzso Strategies such as parallel factor analysis zzso and zzso curve resolution coupled to alternating zzso zzso have been zzso which adequately exploit the zzso zzso They allow for a correct determination of the zzso both in synthetic zzso samples and in a commercial zzso in this latter case even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso partial zzso zzso produced good results only on synthetic zzso zzso but could not be applied to a commercial sample because it contained an zzso zzso
