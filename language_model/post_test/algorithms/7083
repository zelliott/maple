The automatic discrimination of zzso from pathological zzso by rate criteria alone lacks adequate zzso zzso detection zzso based upon zzso analysis of the zzso zzso have been attributed high specificity although their specificity has not been zzso A previous study had shown zzso zzso analysis zzso to be an zzso of high sensitivity in the detection of zzso zzso despite low zzso zzso In this study, the specificity and potential for automatic zzso have been zzso Manual adjustment of thresholds for individual patients gave a maximum potential sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso correctly recognized as zzso The use of automatic setting of thresholds reduced sensitivity to zzso The specificity of the algorithm, as assessed by exercise testing, was only zzso
