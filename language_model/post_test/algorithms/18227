A new scheme for obtaining zzso zzso with improved resolution or in a shorter time called zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso is proposed, which uses region selective zzso zzso and allows the sweep zzso to be adjusted individually for each zzso It thus zzso the problems with the zzso zzso associated with other method suggested for this zzso zzso of the zzso to their respective region is achieved by manipulating the zzso of the zzso zzso and/or their zzso zzso zzso can be applied without any previous knowledge of the chemical shift distribution, but can be further zzso on the basis of a quick overview zzso
