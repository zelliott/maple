zzso induce in the brain mechanical stresses that may explain the loss of consciousness feared by fighter zzso In this study, the brain is zzso as a zzso structure and a finite element method is used to identify the zzso law parameters of each domain and then to zzso the stress level in the zzso The loading and observed strain rates induced by zzso seem to indicate a zzso zzso of the brain zzso A general procedure has been developed to zzso the zzso of a structure including several zzso Each of them is assumed to be zzso and homogeneous with a linear zzso zzso These zzso laws were identified using only the zzso of several zzso on the envelope discarding the zzso between zzso at the interaction zzso These zzso may be buried inside the structure and not connected with the external zzso Two validation examples are proposed to show the reliability and effectiveness of the zzso
