We have developed an zzso and web tool to search similar protein structures in the zzso zzso Data zzso The zzso is a combination of a series of methods including protein zzso geometric feature zzso sequence zzso and zzso structure zzso Given a protein structure, the tool can efficiently discover similar structures from hundreds of thousands of structures stored in the zzso Our experimental results show that it is more accurate than other well-known protein search systems including zzso zzso and zzso in finding proteins that are structurally similar to the query zzso and its speed is also competitive with those zzso The zzso has been fully implemented and is accessible online at the address zzso which is supported by a cluster of zzso
