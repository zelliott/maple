zzso proteins are estimated to represent about zzso of open reading frames in fully zzso zzso However, the experimental study of proteins remains zzso zzso efforts have thus been made to develop prediction zzso Most of these were conceived to detect zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a membrane protein can be zzso and anchored via an zzso zzso inserted in a parallel way to the membrane zzso so-called zzso membrane zzso zzso This type of membrane anchor is still poorly understood and no suitable prediction method is currently zzso 

We report here the zzso method developed to predict zzso zzso It uses a set of 21 reported examples of zzso anchored zzso The method is based on a pattern recognition Support zzso zzso with a dedicated zzso 

zzso was shown to be highly specific, in contrast with classically used methods zzso zzso zzso Additionally, it has been able to retrieve zzso anchors in zzso tested sets of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and the list of the 21 zzso anchored proteins is available on zzso our protein sequence analysis zzso
