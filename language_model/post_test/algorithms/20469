A zzso programming paradigm is described as a formal basis for zzso chemical and physical zzso In this zzso the zzso are interpreted as the outcome arising out of interaction of elements in an object zzso The interactions can create new elements (or same elements with modified zzso or zzso old elements according to specific zzso Since the interaction rules are inherently zzso any number of actions can be performed zzso or competitively among the zzso of zzso so that the elements evolve toward an equilibrium or unstable or chaotic zzso Such an evolution may retain certain zzso properties of the attributes of the zzso The object space resembles zzso ensemble that zzso to a distribution of points in the space of positions and zzso (called phase zzso It permits the introduction of probabilities in rule zzso As each element of the ensemble changes over time, its phase point is carried into a new phase zzso The evolution of this probability cloud in phase space zzso to a distributed zzso zzso Thus, this paradigm can handle zzso deterministic exact zzso when the initial conditions are exactly specified and the trajectory of evolution is zzso Also, it can handle zzso mode of zzso if we want to derive zzso or bulk properties of zzso We also explain how to support this zzso paradigm using zzso like query processing and zzso
