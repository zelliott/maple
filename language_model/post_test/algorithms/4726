To develop a model for zzso dynamic and its relationship to local control after zzso zzso based on repeated dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations in zzso cancer zzso 

Ten zzso cancer patients were examined with dynamic zzso PET before zzso with 70 zzso and after approximately 20 zzso Two of these patients had two additional dynamic zzso scans during zzso Local recurrence was assessed by zzso zzso follow-up zzso months after zzso zzso values for the level of zzso retention R and the vascular zzso efficiency P were determined with a kinetic compartment zzso 

Individual zzso zzso before and during therapy were zzso and significant zzso changes in the characteristic zzso patterns were zzso A tumor control probability model was derived that involves the tissue parameters R and P and estimates the time to zzso On the basis of this model, a zzso value M was introduced and zzso by a fit to the observed outcome zzso zzso is reflected by the model as a progression to zzso tumor types zzso smaller values of zzso In 4 of 6 patients with severe zzso M had decreased after 20 zzso whereas 2 patients showed increasing zzso Four patients showed no zzso in the zzso zzso 

A tumor control probability model was developed based on repeated zzso PET scans during zzso The model combines the local zzso efficiency and the degree of zzso to estimate zzso zzso It constitutes a key for zzso zzso dose escalation in zzso
