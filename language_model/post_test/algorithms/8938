In everyday life, humans interact with a dynamic environment often requiring rapid adaptation of visual perception and motor zzso In particular, new zzso zzso must be learned while old skills have to be kept, such that after adaptation, subjects may be able to quickly change between two different modes of generating movements zzso A fundamental question is how the adaptation schedule determines the acquisition speed of new zzso Given a fixed number of movements in two different zzso will zzso be faster if switches zzso zzso between the environments occur more zzso We investigated the dynamics of zzso under different training schedules in a virtual pointing zzso Surprisingly, we found that acquisition speed of dual zzso zzso in a pointing task is largely independent of the number of phase zzso Next, we studied the zzso mechanisms underlying this result and other key phenomena of zzso by relating model simulations to experimental zzso We propose a simple and yet biologically plausible neural model consisting of a spatial mapping from an input layer to a pointing angle which is subjected to a global gain zzso zzso is performed by reinforcement learning on the model zzso Despite its zzso the model provides a unifying account for a broad range of experimental zzso It zzso reproduced the learning rates in zzso experiments for both direct effect, zzso adaptation to zzso and zzso zzso behavior after removal of zzso and their independence on the number of phase zzso Several other phenomena, zzso initial pointing errors that are far smaller than the induced optical shift, were also zzso Moreover, the underlying mechanisms, a local adaptation of a spatial mapping and a global adaptation of a gain factor, explained zzso spatial transfer and zzso of zzso adaptation, as observed in other zzso
