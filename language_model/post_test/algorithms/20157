The disruption of the zzso system has been associated with the development of zzso 

We examined the effects of zzso zzso on sleep, energy zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso 

Thirteen subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completed a zzso crossover zzso For each condition, subjects stayed time blinded in the zzso chamber during 3 zzso zzso cycles that resulted in a phase advance (3 zzso 21 zzso and a phase delay (3 zzso 27 zzso compared with during a zzso zzso zzso energy zzso zzso zzso and appetite were zzso Blood and saliva samples were taken to determine zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and cortisol zzso 

zzso zzso either phase advanced or phase delayed, did not result in any changes in appetite or energy zzso whereas zzso blood variables zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso followed the new meal zzso However, zzso zzso caused zzso of the zzso pattern zzso zzso zzso increased insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased rapid eye movement sleep zzso zzso zzso and the sleeping zzso rate zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The main effect of zzso zzso either phase advanced or phase delayed, is a zzso zzso of the zzso metabolism and zzso zzso whereas the energy balance or sleep is not largely zzso Chronically eating and sleeping at unusual zzso times may create a health risk through a zzso zzso This trial was registered at the International Clinical Trials zzso zzso zzso as zzso
