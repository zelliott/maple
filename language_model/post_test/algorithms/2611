The authors propose a general modeling framework called the general monotone model zzso which allows one to model psychological phenomena that manifest as zzso relations in behavior data without the need for making zzso precise assumptions about functional zzso Using both simulated and real data, the authors illustrate that zzso performs as well as or better than standard statistical approaches (including ordinary least squares, zzso and zzso zzso in terms of power and zzso accuracy when the functional relations are strictly linear but zzso these approaches under conditions in which the functional relations are monotone but zzso Finally, the authors recast their framework within the context of contemporary models of behavioral decision making, including the lens model and the zzso zzso and use zzso to highlight several important issues within the judgment and decision-making zzso
