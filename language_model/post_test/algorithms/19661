Effect of pressure and temperature on molecular motions and zzso zzso in zzso 50 zzso zzso melt has been studied by zzso relaxation zzso The zzso obtained over the pressure range, zzso zzso and temperature range, zzso K show a distribution of relaxation times greater than found in pure zzso The equilibrium zzso zzso and relaxation time, zzso of the melt increase with increase in pressure and decrease in temperature and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The pressure and temperature variation of the limiting high frequency zzso shows significant contribution from infrared zzso The volumes of zzso for zzso and zzso vary with both the pressure and temperature, indicating that there is also a structural effect that determine zzso This effect would add a zzso term to the zzso equation for variation of zzso with zzso The zzso liquid remains stable with time, and with change in temperature and pressure, suggesting that a more stable glassy state of a pharmaceutical may be obtained by mixing a second zzso
