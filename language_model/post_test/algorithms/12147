zzso enhancement has an important role in image processing zzso Conventional contrast enhancement techniques either often fail to produce satisfactory results for a broad variety of zzso images, or cannot be automatically applied to different images, because their parameters must be specified manually to produce a satisfactory result for a given zzso This paper describes a new automatic method for contrast zzso The basic procedure is to first group the zzso components of a zzso image into a proper number of bins according to a selected zzso then zzso these bins zzso over the zzso and finally zzso the previously grouped zzso zzso this new technique is named zzso grouping zzso zzso not only produces results superior to conventional contrast enhancement techniques, but is also fully automatic in most circumstances, and is zzso to a broad variety of zzso An extension of zzso selective zzso zzso and its variations will be discussed in Part II of this zzso zzso selectively groups and zzso zzso components to achieve specific application purposes, such as eliminating background noise, enhancing a specific segment of the zzso and so zzso The extension of zzso to color images will also be discussed in Part zzso
