Brain structural complexity has zzso prior efforts to extract quantitative zzso zzso We present a systematic zzso and zzso methodology for analyzing three-dimensional zzso zzso images of brain tissue to delineate and zzso key structures, and zzso quantitative associations among zzso To demonstrate the method, thick ( approximately 100 zzso slices of rat brain tissue were labeled using three to five fluorescent signals, and zzso using spectral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tracing zzso were used to delineate cell zzso zzso and cell zzso From these zzso a set of 23 intrinsic and 8 zzso zzso zzso was zzso for each zzso These features were used to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso among cells and between cells and zzso were zzso and represented as zzso networks to enable further zzso The automated results were validated using a zzso interface that permits investigator inspection and corrective editing of each cell in zzso Nuclear counting accuracy was zzso and cell zzso accuracy ranged from 81 to zzso depending on cell zzso We present a software system named zzso implementing our zzso Its output is a detailed zzso file containing zzso that may be used for diverse quantitative zzso and exploratory studies of the central nervous zzso
