The problem of zzso magnetic zzso zzso from zzso zzso is addressed zzso The objective of this work was to identify source grid parameters that provide a good condition for the related linear inverse zzso The parameters investigated here were the number of sources, the extension of the source grid, and the source zzso A new measure of the condition, the ratio between the largest and mean singular value of the lead field zzso is zzso Our results indicated that the source zzso should be larger than the sensor zzso The sources and, consequently, the magnetic zzso field, should be directed toward the zzso For zzso linear inverse problems, such as in our application, the number of sources affects the condition to a relatively small zzso zzso zzso linear inverse problems, however, benefit from a reduction in the number of sources, which considerably improves the zzso The adapted source zzso proposed here were used to estimate the zzso zzso from simulated zzso the zzso zzso and distances between the estimated and simulated sources were significantly zzso
