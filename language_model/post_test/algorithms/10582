One of the main obstacles to the wider use of the modern zzso codes is that, due to the complex behavior of their decoding zzso no systematic method which would allow characterization of the zzso zzso is zzso This is especially true at the weak noise where many systems operate and where coding performance is difficult to estimate because of the zzso small number of zzso We show how the zzso method of physics allows one to solve the problem of zzso analysis in the weak noise range by recasting it as a zzso zzso zzso zzso
