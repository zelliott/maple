zzso is increasingly used to treat systemic zzso zzso zzso although its success, as judged by either zzso or clinical means, is difficult to zzso The aim of the study was to zzso blood flow through zzso zzso with zzso which, because of its relatively long transit time through peripheral zzso behaves like zzso Following zzso injection, zzso entering an zzso shunt rapidly arrives in the lung and can be zzso with a zzso zzso In 17 patients with systemic zzso zzso the reduction in shunt flow following therapeutic zzso was zzso in the zzso theatre by comparing the initial count rates in the zzso recorded by probe, following injection of identical quantities of zzso into a zzso artery before and after zzso By comparing the lung counts with those given by an intravenous injection of zzso the fraction of flow at the zzso tip entering the shunt was also zzso zzso zzso in the vascular territory zzso to the shunt was measured at the same time by recording the clearance of zzso zzso with a second probe over the zzso Control injections of zzso were given in the zzso limb in order to assess zzso transit in the absence of zzso and to compare tissue zzso between the two zzso zzso flow ranged from zzso to zzso (of that at the tip of the zzso zzso zzso zzso while the reduction in shunt flow following zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the shunt and in the zzso limb was about 5 zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso medium had no consistent effect on tissue zzso in either zzso or on shunt zzso There was no difference in peripheral zzso between the abnormal and control sides, nor any significant difference in zzso in the zzso tissue on the abnormal side before and after zzso There was, however, a consistent increase in the fraction of the injected zzso delivered to the zzso tissue after zzso zzso increase zzso p zzso zzso The technique is relatively simple and merits further development as a means of continuous zzso of systemic zzso shunt flow in the zzso theatre at the time of zzso
