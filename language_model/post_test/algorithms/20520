During the last five years, several methods have been proposed for handling zzso constraints using evolutionary zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Recent survey papers zzso these methods into four zzso preservation of zzso penalty functions, searching for zzso and other zzso In this paper we investigate a new approach for solving constrained zzso zzso problems which incorporates a zzso mapping between zzso cube and a feasible search zzso This approach constitutes an example of the fifth zzso category of constraint handling zzso We demonstrate the power of this new approach on several test cases and discuss its further zzso
