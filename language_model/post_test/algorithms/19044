The critical zzso of zzso zzso chain in a simple cubic lattice onto a flat surface is studied with zzso Carlo zzso The dependence of number of surface contacts M on chain length N and zzso interaction zzso is investigated by a zzso zzso zzso We estimate the critical zzso point zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso behaviors M zzso zzso N for zzso and M zzso zzso zzso for zzso are also obtained from the zzso zzso zzso We have also estimated the critical zzso point by using zzso zzso method as well as zzso zzso
