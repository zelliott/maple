A new method is proposed to establish the statistical zzso model for liver diseases zzso zzso the zzso theory is used to construct the zzso zzso and then zzso zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso is used to establish the statistical zzso model and select the feature from the region of zzso at the same time different features have different zzso and finally, Support zzso zzso zzso zzso Colony zzso zzso is used to establish the zzso for the recognition of liver zzso In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, zzso zzso method and normal zzso method are chosen as the contrast zzso The experimental results show that the proposed method can reconstruct liver volume better and improve the zzso accuracy of liver zzso
