For zzso zzso zzso correction is zzso Many different models of CT are available with zzso zzso Our study compares clinical cardiac zzso images that were zzso corrected using zzso CT and high-speed CT transmission zzso 

We evaluated 59 zzso zzso studies from patients who had undergone both a zzso with a zzso CT and a zzso study on a zzso camera equipped with a high-speed CT zzso Each zzso study was reconstructed with transmission maps from both CT scans and the relative zzso was assessed using zzso zzso The summed zzso difference scores zzso were compared as well as the test zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the mean zzso zzso or zzso with the use of either CT for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 as zzso there was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 as zzso there was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso test showed no significant zzso 

There were no significant differences between using a high-speed CT and using a zzso CT for zzso correction of zzso zzso zzso zzso
