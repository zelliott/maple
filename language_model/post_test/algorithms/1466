The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of ultrasound zzso tracking in various zzso zzso from two-dimensional tissue zzso tracking in liver, muscle, fat, and sponge samples are zzso while keeping other zzso tracking parameters zzso zzso tracking performance was characterized both in terms of the magnitude of tracking errors and in terms of the percentage of correctly tracked displacement zzso zzso tracking in muscle zzso which contains zzso and significant tissue zzso produced the highest percentage of correctly tracked zzso and smallest tracking errors relative to other zzso
