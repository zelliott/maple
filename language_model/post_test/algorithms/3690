zzso geometry and fiber orientation may undergo global or local zzso in cardiac zzso However, there are as yet no mathematical and zzso methods for zzso variation of geometry and fiber orientation or the nature of their zzso in zzso Toward this goal, a landmark and image zzso large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso method to transform heart geometry into common coordinates for zzso of shape and form was zzso Two automated landmark placement methods for modeling tissue zzso expected in different cardiac zzso are zzso The zzso zzso using the combined use of landmarks and image zzso yields zzso accuracy of heart zzso even in the presence of significant variation of cardiac shape and zzso Once heart zzso have been zzso properties of tissue geometry and cardiac fiber orientation in corresponding regions of different hearts may be zzso
