zzso distortion zzso is a simple approach to analyze lung tissue zzso zzso This study aimed to characterize zzso behavior of HD at several zzso in lung tissue strips from healthy rats and its influence on the parameters of linear zzso Lung strips zzso zzso 17) were subjected to zzso deformation at three different strain zzso zzso and fixed operational stress (12 zzso among various zzso between zzso and 3 zzso zzso HD was zzso in all zzso The main findings in our study can be summarized as zzso 1) harmonic distortion of stress zzso showed a positive frequency and zzso dependence following a power law with zzso 2) HD correlated significantly with the frequency response of dynamic zzso seeming to zzso to a limited range at an zzso point where zzso 3) the relationship between tissue zzso zzso and zzso (the harmonic distortion at zzso zzso was linear and accounted for a large part of the zzso zzso of zzso 4) zzso depended zzso on zzso (the power law zzso of HD with zzso and 5) the error of the constant phase model could be corrected by taking into account the frequency dependence of harmonic zzso We concluded that tissue elasticity and tissue zzso are coupled at the level of the zzso element and to the mechanisms underlying dynamic zzso of lung zzso
