To correct for spatial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cardiac MR zzso images caused by respiratory and patient zzso 

Twenty zzso studies from consecutive patients with separate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were zzso We automatically registered the zzso zzso and zzso images in three dimensions by minimizing the cost function derived from plane zzso for all zzso zzso The automatic alignment was compared with manual alignment by two zzso 

The processing time for the proposed method was zzso seconds, compared to zzso minutes for the manual zzso The initial plane displacement identified by the observers was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso A displacement of zzso zzso was identified in 15 of 20 zzso The registration accuracy zzso as the difference between the automatic parameters and those obtained by visual zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso alignment and zzso alignment in the zzso zzso and zzso regions, zzso The zzso zzso was higher in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the mid zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions zzso P zzso zzso 

An automated zzso zzso can reduce spatial zzso between multiple zzso images acquired at different zzso and plane zzso
