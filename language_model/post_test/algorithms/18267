This paper is focused on the problem of complete synchronization in zzso of zzso driven identical or slightly different zzso These zzso are coupled by common driving which makes an occurrence of generalized synchronization between a driving signal and response zzso zzso zzso the phenomenon of generalized synchronization is also analyzed zzso The research is concentrated on the cases of an irregular zzso or zzso driving signal acting on zzso zzso systems) and zzso zzso zzso response zzso As a tool for zzso the zzso of the synchronized state, response zzso zzso zzso are zzso The most significant result presented in this paper is a novel method of zzso of the largest response zzso zzso This approach is based on the complete synchronization of two twin response zzso via additional zzso zzso between zzso Examples of the method application and its comparison with the classical zzso for calculation of zzso zzso are widely zzso Finally, the idea of effective response zzso zzso which allows us to zzso the zzso in case of slightly different response zzso is zzso
