zzso zzso comparisons of proteins separated by high resolution two-dimensional protein zzso present a number of zzso These problems may arise zzso variations in zzso and other mechanical zzso of samples, protein loss during transfer from the first to the second gel dimension, variations in zzso and/or variations in film development during zzso in the case of zzso labeled zzso This study presents a discussion of these issues and a zzso zzso to deal with variations, which relies on a class of proteins present in most biological samples which by their nature may be considered internal zzso This class consists of proteins which are controlled by zzso zzso zzso genes are genes that are expressed zzso We have developed an zzso which is currently available as a zzso zzso in the computerized zzso and protein comparison analysis program, developed by Olson & Miller zzso This zzso identifies potentially zzso zzso A zzso method employing these potentially zzso proteins was compared to several others by examining zzso of proteins from developing gypsy zzso zzso zzso zzso insect zzso Following zzso zzso comparisons of spots, which were zzso as zzso were observed to vary less in density than when no zzso method was used, or when zzso based on total integrated spot density was zzso In addition to its use as a zzso zzso this zzso and the zzso zzso may be useful as an aid in biological studies to identify zzso zzso
