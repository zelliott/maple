A simple surface zzso zzso zzso detection zzso was developed for improved zzso definition of initiation and zzso of muscle activity during periodic motion when maximum voluntary zzso are zzso to zzso For the zzso of zzso zzso periods of a signal as percentages of normal cycle zzso two interrelated and variable thresholds of percent zzso and duration of a zzso cycle were the analyzed zzso into an zzso zzso for statistical analysis were total percent zzso per cycle, standard zzso of activity per cycle, and zzso zzso of where the signal turned on and zzso zzso activity per cycle had a zzso of zzso of zzso zzso After the user chose whether to consider the signal for either encompassing all zzso activity or peak activity only, resulting zzso of variation for percent activity were reduced to zzso zzso The results indicated the feasibility of a zzso simple zzso for zzso decomposition of zzso zzso The need for a modifiable threshold zzso to incorporate varying needs of salient activity levels was also zzso
