The effect of binding of zzso to human liver zzso and to zzso from human zzso cells on the zzso of zzso kinetic parameters describing zzso to zzso was investigated using a combination of zzso binding and in zzso zzso kinetic zzso zzso binding in both zzso increased with higher zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso in human liver zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and was independent of zzso concentration over a concentration range of zzso to 200 zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to native human liver zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso rate in a protein concentration dependent zzso This effect was greater at lower zzso zzso and was overcome by zzso zzso of zzso thereby decreasing the apparent affinities of the zzso and zzso components of the zzso process, with minimal effect on the net zzso zzso of metabolically inactive zzso from zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the apparent zzso value for zzso zzso by zzso and increased the uncompetitive zzso zzso constant zzso by zzso making zzso zzso essentially zzso A similar effect was seen with zzso with a zzso increase in the zzso zzso concentration at which zzso zzso of a Hill zzso is zzso zzso binding did not alter the zzso of either zzso zzso to any appreciable zzso These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating zzso binding in the zzso of zzso kinetic parameters in zzso and making appropriate corrections for zzso drug zzso
