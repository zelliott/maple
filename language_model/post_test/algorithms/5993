Lead zzso and cadmium zzso are known zzso zzso which accumulate in zzso cells of the zzso Female Charles foster rats were treated with sodium zzso zzso lead zzso and cadmium zzso either alone or in combination at a dose zzso zzso body weight zzso for 15 days zzso Animals were killed at zzso stage and zzso cells were isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso and zzso zzso activity were zzso As these receptors are localized on the surface of the cell zzso we also estimated the membrane parameters of these zzso Our results demonstrated that both lead and cadmium caused a significant reduction in zzso zzso which altered zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso These changes exhibited a positive correlation with membrane changes of the zzso zzso
