Our aim was to compare zzso zzso and cardiovascular risk zzso of coronary artery calcium zzso between electron beam CT and zzso with retrospective zzso zzso AND zzso One hundred patients underwent both electron beam CT and zzso and coronary artery calcium score, volume, and mass were zzso 

zzso between the two CT scanners was high for both calcium score zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso Although electron beam CT is viewed as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity in the detection of zzso using zzso with a threshold of 130 H were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of calcium scores between the two CT scanners zzso was comparable with two electron beam CT scanners reported zzso The zzso of calcium volume zzso and mass zzso was lower than that of the score zzso zzso test, r zzso zzso zzso In clinical cardiovascular risk zzso based on two CT calcium scores, the Cohen's zzso value was zzso There was no significant difference between the two scanners using zzso signed rank test zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso scanner with retrospective zzso showing high agreement for detection and zzso of zzso with electron beam CT, holds promise in the detection of coronary artery zzso
