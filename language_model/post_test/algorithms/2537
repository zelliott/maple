zzso involving thousands of zzso hypotheses have been addressed by zzso the local false discovery rate zzso A previous zzso approach to reporting point and zzso estimates of an zzso zzso uses an estimate of the prior distribution of the zzso conditional on the alternative zzso That estimated prior is often zzso and yet strongly influences the zzso intervals and point estimates, causing the zzso intervals to differ from zzso confidence zzso even for arbitrarily small estimates of the zzso That influence of the estimated prior zzso the failure of the conditional zzso zzso given the truth of the alternative hypothesis, to match the confidence zzso Those problems are overcome by changing the zzso distribution conditional on the alternative hypothesis from a zzso zzso to a confidence zzso Unlike the zzso zzso the confidence zzso zzso the zzso probability that the zzso lies in a fixed zzso with the coverage rate of the coinciding confidence zzso The resulting zzso hybrid zzso supplies zzso and point estimates that shrink toward the zzso hypothesis zzso The confidence intervals tend to be much shorter than their zzso counterparts, as illustrated with gene expression zzso zzso nonetheless confirm that the zzso confidence intervals cover the zzso more frequently than zzso Generally zzso sufficient conditions for correct coverage are zzso In addition to having those zzso properties, the hybrid zzso can also be motivated from an objective zzso perspective by requiring zzso with some default prior conditional on the alternative zzso That requirement generates a new class of approximate zzso that supplement zzso factors modified for improper zzso and that dampen the influence of proper zzso on the credibility zzso While that class of zzso zzso the class of zzso zzso neither class is a subset of the zzso In short, two first principles generate both classes of zzso a zzso principle and a relevance zzso The zzso principle requires that all effect size estimates comply with the same probability zzso The relevance principle means effect size estimates given the truth of an alternative hypothesis cannot depend on whether that truth was known prior to observing the data or whether it was learned from the zzso
