zzso skin moisture measurement based on zzso zzso zzso is proposed in the spectral range from zzso to 2000 zzso A gap is introduced between the optical fiber probe and the skin surface in order to avoid zzso surface zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments for measuring the water content of skin are zzso The measured zzso zzso are processed by zzso zzso zzso results are compared with the water content values obtained by a zzso zzso The correlations between the optical method and the zzso method obtained by zzso squares zzso are higher than those obtained by multiple linear zzso In addition, a zzso Carlo simulation is implemented to evaluate measurement depths of the optical zzso It is presented that the measurement depth of the optical method depends largely on the water zzso The simulation result also shows that the measurement depth of the optical method is much deeper than the depth of the zzso method, especially in the spectral range where water zzso is relatively zzso
