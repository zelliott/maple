zzso storage disease type zzso zzso is caused by an inherited zzso in the zzso zzso The recent advent of targeted zzso delivery zzso of zzso DNA zzso to the liver in conjunction with zzso may provide an alternative treatment zzso This study focuses on determining the zzso accessible liver volume in zzso patients using zzso models of various zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso with longer focal lengths and smaller zzso (up to an zzso of 2) are able to access larger liver volumes in zzso patients while still being capable of delivering the required ultrasound dose in zzso zzso zzso peak negative pressure at the zzso With sufficiently large acoustic windows and the ability to use zzso to easily assess zzso zzso appears to be a good model for testing zzso as proof of principle as a potential therapy for liver applications in zzso
