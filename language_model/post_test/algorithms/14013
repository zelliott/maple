A distinctive signature of living systems is zzso evolution, that is, a propensity to generate as well as zzso individual zzso To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics of zzso mathematical models must be rooted in the zzso zzso description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several zzso traits and interacting with each zzso The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and zzso zzso an offspring usually zzso the trait values of her zzso except when a zzso causes the offspring to take a zzso step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among zzso Here we present a rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the zzso dynamics over continuous time of birth, zzso and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between zzso A zzso of this formal construction is a general zzso for efficient zzso simulation of the zzso zzso Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different zzso models of zzso zzso These models differ in the zzso they assume, zzso in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, zzso rate, zzso step, while zzso time zzso The zzso models also differ in their mathematical zzso zzso in the form of ordinary, zzso or partial differential zzso or zzso like zzso partial differential equations or zzso These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso A novel class of zzso models zzso when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short zzso compared with the zzso of typical population zzso On a zzso of very rare zzso we establish rigorously the models of zzso substitution zzso and their approximation known as the zzso equation of zzso zzso We extend these models to account for zzso bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary zzso The zzso approach used in this study also opens promising avenues to study and predict patterns of zzso zzso thereby bridging individual zzso genetic variation, and ecological interactions in a common evolutionary zzso
