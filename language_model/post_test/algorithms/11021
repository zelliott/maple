An isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with significant morbidity and zzso Because physicians often fail to recognize this diagnosis, there may be delays in the timely zzso of these zzso The present study sought to identify the clinical characteristics and zzso times among patients presenting with isolated zzso 

We identified subjects with isolated zzso within a registry of all zzso laboratory zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso from 2008 to zzso Association between zzso and zzso within 90 minutes was evaluated by zzso zzso 

Among zzso patients who underwent zzso for zzso a total of 20 zzso had zzso evidence of an isolated zzso Compared to zzso zzso subjects with zzso were more often female zzso vs zzso zzso and less likely to have chest pain zzso vs zzso zzso The median zzso zzso zzso vs 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 29 zzso zzso and zzso times zzso zzso vs 72 zzso zzso were longer among subjects with zzso with fewer patients achieving zzso within 90 minutes zzso vs zzso zzso After multivariable adjustment, individuals with zzso had zzso lower odds zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of achieving coronary zzso within 90 zzso zzso time accounted for zzso of variation in the total zzso time zzso zzso 

zzso time was prolonged for those with zzso resulting in longer zzso times and fewer patients zzso within the recommended zzso An isolated zzso should be considered among individuals presenting with symptoms consistent with zzso zzso
