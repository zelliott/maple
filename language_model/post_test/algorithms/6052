Early recurrence zzso zzso zzso after liver zzso is one of the most important factors that impact the prognosis of patients with zzso zzso zzso We sought to determine factors associated with zzso of zzso and examine the outcomes zzso 

From March 2001 to June 2003, 56 patients underwent zzso zzso for zzso at University of Toronto and were zzso followed with median followup of 24 zzso Patients with zzso were compared with those who remained disease free for more than 1 zzso Patient zzso tumor stage, and operative procedures were evaluated for their zzso significance by zzso and multivariable zzso Time to recurrence and time to death were analyzed using zzso survival zzso and compared using zzso zzso 

The initial procedure in all patients was surgical zzso zzso occurred in 21 patients zzso 31 zzso remained disease free for more than 1 year, and 4 zzso were omitted from evaluation because of early zzso zzso zzso Median survival after initial zzso zzso for those with zzso was 27 months, and zzso survival was zzso There were no deaths in the group that remained disease free for more than 1 year zzso zzso survival, p zzso zzso By zzso analysis, vascular invasion and positive microscopic margins were significant zzso when all 4 variables were considered in the model zzso zzso zzso After zzso 11 of 21 patients zzso underwent additional therapy with significant improvement in median survival zzso zzso compared with those not eligible for conventional therapy (18 months, p zzso zzso 

zzso after liver zzso for zzso is the leading cause of death during the first 2 years after potentially zzso zzso zzso will develop in approximately zzso of patients with either vascular invasion or positive zzso For patients with these zzso factors additional treatment might be zzso
