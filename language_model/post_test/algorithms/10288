The main zzso criteria for the diagnosis of zzso syndrome zzso include abnormal zzso zzso as well as prolonged zzso zzso The T wave in zzso probably includes additional components of the zzso zzso process, which are derived from zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether independent component analysis zzso can extract such abnormal zzso zzso 

Digital zzso data were obtained as a time series from 10 channels using 20 surface zzso in 22 patients with genetically confirmed zzso type 1 zzso and 30 normal zzso In each case, zzso area was analyzed by radical zzso after noise reduction by the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, inverse zzso was applied to determine the origin of each independent component zzso zzso zzso revealed that a zzso consisted of 4 basic zzso in all control subjects, whereas zzso 5 zzso 6) zzso were identified in all 22 patients with zzso The extra zzso which were not evident in normal subjects, were assumed to contribute to the formation of abnormal zzso zzso The extra zzso were identified even in patients with normal zzso values and in those taking zzso zzso zzso indicated that the additional zzso originate predominantly from the late phase of the T wave of the left zzso 

Extra zzso appear during zzso in all patients with zzso but not in normal zzso zzso is a potentially useful zzso statistical method to differentiate patients with zzso from normal zzso
