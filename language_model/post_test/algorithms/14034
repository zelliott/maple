The spatial arrangement of zzso fiber structure affects the mechanical and electrical properties of the zzso zzso information on the structure and dynamics of the orientation of the muscle fibers in the human heart might provide significant insight into principles of the mechanics of normal zzso contraction and electrical propagation and may subsequently aid zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso orientation is inherently linked to cardiac wall motion, which can be measured with phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso also termed tissue phase mapping zzso 

This study provides initial results of the zzso of zzso data with fiber tracking zzso and discusses implications for the fiber zzso In order to generate zzso with sufficient volume coverage and resolution zzso zzso with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso were executed during zzso periods and free zzso zzso zzso evaluation with a tracking zzso for acceleration fields derived from the zzso data was zzso 

zzso acceleration tracking illustrated the dynamics of fiber structure during four different zzso of left zzso performance, that include zzso contraction zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction of the zzso fiber structure from zzso data requires mathematical modeling of zzso evolution of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were reconstructed at these four zzso during the cardiac cycle, and these findings may become zzso surrogate parameters in the normal zzso zzso baseline markers for subsequent clinical studies of abnormal hearts with altered architecture, and zzso may help to explain and illustrate functional features of cardiac performance in structural models like the zzso zzso zzso zzso
