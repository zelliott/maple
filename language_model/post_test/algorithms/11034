Many relevant process states in wastewater treatment are not zzso or their zzso are subject to considerable zzso This poses a serious problem for process monitoring and zzso zzso state zzso can provide estimates of the unknown states and increase the reliability of zzso In this paper, an integrated approach is presented for the zzso sensor network design and the zzso zzso Using the zzso model in the reference scenario zzso a zzso sensor network is designed and the prominent zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Very good zzso results for the system zzso 78 states are found requiring sensor networks of only moderate zzso
