One of the goals of zzso is to enable remote zzso and browsing of medical zzso There is a need to employ zzso zzso schemes and efficient zzso models to obtain zzso and an enhanced viewing zzso First, we present a scheme that uses zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to transmit data in a zzso and progressive zzso The server exploits the spatial locality offered by the zzso transform and packet indexing information to zzso in so far as possible, compressed volume data relevant to the clients zzso Once the client identifies its volume of interest zzso the volume is refined progressively within the zzso from an initial zzso to a final zzso zzso zzso background information can also be made available having quality fading away from the zzso Second, we present a zzso that enables the client to progressively zzso scene content from a compressed zzso In our specific example, the client is able to make requests to progressively receive data corresponding to any tissue zzso The server is now capable of zzso the same compressed data file on the fly to serve data packets zzso as per the client's zzso Lastly, we describe the effect of zzso parameters on zzso ratio, decoding times and zzso We also present suggestions for zzso zzso for remote volume zzso and volume browsing zzso The resulting system is zzso suited for zzso applications with the server maintaining the compressed volume data, to be zzso by a client with a low bandwidth zzso
