Under molecular crowding conditions, zzso have been reported to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso with 0 zzso zzso zzso Here we study the exchange dynamics of such a zzso particle with a zzso boundary using a continuous time random walk zzso We derive the generalized boundary condition and consider the zzso from the zzso An ensuing weak zzso breaking has profound consequences for material exchange between the boundary and zzso We discuss the effects in biological contexts such as gene regulation or zzso exchange zzso We also suggest various methods to zzso probe the zzso zzso
