zzso zzso glow zzso involves the solving of a system of zzso zzso These equations are either differential equations that must be solved zzso or functional approximations for their zzso The current paper presents software with the functions needed for the study of glow zzso that is not a zzso computer program but an extension of zzso zzso It supplies functions that solve the general one trap model for the zzso process without the use of zzso zzso Combined with the zzso utility of Excel this gives a very flexible system for the analysis of glow zzso zzso for zzso the statistics of the zzso results are zzso
