zzso periodically an elastic filament in a viscous liquid generally breaks the constraints of zzso zzso zzso resulting in the generation of a net propulsive zzso This observation suggests a method to design simple swimming zzso we call zzso zzso the zzso mechanism is embedded in a solid body and the resulting swimmer is free to zzso In this paper, we study theoretically the zzso of elastic zzso After discussing the basic physical picture of the phenomenon and the expected zzso zzso we derive zzso the elastic swimming zzso in the limit of small zzso zzso The emphasis is on the zzso between the two unknowns of the zzso the shape of the elastic filament and the swimming zzso have to be solved zzso We then zzso the performance of the resulting swimming device and its dependence on zzso The optimal zzso frequency and body shapes are derived and a discussion of filament shapes and internal zzso is zzso zzso using multiple elastic filaments is discussed, and simple strategies are presented which result in straight swimming zzso Finally, we compare the performance of elastic swimming with that of swimming zzso
