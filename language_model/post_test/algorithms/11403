In this work a detailed analysis of the problem of imaging of objects lying in the plane zzso with respect to the optical axis of the zzso symmetrical optical system is performed by means of geometrical zzso zzso It is shown that the fulfillment of the so called zzso condition zzso zzso does not guarantee the sharp image of the object as it is usually declared because of the fact that due to the dependence of aberrations of real optical systems on the object distance the image becomes zzso The zzso of a given optical system also varies with the object zzso It is shown the influence of above mentioned effects on the accuracy of the laser zzso sensors zzso A detailed analysis of laser zzso sensors, based on geometrical zzso theory, is performed and relations for the calculation of measurement errors and construction parameters of laser zzso sensors are zzso
