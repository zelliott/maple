zzso et zzso zzso recently proved that a ground condition for zzso zzso zzso ties up their consistent zzso to that of the zzso risk, and left as an important problem the zzso questions about their zzso In this paper, we address this problem for a wide set which lies at the intersection of zzso zzso surrogates and those of zzso et zzso zzso This set zzso with those satisfying three common assumptions about zzso zzso expressions for the zzso well zzso for convex and zzso zzso frequently used in the induction of linear zzso and decision zzso Most notably, they share remarkable zzso features: for each of these two types of zzso we give a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the minimum of any such zzso While seemingly different, we show that these zzso are zzso of the same zzso zzso This provides a new and broad unified account of different popular zzso including additive zzso with the squared loss, the zzso loss, and the zzso induction performed in zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the induction enjoys the most popular boosting features, regardless of the zzso zzso are provided on 40 readily available zzso
