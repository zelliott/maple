The output of a zzso assembler generally comprises a collection of zzso DNA sequences zzso whose relative placement along the zzso is not zzso A procedure called scaffolding is commonly used to order and orient these zzso using paired read zzso This ordering of zzso is an essential step when finishing and analyzing the data from a zzso shotgun zzso Most recent zzso include a scaffolding zzso however, users have little control over the scaffolding zzso or the information zzso We thus developed a zzso zzso called zzso which zzso users significant flexibility in controlling the scaffolding zzso zzso was used recently to scaffold the zzso draft dog zzso zzso Most significantly, zzso enables the use of linking data other than that zzso from zzso zzso For example, the sequence of a completed zzso can be used to guide the scaffolding of a related zzso We present several applications of zzso support for zzso comparative zzso analysis of the zzso structure of zzso and scaffolding of a zzso zzso at low zzso zzso is available as an zzso package from our Web zzso
