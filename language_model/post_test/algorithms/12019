zzso zzso occurring in zzso permanent implants contributes to the degradation in dose zzso It has been suggested that needles could be used to zzso the prostate and help reduce zzso This study investigates the effects of parallel stabilizing needles on seed zzso 

A group of ten patients implanted with stabilizing needles was compared with a group of 20 patients implanted without zzso zzso were performed on the displacement of individual seeds and zzso The needle zzso are: zzso angle, the ratio of zzso over zzso lengths and the zzso zzso a measure of relative zzso among the seeds of the same zzso 

No difference was observed in seed zzso No difference was observed in needle zzso angle, a measure which was expected to improve with the use of stabilizing zzso 

None of the expected effects from the use of parallel stabilizing needles have been zzso This method of prostate contention appears to be without zzso zzso zzso is most pronounced along the zzso axis and is caused by friction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso friction could be a promising alternative to prostate contention in trying to reduce zzso
