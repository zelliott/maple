The search for the global minimum energy zzso zzso of protein side chains is an important zzso challenge in protein structure prediction and zzso Using zzso models, the problem is formulated as a zzso zzso zzso zzso elimination zzso methods combined with systematic zzso search zzso has proven useful, but may not be strong enough as we attempt to solve protein design problems where a large number of similar zzso is eligible and the network of interactions between zzso is zzso In this work, we present an exact solution method, named zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso for such protein design zzso The design goal of zzso is to be able to expand smaller search trees than conventional zzso methods while performing only a moderate amount of zzso in each zzso thereby reducing the total running zzso To achieve that, zzso attempts reduction of the problem size within each zzso through zzso and elimination by lower bounds from approximate zzso zzso zzso The lower bounds are also exploited in branching and zzso selection for fast discovery of strong upper zzso Our zzso results show that zzso tends to be faster than zzso for large protein design zzso zzso also solved cases that were not solved by zzso within the maximum allowed time, and did not incur significant disadvantage for cases where zzso performed zzso zzso zzso is particularly zzso to large protein design problems where zzso struggles and can also substitute for zzso in general zzso zzso
