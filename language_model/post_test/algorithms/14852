Fluorescence optical zzso is a zzso imaging zzso that employs the zzso and zzso of light by fluorescent zzso The aim is to reconstruct the zzso distribution in a body from zzso of light zzso at the zzso Due to the zzso nature of light propagation in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and severely zzso problem, and some sort of zzso is required for a stable zzso In this paper we investigate reconstruction methods based on zzso zzso with zzso penalty terms, namely zzso zzso and a zzso method using a zzso zzso of the unknown zzso Moreover, we use the full zzso zzso forward model, which arises from the governing system of partial differential zzso We discuss the zzso realization of the zzso schemes by zzso zzso present some details of the zzso by finite element methods, and outline the efficient zzso of sensitivity systems via zzso zzso As we will demonstrate in zzso tests, the proposed zzso methods provide better reconstructions than standard methods based on zzso forward models and linear penalty zzso We will additionally zzso that the careful zzso of the methods derived on the continuous level allows to obtain reliable, mesh independent reconstruction zzso
