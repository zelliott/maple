A zzso zzso for automatic zzso of small pulmonary zzso on zzso CT images has been zzso In a zzso manner, the zzso uses density, zzso strength, and a shape constraint of the zzso to automatically control zzso zzso The multiple criteria applied to separation of the zzso from its surrounding structures in lung are based on the fact that typical small pulmonary zzso on CT images have high zzso show a distinct difference in density at the boundary, and tend to be compact in zzso Prior to the zzso a zzso containing the zzso is manually selected on the CT zzso Then the zzso process begins with a high density threshold that is decreased zzso resulting in expansion of the area of zzso zzso This progressive region growing approach is terminated when subsequent thresholds provide either a diminished zzso strength of the zzso zzso or significant changes of zzso shape from the compact zzso The shape criterion added to the zzso can effectively prevent the high density surrounding structures zzso blood zzso from being falsely segmented as zzso which occurs frequently when only the zzso strength criterion is zzso This has been demonstrated by examples given in the zzso zzso The zzso accuracy has been compared with that of zzso manual zzso and no statistically significant difference has been found between the zzso areas delineated by zzso and those obtained by the zzso zzso The improved zzso boundary allows for more accurate assessment of zzso size and hence zzso growth over a short time period, and for better characterization of zzso zzso This information is useful in determining zzso status of a zzso at an early stage and thus provides significant guidance for further clinical zzso
