zzso currently used to determine zzso zzso are mainly zzso with the majority of zzso surgeons still relying on clinical zzso In this study, the authors demonstrate the use of zzso zzso zzso to directly zzso normal and abnormal zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso green was injected zzso into zzso adult pigs zzso zzso zzso A custom zzso zzso imaging system was used for image acquisition and zzso Thirty-nine zzso were designed based on identified zzso and zzso imaging was performed for zzso In select zzso isolated zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso In select zzso vascular zzso was induced by local irrigation of the vessels with zzso The zzso zzso of select regions of interest were zzso From these data, the authors defined two zzso for abnormal zzso the zzso ratio and the drainage zzso 

The authors identified a normal pattern of zzso before zzso zzso composed of a distinct zzso intensity peak at zzso zzso inflow followed by a smooth drop representing zzso zzso zzso of this peak after zzso zzso as indicated by the zzso ratio, identified vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fall of zzso zzso after this peak, as indicated by the drainage ratio, identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso accurately characterizes zzso and zzso zzso The zzso technique can assess zzso characteristics during the zzso and zzso periods and therefore zzso clinically based zzso criteria now used for zzso zzso
