The generalized magic zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso sequence compensates background zzso zzso and can be adjusted to zzso timing boundary conditions which for instance are present in zzso MR zzso However, its efficiency is not optimal because one of the two zzso zzso applied in each zzso usually must have a reduced zzso to ensure the desired zzso zzso In this work, a modification of generalized zzso is investigated where this zzso pulse is replaced by two zzso zzso with full zzso but opposite zzso It is shown that with these bipolar zzso zzso the sequence retains the zzso compensation capability for an appropriate choice of the zzso pulse zzso and zzso the zzso efficiency is improved, zzso higher k and b values can be achieved without zzso the echo zzso These results are confirmed in MR imaging experiments on zzso and in zzso in the human brain at zzso using zzso and zzso MR zzso In the examples zzso the b value could be increased between about zzso and zzso when using the bipolar zzso zzso Thus, bipolar zzso may help to improve the zzso of the generalized zzso zzso
