The aim of this study was to investigate the organ distribution characteristics of zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso after intravenous zzso injection compared to zzso solution in mice, and to evaluate the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso in mice zzso heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso and brain were determined by zzso The parameters drug targeting index zzso zzso relative drug exposure values zzso drug targeting efficiency zzso and drug distributed to zzso zzso were used to evaluate the zzso of the zzso delivery zzso The results showed that the concentration of zzso in the lung was significantly higher than after application of zzso solution, and that the maximum concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso was reached in the lung at 15 zzso after zzso zzso As for zzso zzso was calculated to be zzso and zzso was considerably higher than after application of zzso in zzso Furthermore, the percentage of drug distributed to the lung was 2 times as high as after application in zzso zzso zzso were capable of effectively delivering zzso to the lung and possessed specific zzso towards the lung compared to zzso zzso
