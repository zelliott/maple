zzso mass zzso zzso coupled with liquid zzso zzso is a powerful tool for the analysis and comparison of complex protein and zzso zzso However, the extremely large amounts of data that result from the process are very complex and difficult to zzso We show how the zzso of similar zzso from multiple zzso runs can help in data management and improve the analysis of complex zzso zzso The major effect of spectrum zzso is the reduction of the huge amounts of data to a manageable zzso As a result, analysis time is shorter and more data can be stored for further zzso Furthermore, spectrum quality improvement allows the identification of more peptides with greater confidence, the comparison of complex zzso zzso is zzso and the entire zzso project is presented in concise zzso zzso is an advanced software tool that zzso these zzso zzso It proved useful in several comparative zzso projects involving lung cancer cells and various other cell zzso In one of these projects, zzso reduced 517 zzso zzso to 20 900 clusters and identified zzso peptides derived from 830 zzso zzso and identification lasted less than two hours on an zzso zzso zzso computer zzso zzso unique properties make it a very useful tool for large-scale shotgun zzso zzso
