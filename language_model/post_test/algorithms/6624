A zzso zzso control approach, capable of tracking a pre-set process trajectory correlated to the biomass or product concentration in the zzso is zzso The trajectory was either a zzso variable derived from zzso statistical process monitoring zzso based on partial least squares zzso zzso or the absolute value of the process zzso In the control zzso the zzso feed pump rate was calculated from zzso zzso zzso The only parameters needed were the zzso feed concentration and the zzso yield of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were used to demonstrate the performance of the control zzso on an zzso coli zzso zzso for zzso zzso The controller showed good ability to track a defined biomass trajectory during varying process zzso The zzso of the control was high, despite significant external disturbances on the zzso and control zzso
