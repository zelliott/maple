Human zzso zzso and gastric zzso with defective DNA mismatch repair zzso have zzso instability, a unique molecular zzso characterized by widespread zzso zzso of repetitive DNA zzso We developed zzso a zzso program for searches in zzso and protein sequence databases, and performed an in zzso zzso scan for DNA coding zzso that may have novel zzso in zzso zzso zzso of 29 previously untested coding zzso revealed widespread zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the highest zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso allows comprehensive zzso profiling of zzso zzso an important step in understanding the zzso of these zzso
