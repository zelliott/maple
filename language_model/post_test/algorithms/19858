Twin zzso rates provide insight into the possibility of a genetic background for a zzso These zzso rates are usually estimated within a zzso zzso Here we take a zzso zzso For rare diseases, zzso methods based on zzso theory cannot be applied due to very low cell zzso Moreover, a zzso approach allows a straightforward incorporation of prior information on disease prevalence coming from zzso studies that is often zzso An zzso zzso procedure is tested using simulation and contrasted with zzso zzso The zzso method is able to include prior information on both zzso rates and prevalence rates at the same time and is illustrated using twin data on zzso lip and zzso zzso
