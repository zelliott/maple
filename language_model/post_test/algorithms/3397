A method of three-dimensional zzso zzso based on image projections is zzso zzso methods based on projections generally are inaccurate due to the spreading nature of the scattered zzso By zzso the field onto a single plane in the image region, zzso effects are reduced and a projection of the zzso scattering object is zzso zzso conventional X-ray inversion techniques may be used to image the zzso The relationship between the zzso field and the projection is derived both for high frequency incident waves and low spatial frequency zzso The generalized image kernel allows the use of curved or zzso recording zzso zzso results are zzso
