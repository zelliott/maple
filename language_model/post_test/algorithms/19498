Image registration has many medical applications in diagnosis, therapy planning and zzso Especially for zzso zzso an efficient and accurate elastic registration of images acquired for treatment planning, and at the time of the actual treatment, is highly zzso zzso we developed a fully automatic and fast block matching zzso which identifies a set of anatomical landmarks in a zzso CT zzso and zzso them in another CT zzso by zzso of local correlation zzso in the frequency zzso To transform the complete zzso a smooth zzso between the landmarks is calculated by modified zzso zzso with local zzso The concept of the zzso allows separate processing of image zzso like temporally changing air cavities in the zzso track or zzso The result is a fully transformed zzso planning zzso zzso CT as well as zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso to a zzso CT, allowing evaluation and, if necessary, changes of the treatment plan based on the current patient anatomy without time-consuming manual zzso Typically the total calculation time is less than 5 zzso which allows the use of the registration tool between acquiring the zzso images and delivering the dose fraction for online zzso We present zzso of the zzso for five different patient zzso with different zzso locations zzso zzso and zzso by comparing the results with manually selected landmarks, visual assessment and consistency zzso It turns out that the mean error of the registration is better than the zzso resolution (2 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso In conclusion, we present an zzso for fully automatic elastic image registration that is precise and fast enough for online corrections in an zzso zzso radiation treatment zzso
