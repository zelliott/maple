zzso challenge testing is common for assessing the zzso properties of zzso zzso In order to design studies and to interpret published studies, sample size calculations are zzso Unfortunately, wrong sample sizes were previously reported in the zzso We present correct sample sizes required for the comparison of two treatments based on zzso challenge testing in a crossover zzso 

zzso for sample size calculations and the resulting number of subjects required for a specified power are presented for studies designed to show a difference as well as for zzso and zzso zzso 

A much larger sample size is required for zzso challenge testing than previously zzso
