A fast continuous rotating ultrasound zzso zzso was used to perform three-dimensional zzso zzso with zzso images acquired during a single cardiac zzso The 3-D images were reconstructed by zzso zzso data acquired with the zzso Two experiments were carried out to validate the image zzso A dynamic cardiac phantom was used as a known reference to compare the minimal and zzso volumes estimated manually on the reconstructed 3-D zzso The left zzso zzso volume of 30 healthy volunteers also were estimated using a semiautomatic zzso approach and compared to zzso obtained with standard zzso zzso zzso showed a good agreement between 3-D and reference zzso
