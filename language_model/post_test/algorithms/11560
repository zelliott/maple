Although zzso zzso schemes are widely used in the zzso of image motion, zzso are ill zzso for particular classes of zzso This paper addresses this zzso Motion is zzso as the zzso direction in which the difference in image zzso from the local mean is zzso This method can reliably detect motion in zzso and some zzso motion zzso zzso of the model can be identified with zzso zzso and zzso selective simple zzso A stage in which we zzso spatial and zzso derivatives of the difference between image zzso and the local mean zzso using a truncated Taylor series gives rise to a zzso output reminiscent of the response of complex zzso
