The evaluation of a diagnostic test when the reference standard fails to establish a diagnosis in some patients is a common and difficult zzso zzso Conventional operating zzso derived from a 2 zzso 2 zzso require that tests have only positive or negative results, and that disease status be designated definitively as present or zzso zzso can be displayed in a 2 zzso 3 zzso with an additional column for zzso patients, when it is not possible always to ascertain the disease status zzso The authors approach this problem using a zzso method for evaluating the 2 zzso 3 zzso in which test operating characteristics are described by a joint probability density zzso They show that one can derive this joint probability density function of sensitivity and specificity zzso by applying a sampling zzso The three-dimensional zzso resulting from this sampling procedure zzso the true joint probability density function for sensitivity and zzso Using a clinical example, the authors illustrate the method and demonstrate that the joint probability density function for sensitivity and specificity can be influenced by assumptions used to interpret test results in zzso zzso This zzso method represents a flexible and practical solution to the problem of evaluating test sensitivity and specificity when the study group includes patients whose disease could not be diagnosed by the reference zzso
