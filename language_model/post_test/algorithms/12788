We describe here our results in the last zzso zzso We have participated in all targets, both as zzso and as scorers, using our zzso zzso zzso The new challenges zzso modeling of the interacting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have pushed our computer tools to the limits and have encouraged us to devise new zzso zzso Overall, the results have been quite successful, in line with previous editions, especially considering the high difficulty of some of the zzso Our zzso approaches succeeded in five targets as zzso or as scorers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, with the inclusion of available information on the zzso expected to be involved in the interaction, our protocol would have also succeeded in two additional cases zzso and zzso In the remaining targets (except zzso results were equally poor for most of the zzso We submitted the best model (in zzso zzso among scorers for the zzso target zzso the second best model among scorers for the zzso target zzso and the only correct model among zzso for the domain assembly target zzso In zzso our excellent results for the new proposed challenges in this zzso edition showed the limitations and zzso of our approaches and encouraged us to continue developing zzso for automated zzso zzso
