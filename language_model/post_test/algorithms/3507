We briefly describe the ordered weighted average zzso zzso We discuss its role in decision making under zzso We provide an extension of the zzso operator to the case in which our argument is a continuous valued zzso rather than a finite set of zzso We look at some examples of this type of zzso We show how it can be used in some tasks that arise in decision zzso We consider the extension of the continuous zzso argument zzso operator to the more general case in which the argument values have importance zzso We use this to introduce the idea of an zzso expected value associated with a continuous random zzso
