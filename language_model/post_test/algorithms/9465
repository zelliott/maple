A zzso method for simultaneous analysis of zzso and zzso is proposed by application of neural networks on the spectral kinetic zzso The method is based on the reaction of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in slightly basic zzso On the basis of the difference in the rate between the two zzso these two zzso acids can be determined simultaneously in zzso zzso zzso neural networks have been trained to zzso considered zzso acids in zzso under optimum zzso In this way, a zzso network was zzso zzso and linear transfer functions were used in the hidden and output zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso were obtained in the concentration range of 1 to zzso for zzso and 1 to zzso for zzso The zzso performance of this method was characterized by the relative standard zzso The proposed method was applied to the determination of considered zzso acids in synthetic zzso
