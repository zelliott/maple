The high tumor zzso makes it very challenging to identify key zzso pathways as therapeutic zzso The integration of multiple zzso data is a promising approach to identify driving regulatory networks in patient zzso Here, we propose a novel conceptual framework to discover patterns of zzso networks, observed frequently zzso or zzso in a group of patients and to use such networks for patient zzso in zzso zzso zzso We developed an zzso zzso mining approach, called zzso and identified altered regulatory networks frequently observed in zzso zzso The zzso and gene expression profiles were jointly analyzed in a graph zzso We defined a method to transform zzso data into graph representation that encodes zzso and gene expression levels and the interactions between them as zzso The zzso zzso was capable to detect cooperative regulation of zzso and genes even if it occurred only in some zzso Next, the zzso zzso were used in an zzso class prediction model to discover zzso zzso via patient zzso by mixture zzso The zzso analysis of the mixture model showed that the class predictions are highly zzso Moreover, the zzso survival analysis revealed that the zzso zzso identified by the zzso have different survival zzso The zzso analyses of the zzso zzso identified by the zzso demonstrate key roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Thus, our method can integrate various zzso data derived from different platforms and with different dynamic scales to better define molecular tumor zzso zzso is available as zzso code at zzso
