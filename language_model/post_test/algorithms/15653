In the case of the mixed linear model the random effects are usually assumed to be normally distributed in both the zzso and classical zzso In this paper, the zzso process prior was used to provide zzso zzso estimates for correlated random zzso This goal was achieved by providing a Gibbs zzso zzso that allows these correlated random effects to have a zzso prior zzso A sampling based method is zzso This method which is employed by transforming the genetic zzso zzso to an identity zzso so that the random effects are zzso is an extension of the theory and the results of previous zzso Also by using Gibbs sampling and data zzso a simulation procedure was derived for zzso the precision zzso M associated with the zzso process zzso All needed conditional zzso zzso are zzso To illustrate the application, data from the zzso zzso sheep stud were zzso A total of zzso weaning weight records from the progeny of 101 zzso were zzso
