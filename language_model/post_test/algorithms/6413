zzso we report on the binding of zzso pure zzso complexes zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The binding zzso of the two zzso zzso and zzso complexes to DNA were estimated from zzso monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso transferred zzso zzso experiments support the conclusion that zzso and zzso bind to DNA and that an zzso exchange occurs between bound and free zzso zzso Further, evidence for zzso DNA zzso by zzso is provided by means of gel zzso performed in the presence and in the absence of light; in contrast, the zzso zzso does zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso zzso (or zzso compared to that of the zzso zzso gives evidence that, in the latter form, the zzso are strongly zzso zzso the X-ray structure of zzso was also determined and exhibits as an outstanding feature the formation of a one-dimensional zzso species in which the cohesion of the system is maintained by strong hydrogen bonding between zzso acid groups of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso A in agreement with the infrared zzso The conclusion that can be drawn from zzso and X-ray zzso together is that the zzso in zzso is zzso
