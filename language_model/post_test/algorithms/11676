We describe a novel system that permits simultaneous zzso imaging of protein interactions and measurement of cell mechanical properties during passive zzso A mechanical apparatus was designed to replace the stage of a zzso zzso enabling cell zzso force zzso and zzso In addition, image processing zzso were developed to zzso the degree of connectivity between zzso zzso Using this system, we examined the interactions among three cellular structures thought to be linked by the zzso intermediate filament system: zzso zzso and the zzso protein complexes located at the muscle cell zzso Fast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were implemented to zzso image zzso and relative phase shifts among zzso We demonstrated in sample zzso muscle cells that there was significant connectivity among zzso in the same fiber at various zzso zzso as well as between zzso and the zzso zzso This approach can be applied to any cell system in which structural zzso and mechanical connectivity are of zzso
