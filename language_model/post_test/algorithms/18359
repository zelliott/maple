The individual leaves of a zzso zzso zzso have a zzso or zzso design to minimize leakage radiation between adjacent zzso This design element has a drawback in that it creates areas of zzso in zzso zzso beams unless a leaf trajectory is specifically designed such that for any two adjacent leaf pairs, the direct exposure under the zzso is equal to the lower of the direct zzso of the leaf zzso In this work, we present a systematic study of the zzso of a leaf sequencing zzso for zzso zzso zzso beam delivery that completely eliminates areas of zzso due to zzso or zzso design of the zzso zzso elimination of zzso effect and leaf zzso is also zzso This is an extension of our previous work zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso in which we described a leaf sequencing zzso that is optimal for monitor unit zzso efficiency under most common leaf movement constraints that include minimum leaf zzso Compared to our previously published zzso (without zzso the new zzso increase the number of zzso by approximately zzso and zzso respectively, but are optimal in zzso efficiency for zzso zzso
