zzso sequencing has opened up exciting possibilities in population and conservation zzso by enabling the assessment of genetic variation at zzso zzso One approach to reduce zzso complexity, zzso investigating only parts of the zzso is zzso library zzso zzso Like similar approaches, zzso sequencing reduces zzso bias due to simultaneous discovery and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and does not require reference zzso Yet, generating such zzso remains challenging due to laboratory and zzso zzso In the laboratory, current protocols require improvements with regards to sequencing zzso fragments to reduce the number of missing zzso From the zzso perspective, the reliance of most studies on a single zzso zzso zzso the possibility that different zzso may produce disparate zzso zzso 

We present an improved zzso zzso protocol that zzso the generation of zzso DNA zzso thus achieving improved zzso zzso Our modifications facilitate generation of zzso libraries, enabling individual zzso assignments instead of zzso zzso We zzso zzso of the orangutan zzso with zzso median coverage in 31 zzso individuals from two zzso zzso and zzso were called using three different zzso We obtained substantially different zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of the Genome Analysis zzso and zzso performed significantly better than a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Of all conflicting zzso calls, zzso was only correct in zzso of the zzso Furthermore, conflicting zzso between two zzso showed a systematic bias in that one zzso almost exclusively assigned zzso while the other one almost exclusively assigned zzso 

Our enhanced zzso approach greatly zzso zzso and thus direct estimates of zzso zzso Our direct comparison of three commonly used zzso zzso emphasizes the need to question the accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso as we obtained considerably different zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso sequencing depths and filtering zzso These differences affected scans for signatures of natural selection, but will also exert undue influences on demographic zzso This study presents the first effort to generate a population zzso zzso for zzso orangutans with known population zzso
