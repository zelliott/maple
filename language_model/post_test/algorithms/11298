zzso are at the root of many biological functions, often performing complex tasks as the result of large changes in their zzso Describing the exact details of these zzso changes, however, remains a central challenge for zzso biology due the enormous zzso requirements of the zzso This has engendered the development of a rich variety of useful methods designed to answer specific questions at different levels of zzso zzso and energetic zzso These methods fall largely into two zzso physically accurate, but zzso demanding methods and fast, approximate zzso We introduce here a new hybrid modeling zzso the zzso zzso Move zzso zzso designed to bridge the divide between these two classes, while allowing the benefits of both to be seamlessly integrated into a single zzso This is achieved by applying a modern motion planning algorithm, borrowed from the field of zzso in tandem with a well-established protein modeling zzso zzso can combine precise energy calculations with approximate or specialized zzso sampling routines to produce zzso yet accurate, analysis of the large-scale zzso zzso of protein zzso Several key zzso are zzso including the abstract use of generically defined moves zzso sampling zzso and an expansive zzso zzso zzso We present three example problems that zzso is applied to and demonstrate a rapid solution for zzso These include the automatic determination of zzso zzso for the zzso system zzso exploring zzso changes involving long-range coordinated motion between zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the rapid discovery of a transient zzso state of zzso zzso previously only determined by zzso zzso For all cases we provide energetic zzso using well-established energy fields, demonstrating this framework as a fast and accurate tool for the analysis of a wide range of protein flexibility zzso
