We propose an alternate zzso zzso for zzso the zzso function zzso of a zzso laser scanning microscope and the zzso zzso zzso A three-dimensional zzso zzso model is used to restrict the zzso solution space and a constraint on the zzso is used so as to favor the stabilization and convergence of the zzso The results obtained from the simulation show that the zzso can be estimated to a high degree of zzso and those on real data show better zzso as compared to a full theoretical zzso zzso
