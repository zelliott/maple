zzso technical difficulties in zzso zzso zzso in a small regional hospital increases zzso cost-benefit and safety of the zzso The aim of the study was to assess whether it is possible to accurately predict a difficult zzso zzso in a small regional hospital based only on the routine available clinical zzso parameters zzso history, ultrasound examination and blood zzso and their zzso 

A zzso zzso of zzso consecutive patients operated by the same surgeon was zzso zzso rate was 10 zzso zzso was registered in 55 zzso Various data mining techniques were applied and zzso 

Seven significant zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso gallbladder zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso wall thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso attacks of pain lasting zzso hours; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso urine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso network was selected as the best zzso with accuracy of zzso specificity zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

It is possible to predict a zzso with high accuracy using data mining techniques, based on routine zzso clinical parameters and their zzso Use of sophisticated diagnostic equipment is not zzso
