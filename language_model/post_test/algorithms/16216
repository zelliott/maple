This paper presents a zzso zzso model for generalized face zzso in which a novel zzso statistical model is proposed to account for both local and global shape zzso Instead of using statistical analysis on the entire shape, we build separate zzso models for shape components to preserve more detailed local shape zzso In each model of zzso a zzso network is integrated to provide simple geometry constraints for our search zzso In order to make a better description of the zzso zzso over shape zzso the zzso process zzso variable model is adopted to obtain enough control of shape zzso In addition, we adopt an zzso feature to lead the local fitting of every shape point when light conditions change zzso To further boost the accuracy and efficiency of our zzso algorithm, an efficient zzso search technique is adopted to detect components and to provide better zzso for shape zzso Based on this approach, our system can generate accurate shape alignment results not only for images with exaggerated expressions and slight zzso variation but also for images with zzso and heavy shadows, which are rarely reported in previous zzso
