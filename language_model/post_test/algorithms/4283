zzso and zzso introduced to zzso the idea of zzso zzso in which part of a system is assumed to be operating sufficiently fast compared to the rest so that it may be taken to have reached a steady zzso This zzso in principle, the fast components to be zzso resulting in a simplified description of the system's zzso Similar ideas have been widely used in different areas of biology, including zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso gene regulation and zzso zzso However, the methods used have been independent and ad zzso In the present study, we review the use of zzso separation as a means to simplify the description of molecular complexity and discuss recent work setting out a single framework that zzso these separate zzso The framework offers new capabilities for mathematical analysis and helps to do justice to zzso and zzso insights about individual zzso in the context of zzso biological zzso
