By testing industry standard techniques for zzso progeny evaluation on air sample zzso a new technique is developed to evaluate zzso activity on air filters by curve fitting the zzso zzso The industry method modified here is simply the use of filter activity zzso at different times to estimate the air zzso of zzso zzso The primary modification was to not look for specific zzso progeny values but rather zzso zzso By using a method that will provide reasonably conservative estimates of the zzso activity present on a zzso some credit for the zzso curve shape can then be zzso By carrying out rigorous statistical analysis of the curve fits to over 65 samples having no zzso activity taken over a zzso period, an zzso of the fitting function and quality tests for this purpose was zzso
