zzso screening studies are gradually accumulating a wealth of data on the putative involvement of hundreds of zzso in various cellular responses or zzso A fundamental challenge is to chart out the protein pathways that zzso these zzso Previous approaches to the problem have either employed a local zzso zzso aiming to zzso each zzso zzso or a global zzso searching for the overall most zzso zzso Here, we study the zzso between the two approaches and present a new zzso scheme that provides explicit control over zzso We demonstrate its utility in the analysis of the zzso network in humans, and the zzso length maintenance zzso system in zzso Our results show that in the majority of real-life cases, the zzso approach provides the most plausible zzso We use a new set of zzso experiments measuring the role of essential genes in zzso length regulation to further study the zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find that the zzso plays an important role in zzso length regulation through its associations with zzso and DNA repair zzso
