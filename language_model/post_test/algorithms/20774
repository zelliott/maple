In combination with two zzso zzso zzso is currently one of the best techniques to zzso study the zzso zzso of zzso interactions in living zzso An appropriate analysis procedure is crucial to obtain reliable zzso zzso is an accurate method to measure zzso It is however an indirect process that requires zzso zzso curve fitting, using an exponential zzso zzso Although choosing the number of exponential terms is essential, it is zzso and time zzso zzso a zzso is usually applied to a whole zzso Here we propose an algorithm, named zzso allowing zzso by zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso zzso was validated using simulated zzso zzso zzso with known lifetimes and zzso It showed a high zzso for zzso zzso with more than zzso zzso When applied to lifetime images acquired from living cells, it resulted in a more realistic representation of the interaction zzso We developed an zzso procedure for zzso zzso analysis, which enables zzso zzso zzso for all interaction texture studies, and is especially suitable to avoid the classical zzso of zzso zzso
