Although balanced zzso free zzso zzso imaging yields high zzso ratio zzso efficiency, the bright zzso signal is often zzso The zzso spectrum can be shaped to suppress the fat signal with zzso alternating repetition time zzso zzso However, the level of suppression is zzso and the zzso is narrow due to its zzso zzso A multiple repetition time zzso zzso scheme is proposed that creates a broad zzso with a scan efficiency comparable with zzso Furthermore, the zzso signal uniformity is improved, resulting in fewer zzso zzso When data acquisition occurs in more than a single zzso within the zzso period, the echoes can be combined to significantly improve the level of zzso The signal characteristics of the proposed technique were compared with zzso and zzso The zzso method generates identical contrast to zzso and achieves up to an order of magnitude higher zzso suppression than zzso In zzso studies at zzso T and 3 T demonstrate the superior zzso performance of zzso zzso
