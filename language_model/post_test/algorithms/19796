zzso obtained with commercial zzso zzso have been extensively used in many large zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso association studies for a multitude of zzso Yet, these zzso capture only a small fraction of the zzso of the studied zzso zzso structural zzso zzso such as Copy Number Variation zzso may account for part of the missing zzso but their comprehensive detection requires either next-generation zzso or zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso by combining the zzso from zzso for the two zzso can already be used to extract a partial view of such zzso from existing data zzso 

Here we present several advances to facilitate the latter zzso First, we introduce a novel zzso detection method based on a zzso zzso zzso Second, we propose a new algorithm, zzso merge, for combining zzso profiles from many individuals into consensus zzso We applied both our new methods as well as existing ones to data from zzso individuals from the zzso study who were zzso on zzso zzso zzso We developed a number of procedures in order to evaluate the performance of the different zzso This includes comparison with previously published zzso as well as using a replication sample of 239 individuals, zzso with zzso zzso zzso We also established a new evaluation procedure that employs the fact that related individuals are expected to share their zzso more frequently than randomly selected zzso The ability to detect both rare and common zzso provides a valuable resource that will facilitate association studies exploring potential zzso associations with zzso 

Our new zzso for zzso detection and their evaluation will help in zzso additional information from the large amount of zzso data on various zzso and use this to explore structural zzso and their impact on complex zzso
