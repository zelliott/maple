Fluorescence imaging locates fluorescent markers that specifically bind to zzso like tumors, markers are injected to a patient, zzso excited with zzso light, and located thanks to zzso zzso zzso To investigate thick and zzso media, as the zzso signal decreases zzso with the light travel distance, the zzso of biological zzso comes to be a limiting zzso To remove zzso and isolate specific fluorescence, a zzso approach, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso To improve results on zzso sparse markers zzso we suggest a new constrained zzso zzso that takes zzso constraints into zzso A comparative study between both zzso is proposed on simulated and in zzso zzso
