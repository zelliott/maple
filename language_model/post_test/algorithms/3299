zzso of zzso zzso using dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso provides important information for understanding the zzso and zzso processes in humans and zzso A common procedure is to reconstruct a sequence of dynamic images first, and then apply kinetic analysis to the time activity curve of a region of interest derived from the reconstructed zzso Obviously, the choice of image reconstruction method and its parameters affect the accuracy of the time activity curve and hence the estimated kinetic zzso This paper analyzes the effects of penalized likelihood image reconstruction on zzso kinetic zzso zzso Approximate theoretical expressions are derived to study the bias, zzso and ensemble mean squared error of the estimated kinetic zzso Computer simulations show that these zzso predict correctly the changes of these statistics as functions of the zzso zzso It is found that the choice of the zzso zzso has a significant impact on kinetic zzso zzso indicating proper selection of image reconstruction parameters is important for dynamic zzso A practical method has been developed to use the theoretical zzso to guide the selection of the zzso zzso in dynamic PET image zzso
