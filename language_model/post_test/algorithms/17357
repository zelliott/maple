To determine the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso differences in sensitivity for the zzso Standard, zzso Fast, zzso and Full zzso zzso in stable primary open angle zzso 

One designated eye from each of 29 patients (age zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso experienced in automated zzso was examined with the four zzso on each of three visits, using the zzso Field zzso 750 and Program zzso 

The group mean Mean zzso was zzso zzso greater for zzso Standard than Full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater for zzso Standard than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater for zzso Fast than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso greater for zzso Fast than zzso Standard zzso zzso zzso The higher zzso sensitivity for zzso Fast compared to Full zzso zzso and zzso Standard increased with increase in zzso zzso The examination duration for zzso Standard was zzso of that for Full zzso and 50% shorter for zzso Fast compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso regardless of age zzso zzso zzso The examination duration increased with increase in severity of field loss zzso zzso zzso and this increase was zzso greater for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso The Total and zzso zzso probability analyses of both zzso zzso yielded a statistically greater zzso than Full zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso differences were similar between zzso Standard and Full zzso and between zzso Fast and zzso 

Both zzso zzso produce a marginally higher differential light sensitivity compared to existing zzso but with a statistically deeper zzso and a marked reduction in examination zzso
