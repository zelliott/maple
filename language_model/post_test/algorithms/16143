How is the zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso Is vision zzso into separate tasks, such as object recognition and spatial processing, each emphasized in a different anatomical zzso If so, how many zzso zzso What are the zzso relationships among zzso The present study approached the organization of the zzso zzso in a novel zzso A zzso relationship exists between cortical function and cortical zzso Similar functions tend to be located near each other, within the constraints of mapping a highly zzso space of functions onto the two-dimensional space of the zzso We used this principle to re-examine the functional organization of the zzso zzso given current knowledge about its zzso zzso The goal of the study was to obtain a model of the functional relationships among the visual areas, including the number of functional zzso into which they are zzso the pattern of informational overlap among the streams, and the zzso relationships among zzso To test each functional description, we mapped it to a model zzso according to the principle of optimal continuity and assessed whether it accurately reconstructed a version of the zzso zzso Of the models tested, the one that best reconstructed the topography included four functional zzso rather than two, six levels of hierarchy per zzso and a specific pattern of informational overlap among zzso and zzso A specific mixture of functions was predicted for each visual zzso This description matched findings in the zzso literature, and provided predictions of functional relationships that have yet to be tested zzso
