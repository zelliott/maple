In the past few decades, a wealth of zzso data has been produced in a wide variety of species using a diverse array of functional and molecular marker zzso In order to zzso the full potential of the information contained in these independent experiments, researchers need efficient and intuitive means to identify common zzso regions and genes involved in the expression of target zzso traits across diverse zzso To address this need, we have developed a Comparative zzso and zzso zzso zzso tool that can be used to construct dynamic zzso of a variety of types of zzso zzso By zzso determining zzso between sets of objects on multiple zzso zzso the zzso can display zzso regions across zzso combine maps from separate experiments into a consensus map, or project data from different maps into a common coordinate framework using dynamic coordinate translations between source and target zzso We present a case study that illustrates the utility of the tool for managing large and varied zzso by zzso data collected by zzso in zzso drought tolerance research with data from public zzso This example will focus on one of the zzso features for zzso zzso zzso zzso data, using likelihood ratio zzso files produced by generic zzso analysis software and displaying the data in a unique visual manner across different combinations of traits, environments and zzso Once a zzso region of interest has been identified, the zzso can search and display additional zzso meeting a particular threshold for that region, or other functional data such as sets of zzso expressed genes located in the zzso it thus provides an easily used means for organizing and manipulating data sets that have been zzso integrated under the focus of the zzso specific zzso
