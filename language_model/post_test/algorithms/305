We demonstrate two complementary types of zzso using an identical setup for zzso coherent zzso zzso scattering zzso imaging, which employs an zzso laser pulse with a spectral bandwidth of zzso zzso and enables the suppression of zzso CARS zzso One is a novel type of zzso that uses spectral phase zzso for the selective zzso of a single zzso zzso The selective zzso is achieved by the modulated pulse focusing its zzso spectrum into a narrow spectral zzso Another type is zzso CARS zzso zzso based on the measurement of the CARS spectrum obtained from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral imaging of chemical and biological samples is demonstrated using the two types of zzso
