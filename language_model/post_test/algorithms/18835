A new model of zzso in zzso diagnostic data is zzso This was accomplished by combining a zzso neural network zzso principal component analysis zzso and a genetic zzso zzso The zzso was used to reduce input zzso The zzso was applied to search for a set of zzso training factors involved in zzso zzso The presented technique was evaluated with optical zzso zzso zzso data measured during the zzso of oxide thin films in a zzso zzso coupled zzso For a systematic zzso the zzso process was characterized by a zzso Box Wilson zzso The etch responses to be modeled include oxide etch rate, oxide profile angle, and oxide etch rate zzso In zzso three types of data zzso were employed and the reduced input zzso corresponding to 100, 99, and zzso are 16, 8, and zzso The zzso training factors to be zzso include the training zzso number of hidden zzso magnitude of initial weight distribution, zzso of bipolar zzso function, and zzso of linear zzso The prediction errors of zzso models are zzso zzso zzso degrees, and zzso for the etch rate, profile angle, and etch rate zzso zzso Compared to the conventional and previous full zzso models, the presented models demonstrated a significantly improved prediction for all etch zzso
