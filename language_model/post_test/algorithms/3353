The zzso three zzso zzso characteristics of the human ankle and zzso joint were investigated in this zzso The main goals of this investigation were: 1) To determine the range of motion of the zzso complex and the associated range of motion of the ankle and zzso zzso 2) To determine the zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso complex, and 3) To identify the relationship between movements at the ankle and zzso zzso and the resulting motion produced between the foot and the zzso The tests were conducted on zzso fresh zzso lower limbs and consisted of zzso zzso the foot with respect to the shank while the motion of the articulating bones was measured through a three zzso position data acquisition zzso The zzso analysis was based on the zzso axis parameters describing the incremental zzso between any two of the three articulating bones and on a joint coordinate system used to describe the relative position between the zzso From the results of this investigation it was concluded that: 1) The range of motion of the zzso complex in any direction zzso zzso and internal zzso zzso is larger than that of either the ankle joint or the zzso zzso 2) Large zzso zzso values are present at the zzso complex in zzso and in internal zzso zzso However, only a slight amount of zzso was observed to occur in zzso 3) Neither the ankle joint nor the zzso joint are acting as ideal hinge zzso with a fixed axis of zzso 4) Motion of the zzso complex in any direction is the result of zzso at both the ankle and the zzso zzso However, the contribution of the ankle joint to zzso of the zzso complex is larger than that of the zzso joint and the contribution of the zzso joint to zzso is larger than that of the ankle zzso 5) The ankle and the zzso zzso have an approximately equal contribution to internal zzso rotation movements of the zzso zzso
