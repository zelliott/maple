The aim of the present work was to evaluate two classical zzso allowing the correction for having neglected the first exponential in the zzso method used for the determination of zzso zzso namely the zzso linear correction formula zzso and the zzso zzso correction formula zzso First, a comparison study was performed with the two correction zzso in order to predict the behavior of the calculated zzso for various levels of zzso zzso Second, using data obtained from 47 adult patients with normal zzso function, the results obtained with the two correction zzso have been compared to the reference technique, namely the zzso zzso The results of the comparison study indicated that for clearance values lower than 120 zzso the results obtained using zzso were systematically lower than those of zzso whereas for clearance values between 120 and 140 zzso the reverse was zzso The differences however, never exceeded 8 zzso The results were quite different when the clearance was higher than 140 zzso when the difference between zzso and zzso results increased zzso and the zzso provided values systematically lower than zzso The clinical study showed that, in the range of normal clearance values, both zzso and zzso zzso were slightly lower than the results obtained by means of the reference zzso Based on these results, a new specifically designed validation study involving patients with high clearance values is mandatory to determine which of these two correction methods is more accurate, or to devise a better correction zzso
