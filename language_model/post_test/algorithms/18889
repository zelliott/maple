A novel zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso study showed that in zzso solution zzso formed small zzso zzso zzso in zzso at pH zzso and changed into much larger zzso zzso sized about zzso zzso in diameter at pH zzso At pH zzso zzso changed to a much larger continued zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso 2, the surface tension zzso zzso curve at pH 2 was an ordinary one, having one critical zzso concentration at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at relatively high surface tension zzso zzso zzso However, two unique transition points were observed in the zzso plot at pH zzso zzso and zzso showing higher surface activity that is believed to be associated with the zzso structure zzso The zzso degree zzso of the three zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that a complete zzso state of the zzso occurred at pH zzso which is consistent with the apparent surface areas of zzso calculated according to Gibbs zzso zzso Variation of sizes and zzso of zzso in zzso solution at different pH values suggest that our synthetic zzso may have great potential applications as a template in zzso drug delivery, zzso and zzso zzso
