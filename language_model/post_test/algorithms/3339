The aim of this study was to evaluate an zzso for automated zzso of the zzso of a jet stream originating from a zzso The evaluation was performed in a zzso flow zzso The zzso of the zzso was assessed by measuring the diameter of the region with relatively high zzso (the zzso in the zzso profiles, as recorded with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed at 3, 6, and 9 zzso downstream of three different zzso zzso zzso 3, 5, or 8 zzso at different Reynolds numbers zzso based on time averaged flow zzso for a tube of diameter 15 zzso The developed zzso was used successfully for automated detection and zzso of jet flow diameters downstream to a zzso The zzso can be used for calculating the zzso diameter notwithstanding a theoretically predictable zzso of about 1 zzso depending on the Reynolds number and the distance from the zzso
