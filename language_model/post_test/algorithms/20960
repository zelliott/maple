The evolution of zzso is accompanied by the increased complexity of alternative zzso which greatly expands zzso zzso One of the greatest challenges in the zzso era is a complete revelation of human zzso with consideration of alternative zzso Here, we introduce a comparative zzso approach to zzso identify alternative zzso events based on the differential evolutionary conservation between zzso and zzso and the high-quality zzso of the zzso zzso Specifically, we focus on zzso that are included in some transcripts but are completely spliced out for others and we call them conditional zzso First, we characterize distinguishing features among conditional zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of the most important features is the zzso conservation zzso There are dramatic differences in conservation scores between conditional zzso and zzso zzso More importantly, the differences are zzso For zzso zzso regions, the differences between conditional zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso Using the Random zzso algorithm, we can zzso conditional zzso with high zzso zzso for the identification of conditional zzso from zzso regions and zzso for the zzso of known zzso and fair sensitivities zzso and zzso zzso We applied the method to the human zzso and identified zzso zzso that actually contain conditional zzso and classified zzso conditional zzso from the current zzso zzso zzso Among those, zzso zzso containing conditional zzso and zzso conditional zzso classified from known zzso cannot be zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso Some of these de zzso predictions were zzso zzso
