The leaves of many plants emit zzso zzso to the atmosphere, a process which has important ramifications for global and regional atmospheric zzso zzso of leaf zzso zzso and its response to environmental variation are described by zzso derived equations that replicate observed patterns, but have been linked only in some cases to known zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, models have been proposed from several independent laboratories, providing multiple approaches for prediction of emissions, but with little detail provided as to how contrasting models are zzso In this review we provide an analysis as to how the most commonly used models have been zzso or not, on the basis of known zzso and zzso zzso We also discuss the multiple approaches that have been used for modeling zzso zzso rate with an emphasis on identifying zzso and contrasts among models, we correct some mathematical errors that have been zzso through the models, and we note previously zzso zzso within processes of the zzso We come to the conclusion that the state of zzso zzso modeling remains highly zzso Where possible, we identify gaps in our knowledge that have prevented us from achieving a greater zzso foundation for the models, and we discuss the insight and data that must be gained to fill those zzso
