We assess four common claims concerning the zzso forced choice zzso procedure and the standard zzso Model of zzso zzso The first two are zzso that it is unbiased and zzso that the structure of the zzso task does not in itself alter zzso The remaining two concern a claimed 2 enhancement in sensitivity in zzso relative to that measured in a zzso zzso We review relevant past research and zzso zzso experiments from previous studies across three zzso We then report an experiment comparing zzso performance with performance in a second task designed to zzso zzso decision zzso This second task is simply two successive zzso signal detection tasks with the same timing as in the zzso zzso We find little evidence supporting the claims that zzso is unbiased and that it does not alter sensitivity and we also reject the two claims associated with the zzso Model as a model of performance in our own zzso
