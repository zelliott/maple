The dynamic zzso adjustment zzso zzso is a fast constructive zzso for training zzso neural networks zzso and zzso neural networks zzso The zzso has two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The papers which introduced zzso argued that those parameters would not heavily influence zzso performance and therefore they recommended using always the default values of these zzso In contrast, this paper shows that smaller values of zzso zzso can, for a considerable number of zzso result in strong improvement in zzso zzso The experiments described here were carried out using zzso benchmark zzso zzso from both zzso and the zzso zzso The results show that for zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso strongly influenced zzso zzso The influence of zzso was also zzso although much less, on six of the zzso zzso This paper also compares the performance of zzso with zzso selection with both zzso and Support zzso Machines zzso
