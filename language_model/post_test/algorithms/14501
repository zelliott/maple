Native cellulose fibers were surface modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate an zzso zzso which was characterized by scanning electron zzso zzso transform infrared zzso and zzso zzso This zzso had high efficiency in removal of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso solutions, even at low initial zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso equilibrium could be reached within 1 zzso The distribution zzso did not change with zzso dose, indicating the zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso models were used to fit the zzso zzso Based on the parameters calculated from the models, the zzso capacity was in the order of zzso and the zzso was a favorable zzso Compared with zzso and zzso models, the zzso followed zzso model a little zzso
