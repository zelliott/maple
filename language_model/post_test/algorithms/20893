zzso in the zzso of membrane zzso currents of zzso cause regional variations in action potential duration zzso at various zzso depths and along the zzso and zzso directions in the left zzso This work extends our previous study of zzso zzso to zzso walls shaped as an zzso volume and including both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our zzso simulation study investigates the combined effect on zzso sequences and zzso zzso of: zzso the intrinsic zzso zzso across the wall and along the zzso direction, and zzso the zzso currents that zzso the zzso when zzso are embedded in a zzso wall with fiber rotation and zzso zzso Our findings show that: zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have only a weak influence on the zzso patterns on zzso layers parallel to the zzso zzso the patterns of zzso distribution on the zzso surface are mostly affected by the zzso zzso and do not reveal the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is clearly discernible in both zzso and zzso patterns only on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is clearly discernible only in zzso patterns on layers parallel to the zzso Thus, in our zzso zzso wall, the complex zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not fully mix the effects of the zzso and zzso zzso The intrinsic spatial zzso of the zzso is unmasked in the modulated zzso patterns only in the appropriate zzso or zzso zzso These findings are independent of the stimulus location zzso zzso and of zzso zzso
