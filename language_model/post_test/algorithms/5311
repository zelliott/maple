We consider the synchronization problem of an arbitrary number of coupled zzso zzso with delays in the zzso The network zzso is described by a directed zzso Unlike the conventional approach of zzso directly sufficient synchronization conditions, the approach of the paper starts from an exact stability analysis in a zzso zzso zzso space of a synchronized equilibrium and extracts insights from an analysis of its zzso and from the corresponding emerging zzso zzso to this analysis a zzso of the characteristic equation is employed that not only zzso the analysis and reduces zzso cost but also allows to determine the precise role of the individual agents and the zzso of the network in the zzso zzso The study provides an zzso to perform a stability and zzso analysis of synchronized zzso Furthermore, it reveals fundamental limitations to synchronization and it explains under which conditions on the zzso of the network and on the characteristics of the zzso the systems are expected to zzso In the second part of the paper the results are applied to coupled Lorenz zzso The main results show that for sufficiently large zzso gains, zzso Lorenz systems exhibit a generic behavior that does not depend on the number of systems and the zzso of the network, as long as some basic assumptions are satisfied, including the strong connectivity of the zzso Here the zzso stability analysis is strengthened by a zzso stability analysis which confirms the predictions based on the zzso stability and zzso zzso This illustrates the usefulness of the exact zzso analysis in a situation where a direct zzso stability analysis is not possible or where it yields conservative conditions from which it is hard to get qualitative insights in the synchronization mechanisms and their zzso zzso In the examples several network zzso are zzso
