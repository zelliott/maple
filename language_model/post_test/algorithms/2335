A modified zzso free zzso zzso diffusion sequence is proposed for high resolution zzso zzso A pair of bipolar diffusion zzso was used to minimize the errors in measured apparent diffusion zzso zzso caused by variations in zzso zzso and zzso flip angle that have been observed with previously employed zzso diffusion zzso Motion sensitivity was reduced by the use of compensated zzso frame-by-frame zzso and a repetition time of 22 zzso which for a zzso 128 zzso 128 image requires only 3 zzso High resolution was achieved by signal zzso The modified sequence was applied to in zzso diffusion zzso In six normal rat zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cortex, outer zzso and inner zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique requires relatively large zzso to achieve adequate diffusion zzso
