This paper reports the first quantitative comparison study of elastic and zzso properties of zzso from young and aged zzso A force measurement technique, including a zzso zzso cell holding device and a zzso computer vision tracking algorithm, is zzso for measuring forces applied to an zzso and zzso cell zzso in real time during zzso zzso To characterize elastic and zzso properties of the zzso a zzso zzso test is zzso A zzso zzso mechanical model is developed to extract the mechanical properties of the zzso from the measured zzso zzso The experimental results demonstrate that the aged zzso are significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in young zzso but more viscous zzso time: zzso zzso zzso s in young zzso than the young zzso
