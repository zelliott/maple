zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most sensitive imaging zzso for detection of pulmonary zzso However, a single CT examination produces a large quantity of image zzso zzso a computerized scheme has been developed to automatically detect pulmonary zzso on CT zzso This scheme includes both two- and three-dimensional zzso Within each section, zzso zzso methods are used to segment the zzso from the background and then the lungs from the zzso A rolling ball zzso is applied to the lung zzso contours to avoid the loss of zzso zzso Multiple zzso thresholds are applied to the zzso lung regions to identify zzso zzso These candidates represent both zzso and normal pulmonary zzso For each candidate, two- and three-dimensional geometric and zzso features are zzso These features are merged with linear zzso analysis to reduce the number of candidates that zzso to normal zzso This method was applied to a zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was used to evaluate the automated zzso zzso yielded an area under the zzso curve of zzso in the task of zzso candidates detected during zzso as zzso or zzso
