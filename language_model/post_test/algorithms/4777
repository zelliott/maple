zzso zzso modification is an important zzso modification and the zzso of prediction methods remains a zzso Here, by using Support zzso Machines zzso zzso a novel zzso method was developed for zzso modification site prediction based on zzso Forward zzso zzso of hundreds of zzso acid properties, which are collected by zzso Acid Index database zzso Our method also compares with the zzso system, in which the 20 zzso acids are represented by zzso zzso (A zzso zzso C zzso zzso and so zzso The overall accuracy of zzso zzso for our method reaches zzso which is higher than zzso zzso It indicated that the zzso modification prediction process is highly related to the zzso acid property and this approach here provide a helpful tool for further investigation of the zzso modification and identification of zzso sites in zzso The software is available at zzso
