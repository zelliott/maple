A zzso zzso intended for zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction is proposed and zzso The zzso models the object as zzso constant subject to a blurring zzso To validate that the zzso closely zzso the true object in the zzso case, projection data were generated from an object assuming this model and using the system zzso zzso Carlo simulations were performed to provide more realistic data of a phantom with varying zzso across the field of view and a cardiac zzso zzso were performed across a sweep of two primary design zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso recovers the object in a zzso simulation zzso While the zzso assumes a specific blurring model, the results suggest that the zzso may provide high reconstruction accuracy even when the object does not match the assumed blurring zzso Generally, increased values of the blurring zzso and total variation weighting parameters reduced zzso artifacts, while decreasing spatial zzso The proposed zzso demonstrated higher correlation with respect to the true phantom compared to zzso expectation zzso zzso zzso Images reconstructed with the proposed zzso demonstrated reduced zzso artifacts when reconstructing from few views compared to zzso The proposed zzso introduced zzso artifacts in some reconstructed images, depending on the noise level and the selected zzso zzso Overall, the results demonstrate preliminary feasibility of a zzso reconstruction zzso which may be beneficial for zzso zzso
