zzso studies typically identify neural activity correlated with the predictions of highly zzso models, like the many reward prediction error zzso models used to study reinforcement zzso zzso brain areas might zzso zzso or, zzso only have activity correlated with zzso model zzso Here, we use an alternate zzso approach rooted in economic theory to formally test the entire class of zzso models on neural zzso We show that zzso of human neural activity from the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and zzso zzso zzso satisfy necessary and sufficient conditions for the entire class of zzso zzso However, activity measured from the anterior zzso zzso the zzso model, and therefore no zzso model can account for measured zzso Further analysis suggests the anterior zzso might instead zzso something related to the zzso of an zzso As cognitive zzso matures and models zzso formal approaches of this kind that assess entire model classes rather than specific model zzso may take on increased zzso
