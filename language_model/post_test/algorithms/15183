The main obstacle to high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the differential zzso phase error from zzso In this work, the phase error is addressed with a hybrid zzso zzso approach that zzso zzso phase in two zzso In the first, zzso motion is corrected for every zzso In the second, zzso zzso zzso is corrected for each portion of the cardiac zzso These phase error corrections were implemented with a zzso zzso zzso state free zzso pulse sequence and were shown to mitigate signal dropouts caused by zzso phase inconsistencies compared to a standard zzso reconstruction in healthy zzso The proposed approach resulted in diffusion contrast more similar to the contrast observed in the reference zzso imaging scans than reconstruction of the same data without zzso zzso zzso and Color fractional zzso maps generated with zzso data were also shown to be more similar to zzso imaging reference scans than those generated without phase zzso
