Debate continues between zzso or zzso approach for coronary artery bypass zzso zzso We used zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso as a tool within a decision-making zzso driven by the zzso factors of coronary anatomy and zzso Our analysis presents this decision zzso and describes outcomes using this zzso 

From January 2000 to December 2003, zzso consecutive patients undergoing isolated zzso were assigned by one surgeon to a zzso zzso zzso or zzso according to zzso anatomy and zzso predicted zzso zzso factors against zzso were target vessel size less than zzso zzso zzso poor quality, zzso location, and multiple zzso Given that zzso could be performed zzso patients in the moderate risk range, zzso those elderly with multiple zzso were zzso treated using zzso 

The zzso group had higher predicted 30-day mortality compared with the zzso zzso group, consistent with the zzso zzso However, morbidity and mortality were similar between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso patients received the same number of internal zzso artery zzso but fewer zzso zzso zzso and observed to expected ratios were favorable for both groups and below those The Society of zzso zzso predicted for zzso 

zzso surgical strategy to zzso factors and needs resulted in excellent zzso Our data support the use of a protocol based on patient characteristics to drive the zzso choice between an zzso zzso or zzso zzso As such, zzso can be viewed as a tool to be used by the surgeon developing a best practice in treating coronary artery zzso
