zzso artifacts may cause severe problems in clinical zzso zzso zzso imaging and may impair diagnosis as well as overall image zzso Many approaches for reducing these artifacts tackle the problem by simply ignoring or zzso the metal traces in the raw data, which results in a general information loss and additional artifacts in the corrected zzso It was the objective of this study to develop an approach aiming at correcting several physical artifact zzso We have also tried to minimize the impact on spatial resolution and attempted to avoid new artifacts resulting from the zzso 

The zzso works with a first zzso reconstruction followed by zzso metal zzso zzso The segmented metal implants are then forward projected and the resulting zzso entries are squared and combined, followed by a second reconstruction to yield correction zzso The resulting volumes are then combined zzso with a combination weight determined to minimize the zzso of the initial zzso A directional filtering zzso following the beam zzso correction applies a zzso zzso in the metal traces of the zzso which reduces existing zzso noise zzso Phantom zzso on a zzso zzso disc with different zzso and a zzso hip phantom with optional bone and titanium zzso were used for evaluating the zzso Patient zzso containing zzso and bilateral hip zzso verified the zzso and efficiency on realistic clinical zzso 

zzso in CT values were reduced to below 3 zzso on zzso Image noise reduction of up to zzso was achieved zzso noise reduction of zzso with a more homogeneous CT value distribution in zzso zzso A comparison to standard zzso methods showed superior artifact suppression without producing artifacts caused by zzso and without the general information loss in the close vicinity to the zzso The impact on spatial resolution was minimized as compared with zzso zzso 

Metal artifacts caused by zzso were strongly zzso Soft tissue areas and skeletal structures surrounding the implants were well zzso The correction works by zzso CT zzso and it is zzso to any reconstructed image without a zzso zzso
