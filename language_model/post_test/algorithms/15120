zzso zzso the simultaneous zzso of the zzso function and the zzso function zzso of the zzso is an zzso problem with zzso solutions that are usually avoided by enforcing constraints on the zzso function and the zzso We derived a zzso method for blind zzso in which we assume a mathematical model for the zzso that depends on a small number of parameters zzso less than zzso The zzso then estimates the unknown parameters together with the zzso zzso The mathematical model ensures that all the constraints of the zzso are satisfied, and the zzso approach ensures that the zzso is zzso The method successfully estimates the zzso and removes zzso zzso The zzso zzso is robust to aberrations in the zzso and to noise in the zzso
