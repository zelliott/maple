A convenient method for the preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso particles based on an automated particle casting technique is zzso The particles are made highly selective for a number of zzso by doping them with zzso and other active zzso in complete zzso to zzso or fiber-optic chemical zzso The approach used here produces spheres of high zzso at a rate of approximately zzso zzso The casting process is based on a zzso zzso drop formation and zzso process, and the particles are formed under very mild, zzso zzso This allows one to zzso incorporate known amounts of different active components into the zzso As an initial example, the particles are doped with three optical sensing zzso the sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso additive sodium zzso zzso The particles are found to be of zzso shape with a diameter of approximately 10 zzso They respond individually and selectively to sodium according to classical zzso theory, as determined by zzso zzso With a zzso of zzso sensing zzso from particle to particle is zzso This technique may allow the development of mass-produced chemically selective zzso on the basis of bulk extraction zzso
