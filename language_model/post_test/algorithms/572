zzso zzso zzso channels have been implicated in contributing to a broad variety of human disorders, including pain, zzso sleep zzso cardiac zzso and certain types of zzso However, potent and selective zzso zzso channel zzso are not yet available for clinical zzso This may in part be due to their unique zzso properties that have delayed the development of zzso screening zzso zzso for identifying zzso One notable challenge is that at the normal resting membrane potential zzso of cell lines commonly zzso for drug screening purposes, zzso zzso channels are largely zzso and thus cannot be supported by typical formats of functional zzso zzso to both evoke and zzso the zzso channel zzso Here we describe a simple method that can successfully support a zzso functional zzso for compounds that zzso zzso zzso The zzso functions by exploiting the zzso properties of zzso to control the cellular zzso in advance of zzso zzso channel zzso Using selected zzso conditions in the presence of zzso zzso zzso channels are converted from the zzso zzso state to the available, resting state, where they can be subsequently activated by application of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso has been zzso characterized with sample zzso zzso channel zzso whose potency has been determined by conventional manual zzso zzso This method has the potential for applications in zzso zzso imaging plate reader zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formats with cell lines expressing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso
