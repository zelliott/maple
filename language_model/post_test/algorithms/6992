A fast zzso for zzso multiple current zzso in the human brain by measuring the external magnetic field is zzso A genetic zzso is used first for rough estimate of zzso To speed up the global zzso algorithm, an explicit solution for a zzso head model is used for the rough zzso This rough estimate is then used as a start for a fine search using a zzso algorithm, in which a boundary element solution for a realistic zzso head model is zzso zzso simulation indicates that the present zzso zzso zzso times faster than an zzso using a zzso head model in all the zzso
