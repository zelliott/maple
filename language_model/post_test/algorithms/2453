The impression exists that picture acuity scores may overestimate function when subjects are switched to letter zzso This has not been systematically zzso The aims of this study were to validate both printed crowded Kay picture zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso test acuity zzso against gold standard zzso letter chart zzso 

A total of 30 adult subjects with various zzso disease and 40 zzso children underwent test and zzso visual acuity zzso using the zzso chart, the zzso zzso test, and the zzso acuity scores taken, using the zzso visual acuity measurement zzso zzso and Altman methods were zzso 

zzso and printed Kay picture acuity scores agreed zzso Both Kay picture test zzso were systematically biased when compared with zzso chart zzso No significant zzso bias was zzso The test zzso zzso zzso of all three tests was found to be similar between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso 

All three tests were similarly zzso and zzso Kay pictures appear to be a valid alternative to hard copy Kay zzso Kay picture acuity zzso were systematically biased when compared with the gold standard zzso zzso error means that differences of up to zzso zzso may be observed in clinically stable patients when zzso using the same zzso A combination of zzso and systematic bias can however lead to differences of up to zzso zzso in stable zzso patients when switched from zzso to zzso chart acuity zzso
