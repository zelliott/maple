The zzso ideal observer is optimal among all observers and sets an absolute upper bound for the performance of any observer in zzso tasks zzso Trees, zzso zzso and zzso Theory, Part I zzso zzso zzso the ideal observer should be used for objective image quality assessment whenever zzso However, zzso of zzso performance is difficult in practice because this observer requires the full description of unknown, statistical properties of zzso complex data arising in real life zzso Previously, zzso zzso Carlo zzso methods were developed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A 20, zzso ] and by Park et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A 24, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Imaging 28, 657 zzso ] to estimate the performance of the ideal observer and the zzso ideal observer zzso respectively, in zzso tasks involving zzso random zzso However, both zzso had the disadvantage of long zzso zzso We propose a fast zzso for real-time zzso of the likelihood ratio for the zzso Our simulation results show that our method has the potential to speed up zzso performance in tasks involving complex data when efficient channels are used for the zzso
