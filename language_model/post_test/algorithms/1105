Most current linkage analyses assume identical zzso of zzso zzso between zzso marker zzso of the two zzso This assumption is not zzso because considerable sex-related differences have been observed in zzso zzso In this paper, a general zzso zzso is presented to estimate zzso zzso zzso for a mixed set of molecular markers segregating differently in a zzso family derived from two zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the estimates of linkage specifically for each of the parents are evaluated using a zzso analysis based on information zzso This approach will have important implications for precise gene mapping based on zzso linkage zzso
