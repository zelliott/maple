To compare visual outcomes after zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without Iris Registration zzso 

In this retrospective study, zzso was performed on 239 zzso eyes, with or without zzso of 142 zzso Iris registration zzso was performed on 121 eyes and zzso registration zzso was performed on 118 zzso zzso outcome measures were zzso visual acuity zzso best zzso visual acuity zzso and manifest zzso 

At 6 months, the mean values for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in the iris registration group and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso registration group zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of eyes in the iris registration group had zzso of zzso or better compared to zzso in the zzso registration group zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of eyes in the iris registration group and zzso in the zzso registration group were within zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso absolute change in total zzso higher order aberrations in the iris registration group and zzso registration group was zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso At 3 months, the mean magnitude of error of surgically induced zzso was zzso in the iris registration group and zzso in the zzso registration group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso laser system, independent of iris registration status, is effective, safe, and zzso Under zzso surgical conditions, this study did not find any statistical significance supporting the better achievement of visual zzso zzso zzso or the lesser induction of higher order aberrations using iris registration in comparison to a zzso registration zzso
