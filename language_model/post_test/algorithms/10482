This work describes a zzso zzso mixture model constrained by a zzso random field to model high angular resolution diffusion imaging zzso zzso zzso models suit zzso well because the zzso by diffusion is inherently a zzso The goal is to create a general model that can be used in different zzso This study focuses on image zzso and zzso zzso the zzso 

zzso signal zzso data are used to train a zzso mixture model in which the mean zzso and zzso zzso are assumed to be independent of spatial locations, whereas the mixture weights are allowed to vary at different lattice zzso zzso zzso of the data is ensured by imposing a zzso random field prior on the mixture zzso The model is trained in an zzso fashion using the expectation zzso zzso The number of mixture components is determined using the minimum message length criterion from information zzso Once the model has been trained, it can be fitted to a noisy diffusion zzso volume by maximizing the zzso probability of the underlying zzso data in a zzso zzso recovering a zzso version of the zzso Moreover, the fitted probability maps of the mixture components can be used as features for zzso image zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso proposed here was compared on real data with three other approaches that are commonly used in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The comparison shows that, at low zzso ratio, when these methods falter, our zzso considerably zzso zzso When zzso is performed on the zzso data rather than on the noisy zzso the quality of the output improves zzso Finally, zzso and zzso nucleus zzso experiments also show the potential usefulness of the mixture probability maps for zzso zzso 

The presented zzso zzso mixture model for diffusion zzso provides excellent zzso results at low zzso zzso This makes it possible to restore data acquired with a fast zzso zzso pulse sequence to acceptable noise zzso This is the case in diffusion zzso where a large number of zzso volumes have to be acquired under clinical time zzso
