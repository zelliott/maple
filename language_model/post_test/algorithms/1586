We apply a phase retrieval zzso to the intensity pattern of a zzso zzso sensor to measure with enhanced accuracy the phase structure of a zzso hole zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso error achieved by phase reconstruction is one order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained from a typical zzso zzso Experimental results are consistent with a phase measurement performed independently using a zzso zzso zzso
