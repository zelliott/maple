To develop a clinical decision rule to predict the presence of zzso lung disease zzso in systemic sclerosis zzso zzso and to estimate the prevalence of zzso 

Patient data were extracted from the Canadian zzso Research Group zzso Three zzso for the clinical decision rule were considered based on lung zzso chest zzso zzso and % predicted forced vital capacity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were used as the gold standard to determine the diagnostic properties of the 3 zzso Multiple zzso was used to zzso zzso data when missing, thereby avoiding bias due to differential referral for zzso 

This study included zzso zzso Of the patients with zzso scans, zzso had evidence of zzso compared to zzso by physical examination and zzso by zzso The zzso of those who did not have zzso was zzso greater than those who did zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Algorithm A, which identified the presence of zzso based on crackles on lung zzso and/or findings on zzso had a likelihood ratio of zzso compared to zzso for Algorithm B (which included patients with zzso zzso and zzso for Algorithm C (which included patients with zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso in the cohort was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We developed a simple clinical decision rule to predict zzso with good test zzso The prevalence of zzso in a large, zzso zzso cohort was estimated to be zzso
