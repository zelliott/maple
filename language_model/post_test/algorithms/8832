zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecules prepared on noble metal zzso are known to exert considerable influence over zzso nucleation and growth and, as such, offer model templates for investigation of the processes of directed zzso zzso the structural evolution of zzso systems is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which organic zzso mediate mineral zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso provides the attractive ability to study SAM structure at critical stages throughout the processes of zzso in zzso zzso Here, we discuss important theoretical and experimental considerations for designing and implementing zzso studies of zzso zzso
