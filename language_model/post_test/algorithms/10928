The inclusion of organ deformation and movement in zzso treatment planning is of increasing importance as research and clinical applications begin to take into consideration the effects of zzso zzso like breathing, on the shape and position of zzso In this scenario, the challenge is to zzso the target in zzso (not only by means of marker zzso and to calculate the dose distribution as the sum of all the contributions from the positions assumed by the target during the respiratory zzso The aim of this work is to investigate the use of zzso registration for target tracking and dynamic treatment planning, zzso treatment planning based not on one single CT scan but on multiple CT scans representative of the zzso Twenty patients were CT scanned at zzso and zzso An expert radiation zzso identified the zzso in both zzso The two CT data sets per patient were zzso registered using a zzso deformation zzso based on zzso The zzso objective function consisted of a weighted sum of a similarity criterion zzso zzso and a zzso factor which zzso the transformation to be locally zzso Once the transformation was obtained and the registration zzso its parameters were applied to the target zzso Finally, the zzso target was compared to the zzso delineated by the radiation zzso in the other zzso The results of this procedure show an agreement between the center of mass as well as volume of the target identified automatically by zzso registration and manually by the radiation zzso Moreover, obtained zzso were in agreement with body structure constraints and considerations usually accepted in radiation therapy zzso No significant influence of initial target volume on zzso was zzso In conclusion, the proposed method seems to offer the possibility of using zzso registrations in zzso treatment planning, even if more cases need to be investigated in order to give a statistical consistency to zzso setup and proposed zzso
