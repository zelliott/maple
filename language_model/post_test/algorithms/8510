All zzso require an essential zzso metal for their zzso In this study, we investigated the metal dependence of zzso zzso 4 zzso With zzso as the essential metal and zzso being the variable zzso the maximum zzso zzso was not affected by changes in metal zzso whereas zzso was zzso indicating that the metal effects were mainly derived from a change in the zzso for zzso Analysis of the metal dependence of initial rates according to a simple metal binding model indicated the presence on zzso of one zzso zzso site with a zzso constant, zzso of 5 zzso zzso and three zzso zzso sites with an averaged zzso constant, zzso of zzso zzso and that the binding of metal to the zzso and zzso sites appeared to be ordered with binding of metal to the zzso site zzso zzso of zzso for zzso yielded similar metal dependence zzso with a value of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso by zzso and a small zzso inhibitor were also zzso by zzso zzso values estimated from the metal variation of the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso inhibitor zzso zzso were in good agreement with the zzso value zzso zzso obtained from the metal variation of the initial rate of zzso By using the zzso zzso plot, the temperature dependence of zzso and zzso yielded an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso to the zzso site and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso binding to the zzso zzso The values of associated zzso were also negative, indicating that these metal binding reactions were entirely zzso These data were consistent with metal binding to multiple sites on zzso that zzso the zzso structure, zzso the zzso activity, and alters the affinities of inhibitor for the zzso zzso zzso However, the affinities of small zzso zzso for zzso were not affected by the change of metal from zzso to zzso suggesting that the structures of zzso and zzso were zzso
