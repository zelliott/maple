In contrast to the negative results of the primary analysis, secondary analyses of the zzso study do support the clinical importance of middle zzso zzso This is in agreement with the findings of large zzso studies showing an improvement in mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients treated with zzso zzso or zzso techniques as compared to zzso zzso For practical assessment of middle zzso zzso we suggest using the zzso of zzso zzso with a reference zzso value of zzso which was the average value for the zzso arm in the zzso zzso For patients on zzso zzso where zzso cannot reliably be zzso we suggest using the zzso of vitamin B12 zzso with a reference zzso value of zzso adapted from the findings of the Case Mix zzso Study zzso zzso To simplify the routine assessment of these zzso two zzso are zzso the first allows to estimate zzso from the zzso to zzso zzso concentration ratio, the second allows to estimate the diffusion dialysis clearance of vitamin B12 from the in zzso zzso zzso and actual plasma water flow zzso While waiting for specific trials addressing the issue of dialysis zzso related to middle zzso zzso clinical experience with the middle zzso zzso could provide further quantitative tools for dialysis prescription and favor an increase in dialysis time (or zzso and/or the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
