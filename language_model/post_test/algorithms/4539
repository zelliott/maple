The problem of zzso zzso zzso from zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso data in zzso with and without parents is zzso We focus on the Fisher information of the zzso zzso of the parents in order to correctly deal with the dependence of zzso within zzso We compare these Fisher information zzso with those obtained for unrelated individuals and study the relative efficiency of zzso with and without parents compared to unrelated individuals in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second zzso contributes half the information of the first, except for rare zzso when the second zzso counts almost as zzso We argue that the relative efficiencies can also be used to correct for dependence in the calculation of standard errors after initially ignoring the dependence in the zzso zzso
