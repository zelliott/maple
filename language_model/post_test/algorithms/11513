An error analysis on the zzso linear reconstruction zzso is zzso Three types of error are discussed and it is found that zzso error is dominant in most zzso It is also found that the commonly used small zzso assumption in obtaining the zzso equation often fails but, due to the dominance of the zzso error, the reconstruction of the relative zzso distribution is still feasible by using the linear zzso The error analysis leads to a useful understanding of the mechanism of linear reconstruction zzso
