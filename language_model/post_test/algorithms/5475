zzso zzso is a potentially negative side effect of irrigation with reclaimed zzso While zzso schemes have been applied to soil zzso control, these have typically failed to take advantage of real-time sensor zzso This study incorporates current soil observation technologies into the optimal zzso scheme known as zzso Horizon Control zzso to enable successful autonomous control of soil zzso zzso uses real-time sensor zzso zzso state prediction models, and zzso zzso to drive field conditions to a desired environmental state by manipulating application rate or irrigation zzso A simulation model including the Richards equation coupled to energy and zzso transport equations is employed as a state zzso zzso zzso zzso installed in the soil provide initial conditions and continuous feedback to the control zzso An zzso zzso determines the optimal irrigation rate or frequency subject to imposed constraints protective of soil zzso A small-scale field test demonstrates that the zzso scheme is capable of autonomously maintaining specified salt levels at a prescribed soil zzso This finding suggests that, given an adequately structured and trained simulation model, sensor networks, and zzso zzso can be integrated using zzso to autonomously achieve water zzso and agricultural objectives while managing soil zzso
