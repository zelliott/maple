The primary sequence of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso structural sequences of two hundred proteins selected from Brookhaven zzso DataBank using a modified version of the Bowie et zzso zzso zzso zzso structural zzso was found to zzso proteins and specifically to those with the zzso fold for which the crystal structure was zzso No such zzso was detected using common primary sequence alignment programs such as zzso or zzso
