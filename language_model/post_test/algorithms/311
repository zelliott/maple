The zzso radiation produced by a zzso zzso laser scheme strongly zzso and develops an zzso behavior with increasing power of the driving zzso laser zzso This is explained by the formation of a plasma channel due to zzso Due to zzso inside the filament and the zzso phase shift, the phase difference between the 800 zzso and 400 zzso zzso varies along this plasma zzso As a result, the local zzso zzso generated along the filament interfere zzso or zzso which zzso itself in the form of Maker zzso
