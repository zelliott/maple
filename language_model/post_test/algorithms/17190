To develop an zzso utilizing differential zzso frequency analysis to discriminate promoter from zzso regions in zzso DNA zzso without relying upon an extensive database of known zzso zzso 

By determining zzso zzso derived from known promoter regions, coding regions and zzso regions in zzso DNA zzso and a formula first applied by zzso and zzso zzso a zzso measure was created that compares promoter regions with coding zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is able to identify correctly the promoter regions in 18 of 29 zzso zzso from an independent test data zzso With program options set to identify only one promoter region in the forward zzso there are 11 zzso predictions in 208 zzso zzso (one false positive in 18 zzso zzso zzso With options set to analyze sequence in discrete zzso there is no appreciable improvement in sensitivity, whereas the specificity falls off zzso It is of particular interest than a search for a peak score zzso of an absolute zzso is more accurate that a search based upon a fixed scoring zzso This suggests that the selection of promoter sites may be influenced by the global properties of an entire sequence domain, rather than exclusively upon local zzso
