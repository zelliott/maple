To create an accurate 6 zzso zzso Carlo simulation phase space for the zzso zzso treatment head geometry imported from zzso zzso aided zzso without adjusting the input electron phase space zzso 

zzso zzso was employed to simulate the 6 zzso beam treatment head geometry of the zzso zzso zzso The electron tracks in the linear accelerator were simulated with zzso and the obtained electron phase space was used as an input to the zzso Carlo beam transport and dose zzso The geometry components are zzso zzso included in zzso as zzso zzso dynamic zzso language) files obtained via zzso zzso for the exchange of zzso export from zzso followed by zzso import in zzso a zzso zzso The zzso has a compact treatment head and the small space between the shielding zzso and the divergent are of the upper jaws forbids the zzso of a plane for storing the phase zzso Instead, an zzso zzso Atomic Energy zzso zzso phase space writer was implemented on a zzso zzso The simulation was run in parallel on a 1200 zzso Linux zzso The 6 zzso dose calculations were performed for field sizes varying from 4 zzso 4 to 40 zzso 40 zzso The zzso size for the 60 zzso 60 zzso 40 zzso water phantom was 4 zzso 4 zzso 4 zzso For the 10 zzso 10 zzso field, surface buildup calculations were performed using 4 zzso 4 zzso 2 zzso zzso within 20 zzso of the zzso 

For the depth dose curves, zzso of the calculated data points agree within zzso with the experimental zzso for depths between 2 and 40 zzso For depths between 5 and 30 zzso agreement within zzso is obtained for zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso 10), zzso (20 zzso 20 and 30 zzso zzso and zzso (40 zzso 40) of the data points, zzso In the buildup region, the agreement is within zzso except at 1 zzso depth where the zzso is zzso for the 10 zzso 10 zzso open zzso For the lateral dose profiles, within the field size for fields up to 30 zzso 30 zzso the agreement is within zzso for depths up to 10 zzso At 20 zzso depth, the zzso maximum dose difference for the 30 zzso 30 zzso open field is within zzso while the smaller field sizes agree within zzso Outside the field size, agreement within zzso of the maximum dose difference is obtained for all zzso The calculated output factors varied from zzso zzso zzso for the 4 zzso 4 zzso field to zzso zzso zzso for the 40 zzso 40 zzso zzso Their agreement with the experimental output factors is within zzso 

The authors have validated a zzso simulated zzso phase space of the zzso zzso for the 6 zzso beam obtained using a high accuracy geometry zzso from zzso These files are publicly available and can be used for further zzso
