zzso zzso imaging zzso is commonly used to zzso white matter tracts in the human brain via parameters such as fractional zzso and mean zzso zzso studies recommend the use of more than six directions for robust zzso estimates; however, no study has examined the impact of the number of zzso directions on deterministic zzso diffusion parameters in human zzso Here, for 10 major white matter tracts in 11 healthy volunteers at zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso imaging data were compared to zzso or zzso data, keeping scan time and number of b zzso 0 images constant within each zzso Mean zzso was systematically lower for zzso protocols zzso zzso zzso data had higher fractional zzso in the superior zzso zzso and smaller tract volume for the zzso of the corpus zzso In general, zzso differences due to the number of directions were smaller than those from zzso variation or zzso zzso Despite some absolute differences, standard zzso were significantly different for only one of 160 zzso Thus, zzso data provide diffusion measures with comparable zzso to zzso or zzso data and yield appropriate zzso values for most white matter zzso although there are clear advantages in acquiring higher angular resolution zzso
