zzso and zzso zzso measure the electromagnetic signals produced by brain zzso In order to address the issue of limited zzso ratio zzso with raw data, acquisitions consist of multiple repetitions of the same zzso An important challenge arising from such data is the zzso of brain zzso over the zzso It zzso statistical analysis such as prediction performance in a supervised learning zzso One such zzso zzso is the time offset of the peak of the zzso which varies across zzso We propose to address this zzso issue by explicitly modeling time shifts of different brain responses in a zzso zzso To this end, we use the zzso support zzso machine zzso zzso where the zzso shifts are zzso while learning the zzso zzso The zzso shifts are further used to improve the zzso of the zzso data, and to zzso the zzso and the sequence of zzso across the brain regions that are involved in the experimental zzso zzso are validated on a long-term memory retrieval task, showing significant improvement using the proposed zzso zzso zzso
