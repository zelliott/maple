The presence of recurring zzso events (also known as cardiac zzso or irregular zzso as well as erroneous beat detection due to low signal quality, significantly affects zzso of both time and frequency domain zzso of heart rate zzso zzso A reliable, real-time zzso and correction of zzso zzso is a necessary prerequisite for an accurate online monitoring of zzso and cardiovascular zzso We have developed a novel zzso method for real-time zzso zzso error detection and zzso Given an zzso event, we assume that the length of the next zzso zzso follows a zzso motivated, zzso inverse zzso probability zzso We then devise an instantaneous automated detection and correction procedure for erroneous and zzso beats by using the information on the probability of occurrence of the observed beat provided by the zzso We test our zzso over two zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso normal rhythm database is artificially corrupted with known erroneous beats to test both the detection procedure and correction zzso The benchmark zzso zzso database is further considered to test the detection procedure of real zzso events and compare it with results from previously published zzso Our automated zzso represents an improvement over previous procedures, with best specificity for the detection of correct beats, as well as highest sensitivity to missed and extra beats, artificially misplaced beats, and for real zzso zzso A zzso heartbeat zzso and zzso together with the ability to adapt to zzso changes of heartbeat dynamics in an online fashion, may provide a solid base for building a more reliable real-time zzso monitoring zzso
