Moving cast shadows are a major concern for foreground detection zzso The processing of foreground images in surveillance applications typically requires that such shadows be identified and removed from the detected zzso This paper presents a novel zzso statistical approach to model moving cast shadows of zzso and varying zzso This approach uses the zzso mixture model zzso learning ability to build statistical models describing moving cast shadows on zzso This statistical modeling can deal with scenes with complex and zzso zzso including light saturated areas, and prevent false detection in regions where shadows cannot be zzso The proposed approach can be used with zzso descriptions of zzso surfaces found in the zzso It significantly reduces their false detection rate without increasing the missed detection zzso zzso obtained with different scene types and shadow models show the zzso of the zzso
