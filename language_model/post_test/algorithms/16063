zzso zzso is a new technique to obtain mechanical properties of the vessel wall and zzso Mechanical information of vascular tissue is important for zzso of different plaque zzso detection of plaque vulnerability and thus choosing the proper zzso zzso The feasibility of the technique is investigated using zzso and diseased human zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso reveals information that is unavailable or zzso from the zzso zzso The technique is based on the principle that tissue strain is directly related to its mechanical zzso In zzso zzso the tissue is compressed using different zzso zzso The strain is determined using zzso techniques of the radio frequency zzso zzso Reliable strain estimates are only obtained when signals of corresponding tissue are zzso zzso to zzso motion, zzso position and zzso rotation of the zzso zzso the zzso traces at low and at high pressure may be zzso Four zzso are tested to track the corresponding ultrasound zzso Three methods zzso zzso and zzso are applied on the zzso signal and one zzso on the envelope zzso zzso zzso are performed to obtain a data set with a zzso knowledge of the scattering particles positions in the tissue at high and low zzso Different positions of the zzso in the zzso zzso levels of the material and zzso ratios zzso are zzso Finally, these findings are zzso with a phantom experiment in a water zzso From the simulations, it can be concluded that the zzso tracking zzso has the best performance, under all zzso The performance decreases with larger zzso of the zzso and larger zzso of the zzso The zzso is only of minor zzso The zzso tracking zzso has also the best performance in the phantom zzso The performance of the zzso tracking zzso is better than the three zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso of this method may improve the quality of the zzso
