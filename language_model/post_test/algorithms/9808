This article presents the current state of a work in progress, whose objective is to better understand the effects of factors that significantly influence the performance of zzso semantic analysis zzso A difficult task, which consisted of answering zzso biology multiple choice questions, was used to test the semantic properties of the truncated singular space and to study the relative influence of the main zzso A dedicated software was designed to fine-tune the zzso semantic space for the multiple choice questions zzso With optimal zzso the performances of our simple model were quite surprisingly equal or superior to those of seventh- and eighth-grade zzso This indicates that semantic spaces were quite good despite their low dimensions and the small sizes of the training data zzso In addition, we present an original zzso global weighting of the zzso terms for each of the multiple choice questions, which was necessary to achieve the zzso zzso
