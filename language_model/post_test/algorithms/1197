The low dose rate zzso miniature zzso zzso sources are available, with one or three active zzso for use in source trains in automatic and manual zzso systems for zzso zzso Absolute dose rate zzso in water have been calculated around these sources using the zzso Carlo zzso code and they are presented as conventional two-dimensional Cartesian zzso zzso The zzso Task Group 43 zzso for dose calculation has been also zzso The dose rate constant obtained for the one zzso source is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the value for the three zzso source is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, for the treatment planning systems based on zzso zzso the zzso zzso that best reproduce zzso Carlo dose rate distribution are zzso
