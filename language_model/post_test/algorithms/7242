We derive learning rules for finding the connections between units in zzso zzso networks from the recorded history of a zzso subset of the zzso We consider two zzso In both of them, the visible units are zzso and zzso In one model the zzso units are zzso with zzso zzso functions, and in the other they are zzso and zzso like the visible zzso We derive exact learning rules for both zzso For the zzso case, performing the exact calculation requires, in general, repeated zzso over an number of zzso that grows zzso with the size of the system and the data zzso which is not feasible for large zzso We derive a mean field theory, based on a zzso zzso for the distribution of zzso states, which offers an attractive alternative for large zzso We present the results of some zzso calculations that illustrate key features of the two models and, for the zzso case, the exact and approximate zzso
