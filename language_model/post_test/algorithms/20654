This paper reports a method for the identification of those molecules in a database of rigid zzso structures with molecular zzso potential zzso zzso that are most similar to that of a zzso target zzso The most important features of an zzso grid are zzso in zzso and a target zzso is matched against a database zzso by a comparison of the corresponding zzso The matching is zzso using a zzso common zzso zzso algorithm, which provides an alignment of the target zzso zzso with those of each of the database molecules in zzso These alignments are used in the second stage of the search zzso to calculate the zzso zzso zzso Several different ways of generating zzso are zzso in terms of the effectiveness of the resulting similarity measures and of the associated zzso zzso The most appropriate procedure has been implemented in an operational system that searches a corporate database, containing zzso zzso zzso zzso
