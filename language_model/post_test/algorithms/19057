We present intrinsic and zzso methods for studying anatomical coordinates in order to perform statistical zzso on random zzso signals F across clinical zzso In both intrinsic and zzso methods, we introduce generalized partition functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso M, which are used to construct a random field of F on M as statistical zzso In the intrinsic analysis, such partition functions are built zzso for individual anatomical coordinate based on zzso zzso on zzso analysis via zzso linear zzso differential zzso In contrast, the zzso method needs only one set of partition functions for a template coordinate system, and then applies to each anatomical coordinate system via zzso zzso For zzso we apply both intrinsic and zzso methods to a clinical zzso cortical thickness variation of the left zzso zzso in zzso Both methods show that the left zzso zzso tends to become thinner in schizophrenia relative to the healthy control zzso However, the intrinsic method increases the statistical zzso
