A novel zzso reaction was observed to occur under zzso zzso zzso atmospheric pressure chemical zzso zzso and atmospheric pressure photo zzso zzso conditions, leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso followed by fast zzso zzso The reaction is particularly favored during zzso which suggests that this zzso reaction can occur both in the solution inside the zzso droplets and in the zzso environment of most other atmospheric pressure zzso zzso The zzso reaction is inherent to the zzso process during zzso whereas it is more by zzso chemistry in nature during zzso and zzso From the tandem mass zzso zzso data, accurate mass zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments and density functional theory zzso calculations, two zzso zzso zzso appear to be the most likely products of this zzso aromatic substitution zzso The possible occurrence of this unexpected reaction zzso mass spectral data interpretation and can be misleading in terms of structural assignment as reported zzso for zzso zzso
