zzso zzso zzso is a chronic disease, associated with a significant rate of zzso lower in patients with events provoked by transient risk factors and higher in zzso zzso zzso treatment is indicated for provoked zzso long-term treatment should be considered for zzso The aim of this review is to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence and the zzso zzso available to guide patients' zzso 

To identify patients who carry a high zzso risk and require long-term treatment, three zzso have been zzso the zzso the Vienna prediction model, and the DASH zzso All identify male sex and elevated zzso levels as important risk factors for zzso However, important differences among the models should be zzso in the zzso model, zzso levels are measured during zzso and not after its zzso zzso it indicates age greater than 65 as a risk factor for zzso whereas the DASH score attributes a higher risk to age less than zzso The Vienna model is complex for routine zzso 

Further studies are needed to clarify these zzso A management study based on zzso levels after zzso withdrawal is ongoing and could indicate a simple way to safely manage these zzso
