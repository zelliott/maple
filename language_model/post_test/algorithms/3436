This work analyzes use of the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso technique for characterization of normal and zzso tissue in the oral zzso of zzso with potential to diagnose zzso tissue in zzso 

zzso zzso was applied to the right cheek of 31 zzso weighing 150 zzso zzso three times per week during 12 zzso One animal was kept as a control (without application of the zzso At the end of this period, the animals were submitted to zzso zzso excited by an zzso laser zzso connected to an optical fiber zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by a zzso and a zzso camera with zzso zzso covering the spectral range of zzso to zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso were collected in the induced region and normal counter side cheek of all the animals and also in the control zzso After zzso biopsy was carried out for zzso zzso Two diagnosis zzso one based on the ratio of spectral regions and another based on Principal zzso Analysis zzso were zzso 

zzso analysis had demonstrated existence of an intense peak in the region of zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso when compared to the normal zzso The zzso based on the ratio of two spectral regions had zzso of sensitivity and zzso The zzso based on the zzso had zzso and zzso of specificity and sensitivity, zzso 

This work indicates that tissue zzso may be used as a zzso technique for diagnosis of the zzso oral zzso
