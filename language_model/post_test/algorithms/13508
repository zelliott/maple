zzso skillfully manipulate objects and tools despite the inherent zzso In order to succeed at these tasks, the zzso control system must build an internal representation of both the force and mechanical zzso As it is not practical to either learn or store motor commands for every possible future action, the zzso control system zzso a control strategy for a range of movements based on learning performed over a set of zzso Here, we introduce a zzso model for this learning and zzso which specifies how to learn zzso muscle activity in a function of the state zzso Specifically, by incorporating zzso as a function of error into the feedback command, we are able to derive an zzso from a zzso descent zzso of motion error and effort, subject to maintaining a stability zzso This zzso can be used to learn to coordinate any of a variety of motor zzso such as force fields, muscle synergies, physical models or artificial neural zzso This model for human learning and zzso is able to adapt to both stable and unstable zzso and provides a controller for generating efficient zzso motor behavior in zzso zzso results exhibit predictions consistent with all experiments on learning of novel dynamics requiring adaptation of force and zzso and enable us to re-examine some of the previous interpretations of experiments on zzso
