zzso group O zzso is characterized by a high genetic divergence from zzso group M zzso Little is known about the therapeutic impact of this zzso The aim of this study was to assess in a large series of samples zzso the zzso impact of natural zzso of the zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the zzso value of resistance interpretation zzso developed for zzso group M when used for highly zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and 9 highly zzso zzso patients were zzso The viruses were zzso and zzso zzso were identified using 3 different zzso zzso zzso de zzso sur le zzso et les zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All zzso samples naturally exhibited the zzso and zzso resistance zzso in the reverse zzso zzso zzso of samples presented the zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso reverse zzso zzso Twelve minor resistance zzso present in more than zzso of the zzso zzso led to the different zzso giving zzso results for zzso and zzso zzso A marked zzso response was observed in 8 of the 9 zzso patients, despite the prediction of limited activity of the combination for 5 to 8 patients according to the zzso zzso 

The high level of natural zzso in zzso zzso and the important discrepancies between zzso resistance interpretation and the zzso response, emphasize the need for resistance zzso rules better adapted to zzso
