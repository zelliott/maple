zzso and early diagnosis of various diseases and pathological conditions require analysis techniques that can capture zzso zzso zzso In the pursuit of promising TV signal processing methods zzso to real-time clinical monitoring applications, zzso spectral techniques are of great zzso 

We present two potential practical applications of such techniques in zzso TV zzso dynamics concealed in zzso zzso zzso early detection of zzso loss using a zzso approach known as variable frequency complex zzso zzso and accurate detection of abrupt changes in respiratory rates using a zzso approach known as combined optimal zzso search and multiple mode particle filtering zzso 

The zzso technique has been tested using zzso signals in two study models: mechanically zzso patients undergoing surgery in operating room settings and spontaneously breathing conscious healthy subjects subjected to lower body negative pressure zzso in laboratory zzso zzso of respiratory rates has been tested using zzso technique in zzso signals collected from healthy volunteers with abrupt changes in respiratory rate ranging from zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso method showed promise to detect the blood loss zzso in mechanical zzso patients well before blood losses become apparent to the zzso In spontaneously breathing subjects during zzso experiments, the early detection and zzso of blood loss was possible at zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed high accuracy in detecting the constant as well as sudden changes in respiratory rates as compared to other zzso zzso 

zzso of such robust zzso into pulse zzso device may have significant impact in real-time clinical monitoring and zzso zzso zzso
