zzso potential energy surfaces obtained from explicitly correlated zzso calculations and further corrections for zzso correlation contributions, zzso zzso effects and zzso energy contributions were generated in a fully automated fashion for the zzso benchmark systems zzso and zzso The black-box generation of the zzso is based on normal zzso which were used in the underlying zzso expansions of the zzso and the zzso within the Watson zzso zzso coordinates are not the optimal choice for describing zzso zzso and the question remains if they can be used for accurate calculations at zzso However, their unique definition is an appealing feature, which removes remaining errors in truncated potential expansions arising from different choices of zzso coordinate zzso zzso automated calculations are zzso which zzso that the proposed scheme allows for the determination of energy levels and zzso zzso as a routine zzso
