The research on component vulnerability testing is zzso In this paper, an approach of vulnerability testing is proposed based on condition zzso and zzso zzso in order to effectively detect the explicit vulnerabilities of third-party zzso To start with, the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso is presented to generate zzso set of the zzso and test cases are generated based on these zzso Then, the Single zzso zzso zzso zzso procedure is addressed to generate zzso values based on zzso operators of zzso zzso These values are then taken as the input of the Test Case Generation Algorithm based on the zzso zzso zzso which is addressed to generate test case set violating the zzso zzso The explicit vulnerabilities can be detected by the vulnerability detecting zzso based on the test cases of condition and zzso zzso The experiments show that our approach can detect explicit vulnerability faults of third-party zzso Furthermore, the proposed approach can detect more vulnerability faults than other related approaches such as condition coverage methods, fuzzy testing method and boundary value zzso
