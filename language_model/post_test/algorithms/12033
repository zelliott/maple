Historically, linkage mapping populations have consisted of large, randomly selected samples of progeny from a given pedigree or cell lines from a panel of radiation zzso We demonstrate that, to construct a map with high zzso marker density, it is neither necessary nor desirable to zzso all markers in every individual of a large mapping zzso Instead, a reduced sample of individuals bearing complementary zzso or zzso zzso may be selected for zzso subsequent markers from a large, but sparsely zzso mapping zzso Choosing such a sample can be reduced to a discrete zzso zzso problem for which the goal is a sample with zzso spaced evenly throughout the zzso We have developed several different methods for selecting such samples and have evaluated their performance on simulated and actual mapping zzso including the Lister and Dean zzso zzso zzso zzso population and the zzso 4 human radiation hybrid zzso Our methods quickly and consistently find zzso samples with map resolution approaching that of the larger populations from which they are zzso This approach, which we have termed selective zzso can facilitate the production of zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso
