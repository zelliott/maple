This study was performed with the objective to examine the diagnostic framework for urinary tract infection zzso in pregnancy and physician response to the clinical diagnosis and to correlate responses to the results of urine culture and zzso Over a zzso period, 81 consecutive patients attending the labor ward admission of a district general hospital with the diagnosis of zzso during pregnancy were zzso zzso information on symptom complex, result of zzso zzso and culture and sensitivity were zzso Data were analyzed using descriptive zzso Of the 78 patients zzso zzso had increased urinary frequency, zzso had zzso pains and zzso had zzso All the patients had zzso with zzso 41 zzso were positive for zzso and 64 zzso were positive for zzso zzso All 78 patients had urine culture and sensitivity, 21 zzso of who were positive, and zzso were the most commonly isolated zzso The sensitivity for zzso was zzso specificity zzso and positive zzso value zzso The corresponding figures for zzso zzso were sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and positive zzso value zzso zzso zzso patients had treatment started on the basis of the clinical diagnosis, mostly with zzso acid or zzso zzso A high resistance rate to these zzso chosen antibiotics was seen in the sensitivity pattern of isolated zzso Current clinical diagnostic zzso for the diagnosis of zzso when applied in the context of pregnancy have low specificity and positive zzso values; yet, empirical antibiotics are frequently employed on this zzso These are often not in keeping with the sensitivity pattern of isolated zzso There is need for a continuing research for more specific bedside zzso
