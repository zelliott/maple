zzso zzso imaging has been developed for different purposes, but recently, the zzso has gained interest with applications to small animal zzso As a technique it is sensitive to zzso optical contrast present in zzso and, contrary to diffuse optical imaging, it promises to bring high resolution imaging for in zzso studies at zzso depths zzso zzso Because of the limited amount of radiation zzso can be exposed to, existing reconstruction zzso for circular zzso require a great number of zzso and zzso zzso long acquisition zzso zzso PA imaging is therefore possible only at the cost of complex and expensive zzso This paper suggests a new reconstruction strategy using the compressed sensing zzso which states that a small number of linear projections of a zzso image contain enough information for zzso By directly sampling the image to recover in a sparse zzso it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of zzso needed for a given quality of zzso
