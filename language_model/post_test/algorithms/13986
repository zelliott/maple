This research is concentrated on the diagnosis of zzso heart valve zzso through the analysis of zzso zzso zzso power spectral density graphic with the help of zzso zzso zzso ANN trained with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was implemented in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso whereas 4 false zzso have been observed for the test group of 68 subjects in zzso The designed zzso structure has about zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and positive prediction is calculated to be zzso The stated results show that the proposed method can make an effective zzso
