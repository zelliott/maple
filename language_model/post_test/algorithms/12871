We develop a novel zzso bound for learning the kernel zzso First, we show that the zzso analysis of the kernel learning problem reduces to investigation of the zzso of the zzso chaos process of order 2 over candidate zzso which we refer to as zzso chaos zzso Next, we show how to estimate the empirical zzso chaos complexity by well-established metric zzso zzso and zzso of the set of candidate zzso Our new methodology mainly depends on the principal theory of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we establish satisfactory excess zzso bounds and zzso error rates for learning zzso kernels and general zzso basis zzso
