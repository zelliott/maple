In previous works, we have shown that zzso zzso transient zzso is a promising technique for characterizing the elasticity of soft zzso It involves the measurement of the zzso induced by the propagation of low frequency zzso zzso zzso waves in biological zzso In this paper, we present a novel apparatus that contains a zzso vibrating device surrounding a linear array of 128 zzso zzso that performs zzso zzso imaging (up to 10,000 zzso and that is able to follow in real time the propagation of a zzso zzso wave in the human zzso The vibrating device is made of two zzso fixed to electromagnetic zzso that produce in the zzso image area a large zzso zzso zzso The geometry has been chosen both to enhance the sensitivity and to create a zzso linear zzso wave front in the imaging zzso An inversion zzso is used to recover the zzso zzso map from the zzso data, and the first experimental results obtained from zzso materials are zzso
