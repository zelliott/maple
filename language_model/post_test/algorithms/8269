Resistance to targeted cancer therapies such as zzso is a frequent clinical problem not solely because of insufficient expression of zzso zzso but also because of the overriding zzso states of cell signaling zzso Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in zzso testing of factors, which may zzso resistance to targeted zzso zzso study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor therapies and directly test predictions in zzso and in clinical zzso The new mathematical model included zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the regulatory properties of zzso The model was zzso using quantitative zzso expression data from cancer cell lines using zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein expression was found to be the key zzso of resistance to zzso therapy in zzso which was zzso of unseen experiments in zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso When measured in cancer cell lines, zzso expression predicts sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso this quantitative measurement is more zzso of response zzso risk, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso than other zzso components taken in isolation and when tested by zzso analysis in a cohort of 122 breast zzso treated with zzso For the first time, a systems biology approach has successfully been used to zzso patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is further compelling evidence that zzso appropriately measured in the clinical setting, zzso clinical decision making in patients treated with zzso zzso
