The local material zzso of zzso is a well-known indicator of pathology, with locally stiffer tissue related to the possible presence of an abnormal growth in otherwise zzso zzso zzso is a zzso technique for measuring displacement zzso in loaded zzso within a medical imaging zzso From these measured displacement fields, estimated for local strain have been made using well-studied techniques, but the calculation of elastic zzso has been zzso In this study we show a method for zzso local tissue elastic zzso that gives zzso stable and robust results in test cases, and that is zzso zzso The method assumes the tissue is zzso and it requires an independent estimate of tissue zzso ratio, but the method reaches a stable result when the estimated zzso ratio is in error, and the resulting estimates are not very sensitive to the assumed zzso
