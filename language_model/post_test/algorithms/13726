Computer modeling was used to measure the fractional volumes available to zzso zzso objects in a random, zzso network of zzso The data fit the zzso equation exactly when the object was a sphere zzso ratio zzso zzso When the zzso ratio was increased from 1 to 9, the zzso equation was still zzso if the fiber concentration is multiplied by a factor, A, which increases zzso in proportion to the zzso zzso The factor A allows one to adjust the zzso zzso derived from gel zzso zzso for zzso objects to that of zzso zzso with zzso ratios from 1 to zzso zzso the same adjustment of zzso is possible for objects of other zzso
