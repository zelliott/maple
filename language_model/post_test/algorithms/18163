This paper presents a new approach for the mesh composition on models with arbitrary boundary zzso After cutting the needed parts from existing mesh models and putting them into the right pose, an implicit surface is adopted to smoothly zzso the boundaries of models under zzso An interface is developed to control the shape of the implicit transient surface by using sketches to specify the expected zzso After that, a localized Marching zzso zzso is investigated to zzso the implicit transient surface so that the mesh surface of composed model is zzso Different from existing approaches in which the models under composition are required to have zzso merging zzso the framework developed based on our techniques have the new function to fuse models with arbitrary boundary zzso
