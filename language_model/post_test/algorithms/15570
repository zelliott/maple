In the previous paper, boundary conditions matching the probe to the crystal wave function in scanning transmission electron zzso were applied by matching the whole wave function across the zzso It is shown here how that approach relates to previous Bloch wave zzso using zzso plane wave boundary conditions for wave zzso implied by the range of zzso momentum components in the incident zzso zzso the whole wave function across the boundary, and including a suitably fine mesh in the zzso space associated with the crystal to allow matching of zzso momentum components within the probe, leads to a structure zzso A containing many elements which would normally be excluded for plane wave zzso For perfect zzso the zzso may be block zzso This leads to a considerable increase in the zzso efficiency of the model and yields important insights into the physics of zzso zzso in perfect zzso in coherent imaging and the small zzso limit for coherent and incoherent contrast are zzso The zzso zzso of the incoherent lattice contrast calculated in this Bloch wave method and the zzso method using mixed dynamic form factors will be zzso zzso between both these methods and the frozen zzso model, a prevalent zzso method for zzso dark field simulation which has the theoretical advantage of handling double zzso will be zzso
