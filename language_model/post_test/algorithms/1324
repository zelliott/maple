A zzso statistical method for identifying clinically normal tissue in digitized zzso is used to construct an zzso for separating normal regions from potentially abnormal zzso that is, small regions that may contain isolated zzso This is the initial phase of the development of a general method for the automatic recognition of normal zzso The first step is to decompose the image with a zzso expansion that yields a sum of independent images, each containing different levels of image zzso When zzso are present, there is strong empirical evidence that only some of the image components are necessary for the purpose of detecting a zzso from zzso The underlying statistic for each of the selected expansion components can be modeled with a simple zzso probability distribution zzso This function serves as an instrument for the development of a statistical test that allows for the recognition of normal tissue zzso The distribution function depends on only one zzso and this zzso itself has an underlying statistical zzso The values of this zzso define a summary statistic that can be used to set detection error zzso Once the summary statistic is determined, spatial filters that are matched to resolution are applied independently to each selected expansion zzso zzso of the image that correlate with the normal statistical model are discarded and regions in disagreement zzso zzso are zzso These results are combined to produce a detection output image consisting only of suspicious zzso This type of detection output is amenable to further processing that may ultimately lead to a fully automated zzso for the identification of normal zzso
