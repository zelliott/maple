In this study, a software tool was developed to zzso the medical data collected from zzso cancer operations by using two data mining zzso The software, run on real-world medical data, is a tool that enables medical decisions to be reached by zzso past records from zzso The zzso algorithm, which is a zzso zzso in data mining, was used to point out the zzso in the data set and to display two dimensions on the zzso The data of three screens that were named as selective zzso different zzso and zzso stages and zzso operations based on zzso T values, were processed using zzso with the zzso zzso and one screen, which named zzso and survival zzso was processed through zzso It helps the future decision-making process by considering false estimates of zzso stages of the cases and by using the information gathered from past cases concerning zzso zzso and the survival percentage for zzso The characteristics of zzso cancer operations data, that involve zzso zzso were exposed by using two data mining techniques in this zzso
