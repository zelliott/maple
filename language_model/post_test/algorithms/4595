The zzso impulse response technique with a zzso coated zzso column was applied to zzso of infinite dilution zzso diffusion zzso D and retention factors k in zzso carbon dioxide by injecting a zzso solution zzso a mixture of three zzso fatty acids such as zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso zzso The zzso were simultaneously estimated by the curve fitting analysis even from partially overlapping response zzso with the resolution of zzso The D and k values for each zzso were able to be so obtained as accurately as those determined by individually injecting a single component zzso Almost no effect of the interaction among the components in the mixture was found from various approaching ways for curve fitting and the consecutive injection of the mixture at a certain zzso
