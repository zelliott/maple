zzso methods have been applied to zzso Mueller zzso zzso scattering data of the zzso zzso zzso Data were measured at the zzso zzso zzso and 1500 zzso using an zzso optimal Mueller zzso zzso applying a zzso tube and a high gain zzso detector for the two zzso A zzso model with physical significance was deduced through analysis of the product zzso zzso It is found that when the data are analyzed as a function of the scattering angle, similar to particle zzso the zzso elements are largely independent of zzso zzso To the first order, we propose that a zzso zzso is appropriate to describe the polarization index, while the zzso diagonal elements of the zzso zzso have a form resembling zzso single zzso New models are proposed for the off diagonal elements of the measured Mueller zzso
