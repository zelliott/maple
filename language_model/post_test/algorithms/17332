A cancer diagnostic algorithm, zzso zzso zzso using double zzso zzso was employed for distinguishing between zzso and normal oral zzso For zzso zzso at the shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso and 300 zzso the ratio between the area under zzso zzso and the area under zzso zzso was zzso In the same way, for zzso zzso at the longer zzso zzso zzso zzso and 340 zzso the ratio between the area under zzso zzso and the area under zzso zzso was zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were used to evaluate the performance of zzso using single and the double (by combining shorter and zzso zzso zzso The results showed that better performance, up to sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and positive zzso value zzso could be achieved by using the double zzso zzso The present study can be useful as a basis for further investigation on in zzso zzso measurement and analysis using double zzso zzso
