We present a new approach that allows the identification of zzso peptides from mass zzso data in zzso zzso Our zzso uses small regions of zzso sequence information which are automatically deduced from de zzso zzso acid sequence predictions together with the molecular mass information of the precursor zzso The sequence predictions are based on selected zzso mass zzso fragmentation zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence are aligned with each of the six frames of the translated zzso and the precursor mass information is used to assemble the corresponding zzso peptides using the sequence as a zzso zzso zzso peptides can be gathered and in turn verified by mass zzso data interpretation tools such as zzso
