Although the zzso zzso signal from optical zzso zzso zzso used in medical applications is essentially zzso to dose rate, the zzso used so far are imperfect in the sense that their zzso sensitivity changes with accumulated zzso A zzso zzso has been developed that zzso for these sensitivity zzso We further report on a new system that effectively separates the zzso signal generated in the crystal from zzso and zzso zzso generated in the optical zzso cable using a gating technique in connection with zzso linear accelerator radiation zzso The zzso system has been used for dose zzso in a phantom during an zzso radiation therapy zzso treatment with 6 zzso zzso The zzso measurement results are in excellent agreement zzso within zzso with both the zzso results and the dose delivered according to the treatment planning zzso zzso signals from zzso can be used for real-time dose rate zzso with a time resolution of approximately zzso s and a spatial resolution only limited by the size of the detector zzso zzso
