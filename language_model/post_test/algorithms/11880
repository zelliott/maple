In this paper a new zzso is presented for the zzso and display of blood vessels from images obtained with magnetic resonance zzso zzso and other three-dimensional zzso zzso imaging zzso The zzso developed is based on the observation that vessels are strongly evident in the maximum intensity projection zzso zzso as regions of high continuity and low local zzso zzso is measured here by the minimum zzso value of a zzso local zzso fit in the principal directions through each point in the zzso zzso Although some background zzso in the zzso exhibit low local zzso the size of the connected region is nearly always much smaller than even the very smallest vessels that appear in the zzso zzso It is shown that by applying connectivity to the regions of low zzso there is nearly complete separation between vascular detail and zzso When connectivity is further applied in the original zzso image, vascular bed zzso becomes nearly zzso The zzso consists of three basic steps: a) determination of the minimum local zzso at each point in the zzso zzso b) connection of all neighboring points of low local zzso and c) connection of all points in the original zzso image zzso that are connected to the points determined in the zzso zzso and that are above an intensity zzso The zzso as presented is not zzso but demonstrates a very strong potential for improved portrayal of vascular zzso
