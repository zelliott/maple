The object of this study was to work at accurate axis registration and zzso methods for zzso reconstruction of rotary scanning zzso medical zzso At first, zzso zzso of the zzso axes were analyzed according to their characteristic points and the zzso direction registration was zzso Similar zzso was used to find registration zzso line near the axes of two zzso zzso function and zzso spectrum were used to evaluate the effects of axes zzso Second, an zzso method was studied for the special space distribution of rotary scanning zzso zzso of experiments indicate that the axes registration and zzso methods were suitable to rotary scanning medical zzso The quality of reconstruction can be greatly improved by zzso zzso zzso
