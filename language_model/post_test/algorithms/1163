We propose a scheme to zzso gene networks on a zzso scale using a relatively small amount of gene expression data from zzso zzso Our method is based on the empirical observation that such networks are typically large and zzso It uses singular value decomposition to construct a family of candidate solutions and then uses robust zzso to identify the solution with the smallest number of connections as the most likely zzso Our zzso has zzso N) sampling complexity and zzso zzso zzso We test and validate our approach in a series of in zzso experiments on model gene zzso
