The need for movement zzso zzso to assess motor learning and recovery has resulted in various measures that look at different aspects of a movement's zzso This paper first shows that most of the previously published zzso measures lack zzso consistency, sensitivity, or zzso It then introduces and evaluates the spectral zzso metric that uses a movement speed zzso zzso magnitude spectrum to zzso movement zzso This new metric is systematically tested and compared to other zzso zzso using experimental data from stroke and healthy subjects as well as simulated movement zzso The results indicate that the spectral zzso metric is a valid and consistent measure of movement zzso which is both sensitive to modifications in motor behavior and robust to measurement zzso We hope that the systematic analysis of this paper is a step toward the zzso of the quantitative assessment of movement zzso
