The zzso and zzso synaptic models are among the oldest and most useful in the field of neural zzso In this paper we show how to approximate the behavior of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso electronic systems using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are especially attractive for this application since such devices are zzso can be densely packed in zzso structures and possess the long time constants, or memory, needed by the synaptic zzso
