There is a need in critical care units for continuous zzso monitoring zzso zzso gated electrical zzso zzso is able to zzso the zzso variations occurring during the cardiac zzso This method is a safe, inexpensive and potentially fast technique for cardiac output imaging but the spatial resolution is presently low, particularly for central locations such as the zzso Many parameters including noise deteriorate the reconstruction zzso One of the main obstacles in cardiac imaging at the heart location is the high zzso of lungs and muscles on the zzso and zzso side of zzso In this study we are investigating improvements of the measurement and initial zzso zzso of the internal zzso by zzso an internal zzso inside the zzso We consider 16 zzso connected around a zzso zzso With the random noise level set near zzso of the signal we evaluated the zzso consensus reconstruction zzso for electrical zzso zzso The zzso and simulation results showed that the quality of the target in reconstructed images was improved by up to 5 times for zzso response, position error, resolution, shape deformation and ringing effects with zzso located in cardiac related positions when using an internal zzso
