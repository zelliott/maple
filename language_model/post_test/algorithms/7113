Fluorescent zzso DNA zzso molecules labeled at both ends are commonly produced by zzso of complementary zzso DNA zzso zzso labeled with fluorescent zzso at the same zzso or zzso zzso Because the labeling efficiency of zzso is smaller than zzso the resulting zzso have two, one or are without a zzso zzso methods are insufficient to measure the percentage of the zzso zzso component in the fluorescent DNA sample and it is even difficult to distinguish the zzso DNA component from the zzso zzso zzso measurement of the percentage of such doubly labeled zzso component is a critical prerequisite for quantitative zzso zzso which has puzzled scientists for zzso We established a zzso correlation zzso zzso system to measure the percentage of doubly labeled zzso zzso in the total fluorescent zzso zzso The method is based on comparative analysis of the given sample and a reference zzso sample prepared by adding certain amount of zzso zzso into the original zzso zzso From zzso zzso functions, we obtain the number of fluorescent zzso molecules in the focal volume of the zzso microscope and zzso We also calculate the labeling efficiency of zzso The method requires minimal amount of zzso The samples have the concentration of DNA in the zzso range and the volume of tens of zzso We verify our method by using restriction zzso zzso III to cleave the fluorescent zzso The zzso of the reaction depends strongly on zzso a critical zzso for quantitative zzso zzso
