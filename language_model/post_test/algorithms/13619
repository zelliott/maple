The description of cortical folding pattern zzso is challenging because of geometric complexity and zzso zzso On a cortical surface mesh, zzso zzso provides a good zzso proxy of zzso The zzso of this function can be studied using a zzso analysis to produce a power spectrum representative of the spatial frequency composition of zzso First, we introduce an original method for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which performs a spectral decomposition of the mean zzso of the zzso interface mesh based on the zzso operator zzso zzso produces an ordered 7 bands power spectrum of zzso zzso and provides an zzso relevant zzso of zzso based on local spectral zzso A spatial frequency being associated with each zzso the bandwidth design assumes frequency doubling between consecutive spectral zzso Next, we observed that the last 3 spectral bands zzso 5 and 6) accounted for zzso of the analyzed spectral power and were associated with zzso variations of zzso whereas the lower frequency bands were related to global brain zzso The spectral zzso of zzso revealed 1st, 2nd and 3rd order elements associated with zzso B5 and B6 zzso These elements could be related to zzso primary, secondary and zzso zzso Finally, we used zzso zzso of frequency bands power and zzso to analyze the relationship between the spectral composition of zzso and brain size in a large adult zzso Total folding power followed a positive zzso zzso which did not divide up zzso between the zzso B4 contribution was constant, B5 increased like total folding power and B6 much zzso Besides, apparition of new elements of pattern with increasing size only concerned the 3rd zzso zzso we demonstrate that large brains are zzso than smaller ones because of an increased number of high spatial frequency zzso ramifications and zzso that accommodate the zzso increase of cortical zzso
