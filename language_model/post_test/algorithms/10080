The efficiency of zzso reactions depends on 1), the penetration depth of the zzso into the membrane and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso which are susceptible to zzso oxygen zzso experience less damage when separated from the zzso by the zzso Since zzso lifetime in the membrane environment is orders of magnitude longer than the time required for zzso oxygen zzso to cross the zzso this observation suggests that differences between the zzso or membrane partition of zzso and zzso zzso We investigated this hypothesis by releasing zzso at one side of a zzso membrane while monitoring the zzso of target damage at the opposite side of the same zzso zzso to the target, represented by zzso molecules zzso or zzso was indicated by changes in the zzso zzso potential difference zzso A simple zzso model allowed zzso of the zzso zzso concentration difference from the rate at which zzso zzso It confirmed that the lower limit of zzso zzso is approximately 2 zzso zzso it roughly matches zzso zzso as predicted by zzso zzso zzso the membrane cannot act as a barrier to zzso zzso zzso in the reaction rates at the zzso and zzso membrane leaflets may be attributed only to zzso zzso inside the zzso
