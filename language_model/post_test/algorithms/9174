zzso identification by tandem mass zzso is the dominant zzso zzso for protein characterization in complex zzso Traditional search engines, which match zzso sequences with tandem mass zzso to identify the zzso zzso use protein sequence databases to suggest zzso candidates for zzso Although the acquisition of tandem mass zzso is not biased toward zzso protein zzso this zzso strategy is failing to identify peptides from alternative zzso and coding zzso protein zzso despite the acquisition of zzso tandem mass zzso We zzso instead, that expressed sequence tags zzso be zzso zzso such a strategy would be zzso zzso due to the size of zzso sequence zzso however, we show that a sophisticated sequence database zzso strategy, applied to human zzso reduces the sequence database size approximately zzso Once zzso our zzso sequence database is comparable in size to other commonly used protein sequence databases, making routine zzso searching zzso We demonstrate that our zzso sequence database enables the discovery of novel peptides in a variety of public data zzso
