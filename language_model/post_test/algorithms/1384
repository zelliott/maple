The reduction of quantitative diagnostic test scores to the zzso case is a wasteful and unnecessary zzso in the era of high-speed zzso Physicians could make better use of the information embedded in quantitative test results if modern generalized curve zzso techniques were applied to the likelihood functions of zzso zzso Hand calculations could be completely avoided and zzso zzso zzso provided zzso zzso showing zzso probability of disease as a function of zzso probability with confidence intervals zzso zzso would enhance acceptance of these techniques if they were immediately available at the computer terminal when test results were zzso Such zzso would also provide immediate feedback to physicians when a zzso test had been zzso
