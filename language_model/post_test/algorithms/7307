We present a comparison for high-resolution imaging with a laboratory source between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison is done through simulations and experiments using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso doses required for detection in projection images are simulated as a function of the diameter of a zzso zzso Using zzso radiation, simulations show a lower dose requirement for zzso for small object features and a lower dose for zzso for larger object zzso Using zzso radiation, such as that from a laboratory zzso source, experiments and simulations show a lower dose requirement for zzso for a large range of feature zzso Tested on a biological sample, zzso shows higher noise levels than zzso but its advantage of quantitative zzso index reconstruction for zzso samples becomes zzso
