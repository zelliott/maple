In this paper, a zzso multiple kernel learning zzso method is proposed for object recognition to accommodate the zzso diversity and the zzso zzso By introducing the zzso between the object category and individual images as an intermediate zzso zzso attempts to learn zzso zzso combinations together with the associated zzso For each object category, the image corpus from the same category is zzso into zzso Images with similar appearance are zzso into the same group, which zzso to the zzso of the object zzso zzso zzso diversity can be represented by the set of groups from the same category but with diverse zzso zzso correlation can be represented by the correlation between groups from different zzso zzso provides a zzso solution to adapt zzso combination to local data distribution and to seek a zzso between capturing the diversity and keeping the zzso for each object zzso Different from the simple hybrid grouping strategy that zzso sample grouping and zzso training zzso two sample grouping strategies are proposed to integrate sample grouping and zzso zzso The first one is a looping hybrid grouping method, where a global kernel zzso method and zzso interact with each other by sharing zzso zzso zzso The second one is a dynamic divisive grouping method, where a zzso zzso grouping process interacts with zzso Experimental results show that performance of zzso does not significantly vary with different grouping strategies, but the looping hybrid grouping method produces slightly better zzso On four challenging data sets, our proposed method has achieved encouraging performance comparable to the state-of-the-art and outperformed several existing zzso zzso
