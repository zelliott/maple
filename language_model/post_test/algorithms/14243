The measurement of regional lung ventilation by electrical zzso zzso zzso has been evaluated in many experimental zzso However, zzso is not routinely used in a clinical setting, which is attributable to the fact that a convenient concept for how to zzso the zzso data is zzso The definition of region of interest zzso is an essential point in the data zzso To date, there are only limited data available on the different approaches to zzso definition to evaluate regional lung ventilation by zzso For this survey we examined ten patients zzso age zzso zzso 60 zzso 10 zzso under controlled zzso Regional tidal volumes were zzso as zzso values of zzso zzso differences and four types of zzso were subsequently zzso The definition of zzso contours was based on the calculation of the zzso values of zzso standard zzso from each zzso set of zzso data and zzso the zzso zzso from linear zzso equations between the individual local zzso and average zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, arbitrary zzso (four zzso and four zzso segments of equal zzso were zzso Our results indicate that both approaches to zzso definition using statistical parameters are suitable when zzso signals with high sensitivity to zzso phenomena are to be zzso The definition of the zzso zzso as zzso of the maximum standard zzso or zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso are less convenient because of the low zzso signal component in the zzso zzso
