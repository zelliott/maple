zzso component models form a powerful and flexible tool for zzso linkage analysis of quantitative zzso Estimates of genetic similarity are needed for the zzso component model to detect linkage and to locate zzso and two methods are commonly used to calculate zzso zzso zzso estimates for zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used multiple zzso to estimate the zzso sharing along a zzso while the approach of zzso and Lander zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on a hidden zzso zzso In this paper, we modify the zzso component model to accommodate zzso and we extend both zzso zzso zzso methods to accommodate zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate the power and precision of the zzso component model to detect zzso located on the zzso The two zzso zzso zzso methods have the same accuracy to identify zzso position, but the hidden zzso model yields a larger average maximum zzso score to detect linkage than the zzso zzso The extension of the zzso zzso zzso methods and the zzso component model to the X zzso shows that the zzso component model is a powerful and flexible tool for linkage analysis of quantitative traits on both zzso and zzso
