Decoding visual information from a population of retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This work investigates how a zzso visual stimulus is zzso by the collective activity of many retinal zzso zzso Multiple zzso cell spike trains were recorded simultaneously from the isolated zzso of the tiger zzso using a zzso zzso The stimulus consisted of zzso zzso uniform, temporally broadband zzso From the recorded spike trains, an estimate was obtained of the stimulus intensity as a function of zzso This was compared with the actual stimulus to assess the quality and quantity of visual information conveyed by the zzso cell zzso Two zzso were used to decode the spike zzso an zzso linear filter in which each action potential made an additive contribution to the stimulus estimate and an artificial neural network trained by zzso to match spike trains with zzso The two methods performed zzso suggesting that most of the information about this stimulus can be extracted by linear operations on the spike zzso Individual zzso cells conveyed information at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an average information content per spike of zzso zzso The zzso possible rate of information transmission compatible with the measured zzso statistics was zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, zzso cells used zzso of this capacity to zzso visual zzso When a decoder received two spike trains of the same response type, the reconstruction improved only marginally over that obtained from a single zzso However, a decoder using an ON and an OFF cell extracted as much information as the sum of that obtained from each cell zzso cells of opposite response type zzso different and zzso features of the zzso As more spike trains were provided to the zzso the total information rate rapidly zzso with zzso of the zzso value obtained from a local cluster of just four zzso of different functional zzso The decoding filter applied to a given zzso spikes within such a zzso decoder differed substantially from the filter applied to that same zzso in a zzso zzso This shows that the optimal interpretation of a zzso cell's action potential depends strongly on the simultaneous activity of other nearby zzso The quality of the stimulus reconstruction varied greatly with zzso flicker components below 1 zzso and above 10 zzso were reconstructed poorly, and the performance was optimal near zzso zzso Further analysis suggests that zzso zzso by zzso cell spike trains is limited by slow zzso in the cone zzso and a zzso noise source zzso to the zzso
