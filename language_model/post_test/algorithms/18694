The application of zzso force fields (and explicit or implicit zzso zzso to protein zzso tasks such as zzso and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged zzso energy zzso Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new zzso with an emphasis on zzso and zzso zzso As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing zzso in native zzso we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal zzso In brief, large numbers of zzso are generated by using a zzso zzso buildup procedure followed by zzso cycles of zzso zzso zzso and complete energy zzso of selected loop zzso We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of zzso zzso ranging from 4 to 12 zzso in zzso zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso to the native structures zzso the body of the zzso not the loop zzso are zzso A for 5 zzso zzso zzso A for 8 zzso zzso and zzso A for 11 zzso zzso Median zzso are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of zzso the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of zzso states of zzso zzso omission of zzso from the zzso and, in a few cases, probable errors in the zzso determined zzso When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average zzso to the native structures improve to zzso A for 5 zzso zzso zzso A for 8 zzso zzso and zzso A for 11 zzso zzso In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy zzso that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction zzso The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate zzso energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and zzso zzso and, especially for the longer zzso the zzso refinement zzso
