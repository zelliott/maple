zzso zzso is a known surrogate zzso that is useful for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso its low sensitivity for detection prohibits imaging to be zzso Using chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso can be indirectly detected in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso We showed that the zzso signal changed with zzso zzso and was reduced by suppressing cerebral metabolism with increased general zzso The signal changes were not affected by cerebral or plasma zzso and were not correlated with altered cerebral blood flow as demonstrated by zzso neither were they related to the zzso zzso amounts as compared with injection of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed similar changes in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso signal reflected the rate of zzso zzso This method provides a new way to use widely available zzso techniques to image zzso zzso and metabolism in zzso without the need for zzso labeling of the zzso
