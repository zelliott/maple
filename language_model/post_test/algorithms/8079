The paper addresses problem of pulmonary airways investigation based on high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso chest zzso Especially it presents new, fully automated zzso for airway tree zzso The zzso uses two passes of zzso seeded region zzso First pass is applied for obtaining the initial zzso airway zzso The second pass aims at refining the tree based on the zzso zzso zzso of applying proposed zzso to scans of several randomly selected patients are introduced and zzso Moreover, comparison with results obtained by simple region growing with manual threshold selection is zzso zzso results justify the method and prove that it detects up to 10 generations of zzso and diminishes leakages into the lung zzso which are common when simple region growing is used for zzso airway zzso
