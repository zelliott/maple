We consider the problem of tracking rapid changes in the viscous and elastic properties of the respiratory system by using mouth flow and zzso pressure data measured during mechanical zzso A zzso zzso zzso with adjustable zzso is used for online zzso of an zzso model of the breathing zzso zzso simulation experiments are presented to provide guidelines to select suitable values for the key zzso which controls the compromise between tracking ability and noise zzso The results obtained confirm the critical role of the optimum tuning in relation to the noise zzso Experimental results obtained from data measured on zzso dogs, in which respiratory distress syndrome was zzso induced by zzso acid, demonstrate that the tuned zzso is able to track appropriately both the viscous and elastic properties of lung zzso zzso estimates are consistent with those obtained by standard and robust zzso zzso and their time course is in qualitative agreement with known zzso zzso
