Many patients with low-risk prostate cancer zzso who are diagnosed with zzso score 6 at biopsy are ultimately found to harbor higher grade PC zzso at radical zzso This finding increases risk of recurrence and zzso zzso zzso clinical tools that are available preoperatively are needed to improve the ability to recognize likelihood of upgrading in patients with low-risk zzso 

More than 30 zzso parameters were assessed in consecutive patients with zzso 6 PC upon biopsy who underwent radical zzso A zzso for predicting upgrading zzso on final pathology was generated using multivariable zzso zzso in a development cohort of 431 zzso External validation was performed in 2 separate zzso consisting of zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, zzso and decision zzso 

On multivariable analysis, variables predicting upgrading were zzso zzso density using ultrasound zzso ratio zzso zzso obesity zzso zzso number of positive zzso zzso zzso and maximum core involvement zzso zzso On internal zzso the zzso zzso accuracy was zzso External validation revealed a zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso The zzso demonstrated excellent zzso in all 3 zzso and decision zzso demonstrated high net benefit across a wide range of threshold zzso The zzso demonstrated areas under the curve of zzso to zzso for predicting upgrading in zzso of men with very low-risk PC who meet active surveillance criteria (all zzso allowing further risk zzso of these zzso 

A zzso was developed and zzso validated that uses zzso clinical parameters and biopsy findings to predict the risk of pathological upgrading in zzso 6 zzso This can be used to further inform patients with lower risk PC who are considering treatment or active zzso
