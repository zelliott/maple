The aim of this study was to compare the acute changes in zzso zzso ratio after administration of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Neonatal (Glaxo zzso zzso in zzso with respiratory distress zzso zzso premature infants weighing zzso + zzso g with respiratory distress syndrome were zzso and randomly assigned to receive two doses of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso The assigned zzso was prepared and administered in accordance with the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio was measured before each dose and 2 and 6 h zzso The percentage change of the ratio from the first measurement has been zzso There was no significant difference between the two groups as regard to birth weight, zzso age, zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio before administration of the zzso However, the age at zzso of treatment was significantly lower in zzso zzso The mean of changes in zzso zzso ratio was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso on all occasions zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between the initial improvement in the ratio and the age of administration of the first dose of the zzso The initial improvement in zzso zzso ratio after zzso may be explained by either smaller volume of the drug (4 zzso compared to zzso (5 zzso or better spreading properties of the zzso Earlier administration of the second dose of zzso may accelerate the response to the zzso
