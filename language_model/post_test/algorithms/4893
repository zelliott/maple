This paper presents the results of a zzso study that compares simulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso models of the dynamic effects of insulin on blood zzso concentration in zzso In the first approach, we employ the widely accepted zzso zzso and an zzso form of it, which incorporates the effect of insulin zzso by the zzso in order to represent the actual zzso operating conditions of the system, and in the second modeling approach, we employ the general class of zzso models that are estimated from zzso zzso We demonstrate both the zzso between the two approaches zzso and the feasibility of obtaining accurate zzso models from zzso data generated from the zzso zzso The results corroborate the proposition that it may be preferable to obtain zzso zzso zzso models in a more general and realistic operating context, without resorting to the restrictive prior assumptions and zzso regarding model structure and/or experimental protocols zzso zzso tolerance zzso that are necessary for the zzso models proposed zzso These prior assumptions may lead to results that are improperly constrained or biased by zzso (and possibly zzso zzso risk that is avoided when we let the data guide the zzso selection of the appropriate model within the general class of zzso models, as our simulation results zzso
