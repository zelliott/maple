We propose a methodology for the description of the secondary structure of zzso based on assigning a zzso zzso to short zzso sequences according to their arrangement in space at a certain zzso We validated the method on ideal and zzso structures, showing that it can assign secondary structures and that this assignment is robust with respect to random zzso zzso From the values of the index and its pattern along a sequence it is possible to recognize many structural motifs of a zzso and in particular zzso II left-handed zzso often not detected by secondary structure assignment zzso zzso an instantaneous zzso index to the fragments also allows the dynamics to be zzso With this purpose, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in water for selected zzso (110 zzso and zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso showing the capability of the zzso index in identifying the stable secondary structure zzso as well as in following their time evolution and zzso changes during the zzso
