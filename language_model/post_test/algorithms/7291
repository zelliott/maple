To evaluate the clinical application of a dosing zzso by zzso in prediction of zzso maintenance dose in Chinese patients with pulmonary zzso 

During October 2010 and August 2012, 220 zzso or zzso with pulmonary embolism in Beijing zzso Hospital, were enrolled by the inclusion zzso The patients included 86 males and zzso zzso The clinical data and blood samples were zzso The fluorescent zzso zzso method was used to detect the zzso of vitamin K zzso compounds zzso complex zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso According to the random number table, the patients were randomly divided into a study group and a control zzso In the study group, the first 3 doses of zzso were prescribed according to the predicted zzso dose, while in the control group the drug was prescribed according to the dose estimated zzso by zzso zzso was adjusted until it reached a stable dose according to the zzso value, and the zzso lasted for 50 zzso 

AT the end of zzso the percentage of patients who obtained a stable dose in the study group and the control group was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean time to reach a stable dose in the study group and the control group was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso days, and the median time was zzso zzso zzso days and zzso zzso zzso days, the difference between the 2 groups being statistically significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso of side effects of the study group was lower than that of the control group, and the time to the occurrence of side effects in study group was zzso The average predicted dose of the 142 patients who reached a stable dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the average effective dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso the average predicted dose being lower than the actual dose zzso zzso zzso zzso but the difference was not zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso stable dose prediction algorithm, containing genetic factors and zzso factors, can significantly shorten the adjustment time to reach zzso stable dose, and reduce the zzso of side effects, and is clinically zzso
