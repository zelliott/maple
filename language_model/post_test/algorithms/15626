It was found that the resonance frequency of zzso zzso of the fluid inside zzso differs from that of plasma zzso This leads to a broadening of the zzso signal from blood, which depends on the extent of zzso and the shape of zzso The zzso of diffusion of water through the zzso membrane was estimated to be D approximately equal to zzso zzso
