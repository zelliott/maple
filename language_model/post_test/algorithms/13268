The zzso zzso has obvious advantages especially in wider spatial bandwidth over the zzso zzso However, a direct zzso and an unwanted twin image should be separated or eliminated in the zzso zzso for a high quality zzso An approach for suppressing the twin image is proposed by separating the real and twin image regions in the digital zzso Specifically, the initial region of real and twin images is obtained by a blind separation zzso and the zzso mask to suppress the twin image is calculated by zzso zzso from the segmented zzso For the performance zzso the proposed method is compared with the existing approaches including the overlapping block zzso and zzso zzso Experimental results showed that the proposed method has a better performance at the overlapped region of the real and twin zzso Additionally, the proposed method causes less loss of real image than the overlapping block zzso zzso zzso we believe that the proposed scheme can be a useful tool for high quality reconstruction in the zzso zzso
