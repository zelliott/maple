This study was undertaken with the hypothesis that certain common zzso features of zzso zzso are predictably associated with zzso and zzso zzso We selected 43 high-grade zzso zzso diagnosed at Memorial zzso Cancer Center that were studied as part of The Cancer Genome zzso pilot zzso In addition to 12 randomly selected zzso zzso cases, all 31 Memorial zzso Cancer Center cases with zzso or zzso zzso were included zzso zzso were examined to assess tumor architecture, zzso index, zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and involvement of zzso tube zzso Comparing zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso with zzso cases zzso identified statistically significant differences in zzso zzso high-grade zzso zzso had more frequent zzso zzso and Transitional cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher zzso indexes zzso more zzso zzso and either geographic or zzso necrosis zzso zzso cases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tended to show zzso features, but they were relatively deficient in zzso and zzso Two zzso incorporating tumor architecture, zzso and either zzso indexes or zzso separated cases that showed 2 of 3 features zzso zzso from those with 0 of 3 features zzso zzso zzso and zzso A test set zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso and 14 high-grade zzso zzso controls lacking zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to validate the zzso with specific emphasis on the ability to detect cases with zzso zzso zzso Best results were obtained with the zzso that incorporated zzso features, zzso and zzso index zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso These preliminary data indicate potential strong associations between zzso and zzso in high-grade zzso zzso
