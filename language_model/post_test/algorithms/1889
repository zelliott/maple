This paper deals with the complex unit roots representation of zzso DNA sequences and the analysis of zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is shown that even for zzso zzso the distribution of zzso has to fulfill some zzso constraints in such a way that the zzso zzso are zzso distributed, with respect to the zzso zzso
