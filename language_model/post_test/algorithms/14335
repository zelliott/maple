zzso integral membrane and zzso proteins are of key importance in many cellular zzso For most of the zzso predicted proteins in zzso the actual zzso zzso has not been demonstrated zzso So far, their potential zzso has been deduced from zzso that predict zzso zzso and signal zzso However, the zzso and accuracy of these zzso is still zzso The majority of zzso and zzso proteins is zzso on zzso zzso zzso the isolation and characterization of zzso associated with zzso zzso offers an experimental tool for the zzso identification of these zzso Here we describe an efficient method to isolate zzso from zzso zzso and report on the validation of the method to enrich for transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and zzso of the isolation method was investigated by DNA zzso zzso zzso correlations between transcript levels obtained from three replicate zzso showed that the method is highly zzso A significant enrichment for zzso zzso proteins containing predicted zzso zzso and signal peptides was observed in the zzso zzso zzso In this zzso 301 transcripts were classified by gene zzso as zzso component zzso and potentially zzso previously zzso zzso or zzso zzso
