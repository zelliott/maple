zzso methods based on the maximum a zzso principle (also called penalized zzso zzso have been developed to improve image quality in zzso zzso To explore the full potential of zzso reconstruction for zzso zzso we derive simplified theoretical expressions that allow fast evaluation of the zzso of a zzso in zzso zzso This work is zzso on the recent progress on the theoretical analysis of image properties of statistical reconstructions and the development of zzso zzso We explicitly model the zzso variation of the zzso and background without assuming that they are locally zzso The results can be used to choose the optimum prior parameters for the maximum zzso zzso The theoretical results are validated using zzso Carlo zzso The comparisons show good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the zzso Carlo zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso can be reliably estimated using one noisy data zzso
