zzso a zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that is selective for receptors containing the zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso studies examining the disposition of zzso have demonstrated that it is mainly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso that exhibits a genetic zzso 

To assess the zzso absolute oral zzso of zzso in healthy male volunteers zzso as either zzso extensive or poor zzso 

This was an zzso three-way crossover zzso zzso was administered as a single dose orally in solution of 50, 100 and zzso and zzso as a constant rate zzso infusion of 50 and zzso zzso zzso was assigned following zzso zzso zzso 

In poor zzso zzso zzso zzso oral zzso was approximately zzso and was consistent with a liver extraction ratio of approximately zzso zzso clearance of approximately 4 zzso indicating near complete zzso Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state zzso was moderate zzso zzso zzso and the mean elimination zzso zzso was approximately 20 zzso Following oral administration the mean maximum plasma concentration zzso and area under the plasma zzso curve from time zero to zzso zzso increased approximately zzso with zzso In extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso oral zzso was zzso and zzso At the zzso dose, the absolute oral zzso was approximately zzso Overall, the oral zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and its zzso was zzso by large differences in plasma zzso at oral doses without equivalent intravenous zzso Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance was high zzso 27 zzso the zzso was moderate zzso 4 zzso and the zzso was approximately 2-4 zzso Following oral administration the zzso and zzso increased more than zzso with zzso zzso oral clearance decreased with increasing oral zzso However, zzso was approximately the same at all doses zzso 4 zzso 

The zzso of zzso were quite different in the two zzso In extensive zzso the oral zzso was zzso and zzso while in poor zzso oral zzso appeared to be linear and zzso Based on the zzso in extensive and poor zzso the zzso oral zzso in extensive zzso may be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, at a high oral dose, the impact of zzso metabolism on zzso zzso is zzso
