The prerequisite and the rationale for the benefit of cardiac zzso therapy zzso is that it is able to zzso left zzso zzso walls that have a delayed zzso 

In 69 consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso we assessed the magnitude of zzso zzso achieved by means of simultaneous zzso zzso and sequential zzso pacing (with an individually zzso zzso zzso value among zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso tissue zzso imaging techniques and in particular the measurement of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso delay was defined as the difference between the longest and the shortest zzso time in the six zzso segments of the zzso An abnormal zzso delay was defined as a value zzso zzso The zzso delay was 63 zzso 28 zzso zzso decreased to 44 zzso 26 zzso with zzso 0 and to 26 zzso 15 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 determined the shortest delay in 28 zzso patients zzso zzso 12 zzso In 41 zzso patients, a better zzso was achieved with zzso zzso intervals zzso first in 32 and RV first in 5) or zzso pacing zzso in 3 and RV in zzso With zzso 0, the zzso delay remained abnormal in zzso and was longer than baseline in zzso of patients compared with 9 and zzso with zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso is achieved with simultaneous zzso pacing in most zzso A tailored programming of the relative contribution of RV and zzso pacing forms the prerequisite for improving zzso zzso
