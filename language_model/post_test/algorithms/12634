zzso situations after multiple trauma which require interruption of the diagnostic zzso and immediate surgical treatment after admission are a challenge for the multidisciplinary trauma zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso causes, implications and relevance of life-threatening situations for major trauma patients after admission to trauma zzso 

Data of zzso patients listed in the German zzso Register of the German Society for zzso Surgery zzso zzso were zzso Patients with an injury severity score zzso zzso 16, no isolated head injury and primary admission to a trauma center were zzso Data were allocated according to patients where the diagnostic zzso in the resuscitation room was interrupted to perform emergency surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients who received early surgical care after completed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative parameters were the pattern and severity of injury, zzso state and clinical zzso 

Patients receiving emergency surgery showed an average zzso score of 39 zzso 15 points, whereas patients receiving early surgery showed an average zzso of 31 zzso 12 zzso On admission patients in the emergency surgery group zzso suffered from zzso shock considerably more often than patients in the early surgery care group zzso p zzso zzso This was indicated by the significant differences in zzso blood pressure on admission, amount of zzso zzso volume, base excess on admission and zzso zzso concentrates in early clinical zzso zzso was zzso in the emergency surgery group and zzso in the early surgical care group zzso zzso zzso Severe injuries zzso zzso 4) of the zzso abdomen and zzso (including the zzso were encountered considerably more often in the emergency surgery zzso There was no statistical difference in occurrence of severe head injuries between the zzso Emergency surgery consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pelvic zzso 

zzso situations after major trauma which require immediate surgical intervention in the resuscitation room rarely occur in zzso Nevertheless, they are associated with a high mortality and prolonged and complex clinical course if primarily zzso zzso and decision-making processes of these challenging situations have to be practiced with standardized zzso and should be considered for the future education of orthopedic surgeons in zzso
