This paper presents a zzso of a previously published methodology which zzso the zzso consequences of zzso effects in zzso zzso The methodology uses the zzso zzso zzso to identify an equivalent biologically effective dose zzso which, if applied zzso to a specified tissue volume, would produce the same net cell survival as that achieved by a given zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso which enable the equivalent zzso for an enclosed volume to be estimated from the zzso calculated at the dose reference surface, have been calculated and tabulated for both zzso and zzso zzso The main types of zzso zzso dose rate zzso low dose rate zzso and zzso zzso have been examined for a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso are consistently higher than the zzso calculated at the reference surface by an amount which depends on the treatment prescription zzso of the prescribed zzso at the reference zzso zzso are closely related to the zzso zzso values, irrespective of how the original zzso was attained zzso via zzso zzso or zzso Thus, an average zzso can be used for a given prescribed zzso as it will be largely independent of the assumed zzso parameters zzso and zzso and standardized zzso tables may be zzso to all types of zzso zzso This analysis opens the way to more systematic approaches for zzso physical and biological effects in several types of zzso and for the improved quantitative assessment and ranking of clinical treatments which involve a zzso zzso
