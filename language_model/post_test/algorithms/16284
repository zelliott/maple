Gene expression studies provide molecular insights improving the zzso of patients with high-grade zzso We have developed a risk zzso strategy based on a combined analysis of gene expression data to search for robust zzso associated with outcome in these zzso 

We performed a zzso using 3 publicly available zzso zzso zzso data sets zzso zzso to define the genes related to both zzso zzso and patient zzso These zzso were used to construct a zzso equation based on a Cox zzso hazards model on a subset of 144 zzso External zzso were performed on zzso data zzso zzso and on zzso data zzso zzso The zzso model performances zzso and zzso were evaluated and compared with that of clinical risk factors, zzso promoter zzso status, and zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso approach allowed the identification of a zzso signature highly correlated to survival zzso zzso zzso and zzso from which an optimal survival model was built zzso zzso zzso in training and validation zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso risk score was strongly and independently associated with survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Performance zzso indicated that this score added beyond standard clinical parameters and beyond both the zzso zzso status and the zzso zzso status in terms of discrimination zzso statistics, zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso signature provides an independent risk score strongly associated with outcome of patients with high-grade zzso
