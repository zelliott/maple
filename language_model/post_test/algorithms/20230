The purpose of this paper is to present a digital zzso technique for the assessment of zzso bone change over time in zzso Digital zzso zzso may be used to detect areas of zzso change that have occurred between zzso zzso and image processing zzso have been developed which can relate the magnitude of the change on the zzso image to a reference wedge, thereby allowing calculation of the mass of the zzso This manuscript will present two zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso The method was validated in monkeys by means of small zzso chips placed zzso prior to the first zzso The chips were removed, a second zzso taken, and the images zzso Each zzso was used to isolate the zzso and calculate change in bone zzso Overall, there was excellent correlation between the calculated zzso mass (in zzso and actual zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The utility of the method was demonstrated by comparison of the results of zzso zzso in successful implants and in implants that did not integrate during the healing zzso
