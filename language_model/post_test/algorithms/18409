zzso identification is a necessary step in developing safe and effective zzso zzso analysis typically involves rapid identification of the chemical composition of the zzso by automated zzso methods, followed by the zzso process of identifying the structure of the zzso Since zzso is typically zzso to identify the zzso it is logical to zzso zzso to structurally characterize the zzso However, interpretation of zzso data may not provide sufficient information, as fragmentation pathways are not well understood or zzso zzso other more time-consuming methods of analysis are often zzso If the zzso rules for low-energy zzso experiments were clearly defined for all classes of compounds, more information would be obtained from zzso data, and zzso identification would proceed more zzso We are currently developing methods to define these fragmentation zzso By screening approximately 100 zzso acids at a time and applying knowledge of zzso chemistry, zzso rules are under development that describe how compounds zzso under low-energy zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso acid zzso demonstrate that this approach is practical and zzso zzso rules were predicted with a zzso success rate, when tested on zzso zzso This zzso power cannot be matched by any commercially available zzso This study, and others like it, will be used to develop zzso that more rapidly identify drug zzso and degradation products, based on zzso zzso Such zzso will benefit drug development for all types of zzso
