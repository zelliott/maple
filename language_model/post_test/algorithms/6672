We measured the zzso of the directional component of the zzso zzso zzso the so-called optical zzso effect, as a function of zzso The directional zzso originates from within the outer segments of the zzso Thus only two anterior zzso are of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso obtained in zzso established that the cone zzso act as zzso neutral zzso The zzso zzso expressed in density units, resembled the zzso zzso density zzso zzso age effects in the lens of normal subjects resulted in a description of the optical density of the lens in terms of a zzso and an zzso zzso The young template represents the zzso zzso of zzso which dominates the light zzso in young eyes and decreases with zzso The aged template represents the zzso accumulating in the lens with zzso The total optical density increased with age, but it was lower in the wavelength region zzso zzso than was previously assumed on the basis of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso also provided precise individual estimates of the optical density of zzso zzso Finally, we observed a decrease in the zzso zzso with age, possibly reflecting a degradation of the zzso
