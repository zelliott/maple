To review the literature on diagnostic testing in zzso and provide recommendations for a comprehensive, cost-effective approach to establishing its zzso 

Studies were identified through a zzso search zzso to zzso and a manual review of zzso of identified zzso 

zzso were eligible if they addressed diagnostic testing in zzso or near zzso and reported results for at least 10 zzso 

The usefulness of tests was assessed by calculating diagnostic zzso the number of patients with zzso positive test results divided by the number of patients tested or, in the case of monitoring studies, the sum of zzso and zzso test results divided by the number of patients zzso 

Despite the absence of a diagnostic gold standard and the paucity of data from zzso trials, several points zzso First, history, physical examination, and zzso are the core of the zzso zzso zzso diagnostic yield, zzso Second, zzso testing is rarely helpful unless additional zzso signs or symptoms are present zzso yield of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso Third, patients in whom heart disease is known or suspected or those with zzso zzso are at higher risk for adverse outcomes and should have cardiac testing, including zzso stress zzso zzso monitoring, or zzso zzso studies, alone or in combination zzso yields, zzso to zzso Fourth, zzso in the elderly often results from zzso and abnormal zzso responses to daily zzso zzso long-term loop zzso zzso yield, zzso to zzso and tilt testing zzso yield zzso or zzso zzso are most useful in patients with zzso zzso in whom heart disease is not zzso zzso psychiatric evaluation can detect mental disorders associated with zzso in up to zzso of zzso zzso hospitalization may be indicated for patients at high risk for cardiac zzso zzso with an abnormal zzso organic heart disease, chest pain, history of zzso age zzso 70 zzso or with acute zzso zzso 

Many tests for zzso have a low diagnostic zzso A careful history, physical examination, and zzso will provide a diagnosis or determine whether diagnostic testing is necessary in most zzso
