To determine a zzso relationship for cataract zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the rate of repair of zzso damage, zzso value, in the zzso formula have to be zzso To obtain these parameters for the human eye zzso a large series of patients treated with different doses and dose rates is zzso The data of patients with acute leukemia treated with zzso total body zzso zzso and bone zzso transplantation zzso collected by the European Group for Blood and zzso zzso were zzso 

The data of zzso patients who underwent zzso for acute zzso who had zzso as part of their conditioning regimen, were analyzed using the zzso zzso The end point was the zzso of cataract formation after zzso Of the analyzed patients, 175 were registered as having zzso zzso effective doses zzso for different sets of values for zzso and zzso were calculated for each zzso With Cox zzso analysis, using the overall zzso test as the zzso evaluating the goodness of fit, zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso factors for cataract induction were the zzso of the applied zzso regimen, zzso zzso steroid therapy for zzso weeks, and zzso zzso To avoid the influence of steroid therapy and zzso on cataract zzso patients who received steroid or zzso treatment were zzso leaving only the zzso as a risk zzso Next, the most likely set of zzso and zzso values was zzso With this set, the zzso survival rates were calculated for specific zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso From these calculations, cataract zzso were obtained as function of the zzso at 120 months after zzso 

The use of zzso instead of the zzso dose enabled the zzso of cataract formation to be predicted in a reasonably consistent zzso With Cox zzso analysis for all zzso data, a zzso zzso value was obtained for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When Cox zzso analysis was applied for patients who had no steroid treatment after zzso a zzso zzso value was obtained for zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis was repeated using the data of patients who had not received zzso steroid treatment and also no zzso zzso we found zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An increased cataract zzso was observed after steroid treatment of zzso weeks and zzso zzso 

The zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso value of zzso zzso found for the eye lens are characteristic for zzso zzso The zzso of cataract formation can now be zzso taking into account the values calculated for zzso and zzso zzso dose, and dose zzso Also, the reduction in cataract zzso as a result of lens dose reduction by eye shielding can be zzso
