zzso resonance assignment is a critical bottleneck in studies of protein structure, dynamics and interactions by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso A minimalist approach to assignment, which we call zzso seeks to dramatically reduce experimental time and expense by replacing the standard suite of zzso experiments with the zzso zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso In the zzso approach, spectral data are represented in a graph with zzso for putative zzso (of unknown relation to the primary zzso and edges for hypothesized zzso zzso such that observed spectral zzso could be explained if the zzso were zzso zzso Due to experimental zzso several incorrect edges can be hypothesized for each spectral zzso An assignment is derived by identifying consistent patterns of edges zzso for zzso and zzso within a graph and by mapping the zzso to the primary zzso The key zzso challenge is to be able to uncover these patterns even when they are obscured by significant zzso 

This paper develops, analyzes and applies a novel zzso for the identification of zzso representing consistent patterns of edges in a corrupted zzso zzso Our zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and fixes inconsistencies with simple local zzso called zzso that maintain most of the structure already zzso In characterizing the effects of experimental noise, we employ an zzso random graph model in proving that our zzso gives optimal performance in expected zzso time, even when the input graph is significantly zzso We confirm this analysis in simulation studies with zzso corrupted by up to zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate the practical application of the zzso on several experimental zzso zzso Our approach is able to eliminate a large majority of noise edges and to uncover large consistent sets of zzso 

Our zzso has been implemented in the zzso Python zzso The software can be freely obtained for academic use by request from the zzso
