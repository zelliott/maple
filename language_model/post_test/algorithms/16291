The zzso zzso Unit zzso originally designed for rendering graphics and which is difficult to program for other tasks, has since evolved into a device suitable for zzso zzso As a result graphics hardware has become progressively more attractive yielding unprecedented performance at a relatively low zzso Thus, it is the ideal candidate to accelerate a wide variety of data parallel tasks in many fields such as in zzso Learning zzso As problems become more and more zzso parallel zzso of learning zzso are crucial for a useful zzso In particular, the zzso of zzso Networks zzso in zzso can significantly reduce the long training times during the learning zzso In this paper we present a zzso parallel zzso of the zzso zzso and Multiple zzso zzso zzso and describe the zzso kernels needed for this zzso The results obtained on well-known benchmarks show faster training times and improved performances as compared to the zzso in traditional hardware, due to zzso zzso zzso and memory zzso Moreover, a preliminary zzso based zzso Training System (ATS) is developed which aims at automatically finding high-quality zzso solutions for a given zzso
