When zzso is used in pharmaceutical zzso processing of zzso with metal zzso is zzso from both an industrial and pharmaceutical perspective, compared to processing using silicon zzso Unlike the use of zzso and basic zzso for the industrial preparation of zzso zzso zzso of metal zzso is dependent upon a simple replacement reaction between sodium zzso and metal zzso When zzso onto zzso zzso aluminum, zzso or calcium zzso result in zzso highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters for zzso zzso zzso were investigated and found to be independent of the particle zzso zzso action appears to be the major contributor to both water zzso and the driving force for disintegration of zzso The good zzso and zzso properties shown by the zzso zzso were found to be strongly dependent upon the type of metal zzso zzso onto zzso In addition, the inherent binding and disintegration abilities of zzso zzso are useful in pharmaceutical applications when poorly zzso and/or highly zzso drugs need to be zzso
