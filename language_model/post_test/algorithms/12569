A novel zzso for pose and motion zzso using corresponding features and a Digital zzso zzso is zzso Using a Digital zzso (or Digital zzso zzso zzso as a global reference enables the elimination of the ambiguity present in zzso zzso for motion zzso As a consequence, the absolute position and orientation of a camera can be recovered with respect to the external reference zzso In order to do this, the zzso is used to formulate a constraint between corresponding features in two consecutive zzso zzso reconstruction of the zzso world is not zzso When considering a number of feature points, the resulting constraints can be solved using zzso zzso in terms of position, orientation, and zzso Such a procedure requires an initial guess of these zzso which can be obtained from zzso or any other zzso The feasibility of the zzso is established through extensive zzso Performance is compared with a state-of-the-art alternative algorithm, which zzso reconstructs the zzso structure and then registers it to the zzso A clear advantage for the novel zzso is demonstrated in variety of zzso
