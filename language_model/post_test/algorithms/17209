Very little work has been conducted on three-dimensional aspects of electrical zzso zzso zzso partly due to the increased zzso complexity over the two-dimensional aspects of zzso Nevertheless, extending zzso to three-dimensional data acquisition and image reconstruction may afford significant advantages such as an increase in the size of the independent data set and improved spatial zzso However, considerable challenges are associated with the software aspects of three-dimensional zzso systems due to the requirement for accurate three-dimensional forward problem zzso and the derivation of three-dimensional image reconstruction zzso This paper outlines the work performed to date to derive a three-dimensional image reconstruction zzso for zzso based on the inversion of the sensitivity zzso approach for a finite right circular zzso A comparison in terms of the zzso zzso and the singular zzso between the sensitivity zzso for a three-dimensional cylinder and a two-dimensional disc has been zzso This comparison shows that the three-dimensional image reconstruction zzso recruits more central information at lower condition numbers than the two-dimensional image reconstruction zzso
