The zzso zzso zzso is extensively expressed on the vast majority of zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso and, therefore, is a good target for tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso cells play a critical role in zzso regulation, and maintenance of immune zzso In this study, we sought to identify zzso zzso derived from zzso which can induce zzso zzso zzso The combined application with zzso T zzso zzso zzso would be more potent than tumor vaccines that primarily activate zzso zzso 

We zzso a combined approach of using a computer-based zzso analysis zzso and in zzso biological analysis to identify zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso screening of healthy donors showed that all five predicted peptides derived from zzso could induce zzso zzso proliferation in zzso We characterized these zzso zzso by establishing and analyzing zzso zzso zzso It was shown that zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso can recognize and respond to naturally processed zzso protein and zzso zzso can be zzso presented by commonly found major zzso complex zzso zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated that zzso of human zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses which can recognize the zzso peptides derived from zzso protein and zzso zzso 

The zzso class zzso zzso zzso could be used in the design of zzso tumor vaccine against several common zzso expressing zzso
