Most of the known methods to measure the zzso optical properties of materials deal with the bulk properties, but there are many demanding applications that require those zzso to be done on a single particle or a single zzso We report a novel application of zzso zzso to measure the zzso zzso optical zzso of zzso in zzso By measuring the power of the third harmonic generated in a diluted solution of zzso both the size and zzso can be extracted from a simple set of zzso
