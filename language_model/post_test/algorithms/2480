zzso pressure zzso is affected in many neurological zzso Clinical measurement of pressure on the brain currently requires placing a probe in the zzso fluid zzso the brain zzso or other zzso zzso This zzso limits the measurement to critically ill zzso Because zzso is also clinically important in conditions ranging from brain tumors and zzso to zzso zzso determination of zzso would be zzso Our zzso approach to continuous zzso and tracking of zzso uses routinely zzso zzso zzso (or minimally zzso zzso of peripheral zzso blood pressure and blood flow zzso in the middle cerebral artery zzso both at zzso zzso A zzso model of cerebrovascular dynamics provides mathematical constraints that relate the measured zzso to zzso Our zzso produces zzso zzso estimates with no zzso or zzso Using 35 hours of data from 37 patients with traumatic brain injury, we generated zzso estimates on zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso against zzso recorded invasive zzso zzso that varied over 100 zzso of mercury zzso across all records, our estimates achieved a mean error zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of error zzso of zzso zzso For the zzso data windows over 22 hours in which blood flow zzso recordings were available from both the left and the right zzso averaging the resulting bilateral zzso estimates reduced the bias to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso This accuracy is already comparable to that of some invasive zzso measurement methods in current clinical zzso
