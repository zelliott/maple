zzso is proposed for zzso assessment of both zzso sound quality and speech recognition in such way that results can be compared between these two zzso zzso is performed with a noise suppression system applied to hearing zzso A method termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for time efficient assessment of zzso impression of different aspects of sound quality for a variety of noise zzso The method is based on paired comparisons between processed and zzso zzso and the results are expressed as the difference in zzso ratio zzso between these that give equal zzso zzso For tests of speech recognition in noise, validated zzso test methods can be used that give results in terms of zzso zzso The methodology was shown to be sensitive enough to detect significant mean differences between processed and zzso speech in noise, both regarding zzso sound quality and speech recognition ability in groups consisting of 30 zzso An effect on sound quality from the noise suppression equivalent to about zzso zzso is required to be statistically significant for a single zzso A corresponding effect of 3-6 zzso is required for speech recognition zzso zzso The magnitude of difference that occurred in the present study for sound quality was sufficient to show significant differences for sound quality within individuals, but this was not the case for speech zzso
