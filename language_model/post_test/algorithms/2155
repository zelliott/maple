To evaluate the zzso and zzso agreement for both treatment plan and fracture zzso of zzso plateau fractures using plain films alone and with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective study to assess the impact of an advanced zzso study on the agreement of treatment plan and fracture zzso of zzso plateau zzso 

Two zzso zzso two zzso residents, and two skeletal zzso were presented with zzso cases of zzso plateau fractures zzso with plain films and with CT zzso 

zzso was measured using zzso zzso 

Using plain films alone, the mean zzso zzso zzso for zzso was zzso which decreased to zzso after addition of CT zzso Using plain films alone for zzso a treatment plan, the mean zzso zzso zzso was zzso which increased to zzso after addition of CT zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso for fracture zzso using plain films was zzso which increased to zzso with addition of CT zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso for treatment plan based on plain films alone was zzso which increased to zzso after addition of CT zzso Class was changed in an average of 12 percent of cases after addition of CT zzso Treatment plan was changed an average of 26 percent of the time after addition of CT zzso 

zzso of CT scans to plain zzso increases the zzso and zzso agreement on treatment zzso
