In this paper, we recover a graph interpretation of the mutual partition distance, proposed recently by zzso and zzso We deduce some properties of this measure, and establish a correspondence with the partition distance introduced by zzso and Field and zzso and independently by zzso We also present some different zzso for the zzso of the mutual partition zzso Finally, a comparison is made with similar zzso
