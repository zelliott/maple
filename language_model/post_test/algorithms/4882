The purpose of the study was to zzso the potential use of pulse wave zzso zzso and digital volume pulse zzso as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood zzso Single and multiple correlation studies were conducted, including zzso parameters and risk zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals were obtained from a Pulse Trace zzso and Pulse Trace zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso allowed zzso zzso and reflection indexes zzso to be zzso The first study on 47 healthy volunteers showed that both zzso and zzso correlated significantly both with zzso and zzso Multiple zzso models of the zzso and the zzso ratio zzso allowed zzso and zzso to be modeled with r zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso results also employed zzso and modeled zzso and zzso with r zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso did not correlate either with zzso or zzso In order to avoid the use of ultrasound techniques to measure zzso we then developed a zzso system to measure zzso by zzso and validated it against the Pulse zzso With the same equipment we conducted a second pilot study with ten healthy zzso The best zzso multiple zzso model for zzso achieved r zzso zzso by considering the zzso zzso zzso measured between zzso and index zzso zzso and heart zzso Only zzso was significant in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso signal could be a reliable zzso of approximate zzso and could be used, for example, to monitor cardiac patients during physical exercise sessions in cardiac zzso
