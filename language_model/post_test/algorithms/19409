Assessing the accuracy of zzso and water quality simulation models in different soils, land-use systems, and environments provides a basis for using and improving these zzso We evaluated the performance of the zzso model for simulating zzso zzso zzso export from a zzso watershed in central Illinois, where approximately zzso of the land is used for zzso production and tile drainage is zzso zzso chemical properties, crop nitrogen zzso zzso zzso dry matter ratio, and a zzso reduction zzso were used as zzso parameters to zzso the fit between measured and simulated zzso load from the watershed for the 1989 to 1993 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso values was tested by using these values for simulating the 1994 to 1997 period on the same zzso zzso index of agreement ranged from zzso to zzso for daily, weekly, zzso and annual comparisons of zzso nitrate N zzso zzso accuracy generally decreased as the time zzso zzso zzso index for simulated crop yields ranged from zzso to zzso however, observed crop yields were used as input to the zzso The partial N budget results suggested that 52 to 72 zzso N zzso zzso accumulated in the soil, but simulated biological N fixation associated with soybeans was considerably greater than literature values for the zzso Improvement of the N fixation zzso and incorporation of mechanisms that describe soybean yield in response to environmental conditions appear to be needed to improve the performance of the zzso
