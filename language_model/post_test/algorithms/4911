zzso zzso zzso is the most common sustained zzso and is associated with an increased long-term risk of zzso A screening test for early diagnosis has the potential to prevent zzso zzso This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an automated device for zzso blood pressure zzso monitoring, which zzso an zzso for zzso zzso A zzso automated zzso device for zzso zzso monitoring zzso zzso Plus, zzso zzso zzso with an zzso detector was used to carry out zzso zzso zzso in subjects with zzso rhythm, zzso and zzso zzso During each zzso zzso the zzso zzso was recorded zzso A total of 217 simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso recordings were obtained from 73 zzso zzso subjects zzso had zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso and 23 zzso had zzso zzso A single measurement had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for detecting zzso For two zzso in which one of them was required to detect zzso the sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso whereas for three zzso in which two of them were required to detect zzso the sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso zzso for an agreement with zzso Using the latter approach, there were five false positive cases all having irregularities in approximately 50% of the zzso In patients with zzso the device underestimated heart zzso These data suggest that an electronic device for zzso zzso monitoring, which zzso an zzso for zzso diagnosis has an excellent diagnostic accuracy and might, therefore, be used as a reliable screening test for the early zzso
