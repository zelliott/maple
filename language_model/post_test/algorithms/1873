The mechanical properties of cells are unique indicators of their states and zzso zzso it is difficult to recognize the degrees of mechanical properties, due to small size of the cell and broad distribution of the mechanical zzso Here, we developed a simple virtual reality system for presenting the mechanical properties of cells and their zzso using a zzso device and a zzso This system simulates atomic force zzso zzso zzso experiments for floating cells in virtual zzso An operator can virtually position the zzso zzso probe over a round cell with the zzso handle on the PC monitor and feel the force zzso The Young's zzso of zzso stem cells and zzso cells in the floating state was measured by zzso The distribution of the Young's zzso of these cells was zzso and the distribution complied with a zzso zzso To represent the mechanical properties together with the cell zzso we used zzso zzso random number determined by the mode and zzso values of the Young's zzso of these zzso The represented Young's zzso was determined for each touching event of the probe surface and the cell object, and the zzso zzso force was calculated using a Hertz model corresponding to the zzso depth and the fixed Young's zzso zzso Using this system, we can feel the mechanical properties and their zzso in each cell type in real zzso This system will help us not only recognize the degrees of mechanical properties of diverse cells but also share them with zzso
