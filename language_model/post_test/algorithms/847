The zzso protein zzso plays an important role in the zzso system zzso The zzso induced on the protein structure at high zzso pressure values zzso 50, 100, zzso and 200 zzso were previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Science 2000, zzso 9, zzso zzso analyzed by zzso zzso the zzso variations of the zzso chemical shifts at high pressure values were supposed to arise from induced shifts in the protein zzso zzso zzso dynamics zzso simulations are here performed, to analyze the protein internal mobility at zzso zzso and to relate the zzso variations of chemical shifts observed at high pressure, to variations in zzso zzso The global features of the protein structure are only slightly modified along the zzso Nevertheless, the values of the zzso zzso volumes show that the zzso of zzso are more compressed that those belonging to the zzso The zzso are also displaying the largest internal mobility and deformation in the zzso The zzso of the zzso chemical shifts, zzso from the MD simulation zzso is in qualitative agreement with the zzso of the zzso observed chemical zzso
