In many zzso vegetation extracts water from both the zzso and the saturated zzso The zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zone zzso and ground water zzso zzso is complex because it depends on land cover and subsurface zzso Traditionally, the zzso fraction is assumed to zzso with increasing depth to the water table zzso attaining a value of 0 at what is termed the extinction zzso A simple assumption of linear zzso with depth is often used but has never been rigorously examined using zzso flow zzso Furthermore, it is not well understood how to relate extinction depths to characteristics of land cover and soil zzso In this work, variable zzso flow theory is used to simulate zzso for three land covers and a range of soil properties under drying soil zzso For a water table within half a meter of the land surface, nearly all zzso is extracted from ground water due to the close zzso connection between the zzso and the saturated zzso For zzso zzso the decoupling of ground water and zzso zone was found to begin at water table depths between 30 and 100 zzso depending on the soil zzso The decline of zzso with zzso is better simulated by an exponential zzso function than the commonly used linear zzso A comparison with field data is consistent with the findings of this zzso zzso are provided to vary the extinction depth for zzso landscapes with different vegetation cover and soil zzso
