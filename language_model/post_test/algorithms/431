In many cases, we observe some variables X that contain zzso information over a zzso variable of interest Y , with zzso pairs observed in a training zzso We can take advantage of this information to estimate the conditional density zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a conditional mixture model with hybrid zzso components to estimate zzso zzso zzso The hybrid zzso is a zzso whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized zzso zzso A third zzso in addition to the location and spread parameters of the zzso controls the zzso of the upper zzso Using the hybrid zzso in a mixture model results in a zzso zzso that can adapt to zzso zzso and heavy zzso A conditional density zzso is built by modeling the parameters of the mixture zzso as functions of zzso We use a neural network to implement these zzso Such conditional density zzso have important applications in many zzso such as finance and zzso We show zzso that this novel approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood, compared to competing zzso conditional mixture models with other types of components and a classical zzso zzso zzso
