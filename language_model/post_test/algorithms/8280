To improve the zzso performance of online learning and reinforce its stability, we consider online learning with limited zzso learning rate in this zzso The letter extends convergence zzso for zzso to a range of step sizes, then employs support zzso learning with zzso zzso zzso limited to that range for step size adaptation, so as to obtain an online kernel zzso that combines theoretical convergence guarantees with good practical zzso zzso on different data sets corroborate theoretical results well and show that our method is another promising way for online zzso
