zzso simulation codes typically execute for extended periods of time and often on distributed zzso zzso Because these simulations can run for hours, or even days, scientists like to get feedback about the state of the zzso and the zzso of its results as it zzso It is also important that these capabilities be made available with little impact on the performance and stability of the zzso zzso and exploring data in the early stages of the simulation can help scientists identify problems early, potentially avoiding a situation where a simulation runs for several days, only to discover that an error with an input zzso caused both time and resources to be zzso We describe an application that aids in the monitoring and analysis of a simulation of the human zzso zzso The application provides researchers with high-level feedback about the state of the ongoing simulation and enables them to investigate particular areas of interest in greater zzso The application also offers monitoring information about the amount of data produced and data transfer performance among the various components of the zzso
