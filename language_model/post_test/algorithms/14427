The drug discovery process mainly relies on the experimental zzso screening of huge compound libraries in their pursuit of new active zzso However, spiraling research and development costs and unimpressive success rates have driven the development of more rational, efficient, and cost-effective zzso With the increasing availability of protein structural information, advancement in zzso zzso and faster computing resources, in zzso zzso methods are increasingly used to design smaller and focused compound libraries in order to reduce screening efforts and costs and at the same time identify active compounds with a better chance of progressing through the zzso zzso This chapter is a primer on the various zzso methods developed for the purpose of zzso library zzso Our aim is to zzso some basic terms related to the zzso technique and explain the methodology behind several zzso library design zzso This chapter also aims to guide the novice zzso practitioner by laying out the general steps involved for such an zzso zzso successful case studies conclude this zzso
