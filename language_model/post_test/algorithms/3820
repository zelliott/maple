An increasing number of researchers have released novel zzso structure analysis and prediction zzso for comparative approaches to structure zzso Yet, independent zzso of these zzso is rarely performed as is now common practice for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Here we evaluate a number of zzso folding zzso using reliable zzso zzso and compare their relative zzso 

We conclude that comparative data can enhance structure prediction but zzso vary widely in terms of both sensitivity and selectivity across different lengths and zzso Furthermore, we outline some directions for future zzso
