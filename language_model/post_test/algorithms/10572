We apply the recently developed symbolic resonance analysis to zzso zzso of zzso brain zzso zzso in a language processing experiment by using a zzso zzso zzso with varying thresholds for analyzing the zzso zzso followed by a zzso transformation as a zzso zzso We zzso an zzso of the zzso ratio zzso for the symbolic dynamics measuring the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we zzso the inherent noise of the zzso for sweeping the underlying zzso components beyond the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso within the time window of a particular zzso component (the zzso against the zzso zzso we find different resonance zzso for the experimental zzso The zzso differences of the zzso lead to the zzso of optimal zzso zzso We show that zzso brain maps of the optimal threshold zzso and of their associated zzso differences are able to zzso the underlying zzso zzso while corresponding maps gained from the customary zzso averaging technique are unable to do zzso
