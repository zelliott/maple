Currently, two of the most sensitive clinical approaches commonly used to monitor for zzso air zzso zzso zzso zzso audio and zzso require the attention of the zzso eye or ear, which is a distraction from other aspects of zzso To assess the feasibility of allowing the computer to relieve the necessity for continuous human monitoring, we developed a computer zzso for monitoring the zzso zzso zzso This zzso extracted zzso the zzso of certain zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso a measure of the average value of the envelope of zzso zzso and zzso the ratio between the average value of the zzso envelope and the amount of envelope signal variation at heart rate frequency and its zzso These three features were monitored by an zzso pattern recognition zzso that compared each new value for each feature with the previously developed mean and standard zzso for that zzso If the changes in the three features exceeded a detection zzso an alarm zzso suspected air zzso was zzso zzso as a zzso system, the zzso was given preliminary testing in 2 dogs and activated alarms at levels of air well below those reported to cause clinically significant zzso changes in zzso While decreasing the distraction for the zzso this early zzso alarm system alerts its user to the need for analysis of the zzso signals when it senses an air zzso
