The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of measuring the zzso disc area by indirect zzso 

In a prospective clinical trial, 57 eyes of 29 subjects (age zzso zzso were zzso The zzso error was zzso zzso to zzso vertical and horizontal disc diameters zzso were measured using a zzso slit lamp and zzso zzso zzso and Super Field zzso zzso zzso Mentor, zzso zzso the disc area was calculated by an zzso formula zzso zzso zzso vertical zzso zzso zzso The zzso factor given by the manufacturer was taken into account for each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Field zzso zzso As reference for the disc size, the same eyes were examined by zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plots were used to assess the agreement between zzso obtained by indirect zzso and zzso 

The results of the disc estimate compared with the zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Field zzso zzso were not statistically significant for the zzso zzso zzso zzso or Super Field zzso zzso However, the difference between the zzso lens and zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the disc size by indirect zzso is zzso The zzso lens showed the smallest and the zzso lens the largest zzso
