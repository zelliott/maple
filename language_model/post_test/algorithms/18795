To zzso compare the diagnostic performance and time efficiency of both second and concurrent zzso detection zzso reading zzso for zzso obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso data sets by using consensus reading (three zzso of zzso findings as a reference zzso 

Ethical zzso zzso compliance (for zzso zzso and patient consent were obtained from all institutions for use of CT zzso data sets in this zzso Ten zzso each read 25 CT zzso data sets (12 men, 13 zzso mean age, 61 zzso containing 69 zzso zzso were zzso zzso 41 were zzso zzso by using zzso integrated with zzso zzso Reading was zzso to either zzso zzso zzso zzso only after initial zzso assessment) or zzso zzso zzso zzso at the start of zzso Data sets were reread 6 weeks later by using the opposing zzso zzso sensitivity and reading times were compared by using zzso zzso and linear regression, zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso 

Compared with the zzso read, odds of improved zzso zzso zzso detection were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using zzso as second and concurrent reader, zzso zzso odds by using zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso those of second read zzso excluding and including zzso zzso zzso zzso The concurrent read took zzso minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso less than did second zzso The mean areas under the zzso curve zzso zzso for the zzso read, second read zzso and concurrent read zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is more time efficient when used zzso than when used as a second reader, with similar sensitivity for zzso 6 zzso or zzso However, use of second read zzso zzso sensitivity, particularly for smaller zzso
