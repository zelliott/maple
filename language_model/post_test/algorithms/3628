The forward and backward zzso for watershed water pollution control planning were summarized in this paper as well as their advantages and zzso The spatial databases of water environmental function region, pollution sources, monitoring sections and sewer outlets were built with zzso as the platform in the case study of zzso valley, zzso zzso Based on the principles of the forward algorithm, four scenarios were designed for the watershed pollution zzso Under these scenarios, ten sets of planning schemes were generated to implement cascade pollution source zzso The investment costs of sewage treatment for these schemes were estimated by means of a series of cost-effective zzso with pollution source zzso the water quality was modeled with zzso model for each planning zzso The modeled results of different planning schemes were zzso through zzso to aid zzso With the results of investment cost and water quality zzso as decision-making zzso and based on the analysis of the economic zzso capacity for water pollution control in zzso river zzso two zzso schemes were zzso The research shows that zzso technology and scenario analysis can provide a good guidance to the zzso integrity and zzso aspects for river basin water quality zzso
