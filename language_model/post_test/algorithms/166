The combination of the output of zzso has been one of the strategies used to improve zzso rates in general purpose zzso zzso Some of the most common approaches can be explained using the zzso zzso In this paper, we tackle the problem of the combination of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso This approach permits us to derive two linear combination rules that minimize zzso rates under some constraints on the distribution of zzso In order to show the zzso of this approach we have compared it with other popular combination rules from a theoretical viewpoint using a synthetic data set, and zzso using two standard zzso the zzso handwritten zzso database and the zzso symbol zzso zzso on the synthetic data set show the zzso of the theoretical zzso Indeed, results on real data show that the proposed methods outperform other common combination zzso
