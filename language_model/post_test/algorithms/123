Novel zzso parallel sequencing technologies provide highly detailed structures of zzso and zzso by yielding deep coverage of short reads, but their utility is limited by inadequate sequencing quality and zzso zzso zzso trimming in short reads is therefore a vital process that could improve the rate of successful reference mapping and zzso zzso Toward this aim, we zzso report a zzso de zzso zzso zzso method that organizes erroneous short sequences originating in a single abundant sequence into a tree zzso in this structure, each zzso sequence is considered to be zzso derived from its more abundant zzso sequence with one zzso through sequencing zzso The root zzso is the most frequently observed sequence that represents all erroneous reads in the entire tree, allowing the alignment of the reliable representative read to the zzso without the risk of mapping erroneous reads to zzso zzso This method zzso base calling and the error correction of making direct alignments with the reference zzso and is able to improve the overall accuracy of zzso alignment by consulting the inherent relationships among the entire set of zzso The zzso runs efficiently with a linear time zzso In addition, an error rate evaluation model can be derived from bacterial artificial zzso sequencing data obtained in the same run as a zzso In two zzso experiments using small zzso and zzso zzso reads data sets, we confirmed a remarkable increase ( approximately zzso in the percentage of short reads aligned to the reference zzso
