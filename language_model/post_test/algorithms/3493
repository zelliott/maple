We survey the recent activities of the zzso Laboratory in the area of the application of mathematics to the design of models for studying brain anatomy and zzso We start with the problem of reconstructing sources in zzso and zzso and discuss the zzso approach we have developed for solving these inverse zzso This motivates the need for geometric models of the zzso We present a method for automatically and accurately zzso surface zzso of several zzso of the head from anatomical magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso connectivity can be extracted from diffusion zzso magnetic resonance images but, in the current state of the technology, it must be preceded by a robust zzso and zzso zzso We discuss our work based on zzso principles and show how the results can be used to track fibers in the white matter zzso as zzso in some zzso zzso We then go to the statistical modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals from the viewpoint of their decomposition in a zzso and zzso part that we then use to perform zzso of zzso in a way that is inspired by the theory of support zzso machines and in a way that is grounded in information zzso zzso image matching is discussed next in the framework of image statistics and partial differential equations zzso with an eye on registering zzso to the zzso The paper ends with a discussion of a new theory of random shapes that may prove useful in building anatomical and functional zzso
