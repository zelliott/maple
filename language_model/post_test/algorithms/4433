In this paper, we present a novel approach zzso zzso Information zzso and Data zzso to integrate text mining and zzso modeling to analyze zzso network from biomedical literature zzso Our method consists of two zzso In phase 1, we discuss a zzso efficient learning approach to automatically extract biological relationships such as zzso interaction, zzso interaction from the biomedical literature databases to construct the zzso zzso Our method automatically learns the patterns based on a few user seed zzso and then extracts new zzso from the biomedical literature based on the discovered zzso The derived zzso network forms a large zzso network zzso In phase 2, we present a novel zzso zzso to analyze the zzso network graph to identify biologically meaningful zzso zzso The zzso zzso considers the characteristics of the zzso network zzso and is based on the local density of the zzso and its neighborhood functions that can be used to find more meaningful clusters with different density zzso The experimental results indicate our approach is very effective in zzso biological knowledge from a huge collection of biomedical zzso The integration of data mining and information extraction provides a promising direction for analyzing the zzso zzso
