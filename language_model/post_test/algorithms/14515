zzso features of zzso and zzso zzso from simulated radioactive solutions onto a novel zzso zzso composite as beads have been investigated compared with zzso zzso with zzso The effects of contact time, the initial metal zzso zzso zzso mass and temperature on the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso was well described by the zzso order zzso and the zzso zzso were better fitted by the zzso zzso The maximum experimental zzso capacities were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso tendency of zzso composite toward zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso under competitive conditions, followed the order: zzso and zzso zzso The negative values of Gibbs free energy of zzso indicated the spontaneity of the zzso of radioactive zzso on both the zzso composite and the zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso from the composite zzso by using zzso zzso was around zzso and that of zzso zzso performed by zzso zzso was around zzso both values being higher than the zzso level of zzso from the zzso zzso which were zzso and zzso zzso
