We consider zzso problems where the set of solutions available for evaluation at any given time zzso during zzso is some subset of the feasible zzso This model is appropriate to describe many zzso zzso settings zzso where physical processes or experiments are used to evaluate zzso where, due to resource limitations, it may be impossible to evaluate particular solutions at particular times zzso the solutions being part of the feasible zzso We call the constraints determining which solutions are zzso ephemeral resource constraints zzso In this paper, we investigate two specific types of zzso one encodes periodic resource zzso the other models commitment constraints that make the zzso part of the space a function of earlier evaluations zzso In an experimental study, both types of constraint are seen to impact the performance of an evolutionary zzso zzso To deal with the effects of the zzso we propose and test five different zzso policies zzso from those used to handle standard zzso using a number of different test functions including a fitness landscape from a real zzso zzso We show that knowing information about the type of resource constraint in advance may be sufficient to select an effective policy for dealing with it, even when advance knowledge of the fitness landscape is zzso
