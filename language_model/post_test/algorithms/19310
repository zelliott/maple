Whole body exposure from zzso hot particles is receiving new attention because of changes in skin dose zzso A recent study calculated and tabulated effective dose equivalent zzso and effective dose zzso for zzso energies between zzso zzso and 2 zzso for point sources at 74 locations on the zzso This technical note describes a software package called the zzso zzso zzso that allows a user to input exposure data and to calculate the zzso and zzso zzso
