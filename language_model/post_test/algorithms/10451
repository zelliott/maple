zzso organisms have two copies of all zzso but only one is carried by each zzso zzso and zzso zzso This causes a fundamental genetic conflict over transmission rate between alternative zzso Single zzso or gene zzso only rarely code for the complex zzso needed to give them a transmission advantage zzso zzso However, all genes on a zzso X and Y zzso zzso allowing different zzso genes to code for different parts of the drive zzso zzso the zzso phenomenon of male zzso drive, occurring during zzso zzso is especially common on sex zzso The new theory of sexually zzso zzso drive of the sex zzso zzso zzso extends the logic of zzso drive into the zzso phase of the zzso whenever there is competition among siblings or harmful zzso zzso The X and Y are predicted to gain a transmission advantage by harming offspring of the sex that does not carry zzso 

Here we analyzed a zzso zzso in zzso zzso that produced an excess of daughters when transmitted from zzso We developed a series of tests to differentiate between zzso and zzso drive, and provide multiple lines of evidence that zzso drive is responsible for the sex ratio zzso Driving zzso produce about 50% more surviving daughters than zzso 

zzso distortion due to genetic conflict has evolved via zzso drive and zzso transmitted zzso Our data indicate that sex zzso can also drive by harming the zzso sex of zzso
