Data from 59 critically ill patients equipped with a zzso device were zzso zzso The database contained the zzso zzso zzso zzso value obtained at each time point the device was zzso and the pulse zzso zzso zzso value recorded immediately before this time zzso Seven zzso of zzso pairs were defined according to intervals of time elapsed from the previous zzso zzso the first 30 zzso between 30 zzso and 1 zzso and every hour up to 6 zzso In the whole set of 400 zzso pairs, zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The bias zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the percentage error was zzso Among the seven zzso subsets, the percentage error was zzso only in the two first ones zzso and zzso zzso When changes in systemic vascular resistance by zzso occurred zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso the bias zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the percentage error was zzso In the subset of zzso pairs recorded within the zzso zzso period while vascular resistance changed by zzso zzso zzso zzso the bias zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the percentage error was zzso 

Our study in critically ill patients suggests that the agreement between pulse zzso cardiac output and zzso zzso cardiac output was not significantly influenced by changes in vascular zzso However, after a zzso zzso period, zzso may be zzso Such a procedure provides helpful information drawn from other zzso zzso
