The fate and transport of TNT has been studied as part of a research program to develop chemical sensors for detecting zzso The spatial and zzso concentration profiles of TNT and its degradation products depend primarily on the mobility of the water zzso The fate and transport of TNT released from a mine determine the location of the maximum concentration of chemicals on the zzso Chemical detection on the other hand may also provide such spatial location, but the actual position of the zzso is not necessary under the surface of that zzso Although this hypothesis seems zzso it has never been zzso This paper presents zzso simulations in zzso zzso zzso and zzso codes developed at Los Alamos National zzso of the fate and transport of TNT released from a zzso under changing environmental conditions (such as zzso and solar zzso To assess the zzso techniques, we compare zzso simulations to experimental data previously zzso
