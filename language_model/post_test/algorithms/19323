The framework model and the zzso collapse model represent two zzso descriptions of the protein folding zzso The first places primary reliance on the short-range interactions of secondary structure and the second assigns greater importance to the long-range interactions of zzso zzso The availability of increasingly detailed information about the folding mechanisms of diverse proteins suggests that both are important and the folding mechanism of most proteins zzso different combinations of such zzso A prior report described the zzso model, an extended zzso theory, which treats the mutual stabilization of secondary and zzso structure in simple zzso proteins at zzso In this study, a kinetic scheme describing zzso contact formation has been developed which zzso to the zzso equilibrium zzso The relaxation is governed by the relative zzso of the equilibrium states and an additional factor which represents an zzso energy for formation of a zzso zzso The model can be used to simulate zzso properties of the ensemble of zzso during the entire folding process, and the resulting predictions are zzso to a range of experimental zzso This zzso kinetic model enables investigation of the relative influence of secondary and zzso interactions on folding zzso
