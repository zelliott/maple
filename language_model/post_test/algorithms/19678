zzso training refers to an approach to pattern recognition based on direct zzso of a cost function commensurate with the performance of the recognition zzso This is in contrast to the procedure of probability distribution zzso as conventionally required in zzso zzso of the statistical pattern recognition zzso Currently, most zzso training zzso for zzso zzso designs are based on zzso zzso methods for cost zzso These zzso are easy to derive and effective in practice, but are slow in training speed and have difficulty selecting the learning zzso To address the problem, we present our study on a fast zzso training zzso The zzso zzso the parameters by the zzso zzso algorithm, and then uses a set of zzso formulas derived in this paper to further zzso a proposed objective of minimizing error zzso zzso in speech applications show that the zzso provides better recognition accuracy in a fewer zzso than the zzso zzso and a neural network trained by hundreds of zzso zzso Although some zzso properties need further research, the proposed objective and derived formulas can benefit further study of the zzso
