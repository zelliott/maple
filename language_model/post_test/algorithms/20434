The zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso zzso currents zzso were investigated in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso using the zzso zzso patch recording zzso under zzso zzso zzso application of zzso to zzso zzso induced zzso currents which increased in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso antagonized the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso with an zzso of zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso while zzso evoked no zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all enhanced the zzso by increasing the apparent affinity of the zzso receptors to zzso Moreover, spontaneous zzso zzso zzso currents zzso were observed in mechanically zzso zzso zzso attached with synaptic zzso so called zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso express zzso receptors with relatively low sensitivity to zzso zzso and that zzso may have a functional role as an zzso zzso in the zzso regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso
