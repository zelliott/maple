A significant metric in federal zzso quality standards is the phantom image quality zzso The present work seeks to demonstrate that automated image analyses for American College of zzso zzso zzso accreditation phantom zzso images may be performed by a computer with objectivity, once a human acceptance level has been zzso Twelve zzso images were generated with different zzso techniques and zzso zzso medical physicists in diagnostic roles (five of which were specially trained in zzso viewed the original film images under similar conditions and provided individual scores for each test object zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain template matching, used for low-level processing, combined with zzso zzso for zzso processing, provided translation and zzso zzso of the test objects in the zzso zzso The visibility zzso decision was modeled by a zzso zzso using threshold zzso The 50% visibility contrast threshold established by the trained zzso responses were: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using these values as an estimate of human observer performance and given the automated zzso of test objects, six images were graded with the computer zzso In all but one instance, the zzso scored the images the same as the diagnostic zzso In the case where it did not, the margin of disagreement was zzso due to the fact that the human scoring did not allow for zzso zzso zzso occurred for the other test zzso The implication from this is that an zzso zzso scoring of zzso images is feasible and could be used as a tool to help eliminate the effect of observer zzso within the current system, given proper, consistent zzso is zzso
