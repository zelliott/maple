We describe a new method for constructing empirical zzso bond potential energy surfaces using a parallel zzso genetic program zzso zzso programs can be used to perform an efficient search through function space and zzso space to find the best functions and sets of parameters that fit energies obtained by zzso zzso electronic structure zzso Building on the traditional genetic program approach, the zzso zzso a hierarchy of genetic programming on two different zzso The lower level genetic programs are used to zzso zzso populations in parallel while the higher level genetic program zzso is used to zzso the genetic operator probabilities of the lower level genetic zzso The zzso allows the zzso to zzso learn the zzso or combination of zzso that most effectively increase the fitness of the zzso causing a significant increase in the zzso accuracy and zzso The zzso accuracy and efficiency is tested against a standard parallel genetic program with a variety of one-dimensional test zzso zzso the zzso is zzso to obtain an accurate empirical zzso bond model for zzso transfer in zzso in gas phase and zzso zzso
