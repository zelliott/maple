The systematic use of hints in the zzso paradigm is the subject of this zzso zzso are the properties of the target function that are known to use independently of the training zzso The use of hints is tantamount to combining rules and data in learning, and is compatible with different learning models, zzso techniques, and zzso zzso The hints are represented to the learning process by virtual examples, and the training examples of the target function are treated on equal footing with the rest of the zzso A balance is achieved between the information provided by the different hints through the choice of objective functions and learning zzso The zzso zzso zzso achieves this balance by relating the performance on each hint to the overall zzso The application of hints in forecasting the very noisy zzso markets is zzso On the theoretical side, the information value of hints is contrasted to the complexity value and related to the VC zzso
