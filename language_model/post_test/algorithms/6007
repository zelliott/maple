The zzso zzso has been developed at the National Institute of zzso zzso Nominal beam zzso was 128 zzso in the zzso zzso When scanning continuously at the same position to obtain zzso zzso images, the effective dose is increased in proportion to the scan zzso Our purpose in this work was to measure the dose for the zzso CT, to compare it with that of the zzso zzso and to make a preliminary assessment of dose for dynamic zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso Our group reported previously that the phantom length and integration range for zzso needed to be at least 300 zzso to represent more than zzso of the line integral dose with the beam zzso between 20 zzso and 138 zzso In order to obtain good estimates of the dose, we measured the zzso dose over a 300 zzso range in zzso zzso zzso of 160 zzso or 320 zzso diameter and 300 zzso zzso zzso for both CT systems were compared for a clinical zzso The results showed that the zzso CT generates a smaller dose than the zzso CT in all zzso For zzso zzso imaging, we found an acceptable scan time would be 6 s to 11 zzso depending on zzso if dose must be limited to the same values as routine examinations with a conventional zzso zzso Finally, we discussed the studies necessary to make full use of zzso zzso zzso
