Permanent zzso zzso and temporary zzso zzso are competitive techniques for clinically localized prostate zzso Although a zzso trial will likely never be conducted comparing these two forms of zzso a comparative zzso modeling analysis proves useful in understanding some of their intrinsic differences, several of which could be exploited to improve zzso 

zzso models based upon the linear zzso equations are presented for zzso external zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso These models incorporate the dose zzso present in zzso based upon zzso dose volume zzso zzso as well as tumor doubling times and repair zzso zzso parameters are zzso to zzso to three accepted clinical risk factors based upon zzso zzso and zzso score to compare models with clinical zzso zzso control probabilities zzso for zzso and zzso zzso (as zzso or combined with external zzso are compared with clinical zzso survival zzso zzso are made for dose escalation with zzso zzso zzso 

Model predictions for dose escalation with external beam agree with clinical data and validate the models and their underlying zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso achieve superior tumor control when compared with external beam at conventional doses zzso zzso but similar to results from dose escalation zzso zzso zzso as boost achieves superior tumor control than when used as zzso Stage for stage, both zzso and current zzso regimens achieve similar tumor control rates, in agreement with current clinical zzso zzso zzso with zzso fraction sizes might achieve superior tumor control compared with zzso especially if prostate cancer possesses a high sensitivity to dose zzso zzso if the zzso ratio is zzso 

zzso models support the current clinical evidence for equivalent outcomes in localized prostate cancer with either zzso or zzso zzso using current dose zzso However, zzso zzso dose escalation regimens might be able to achieve higher biologically effective doses of zzso in comparison to zzso and hence improved zzso This advantage over zzso would be amplified should prostate cancer possess a high sensitivity to dose zzso zzso a low zzso zzso as the current evidence zzso
