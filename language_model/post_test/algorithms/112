The absolute force sensitivities of zzso zzso comprised of atomic force zzso or zzso cantilevers with zzso attached to their zzso ends are zzso The force sensitivities are zzso through reference to accurate zzso forces, the zzso of which are described in zzso Furthermore, the absolute accuracy of a common zzso force zzso zzso known as the zzso noise method, is zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso noise method can be applied with great success to zzso probe zzso in air and in liquid to yield force zzso with relative standard uncertainties below zzso zzso to combine the zzso determination of the zzso force sensitivity with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso noise spectrum to zzso zzso estimates of the displacement sensitivity and spring constant are also zzso
