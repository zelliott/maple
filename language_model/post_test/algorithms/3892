Each edge in a weighted colored tree has a zzso weight corresponding to the colors of its incident zzso The sum of these weights is the weight of the zzso zzso of zzso are known to find minimal zzso that is, to assign colors from a given finite set to the zzso of a tree so as to minimize the weight of the zzso In this paper generating functions are used to find the number of minimal zzso and the average weight of each edge over such zzso also using zzso zzso zzso to evolutionary trees are zzso
