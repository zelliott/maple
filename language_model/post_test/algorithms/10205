zzso how communities assemble is a key challenge in zzso zzso hypotheses suggest that plant traits within communities should show divergence to reflect strategies to reduce competition or convergence to reflect strong selection for the environmental conditions zzso Further hypotheses suggest that plant traits related to productivity show convergence within communities, but those related to zzso show zzso Data on functional diversity zzso of 12 traits from 30 communities ranging from zzso fields, zzso and grazed zzso to zzso and zzso were employed to test this using zzso tests and correlation and zzso zzso No traits showed consistent significant convergence or divergence in functional zzso When correlated to measures of the environment, the most common pattern was for functional diversity to decline (7 out of 12 zzso and the degree of convergence (7 out of 12 zzso to increase as the levels of productivity zzso as primary zzso soil nitrogen release and vegetation zzso and zzso zzso zzso or a relationship between functional diversity and the environment was not seen for a number of important traits, such as zzso and zzso which are considered as key zzso of zzso zzso The analysis indicates that taking into account functional diversity within a system may be a necessary part of predicting the relationship between plant traits and zzso function, and that this may be of particular importance within less productive and less disturbed zzso
