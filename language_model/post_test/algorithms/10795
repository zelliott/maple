This paper presents a feature extraction procedure zzso for a zzso interface zzso application where features are extracted from the electroencephalogram zzso recorded from subjects performing right and left motor zzso Two neural networks zzso are trained to perform zzso predictions for the zzso zzso data, where one zzso is trained on right motor imagery and the other on left motor zzso Features are derived from the power zzso zzso of the prediction error or the power of the predicted zzso All features are calculated from a window through which all predicted signals zzso zzso of features is achieved due to the zzso differences of the zzso signals and each zzso specialization to the type of data on which it is zzso Linear zzso analysis zzso is used for zzso This zzso is tested on three subjects zzso and zzso accuracy zzso rates range between zzso and zzso The approach compares favorably to a well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso and also a linear zzso model based prediction zzso
