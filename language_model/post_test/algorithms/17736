The influence of external interference on zzso source reconstruction by zzso zzso techniques was zzso In our analysis, we assume that the interference has the following two zzso First, it is additive and zzso with brain zzso Second, its zzso behavior can be characterized by a few distinct activities, and as a result, the zzso zzso of the interference has a few distinctly large singular zzso zzso the interference can be modeled as a zzso zzso Under these zzso our analysis shows that the zzso zzso techniques are insensitive to interference when its spatial singular zzso are so different from a lead field zzso of a brain source that the generalized zzso between these two zzso is much smaller than zzso Four types of zzso examples zzso this conclusion are zzso
