The authors present an exact zzso study of short zzso walks in two as well as in three dimensions that addresses the question, zzso is the shortest walk for which the existence of all the three zzso zzso zzso and the zzso be zzso Even though they could easily demonstrate the zzso and the zzso phase from free energy considerations, they could demonstrate the existence of a zzso temperature only by using a zzso form for the distribution of zzso zzso That even such short walks have a zzso behavior is an unexpected result of this zzso
