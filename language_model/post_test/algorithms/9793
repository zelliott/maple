An zzso for computing the probabilities of families of biological sequences is zzso The zzso is zzso to many problems of zzso in particular, for computing the sensitivity of seeds while searching for local similarities in zzso and while zzso the reliability of search for clusters of regulatory zzso This zzso can be also used for distribution of probabilities described by different models, for example, zzso zzso and hidden zzso zzso The zzso is based on the description of probabilities distribution as well as on the description of the family of sequences using the finite zzso Then the problem of calculation of probabilities is reduced to zzso of the proper generalized statistical zzso The zzso can be applied not only to biological sequences but also to symbol sequences of any zzso
