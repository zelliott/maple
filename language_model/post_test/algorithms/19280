We are developing a zzso detection zzso system to identify zzso clusters zzso automatically on full field digital zzso zzso The zzso system includes six zzso zzso image zzso zzso of zzso candidates; false positive zzso reduction for individual zzso regional zzso and zzso reduction for clustered zzso At the stage of zzso reduction for individual zzso a truncated zzso error function was used to improve the efficiency and zzso of the training of an artificial neural network in our zzso system for zzso At the stage of zzso reduction for clustered zzso zzso features and features derived from the artificial neural network zzso were extracted from each zzso zzso linear zzso analysis zzso was used to select the zzso An zzso zzso was then used to differentiate clustered zzso from zzso A data set of 96 cases with 192 images was collected at the University of zzso This data set contained 96 zzso of which 28 clusters were proven by biopsy to be zzso and 68 were proven to be zzso The data set was separated into two independent data sets for training and testing of the zzso system in a zzso zzso When one data set was used to train and validate the zzso neural network zzso in our zzso system, the other data set was used to evaluate the detection zzso With the use of a truncated error zzso the training of CNN could be accelerated and the zzso performance was zzso The CNN in combination with an zzso zzso could substantially reduce zzso with a small zzso in zzso By using the zzso receiver operating characteristic methodology, it was found that our zzso system can achieve a zzso sensitivity of 70, 80, and 90 % at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For zzso performance zzso a sensitivity of 70, 80, and 90 % can be achieved at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also used a data set of 216 zzso negative for clustered zzso to further estimate the zzso rate of our zzso zzso The corresponding zzso rates were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso detection when negative zzso were used for zzso of zzso zzso
