We present a general purpose zzso of variable length zzso zzso zzso to fixed order zzso models, these models are not restricted to a zzso uniform zzso Rather, by examining the training data, a model is constructed that fits higher order zzso zzso where such contexts exist, while using lower order zzso zzso zzso As both theoretical and experimental results show, these models are capable of capturing rich signals from a modest amount of training data, without the use of hidden zzso
