zzso waves are distinct hallmarks of both the secondary and zzso structures of zzso proteins that are immobilized in membrane zzso or embedded in zzso zzso We present a simple, zzso approach that exploits the zzso of the zzso and average of zzso waves to determine the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, we describe the application of this method for the structural determination of a zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso that is involved in calcium regulation of cardiac zzso When combined with high-resolution solid-state zzso data, this method can serve as a fast route for determining the zzso of zzso membrane proteins zzso in zzso zzso
