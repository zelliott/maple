zzso energy restriction zzso reduces risk of spontaneous zzso cancer in zzso In humans, zzso in zzso years seems to reduce risk of zzso breast zzso zzso of zzso are required to develop acceptable zzso regimens for breast cancer zzso We therefore examined markers of zzso in the breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso overweight or obese women at moderately increased risk of breast cancer zzso risk, 1 in 6 to 1 in 3) ages between 35 and 45 were randomly allocated to zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or asked to continue their normal eating patterns zzso zzso 9) for one zzso zzso zzso of the breast and abdominal fat were taken before and after the zzso zzso was extracted from whole zzso and breast zzso (by laser capture zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso plasma and urine samples were collected before and after intervention, and zzso profiles were generated using gas zzso zzso zzso was associated with significant reductions in weight zzso zzso zzso and in zzso of serum zzso of breast cancer risk zzso zzso total and zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso In both abdominal and breast zzso as well as isolated breast zzso cells, genes involved in zzso and zzso synthesis pathways (including zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso We conclude that reduced expressions of genes in the zzso metabolism and zzso pathways are zzso in breast tissue following zzso and these may represent targets for zzso zzso as effective zzso zzso
