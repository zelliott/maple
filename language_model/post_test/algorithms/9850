Increased zzso zzso is associated with cardiovascular zzso Its zzso in individual patient management, however, is limited due to lack of reliable zzso We developed a method to measure zzso zzso by means of local pulse wave zzso zzso using multiple zzso ultrasound and the zzso notch zzso rather than the zzso foot zzso as zzso zzso 

zzso foot and zzso notch were determined in 14 simultaneously recorded zzso zzso obtained in young and older participants zzso age 26 and 59 zzso Linear zzso was performed on zzso position and zzso point, resulting in a local zzso estimate, either zzso or zzso 

zzso at about mean zzso pressure, had a better zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso The expected difference in zzso between the two age categories was identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso zzso showed a significant correlation with relative zzso zzso zzso zzso and the local zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso and suitable measure of zzso zzso it has a good zzso discriminates well between age groups, and zzso with local zzso zzso does not require additional assessment of distance or local pulse zzso Furthermore, zzso is measured locally, at zzso zzso pressure, thereby better reflecting the effective zzso zzso which determines the load the left zzso is subjected to as it zzso zzso
