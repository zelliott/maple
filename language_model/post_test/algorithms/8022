zzso has received widespread attention due to its unique electronic zzso Much of the research conducted so far has focused on electron mobility, which is determined by scattering from charged zzso and other zzso However, another important zzso the quantum zzso has been largely zzso Here, we report a direct measurement of the quantum zzso of zzso as a function of gate potential using a zzso zzso zzso The quantum zzso has a zzso minimum at the zzso point and a linear increase on both sides of the minimum with relatively small zzso Our findings -- which are not predicted by theory for ideal zzso -- suggest that charged zzso also influences the quantum zzso We also measured the zzso in zzso solutions at different zzso zzso and our results strongly indicate that the long-standing puzzle about the zzso zzso in zzso zzso has a quantum zzso
