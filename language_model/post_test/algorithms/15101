Our aim was to determine the accuracy of quantitative and qualitative findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of differential analysis of small zzso solitary pulmonary zzso and to compare the CT diagnosis with the results of zzso needle zzso zzso We assessed a consecutive series of 109 patients with 66 zzso or 45 benign pulmonary zzso before zzso and surgery with contrast and high resolution zzso zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso were classified as small when equal to or smaller than 15 zzso and large when larger than 15 zzso zzso accuracy of CT qualitative evaluation was zzso for large zzso and zzso for small zzso zzso was zzso for small zzso zzso for large zzso zzso regular zzso were observed in 28 zzso zzso while except for two cases zzso inner zzso were absent or irregular in zzso zzso zzso accuracy was zzso for small zzso and zzso for large zzso zzso zzso are more frequent in Italy than in the US where the prevalence of zzso zzso in benign zzso reduces the specificity of quantitative CT zzso We propose that certain geographic areas would benefit from zzso in place of zzso in managing lung zzso equal to or less than zzso zzso
