We describe a study of the discrimination of early melanoma from common and zzso zzso using fiber zzso diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the wavelength range 550 to 1000 zzso are obtained using zzso core zzso fibers arranged in a zzso geometry with a single zzso spacing of 470 zzso zzso are collected at specific locations on 120 pigmented zzso selected by clinicians as possible melanoma, including 64 zzso diagnosed as zzso These locations are carried through to the zzso diagnosis, permitting a zzso localized comparison with the corresponding zzso The variations in zzso between groups of zzso with different diagnoses are examined and reduced to features suitable for zzso zzso A zzso distinguishing between benign and zzso zzso performs with zzso of between zzso and zzso zzso between pairs of the group common zzso zzso zzso in zzso melanoma, and invasive melanoma show better or similar performance than the zzso zzso and analysis provides evidence that different spectral features are needed for each pair of zzso This indicates that multiple zzso systems are likely to be required to distinguish between melanoma and similar zzso
