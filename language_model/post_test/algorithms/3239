This paper mainly introduces the design of digital scanning zzso zzso for medical zzso ultrasound zzso Fast modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complete coordinate conversion is used to increase the speed of zzso scanning zzso zzso is used as the kernel module to control data zzso related circuits and relevant zzso working, and to accomplish data zzso With the advantages of simple structure, nice flexibility and zzso it zzso the demand for real-time displaying in this zzso Finally, the original polar coordinate image is transformed to zzso coordinate zzso image through coordinate zzso The system performances have been validated by the experimental zzso
