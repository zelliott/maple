This paper describes an automatic mechanism for drawing zzso zzso We apply zzso zzso to find effective placement of stations with a good line layout and to label the map zzso A number of metrics are zzso which are used in a weighted sum to find a fitness value for a layout of the zzso A hill climbing zzso is used to reduce the fitness value, and find improved map zzso To avoid local zzso we apply zzso techniques to the zzso hill climber moves both stations and clusters when finding improved zzso We show the method applied to a number of zzso zzso and describe an empirical study that provides some quantitative evidence that zzso zzso maps can help users to find routes more efficiently than either published maps or zzso zzso Moreover, we have found that, in these cases, study subjects indicate a preference for zzso maps over the zzso
