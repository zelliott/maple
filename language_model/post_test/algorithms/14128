The zzso efficiency of the arm stroke zzso was estimated in a group of 63 male and female subjects zzso years of zzso of good technical zzso swimming the front crawl at zzso zzso zzso was calculated on the basis of values of speed zzso stroke frequency zzso and zzso distance zzso calculated from measures of arm length and elbow angle during the zzso as proposed by zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso In both zzso the distance covered per stroke zzso zzso zzso is similar before zzso reaches its maximum at about 20 years of age and then steadily zzso zzso is significantly larger in males than in females and this difference tended to offset the differences in Ds so that zzso is almost the same in male and female swimmers of the same age group and swimming zzso about zzso before zzso zzso at about 20 years of age and about zzso in swimmers older than 40 years of zzso The development of zzso and Ds during the life span is similar to the changes in muscle strength and power reported in the literature suggesting that these parameters are related to the ability to exert forceful (and hence zzso strokes in zzso Since the energy cost of swimming zzso depends essentially on zzso and the zzso resistance zzso these data further suggest that differences in C between genders are mainly to be attributed to differences in zzso whereas differences across ages can be attributed also to changes in zzso
