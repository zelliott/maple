A programmed complex has been developed to determine the optimum radiation protocols which include the optimum positions of intersection centers of central axes of radiation beams, the optimum directions of radiation, the optimum time of zzso zzso the optimum radiation protocols has shown that variations in the positions of intersection centers of radiation beams play a crucial role in the targeted formation of the optimum dose zzso To choose the optimum radiation protocols for central lung cancer is a challenge whose solution depends on the initial position of intersection centers of radiation beams, which give rise to zzso solution of emergency zzso An effective radiation protocol has been chosen among its varieties by making a zzso assessment of gross characteristics of dose fields in the lung zzso
