In this article we propose a new framework for studying zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso Diversity dependence causes diversification to zzso at the end of an zzso radiation but also plays a key role in the initial pulse of zzso In particular, key innovations (which in our definition include novel traits as well as new zzso may cause decoupling of the zzso dynamics of the innovative zzso from the zzso dynamics of its ancestral zzso We present a zzso zzso method to test for decoupling of diversity dependence using molecular zzso The method, which can handle incomplete zzso identifies when the decoupling took place and which diversification parameters are zzso We illustrate our approach by applying it to the molecular zzso of the North American zzso of the zzso tribe zzso zzso extant species, of which 4 are zzso Two diversification rate shifts were previously identified for this zzso our analysis shows that the first, positive shift can be associated with decoupling of two zzso zzso from the other zzso zzso while we argue that the second, negative shift can be attributed to zzso being zzso The latter explanation yields zzso extinction rates, in contrast to previous zzso Our framework offers a new perspective on zzso new environments and novel traits zzso zzso and diversity dependence zzso zzso cannot be considered zzso
