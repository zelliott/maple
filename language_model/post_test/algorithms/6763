The general zzso zzso is known to be an zzso zzso zzso Although zzso also blocks zzso sodium channels in a local zzso fashion, little information exists on the molecular pharmacology of this zzso We measured the effects of zzso on sodium zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso rat skeletal muscle sodium channels were expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid substitution site is part of the zzso local zzso zzso The effect of zzso was measured in zzso expressing zzso or zzso sodium channels using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blocked sodium channels in a local zzso fashion, exhibiting zzso blockade zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shift of the zzso zzso the parameters of these actions were strongly modified by zzso of the zzso local zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso showed greater zzso zzso but less zzso zzso 

zzso interacts with sodium channels in a local zzso fashion, including sharing a binding site with commonly used clinical local zzso
