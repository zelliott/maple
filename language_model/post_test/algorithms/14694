A kind of data zzso zzso for sensor networks based on zzso zzso and virtual landmark zzso within clusters is proposed in this zzso zzso zzso zzso existing in data obtained by the same zzso in sequential zzso can be zzso Then sensor networks zzso will be zzso zzso zzso landmarks in clusters can be established based on cluster zzso zzso in clusters can be realized by combining a greedy zzso and a flooding zzso zzso a global structure tree based on cluster heads will be zzso During the course of data transmissions from zzso to cluster heads and from cluster heads to sink, the spatial zzso existing in the data will be zzso Only part of the raw data needs to be transmitted from zzso to sink, and all raw data can be recovered in the sink based on a zzso code and part of the raw zzso zzso zzso energy can be saved, largely because transmission of redundant data can be zzso As a result the overall performance of the sensor network can obviously be zzso
