We present a fully automatic methodology for the detection of the zzso border zzso in human coronary artery in zzso zzso zzso zzso A robust border detection is achieved by means of a holistic interpretation of the detection problem where the target object, zzso the media layer, is considered as part of the whole vessel in the image and all the relationships between zzso are zzso A fairly general framework exploiting zzso tissue characterization as well as contextual information on the zzso and the appearance of the zzso is zzso The methodology is zzso validated through an exhaustive comparison with both zzso zzso on two challenging databases and zzso compared with state-of-the-art methods for the detection of the zzso in zzso The obtained averaged values for the mean zzso distance and the percentage of area difference are zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the proposed methodology to clinical practice is also zzso
