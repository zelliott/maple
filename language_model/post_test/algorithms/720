Following rational, zzso drug design strategies, already two generations of zzso zzso soft zzso have been zzso During their development, a large number of zzso affinity zzso data for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso is a major zzso of therapeutic potential for zzso because zzso from different zzso and even from different species seem to be essentially the zzso A quantitative analysis of these zzso data obtained from more than sixty structures was zzso Within both generations of soft steroids, good zzso affinity could be achieved with adequate substitution at the sensitive zzso or zzso zzso For soft steroids that satisfy the main binding criteria at the zzso zzso an indicator variable for a structural element zzso or zzso and a zzso zzso zzso as measured by log zzso account for a large portion of the zzso in zzso Following a classical, zzso analysis, a zzso model that accounts for close to zzso of the zzso in the log zzso data could be built using only these two zzso According to these data, zzso binding affinity at the zzso is dramatically increased by zzso or zzso and it also tends to increase with increasing zzso
