A multiple time scales landscape model is presented that reveals structures of performance dynamics that were not resolved in the traditional power law analysis of motor zzso It shows the zzso of separate processes during and between practice sessions that evolve in two independent dimensions characterized by time scales that differ by about an order of zzso Performance along the slow persistent dimension of learning improves often as much and sometimes more during rest zzso consolidation and/or insight generation zzso than during a practice session zzso In contrast, the process characterized by the fast, transient dimension of adaptation reverses direction between practice sessions, thereby significantly degrading performance at the beginning of the next practice session zzso zzso The theoretical model fits zzso and zzso the data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Learning and zzso Journal of zzso zzso 10, zzso classic learning study of mirror tracing and other averaged and individual data sets, and provides a new account of the processes of change in adaptation and zzso
