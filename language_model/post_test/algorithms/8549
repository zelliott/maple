zzso dimensions always involve some averaging with respect to the given geometrical zzso The classical geometrical description includes overly detailed geometrical information, rendering the precise zzso of equations zzso The problems associated with the functionality and growth of biological systems according to their observed geometrical shape require a specific zzso 

The material consists of 50 zzso 4th to 8th month of fetal life, length zzso zzso zzso The material was examined using the zzso method, computer image analysis zzso Scion for Windows 1998, and Elf zzso zzso and zzso zzso Various transformations were zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso zzso geometrical zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis employs the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso vein net maintains the fetal character, with a large number of zzso also present in zzso The size of zzso branches amounts to zzso zzso The reduction of some of the zzso during the early stages of evolution comes from an increase in the zzso zzso During the 4th month, the zzso dimension is zzso increasing to zzso at month zzso Rapid growth of the zzso dimension has been observed until the 6th and 7th zzso This means an increased complexity level and feed volume in the zzso 

zzso constitute a promising and effective tool to estimate the structures of brain zzso The zzso dimension varies during the fetal zzso This shows the close correspondence between the structure and zzso
