In the search for appropriate zzso conditions to separate zzso screening strategies are often applied because achieving zzso zzso is zzso These screenings aim to find relatively fast suitable separation zzso However, the definition of these screenings mostly relies on years of expertise or on the zzso and zzso investigation of a broad range of zzso zzso and mobile zzso A large amount of data is generated using either zzso In this study, the obtained data are investigated in a systematic manner and zzso systems are searched zzso For this case study, 48 zzso systems were characterized by the zzso of 29 zzso zzso data analysis was performed by means of projection zzso revealing the different zzso patterns of the zzso zzso To zzso the zzso correlation zzso and zzso distances were zzso These results were zzso in zzso maps to allow investigating the degree of zzso between the zzso These maps proved to be a helpful tool in the selection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed next to evaluate the zzso of similar systems, zzso with an equivalent zzso zzso sequences were extracted and compared with the initial, defined by direct data zzso In a final section, selection of dissimilar systems was done by means of the zzso and Stone zzso The systems selected by the applied techniques did not necessarily perform better than the selection by direct data zzso Nevertheless, high cumulative success rates are achieved for the selected combinations, due to the broad zzso the high individual success rates and the zzso of the zzso zzso
