This paper presents an improved zzso zzso zzso circuit for robust zzso control of zzso flexible structures in zzso zzso The circuit acts as a zzso filter and provides better zzso strain signals with wider sensing bandwidth and higher zzso zzso An zzso zzso control is used to compensate for the structural zzso using the strain signals from the zzso The proposed scheme is implemented in a zzso suspension of a commercial zzso hard disk zzso Experimental results show improvements of 50% and zzso in the zzso suppression at zzso and zzso respectively, compared to the conventional zzso zzso
