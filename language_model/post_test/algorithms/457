In this paper we study the effect of material zzso on the performance of a zzso zzso transform zzso The spectrum is thus evaluated zzso using a test spectrum zzso The obtained zzso results show that the classical technique for zzso zzso compensation, usually used with a zzso zzso cannot be efficiently used with wedge zzso as it is limited to the cases of weak zzso The error in this technique is thus evaluated in different cases and a new zzso technique is proposed to overcome this zzso We also notice shrinkage in the zzso spread in the spatial domain in contradiction with the normal zzso effect in a zzso zzso
