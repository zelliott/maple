In the Australian kidney paired donation zzso program matching is based on acceptable zzso whereas deceased donor zzso zzso patients are allocated zzso based on zzso zzso matching zzso zzso we compared waiting time for a zzso match to the waiting time on the zzso and the occurrence of matching in the zzso for patients who were registered in both zzso Data on first dialysis, matches on the zzso zzso program entry, matches and transplant dates were assessed in 26 zzso recipients of the Australian zzso There were 22 recipients who were listed in the zzso and received kidney transplants by zzso Time on dialysis until zzso transplantation was zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven patients had never been matched with a deceased donor zzso time 345 zzso 237 zzso and 11 had been matched on average 3 zzso 5 times zzso time zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso zzso never zzso but did not progress to transplantation because of positive zzso or class II zzso zzso Mean time from registration in the zzso program until kidney transplantation was 153 zzso 92 days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allocation using the acceptable mismatch approach is effective in identifying suitable live donors for some recipients within a relatively short zzso
