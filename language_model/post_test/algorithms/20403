We present a simplified zzso neural network model of the primary visual zzso with separate zzso and modifiable zzso as well as zzso synaptic zzso Random as well as natural image stimuli drive the weight adaptation which follows zzso learning rules stabilized with constant norm and constant sum zzso The simulations consider the development of orientation and zzso dominance maps under different conditions concerning stimulus patterns and lateral zzso With random input patterns realistic orientation maps with zzso zzso mostly develop and plastic lateral zzso zzso into zzso hat type structures on zzso Using natural zzso images as input patterns, realistic orientation maps develop as well and the lateral zzso profiles of the cortical zzso represent the two point correlations of the input image zzso
