zzso of the hip may be treated by zzso but surgeons report variable results, and there is no consensus regarding which method to use in choosing the type of zzso The authors defined three zzso measures of hip zzso zzso point zzso joint space, and contact zzso and developed a two-dimensional frontal plane model to zzso joint zzso over the joint range of motion during normal activities of daily zzso The zzso measures were calculated for 38 patients who had undergone zzso at least 5 years zzso The authors calculated the measures throughout a functional range of motion after 13 zzso zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis determined which, if any, of the three measures, in conjunction with other clinical zzso correctly predicted zzso The average values for the characteristic point zzso joint space, and contact region measures ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior between two of the three measures zzso space and contact zzso and zzso angle were observed, suggesting these two would be the most useful in predicting an optimal zzso The most significant independent variable predicting clinical outcome was the joint space zzso This supports the potential of an zzso approach for determining the best angle for a hip zzso
