An zzso to calculate zzso signals of a zzso pulse sequence with arbitrary position dependent zzso and B1 fields taking into account relaxation and zzso is zzso The zzso pulse sequence consists of an initial zzso pulse zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and a series of L zzso zzso zzso with arbitrary zzso and zzso The calculation is exact and takes into account all the zzso pathways that contribute to the signal on a zzso spatial zzso The theoretical prediction is verified zzso using a high field zzso zzso zzso The zzso was implemented in a simulation program in order to zzso the design of an zzso MR zzso zzso that is used for characterization of vessel wall zzso Measured data obtained with the zzso are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the zzso
