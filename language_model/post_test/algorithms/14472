The range of scene depths that appear focused in an image is known as the depth of field zzso Conventional cameras are limited by a fundamental zzso between depth of field and zzso ratio zzso For a dark scene, the zzso of the lens must be opened up to maintain zzso which causes the zzso to zzso Also, today's cameras have zzso that zzso to a single slab that is perpendicular to the optical zzso In this paper, we present an imaging system that enables one to control the zzso in new and powerful zzso Our approach is to vary the position and/or orientation of the image detector during the integration time of a single zzso Even when the detector motion is very small zzso of zzso a large range of scene depths (several zzso is zzso both in and out of zzso Our zzso camera uses a zzso to translate the detector along the optical axis during image zzso Using this device, we demonstrate four applications of flexible zzso First, we describe extended zzso where a large depth range is captured with a very wide zzso zzso zzso but with nearly zzso zzso zzso zzso a captured image with a single blur kernel gives an image with extended zzso and high zzso Next, we show the capture of images with zzso zzso For instance, near and far objects can be zzso with zzso while objects in between are severely zzso Third, we show that our camera can capture images with zzso zzso zzso zzso without tilting the image zzso Finally, we demonstrate how our camera can be used to realize zzso zzso We believe flexible zzso imaging can open a new creative dimension in photography and lead to new capabilities in scientific imaging, vision, and zzso
