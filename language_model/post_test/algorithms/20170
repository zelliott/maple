A zzso network is one of the most important zzso zzso This paper describes an automatic system that performs its detection in zzso zzso The proposed system involves a set of sequential zzso First, a zzso zzso is applied to the zzso zzso Then, a bank of directional filters and a connected component analysis are used in order to detect the zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, features are extracted from the detected network and used to train an zzso zzso to zzso each zzso regarding the presence of the zzso zzso The zzso was tested on a zzso of 200 medically zzso images from the database of Hospital Pedro zzso zzso achieving a sensitivity zzso zzso and a specificity zzso zzso
