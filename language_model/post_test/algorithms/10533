zzso options for patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso are zzso There is emerging evidence that the growth of cancer cells may be altered by very low levels of electromagnetic fields modulated at specific zzso 

A zzso zzso phase zzso study was performed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the zzso administration of very low levels of electromagnetic fields zzso modulated at zzso zzso in 41 patients with advanced zzso and limited therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso treatments were administered until disease progression or zzso Imaging studies were performed every 8 zzso The primary efficacy end point was zzso survival zzso zzso Secondary efficacy end points were zzso survival and overall zzso 

Treatment was well tolerated and there were no zzso grade 2, 3 or 4 zzso In all, 14 patients zzso had stable disease for more than 6 zzso Median zzso survival was zzso months zzso zzso zzso and median overall survival was zzso months zzso zzso zzso There were three partial and one near complete zzso 

Treatment with zzso administered zzso electromagnetic fields is safe, well zzso and shows evidence of zzso effects in patients with advanced zzso
