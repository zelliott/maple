zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profiling with zzso has been demonstrated as a more effective method of cancer diagnosis and treatment than the traditional zzso or clinical zzso based zzso Recently, the discovery of a category of small zzso zzso named zzso zzso provides another promising method of cancer zzso zzso play a critical role in the zzso process by functioning either as zzso or as tumor zzso Here, we apply a neural based zzso zzso zzso to zzso broad types of zzso based on their zzso expression zzso As the zzso expression data usually have high zzso particle swarm zzso zzso is used for selecting important zzso that contribute to the discrimination of different cancer zzso Experimental results on the multiple human zzso show that zzso zzso performs consistently well on all the data, and the zzso accuracy is better than or comparable to that of the other popular zzso Also, the selection of zzso zzso can further improve the performance of zzso and provide meaningful insights into cancer zzso
