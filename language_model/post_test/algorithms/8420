Scientific studies typically treat data by studying effects of zzso Clinical therapy typically treats patients on a subject specific zzso zzso scientific and clinical attempts to help patients are often not zzso The purposes of this study were zzso to identify subject and group specific locomotion characteristics zzso using time discrete and time continuous data and zzso to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the two zzso zzso and kinetic gait pattern of 13 female subjects walking in dress shoes with different heel heights zzso 37, 54 and 85 zzso were zzso The results of this study showed that subject specific gait characteristics could be better identified with the time continuous than with the time discrete zzso Thus, the time continuous approach using artificial networks is an effective tool for identifying subject and group specific locomotion zzso
