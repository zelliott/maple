zzso anatomy zzso has introduced the idea of anatomical structures being transformed by zzso zzso on groups of zzso Among these geometric structures, landmarks and image outlines in CA are shown to be singular solutions of a partial differential equation that is called the zzso zzso zzso A recently discovered momentum map for singular solutions of zzso yields their zzso zzso zzso which in turn provides a complete zzso of the landmarks by their zzso positions and zzso The momentum map provides an zzso between landmarks (and zzso for images and singular zzso solutions of the zzso zzso This zzso suggests a new zzso paradigm for CA, as well as new data zzso
