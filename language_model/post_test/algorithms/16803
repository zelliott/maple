Attention deficit zzso disorder is a complex brain disorder which is usually difficult to zzso As a result many literature reports about the increasing rate of zzso of zzso disorder with other types of brain zzso There is also a risk of normal children to be associated with zzso if practical diagnostic criteria are not zzso To this end we propose a decision support system in diagnosing of zzso disorder through brain zzso zzso zzso of 10 children participated in this study, 7 of them were diagnosed with zzso disorder and remaining 3 children are normal zzso Our main goal of this zzso is to present a supporting diagnostic tool that uses signal processing for feature selection and machine learning zzso for zzso for a feature selection we propose information zzso which is based on zzso and mutual information zzso We propose a zzso zzso criterion for selecting distinct (most zzso features of two groups as well as a zzso zzso for efficiently updating the training zzso Further, support zzso machine zzso trained and tested for identification of robust marker of zzso patterns for accurate diagnosis of zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of the proposed approach provides higher accuracy in diagnostic process of zzso disorder than the few currently available zzso
