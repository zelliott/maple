A new zzso technique is zzso It regards the zzso plot as the integral of the retention function, and performs zzso by creating and then zzso the zzso zzso The reasoning behind this approach is that in producing the zzso plot, both the content function and the integral of the input function are divided by the input function zzso the blood zzso and that this has the effect of producing data equivalent to that which would be produced if the input function did not vary zzso if there were a constant blood level of zzso The concept was tested against data created by zzso zzso It was able to reproduce retention functions with a variety of different shapes that were used to produce the artificial zzso zzso The new zzso method is sufficiently simple to be used in either a database or a spreadsheet and does not require any special program units to be zzso It does not appear to make any assumptions about the data nor the shape of the retention function, and does not appear to be vulnerable to the zzso errors that sometimes occur in zzso zzso
