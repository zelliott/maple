With great biological interest in zzso modifications zzso various approaches have been introduced to identify zzso using zzso Recent developments for zzso identification have focused on an zzso approach that searches zzso zzso for all known and possibly even unknown types of zzso at zzso However, the resulting expanded search space requires much longer search time and also increases the number of false zzso zzso zzso and false zzso zzso true zzso thus creating a bottleneck in high zzso zzso Here we introduce zzso a novel zzso spectral alignment zzso that allows for fast zzso zzso searches with no limitation on the number of modifications per zzso while featuring over an order of magnitude zzso in relation to existing zzso We demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso on human shotgun zzso data where it reveals multiple zzso a wide range of modifications (including zzso and evidence for several putative novel zzso Based on the reported findings, we argue that the efficiency and sensitivity of zzso make it the first zzso search tool with the potential to fully replace conventional restrictive identification of zzso mass zzso zzso
