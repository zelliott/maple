We present a critical analysis of the conformity zzso described in the literature and an evaluation of their field of zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without intensity zzso is based on medical imaging techniques, three-dimensional zzso software, zzso accessories, and zzso zzso It consists of zzso target volumes and critical healthy zzso to select the best combination of zzso This approach allows better adaptation of the zzso to the tumor volume, while limiting zzso of healthy zzso zzso must be developed to evaluate the quality of proposed treatment zzso zzso software provides the dose distribution in each CT section and zzso zzso without really indicating the degree of zzso The conformity index is a complementary tool that attributes a score to a treatment plan or that can compare several treatment plans for the same zzso The future of zzso index in everyday practice therefore remains zzso
