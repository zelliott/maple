This study evaluates zzso stress zzso zzso for zzso cardiac risk assessment with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso stress zzso was used to evaluate 81 patients before zzso zzso zzso Patients were placed into three zzso Group I zzso zzso 31) had normal zzso Group II zzso zzso 25) had resting wall motion abnormalities without zzso changes of zzso Group III zzso zzso 25) had evidence of zzso zzso Patient analysis revealed that of 46 patients with clinical indicators of coronary artery disease zzso only 23 had zzso with zzso zzso Two of 35 patients without clinical indicators of zzso had zzso with zzso zzso 

The 56 patients in group I and II underwent zzso reconstruction without cardiac complications or zzso Of the 25 patients in group III, surgery was deferred in five zzso patients with zzso and three with zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso and four underwent coronary artery bypass zzso zzso after coronary artery bypass zzso included one death from stroke, one aneurysm zzso and two uncomplicated zzso zzso The remaining 16 patients in group III underwent zzso surgery, with three zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso 

Using zzso for zzso assessment of cardiac risk allowed us to operate on 74 of 81 patients being considered for zzso zzso zzso with no operative deaths and a zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso stress zzso has the ability to identify patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and its increased risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Equally important, for patients with clinical indicators of zzso but without zzso zzso no further cardiac evaluation is zzso
