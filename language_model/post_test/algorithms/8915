The problem of determining sample size for testing an upper zzso of a zzso distribution based on samples with multiple detection limits is zzso Two tests, the signed likelihood ratio test and another test based on a pivotal zzso are zzso These tests are very satisfactory in controlling type I error rates and comparable in terms of zzso zzso and R codes for calculating sample sizes for these tests to attain a specified power are zzso It is noted that for guaranteeing a given power, increased sample size is necessary due to the presence of detection limits, and the required sample size goes up as the proportion of zzso goes zzso It is also noted that in the multiple detection limit scenario, zzso determination does not require knowledge of the proportions of zzso that are expected to be below the individual detection zzso rather, what is required is a knowledge of the overall percentage of zzso that is to be expected in the entire zzso zzso calculation is illustrated using a practical zzso
