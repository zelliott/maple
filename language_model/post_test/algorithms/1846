The zzso relationship is fundamental to our understanding of biological systems at all levels, and drives most, if not all, techniques for zzso zzso and treating zzso However, at the tissue level of biological complexity we encounter a gap in the zzso zzso having accumulated an extraordinary amount of detailed information about biological zzso at the cellular and zzso level, we cannot assemble it in a way that explains the zzso complex biological functions these structures zzso To help close this information gap we define here several quantitative zzso features that link tissue structure to its corresponding biological zzso Both zzso images of human tissue samples and zzso images of three-dimensional cultures of human cells are used to compare the accuracy of in zzso culture models with their corresponding human zzso To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on a quantitative comparison of zzso and in zzso zzso Features are calculated from graph theoretical representations of tissue structures and the data are analyzed in the form of zzso and zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso methods, with a goal of zzso between zzso and healthy states of brain, breast, and bone zzso We also show that our techniques can differentiate between the structural organization of native zzso and their corresponding in zzso engineered cell culture zzso
