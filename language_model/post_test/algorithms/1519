zzso studies have shown that loads imposed on the human spine during daily living play a significant role in the onset of low back zzso The loads applied to the zzso spine are shared by a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso and the disc of a zzso motion zzso In zzso it is not practical to determine forces in these structures using experimental zzso zzso models, based on an zzso technique of zzso activities of the trunk muscles, have been proposed to predict forces in the load zzso zzso The mathematical models reported in the literature are based on information collected from a wide variety of sources, of which the subject that takes part in the experiment is only zzso The present study describes techniques developed in our laboratory to collect from the subjects themselves all the data needed for the zzso of a zzso zzso The results demonstrated that back lifting with 0 N (no zzso 90 zzso and 180 N in the hands created maximum external zzso moments respectively of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso disc zzso The corresponding external zzso zzso forces on the disc were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The predicted disc zzso varied from zzso to zzso times the body zzso In comparison to the zzso lifting mode, the dynamic lifting task caused an increase in the disc zzso force ranging from zzso to zzso depending on the load being lifted zzso zzso N for the dynamic mode zzso zzso N for the zzso mode when the subject lifted 90 zzso The salient features of the entire protocol developed by the authors and the need for further improvements are also zzso
