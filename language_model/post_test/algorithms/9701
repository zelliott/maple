Common contemporary practice within the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso community is to evaluate and validate novel zzso on empirical data or simplified simulated zzso zzso data captures the complex characteristics of experimental data, but the optimal or most correct analysis is unknown a zzso therefore, researchers are forced to rely on indirect performance zzso which are of limited zzso In order to achieve fair and complete analysis of competing techniques more exacting metrics are zzso Thus, zzso researchers often evaluate their zzso on simplified simulated data with a known zzso Unfortunately, the conclusions obtained on simulated data are only of value if the data sets are complex enough for results to zzso to true experimental zzso zzso synthetic data should be indistinguishable from empirical data, yet retain a known best zzso 

We have developed a technique for creating realistic synthetic zzso validation sets based on zzso zzso zzso The validation sets are developed by characterizing the salient zzso in sets of empirical zzso zzso Using this technique, several validation sets are constructed with a variety of characteristics present in zzso zzso A case study is then presented to compare the relative accuracy of several alignment zzso using the increased precision afforded by these synthetic data zzso 

These data sets are available for download at zzso
