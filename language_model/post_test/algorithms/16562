zzso either zzso or zzso are responsible for the mental handicap in approximately zzso of all zzso Currently, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used to detect these small aberrations in a routine zzso Although zzso the zzso is low and the degree of zzso is limited to zzso zzso zzso zzso we developed an zzso zzso method, with zzso identified by unique tag zzso allowing the simultaneous analysis of 180 zzso in a single experiment thereby covering all known mental zzso zzso with at least two zzso We screened 120 patients with idiopathic mental zzso In this group we detected 6 aberrations giving a detection rate of zzso consistent with similar zzso In addition we tested zzso patients with mental zzso who were negative for fragile X syndrome and commercially available zzso zzso We found seven zzso zzso in this group zzso rate of zzso thereby illustrating the value of including zzso for zzso zzso syndromes and additional zzso in the zzso regions in targeted screening sets for mental zzso zzso zzso may thus be a good candidate to develop probe sets that rapidly detect copy number changes of disease associated zzso in the human zzso This method may become a valuable tool in a routine diagnostic setting as it is a fast, zzso and relatively low-cost technique providing straightforward results requiring only 125 zzso of zzso zzso
