zzso disease often zzso as a combination of pathological electrical and structural heart zzso The relationship between mechanics and zzso is crucial to our understanding of mechanisms of cardiac zzso and the treatment of cardiac zzso While several technologies exist for describing whole heart zzso studies of cardiac mechanics are often limited to rhythmic patterns or small sections of zzso Here, we present a comprehensive system based on zzso three-dimensional zzso structured light imaging to map surface dynamics of whole heart cardiac zzso Additionally, we introduce a novel zzso zzso zzso based on an zzso zzso framework that forms zzso between consecutive 3-D frames without the use of any zzso zzso By combining our 3-D imaging system with zzso surface zzso we are able to measure cardiac surface mechanics at unprecedented spatial and zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate accurate cardiac deformation at over 200,000 surface points of a rabbit heart recorded at 200 zzso and validate our results on highly contrasting heart motions during normal zzso rhythm, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
