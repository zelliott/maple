zzso is an MR imaging measure of brain tissue integrity and provides an attractive metric for use in zzso clinical zzso The purpose of our study was to use zzso to evaluate the zzso changes in brain tissue integrity in a group of patients with zzso 

zzso patients with zzso starting zzso were zzso serially for 12 zzso zzso zzso and 20 regions of interest from zzso white and gray matter brain tissue were followed zzso Average values within each region of interest were derived for zzso zzso zzso and zzso New zzso black holes were identified at 12 zzso Analysis was performed by using zzso zzso analysis with slope zzso zzso change per zzso as the dependent zzso 

During 1 year, zzso increased in zzso zzso but decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Changes in zzso within zzso zzso were driven by decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and within zzso by decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso A higher zzso within zzso zzso at baseline predicted conversion to zzso black holes at 12 zzso MD was unchanged in both zzso zzso and zzso 

We observed changes in zzso measures during 1 year in both zzso zzso and zzso The zzso results may represent possible zzso within acute zzso and chronic zzso zzso in zzso These results support the use of zzso as a measure of tissue integrity for studies of zzso zzso
