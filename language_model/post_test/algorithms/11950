zzso theories of zzso are widely used to describe physical processes in various biological zzso Although these are well-established theories in zzso situations, it is not clear from the outset that they should work in small systems whose dimensions are comparable to or smaller than the zzso zzso Here, we test the zzso of the zzso approximation in zzso theory by comparing its predictions with those of zzso dynamics zzso For this purpose we use zzso and zzso boundaries and a zzso shape similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso The interior region filled with zzso is assumed to have a high zzso constant, and the exterior region representing protein a low zzso Comparisons of the force on a test zzso obtained with the two methods show that the shielding effect due to zzso is overestimated in zzso theory when the zzso is within a zzso length of the zzso As the zzso gets closer to the boundary, the zzso in force grows zzso The implication for membrane channels, whose zzso are typically smaller than the zzso zzso is that zzso theory cannot be used to obtain reliable estimates of the zzso potential energy and force on an zzso in the channel zzso
