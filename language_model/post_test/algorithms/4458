The zzso beam zzso zzso approach can be applied to model ultrasound propagation in zzso materials and zzso In this article, progress made in extending and applying the zzso beam zzso technique to model the beam fields generated by zzso with flat and focused zzso zzso as well as with circular focused zzso is zzso The refraction of zzso beam fields through curved surfaces is illustrated by calculation results for beam fields generated in curved components during immersion zzso In particular, the following developments are put zzso zzso the use of individually determined sets of zzso to model zzso beam fields with a number of less than ten zzso zzso the application of the zzso representation of zzso zzso to focusing zzso as well as to the problem of transmission through zzso and zzso zzso efficient transient modeling by zzso of zzso zzso zzso
