Second generation zzso zzso zzso for zzso to zzso C virus zzso have a higher specificity and sensitivity than first generation zzso zzso zzso We studied how many zzso blood donors were missed by the zzso how many were false positive, how zzso donors should be dealt with and how the results of the zzso correlate to demographic data and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso 544 northern German blood donors, not zzso for zzso zzso were tested for zzso with zzso and, if zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a licensed supplementary test zzso zzso of the donors were zzso zzso but only zzso of women and zzso of men were zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were very low in donors 18 to 27 years old zzso and zzso and rose with age in women but not in zzso zzso women were significantly more often zzso than zzso The rate of zzso positive zzso results zzso negative in zzso increased with age in both sexes and did not correlate with zzso The zzso distribution was zzso with a different pattern for men and zzso Confirmation of zzso results with zzso was rare when zzso was low and frequent when zzso was zzso zzso screening before introduction of zzso detected one out of six infected zzso To exclude this one infectious donation, 46 zzso donations had to be excluded in zzso Only zzso of the then zzso donors were not detected by zzso zzso zzso in zzso are usually not zzso only 1 out of 66 apparent zzso could be confirmed by zzso suggesting recent zzso zzso zzso of the donor population showed an inconsistent zzso pattern during zzso We conclude that donors should not be excluded from further donations, even on the basis of multiple zzso positive results or on the basis of only one zzso positive zzso zzso prophylaxis may have been a source of infection in some zzso zzso zzso screening should not be discontinued because recent zzso infection can be detected earlier by zzso than by zzso but exclusion limits should be elevated to increase specificity and limit unnecessary exclusion of zzso
