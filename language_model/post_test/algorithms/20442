zzso rate zzso (in zzso rat gut zzso and in zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso have been zzso A zzso model that relates the zzso of the compounds with their zzso was zzso The model considers the zzso process from the zzso zzso as the sum of two zzso in zzso zzso zzso barrier and zzso zzso Even if zzso into the membrane and membrane diffusion are both enhanced for zzso compounds, the zzso rate constant is limited by the zzso zzso To estimate the influence of structural modifications on each property and to establish the role of zzso in controlling in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso activity, the zzso search system is used to construct zzso zzso The structural models, which explain zzso of the total zzso of each zzso property and zzso of each in zzso biological activity, provide an explicit and precise interpretation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results confirm the important role of zzso in controlling zzso as pointed out by the zzso model for the zzso series, and suggest the introduction of electronic factors in order to extend the model to zzso They also justify the mechanism by which zzso are assumed to induce zzso zzso
