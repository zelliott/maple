Proper timing of gene expression requires that zzso factors zzso efficiently locate and bind their target sites within a zzso zzso studies have long proposed that one-dimensional sliding along DNA while simultaneously reading its sequence can accelerate zzso location of target zzso Sliding by zzso and zzso zzso were subsequently zzso More recent theoretical investigations have argued that simultaneous reading and sliding is not possible for zzso without their possessing at least two zzso zzso The tumor zzso zzso has been shown to slide on DNA, and recent experiments have offered structural and single zzso support for a zzso model for the zzso If the model is zzso to zzso then the requirement that zzso be able to read while sliding implies that zzso sites will affect zzso mobility on DNA, which will thus be generally zzso Here, we confirm this prediction with zzso zzso zzso of zzso local zzso on zzso zzso We show how a zzso model accurately predicts the variation in local zzso while a zzso model does zzso We further determine that the best model of zzso binding energy includes terms for zzso zzso with one zzso of zzso zzso binding specifically to a zzso and the other binding zzso to zzso zzso Our work provides evidence that the recognition by zzso of its targets and the timing zzso can depend on its zzso binding properties and its ability to change between multiple modes of zzso in addition to the much zzso effects of zzso zzso
