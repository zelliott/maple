Many zzso programs have been developed to identify enriched regions for a single biological zzso zzso Given that many biological questions are often asked to compare the difference between two different conditions, it is important to develop new programs that address the comparison of two biological zzso zzso Despite several programs designed to address this question, these programs suffer from some zzso such as inability to distinguish whether the identified differential enriched regions are indeed significantly zzso lack of distinguishing binding patterns, and neglect of the zzso between zzso 

In this study, we developed a novel quantitative method for comparing two biological zzso samples, called zzso Our method employs a new global zzso method: zzso empirical zzso zzso correction zzso zzso zzso enriched regions identified from zzso peak calling programs, uses statistical methods to define differential enriched regions, then defines binding zzso zzso pattern information for those differential enriched zzso Our program was tested on a benchmark zzso zzso modifications data used by zzso It was then applied on two study zzso one to identify differential zzso modification sites for zzso of zzso and zzso data in zzso zzso zzso the other to identify differential binding sites for zzso of zzso data in zzso and zzso zzso 

Several advantages of our program include: 1) it considers a control (or zzso zzso 2) it incorporates a novel global zzso zzso zzso empirical zzso correction zzso 3) it provides the binding pattern information among different enriched zzso zzso is implemented in zzso zzso and zzso and has been tested under zzso The R package is available at zzso
