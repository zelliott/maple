A basic problem of zzso systems biology is to zzso gene regulatory networks as a vehicle to design therapeutic intervention strategies to zzso alter network and, therefore, cellular zzso One strain of research has this problem from the perspective of control theory via the design of optimal zzso chain decision zzso mainly in the framework of zzso zzso networks zzso Full zzso assumes that the network is accurately modeled and, to the extent that model zzso is zzso which can be expected for gene regulatory networks zzso to the combination of model complexity and a paucity of zzso data, the designed intervention strategy may perform zzso We desire intervention strategies that do not assume accurate zzso zzso 

This article demonstrates the feasibility of applying zzso zzso control to improve intervention performance in genetic regulatory networks modeled by zzso It shows via simulations that when the network is modeled by a member of a known family of zzso an zzso design can yield improved performance in terms of the average zzso Two zzso are zzso one better suited for zzso random zzso and the other better suited for zzso zzso with low switching probability between the constituent zzso
