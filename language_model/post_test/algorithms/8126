zzso generation is a fundamental attribute of the human mind, but the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying this process remain zzso In this paper, we present a dynamic zzso model for the generation of ideas within a zzso zzso The key hypothesis underlying the model is that ideas emerge naturally from itinerant zzso dynamics in a zzso modular semantic space, and the potential surface underlying this dynamics is itself shaped zzso by task context, ongoing zzso feedback, zzso zzso and short-term synaptic zzso While abstract, the model attempts to capture the interplay between semantic zzso working memory, zzso selection, reinforcement signals, and zzso We show that, once trained on a set of contexts and ideas, the system can rapidly recall stored ideas in familiar zzso and can generate novel ideas by efficient, zzso zzso search in both familiar and unfamiliar zzso We also use a simplified zzso zzso of the model to explore the effect of zzso on idea zzso In particular, we consider how zzso zzso categories in a zzso semantic network can lead to the generation of novel zzso The mapping of the model onto various regions and zzso processes in the brain is also discussed zzso
