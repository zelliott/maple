In this study, the author has designed new verifiable zzso threshold zzso signature zzso The proposed schemes have the following zzso zzso The shadows of the secret distributed by the trusted center can be verified by all of the zzso zzso Even if the number of the zzso member is over the value of the zzso they cannot get the system secret zzso such as the group secret key, and forge other zzso individual zzso zzso zzso The zzso can verify the group signature easily and the zzso time of the group signature is equivalent to that of an individual zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the group signature cannot be zzso
