zzso is a highly selective zzso zzso used for short-term sedation of mechanically zzso zzso The zzso profile of zzso has not been fully characterized in zzso 

This study was designed to compare the zzso responses of six healthy male volunteers during zzso zzso infusions of zzso and zzso A computer-controlled zzso was used to deliver painful heat stimuli to the zzso side of the zzso of the zzso Six sequential zzso stimuli zzso from 41 degrees to 50 degrees zzso were delivered in random zzso The recorded visual analog scale was used to fit an zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso infusions resulted in a right shift of the zzso curve zzso zzso the temperature producing a visual analog scale score of 50% of the zzso effect, from zzso degrees C at baseline to zzso degrees and zzso degrees C during zzso zzso without a change of the zzso of the curve zzso Hill zzso gamma during baseline and zzso Compared to zzso zzso infusions resulted in both a right shift of the zzso curve zzso zzso to zzso degrees zzso and a decrease in the zzso of the curve zzso gamma from zzso during baseline and zzso infusions to zzso during zzso zzso There was no difference in the pain responses between baseline and after recovery from zzso infusions zzso zzso and zzso 

As expected, zzso is not as effective an zzso as the zzso zzso The difference in the quality of the analgesia with zzso may be a reflection of a different mechanism of action or a consequence of the sedative effect of zzso
