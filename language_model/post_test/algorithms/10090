zzso of approximate zzso zzso requires a zzso determination of two unknown zzso m and zzso While the recommended values of zzso in the range of zzso times the standard zzso of the zzso have been shown to be zzso for a wide variety of signals, in certain cases, r values within this prescribed range can lead to an incorrect assessment of the complexity of a given zzso To circumvent this zzso we recently advocated finding the maximum zzso value by assessing all values of r from 0 to 1 and found that the maximum zzso does not always occur within the prescribed range of r zzso Our results indicate that finding the maximum zzso leads to the correct interpretation of a zzso zzso One major zzso however, is that the calculation of all choices of r values is often zzso because of the zzso zzso Our new method, based on a zzso zzso model, overcomes this zzso burden and leads to the automatic selection of the maximum zzso value for any given zzso On the basis of zzso Carlo simulations, we derive general equations that can be used to estimate the maximum zzso with high accuracy for a given value of zzso Application to both synthetic and experimental data confirmed the advantages claimed with the proposed zzso
