The authors analyzed the value of using mean zzso volume zzso as a guide for selecting tests for further evaluation of anemia in hospitalized zzso Of the zzso patients with anemia admitted to the medical service of a teaching hospital over one year, 655 zzso had further diagnostic tests to evaluate the cause of the zzso Within this group of 655 patients, 399 zzso had normal zzso Over half the patients with abnormal serum vitamin zzso zzso or zzso levels, or with low serum iron zzso levels with elevated total zzso capacity zzso did not have the zzso expected according to the zzso of anemia proposed by zzso Furthermore, zzso of patients with evidence of iron zzso had high zzso and about zzso of patients with decreased vitamin B12 levels had low zzso The zzso was quite specific in identifying patients who had low zzso zzso specificity was zzso however, sensitivity was only zzso The zzso was also specific zzso for identifying patients who had low zzso with elevated zzso however, sensitivity was only zzso The zzso was poor in identifying patients with abnormalities of serum vitamin B12 and folate zzso In this study the zzso did not provide sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be a useful criterion for the selection of more definitive tests in the evaluation of anemia in hospitalized zzso
