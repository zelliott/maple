The successful high zzso screening of zzso libraries for a specific biological property is one of the main improvements in drug zzso The virtual molecular filtering and screening relies greatly on quantitative zzso relationship zzso analysis, a mathematical model that zzso the activity of a zzso with molecular zzso zzso models have the potential to reduce the costly failure of drug candidates in advanced zzso stages by filtering zzso libraries, eliminating candidates with a predicted toxic effect and poor zzso profiles, and reducing the number of zzso To obtain a zzso and reliable zzso model, scientists use methods from various fields such as molecular zzso pattern recognition, machine learning or artificial zzso zzso modeling relies on three main steps: molecular structure codification into molecular zzso selection of relevant variables in the context of the analyzed activity, and search of the optimal mathematical model that zzso the molecular zzso with a specific zzso Since a variety of techniques from statistics and artificial intelligence can aid variable selection and model building steps, this review focuses on the evolutionary zzso methods supporting these zzso Thus, this review explains the basic of the genetic zzso and genetic programming as evolutionary zzso approaches, the selection methods for zzso data in zzso the methods to build zzso models, the current evolutionary feature selection methods and applications in zzso and the future trend on the joint or zzso feature selection zzso
