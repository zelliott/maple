zzso server zzso provides a zzso facility for the alignment of multiple protein structures based on zzso coordinate zzso using zzso extension zzso and zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso zzso are possible for zzso zzso zzso Data zzso chains as well as for zzso structures or the combination of the zzso The whole process of generating multiple structure alignments involves three distinct steps, zzso zzso zzso alignment using the zzso algorithm, zzso global zzso of a multiple alignment using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso results using the JOY zzso The server can be used to get multiple alignments for up to 25 protein structural chains with the flexibility of uploading multiple coordinate files and performing multiple structure alignment for zzso zzso zzso For large-scale jobs and local installation of the zzso program, users can download the source code and zzso zzso from the web zzso
