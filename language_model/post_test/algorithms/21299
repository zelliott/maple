A dynamic mathematical model is formulated and used to describe the distribution and transport of fluid and plasma proteins between the zzso zzso space of skin and muscle, and the zzso in the zzso Two descriptions of zzso exchange are zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso leak zzso zzso used in the two hypothetical transport mechanisms are determined based on statistical fitting procedures between simulation predictions and selected experimental zzso These data consist of zzso fluid volume and zzso zzso pressure zzso as a function of zzso pressure for muscle and zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso pressure for zzso The values determined for the transport parameters compare well with data in the zzso The fully determined model is used to simulate zzso conditions of zzso zzso and dehydration, as well as the dynamic response to changes in zzso pressure and zzso administered protein zzso Comparisons between the simulation predictions and experimental data for these various zzso are zzso The plasma leak model appears to provide a better description of zzso zzso
