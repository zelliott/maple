The aim of the present paper is to propose and evaluate an automatically trained zzso boosting detector zzso based on zzso zzso for tracking zzso zzso The proposed method was able to detect correctly zzso of players when applied to the second period of that same game used for training and zzso when applied to a different zzso Furthermore, the analysis of the automatic training using boosting detector revealed general results such as the training time initially increased with the number of figures used, but as more figures were added, the training time zzso Automatic zzso zzso has shown to be a fast and efficient method for selecting image regions for the boosting detector and allowed an improvement in the automatic tracking of zzso zzso
