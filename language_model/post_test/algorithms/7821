The discovery of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso biologically active proteins that do not possess stable secondary and/or zzso zzso came as an unexpected surprise, as the existence of such proteins is in contradiction to the traditional zzso zzso zzso prediction of a zzso predisposition to be zzso zzso is a necessary prerequisite for the further understanding of principles and mechanisms of protein folding and function, and is a key for the zzso of a new structural and functional hierarchy of zzso zzso prediction of zzso has attracted the attention of many researchers, and a number of prediction tools have been zzso zzso of disorder, in turn, are playing major roles in directing laboratory experiments that are leading to the discovery of ever more zzso zzso and thereby leading to a positive feedback loop in the investigation of these zzso In this review of zzso for intrinsic disorder zzso the basic concepts of various prediction methods for zzso are zzso the strengths and shortcomings of many of the methods are zzso and the difficulties and directions of future development of zzso prediction techniques are zzso
