Most biological sequences contain zzso biased segments in which one or more zzso types are significantly zzso The function and evolution of these segments are poorly zzso Usually, all types of zzso biased segments are masked and ignored during sequence zzso However, it has been shown for a number of proteins that biased segments that contain zzso acids with similar chemical properties are involved in a variety of molecular functions and human zzso A detailed large-scale analysis of the functional implications and evolutionary conservation of different zzso biased segments requires a sensitive method capable of detecting zzso types of compositional zzso 

We present zzso a novel sensitive method for the detection of zzso biased segments composed of a zzso set of zzso zzso zzso uses the discrete scan statistics that provides a highly accurate correction for multiple tests to zzso zzso estimates of the significance of each zzso biased zzso The method can take into account global compositional bias when computing zzso estimates of the significance of local zzso zzso is zzso against zzso zzso and CAST zzso We also use zzso to show that groups of proteins with the same biological function are significantly associated with particular types of zzso biased zzso
