zzso rhythm mechanisms involve zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso We present the application of efficient, zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso systems of differential equation models of zzso zzso into zzso accurate zzso zzso We apply and validate our zzso phase zzso technique on zzso and zzso zzso systems, obtaining zzso of 9 - zzso over conventional zzso zzso with insignificant loss of zzso for single zzso being synchronized by zzso light zzso Further, we apply the zzso to simulate a system of 400 coupled zzso zzso achieving zzso of zzso and accurately zzso synchronization and zzso phenomena amongst the zzso We also present the use of zzso phase zzso for these zzso systems, and zzso insights into zzso timing effects directly provided by our zzso zzso
