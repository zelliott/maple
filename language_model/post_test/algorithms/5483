The existing zzso for the minimum zzso cost network flow problems mainly focus on the zzso zzso To handle both the zzso and the zzso problem in the same way, especially the problems with dense zzso a deterministic zzso zzso is proposed in this zzso The zzso is derived from an application of the zzso and zzso barrier zzso It consists of two major steps: one is to find a feasible descent direction by updating zzso zzso with a globally zzso zzso zzso which forms the major contribution of this paper, and the other is to generate a point in the feasible descent direction, which always automatically zzso lower and upper bound constraints on variables provided that the step size is a number between zero and zzso The zzso is zzso to both the zzso and the zzso zzso problem and is especially effective and efficient for the problems with dense zzso zzso results on 48 test problems show that the zzso is effective and zzso
