The literature presents many different zzso for zzso zzso from zzso zzso The performance of the zzso is normally presented in terms of sensitivity, specificity or other metrics describing the proportion of correct versus incorrect beat zzso From the zzso point of view, such metrics are however insufficient to rate the performance of a zzso 

We propose a new methodology for the presentation of zzso performance, based on zzso zzso zzso Our proposition lets the investigators report their findings in terms of zzso zzso and zzso the role of assessing the utility of the zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso utility must be undertaken in conjunction with the set of relative costs zzso to the zzso zzso Such evaluation produces a metric more tuned to the specific application, whilst preserving the information in the zzso 

By way of demonstration, we propose a set of costs, based on clinical data from the literature, and examine the results of two published zzso using our zzso We make recommendations for reporting zzso performance, such that this method can be used for subsequent zzso 

The proportion of zzso beats contains insufficient information to fully evaluate a zzso Performance reports should include a table of zzso zzso showing zzso the number of zzso but also the identity of the classes involved in each inaccurate zzso
