We have designed and implemented an zzso zzso zzso seizure control method using a seizure prediction method from zzso dynamics coupled with deep brain stimulation in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A comparison to periodic zzso with identical stimulation zzso was also zzso The two schemes were compared in terms of their efficacy in control of seizures, as well as their effect on synchronization of brain zzso The automated zzso zzso stimulation showed reduction of seizure frequency and duration in 5 of the 6 rats, with significant reduction of seizure frequency zzso in zzso of the zzso This constituted a significant improvement over the efficacy of the periodic control scheme in the same zzso Actually, periodic stimulation showed an increase of seizure frequency in 50% of the rats, reduction of seizure frequency in 3 rats and significant reduction in 1 zzso zzso successful seizure control was highly correlated with zzso of brain zzso This study provides initial evidence for the use of zzso feedback control systems in zzso zzso combining methods from seizure prediction and deep brain zzso
