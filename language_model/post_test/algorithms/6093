With the use of information from a database of pediatric patients with zzso nuclear zzso and serum zzso zzso estimated zzso equations were derived on the basis of local laboratory methods and zzso These formulas then were compared with those recommended by the National zzso Foundation for zzso zzso in zzso For this, their ability to estimate accurately an zzso true zzso and chronic kidney disease stage, identify patients whose true zzso was zzso zzso per zzso zzso and to identify correctly deterioration in an zzso zzso over time was zzso Next, two methods to estimate zzso in children without the use of height or weight were zzso The first was a zzso and zzso zzso the second was a novel approach using the Schwartz formula and calculating a zzso zzso based on zzso estimates of height and zzso level of interest, zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso Our results suggest that if local laboratory zzso are derived and a height is known, then the Schwartz formula offers the most accuracy with least mathematical complexity to perform in the clinical zzso If height is not available but the local laboratory zzso have been zzso then the British Columbia's Children's Hospital 2 formula is of value; however, in the setting of zzso pediatric zzso function in the zzso laboratory, where neither of these factors is commonly known, an approach zzso a zzso zzso for a zzso of interest is developed is zzso zzso are zzso levels that are based on a reference method of zzso measurement to facilitate this approach for the zzso
