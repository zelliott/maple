Eye movements and blinks may produce unusual zzso changes in human electroencephalogram zzso These effects may spread across scalp and mask brain zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso processing procedure zzso is presented to remove artifact zzso zzso zzso a discrete equivalent distributed source on the cortical surface is reconstructed from the contaminated scalp recordings by a linear minimum norm zzso zzso a spatial analysis zzso Then, the equivalent sources of zzso are identified by principal component analysis zzso of the equivalent distributed source time series zzso a zzso analysis zzso Finally, the zzso scalp zzso is reconstructed from the equivalent distributed source where zzso components have been zzso The effectiveness of CAST is confirmed by the application to actual scalp data and a detailed comparative zzso
