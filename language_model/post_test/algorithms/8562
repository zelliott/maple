Various random zzso models have been advocated for the fitting of zzso zzso It was suggested that a zzso model would fit better to weight data than a random zzso model that zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate which kind of random zzso model fits best to weight data of zzso Two random zzso models that described weight of individual zzso one using zzso zzso and the other using zzso were zzso A comparison with a zzso model, zzso information zzso and the zzso information criterion were used to select the best zzso zzso permanent zzso and total zzso increased with zzso zzso for the zzso model ranged from zzso to zzso and for both random zzso models the zzso were fluctuating around zzso Both genetic and zzso correlations decreased when the zzso between zzso zzso The zzso model needed fewer parameters than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso information criterion was least for the zzso model and greatest for the zzso zzso The zzso information criterion was least for the zzso model and greatest for the zzso zzso zzso of all models were normally zzso Based on these results, it is concluded that random zzso models provide the best fit to pig weight zzso
