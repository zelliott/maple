This paper sets out a tracking zzso which is applied to the recovery of three-dimensional hand motion from an image zzso The method handles the issues of zzso zzso and recovery in a unified zzso In a single input image with no prior information of the hand pose, the zzso is equivalent to a zzso detection zzso where unlikely pose candidates are rapidly zzso In image zzso a dynamic model is used to guide the search and approximate the optimal filtering zzso A dynamic model is given by transition probabilities between regions in zzso space and is learned from training data obtained by capturing articulated zzso The zzso is evaluated on a number of image zzso which include hand motion with zzso in front of a cluttered zzso
