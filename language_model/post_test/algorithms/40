zzso zzso zzso can be employed to investigate brain activities associated with regional changes of the zzso and zzso concentration by measuring the zzso of zzso light through the intact zzso zzso is regarded as a promising zzso zzso thanks to its excellent zzso resolution and flexibility for routine zzso Recently, the general linear model zzso which is a standard method for functional zzso zzso analysis, has been employed for quantitative analysis of zzso zzso However, the zzso often fails in zzso when there exists an unknown global trend due to breathing, zzso zzso or other experimental zzso We propose a zzso minimum description length zzso zzso zzso to overcome this zzso Specifically, the zzso transform is applied to decompose zzso zzso into global trends, zzso signals, and zzso noise components at distinct zzso The minimum description length zzso principle plays an important role in preventing zzso or zzso and zzso optimal model order selection for the global trend zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the new zzso zzso zzso the conventional zzso
