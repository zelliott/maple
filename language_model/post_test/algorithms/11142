The zzso of neural firing rates based on spike sequences has been introduced as a useful tool for extraction of an zzso zzso Different zzso methods of such neural firing rates have been developed by zzso and among these methods, time zzso and kernel zzso have been used more than other zzso In this paper, the problem in the zzso of firing rates using zzso density zzso has been zzso The results of simulation study in zzso of underlying rates based on spike sequences sampled from two different variable firing rates show that the proposed zzso density method provides better and more accurate zzso of firing rates with smooth results compared to two other classical zzso Furthermore, the performance of a different family of zzso density zzso in the zzso of the underlying firing rate of biological data have been compared with results of both time zzso and kernel zzso All in all, the results show that the proposed method can be useful in the zzso of firing rate of neural spike zzso
