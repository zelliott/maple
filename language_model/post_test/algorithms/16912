zzso data analysis has been shown to provide an effective tool for studying cancer and genetic zzso Although classical machine learning techniques have successfully been applied to find zzso genes and to predict class labels for new samples, common restrictions of zzso analysis such as small sample sizes, a large attribute space and high noise levels still limit its scientific and clinical zzso zzso the zzso of prediction models while retaining a high accuracy would help to exploit the information content in zzso data more zzso For this purpose, we evaluate our zzso evolutionary machine learning systems, zzso and zzso on three public zzso cancer zzso obtaining simple zzso models for sample zzso A comparison with other benchmark zzso sample zzso based on three diverse feature selection zzso suggests that these evolutionary learning techniques can compete with state-of-the-art methods like support zzso zzso The obtained models reach zzso above zzso in zzso external zzso with the added value of zzso interpretation by using only combinations of simple zzso zzso As a further benefit, a literature mining analysis reveals that zzso of zzso genes extracted from zzso zzso rule sets can outperform gene rankings obtained from a conventional ensemble feature selection in terms of the zzso mutual information between relevant disease terms and the standardized names of top-ranked zzso
