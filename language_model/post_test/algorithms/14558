Gene set analyses have become a standard approach for increasing the sensitivity of zzso zzso However, zzso methods incorporating gene sets require the availability of zzso gene sets relevant to the underlying physiology being zzso For novel zzso problems, relevant gene sets may be unavailable or existing gene set databases may bias the results towards only the zzso of the relevant biological zzso We describe a successful attempt to mine novel functional gene sets for zzso projects where the underlying physiology is not necessarily well characterized in existing zzso zzso We choose targeted training data from public expression data zzso and define new criteria for selecting zzso to serve as candidate gene zzso Many of the discovered gene sets show little or no enrichment for zzso Gene zzso terms or other functional zzso However, we observe that such gene sets show coherent differential expression in new clinical test data sets, even if derived from different species, zzso and disease zzso We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on a human zzso data set, where we discover novel, zzso gene sets that are diagnostic of diabetes, and on additional data sets related to zzso processes and human zzso Our results suggest that our approach may be an efficient way to generate a collection of gene sets relevant to the analysis of data for novel clinical applications where existing functional zzso is relatively zzso
