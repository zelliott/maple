zzso zzso needle insertions are widely used techniques in current clinical zzso Some of these procedures have a high degree of difficulty because of poor zzso of the needle in the ultrasound zzso There have been recent efforts to improve guidance by computer assisted needle zzso These software techniques are often limited by not representing needle zzso We present two methods to detect the needle in zzso ultrasound that specifically address needle zzso zzso we demonstrate a real-time needle zzso zzso based on the zzso transform which detects the needle and represents its curved zzso zzso we demonstrate how a new coordinate transformation can transform detection of a curved needle to a linear zzso These methods are demonstrated on ultrasound and photographic zzso
