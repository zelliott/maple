The function of a protein is closely correlated with its zzso zzso With the rapid increase in new protein sequences entering into data banks, we are confronted with a challenge: is it possible to zzso a zzso approach to help zzso the determination of protein zzso zzso To explore this problem, proteins were zzso according to their zzso locations, into the following 12 groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso apparatus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, (10) zzso (11) plasma membrane and zzso zzso Based on the zzso scheme that has covered almost all the zzso and zzso compartments in an animal or plant cell, a zzso zzso zzso was proposed to predict the zzso location of a query protein according to its zzso acid zzso zzso obtained through zzso zzso and independent zzso tests indicated that the rates of correct prediction by the current zzso are significantly higher than those by the existing zzso It is anticipated that the zzso scheme and concept and also the prediction zzso can zzso the functionality determination of new zzso which can also be of use in the zzso of genes and proteins identified by zzso efforts as potential molecular targets for drug zzso
