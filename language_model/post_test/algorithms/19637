To enhance the precision of treatment planning for tumors which move under zzso we developed a zzso segment reconstruction method zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso which provides high zzso resolution and a high zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso and zzso with regard to dose distribution in heavy zzso treatment zzso 

Data acquisition for zzso is done using a respiratory sensing system in zzso scan mode with a zzso row CT zzso To evaluate the accuracy of zzso of moving tumors, dose zzso with each zzso were compared in heavy zzso treatment planning using beam parameters obtained with zzso 

Images obtained using zzso did not show motion artifacts and zzso the edges of the liver and pulmonary vessels more clearly than those with zzso The zzso zzso for zzso covered the target zzso in contrast, zzso with the beam zzso of zzso image provided an insufficient dose to the target and a considerable dose to normal zzso around zzso 

The information provided by zzso improves accuracy in the prescription of zzso zzso Further, zzso allows greater precision in the delivery of zzso including zzso radiation zzso
