Fluorescence lifetime imaging zzso is widely applied to obtain quantitative information from zzso signals, particularly using zzso zzso Energy Transfer zzso zzso to map, for example, zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiencies or population zzso typically zzso fitting data to complex zzso zzso models but such experiments are frequently zzso zzso particularly for live cell or in zzso imaging, and this leads to unacceptable errors when zzso data on a zzso zzso zzso and population zzso may, however, be more robustly extracted using global analysis to simultaneously fit the zzso zzso data of all zzso in an image or zzso to a zzso model under the assumption that the lifetime components are zzso across the image zzso This approach is often considered to be zzso slow and/or zzso expensive but we present here a zzso efficient global analysis zzso for the analysis of zzso single zzso counting zzso or zzso zzso data based on variable zzso It makes efficient use of both computer zzso and memory resources, requiring less than a minute to zzso time series and zzso plate zzso with hundreds of zzso images on standard personal zzso This lifetime analysis takes account of repetitive zzso including zzso photons excited by earlier zzso contributing to the fit, and is able to accommodate zzso backgrounds and instrument response zzso We demonstrate that this global approach allows us to readily fit zzso zzso data to complex models including a zzso model of a zzso system, for which the zzso efficiencies of the two species of a zzso donor are linked, and zzso lifetime data, where a zzso intensity and zzso zzso zzso model is applied to the analysis of live cell zzso zzso A software package implementing this algorithm, zzso is available under an open source zzso through the Open zzso zzso
