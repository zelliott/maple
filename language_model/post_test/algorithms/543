zzso zzso detected in large-scale association studies are frequently located in zzso zzso regions, suggesting that they may be involved in zzso zzso Here we describe a new strategy for detecting regulatory zzso zzso by combining zzso and experimental zzso Whole zzso zzso data for zzso was analyzed using a novel motif finding zzso called zzso zzso binding sites were identified and 140 candidate zzso were found in the predicted zzso For zzso their regulatory function, seven zzso found to be zzso in at least one of four human cell samples were investigated by zzso and sequence analysis zzso In four of five cases where the zzso was predicted to affect zzso zzso was zzso bound to the zzso containing the consensus zzso zzso differences in binding for other proteins and zzso marks further reinforced the zzso regulatory zzso Moreover, for one of these zzso zzso and zzso levels at neighboring zzso zzso indicated effects on zzso Our strategy, which is entirely based on in zzso data for both the prediction and validation steps, can identify individual binding sites at base pair resolution and predict zzso Overall, this approach can help to pinpoint the zzso zzso in complex disorders where the associated zzso are located in regulatory zzso
