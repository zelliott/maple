The purpose of this study was to zzso exploit the capabilities of zzso systems zzso with linear zzso zzso for field use in redundant zzso We simulated different zzso equipped with zzso zzso or zzso sensors with a number of axes that lie in the range of zzso the zzso were located on a zzso surface by adopting a zzso criterion while their orientation was zzso In addition, for a comparative purpose the nine zzso scheme (one zzso zzso and three zzso zzso addressed in the following as zzso zzso was also analyzed in the present zzso We simulated and statistically assessed the performances of zzso zzso in the test case of a healthy subject walking freely at normal pace over level zzso The zzso results indicated that a well designed zzso headset can retrieve the angular acceleration and zzso component with zzso errors of about zzso and zzso respectively, and angular zzso with a drift error of about zzso in a 6 s zzso On the contrary, the pose of the headset cannot be evaluated because of the drift induced by the integration zzso In general, we can state that zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso have comparable zzso The main implications of the zzso observations are zzso neither expensive zzso zzso nor assembling procedure based on the use of zzso mounting blocks are zzso zzso redundant zzso of low-cost zzso or zzso zzso can effectively be used to reach adequate performances in zzso studies where head acceleration and zzso are zzso zzso while estimates of angular acceleration with zzso are accurate, zzso of angular zzso linear zzso and pose are zzso
