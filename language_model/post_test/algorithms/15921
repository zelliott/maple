The present study investigates the influence of zzso damage and of blood pressure on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso For this purpose a zzso model for the coupled mass transport processes in the zzso zzso and in the various layers of the zzso wall is zzso The model considers the transport in the zzso zzso internal elastic zzso zzso and media of a straight zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso fully developed stationary blood flow is zzso the zzso zzso in the wall layers is calculated applying zzso zzso The description of the zzso mass transport uses the stationary zzso zzso the transport in the porous zzso and media is zzso applying the zzso stationary zzso zzso The transport processes in the zzso zzso and media are coupled by the flux across the zzso and zzso which is zzso described using the zzso zzso The zzso solution of the transport equations applies the finite element zzso The results demonstrate a high resistance of the healthy zzso to zzso exchange between blood and the artery zzso The reduced resistance of an injured zzso causes an increased mass flux into the wall which results in higher concentration levels within the zzso The effect of the blood pressure on the wall concentration level is different for a zzso and an injured zzso In the case of a healthy zzso a blood pressure increase causes a decrease of the zzso concentration and an increase of the zzso zzso whereas in the case of an injured zzso an increased blood pressure results in higher concentration levels within the zzso and zzso
