The reliability of the electrical distribution system is a contemporary research field due to diverse applications of electricity in everyday life and diverse zzso However a few research papers exist in zzso This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the reliability of zzso zzso zzso stations based on average time between zzso The objective of this paper is to find the optimal fit for the failure data via time between zzso We determine the zzso zzso for all components of the zzso We also estimate the reliability value of each component and the reliability value of the system as a zzso The best fitting distribution for the time between failures is a three zzso zzso distribution with a scale zzso zzso see zzso and shape parameters zzso see zzso and zzso see zzso Our analysis reveals that the reliability value decreased by zzso in each 30 zzso We believe that the current paper is the first to address this issue and its zzso Thus, the results obtained in this research reflect its zzso We also suggest the practicality of using these results for power systems for both the maintenance of power systems models and preventive maintenance zzso
