The zzso of zzso containing sugar zzso with various zzso chain length were investigated, in order to develop a zzso zzso penetration zzso which was expected to show a low irritation to the zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso as the zzso followed by zzso of the zzso groups with sodium zzso The enhancing effect of zzso on the zzso drug penetration was evaluated by in zzso experiments using a zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso and zzso model drugs, respectively, and the amount of drug zzso through the rat abdominal skin with or without zzso was estimated by zzso As a result, zzso exhibited a enhancing effect on the zzso of both drugs through the skin, which was influenced by the zzso chain length of zzso In addition, it was suggested that a suitable balance of polarity would be necessary to appear the high enhancing effect, where zzso with zzso and zzso groups exhibited the highest enhancing zzso From the determination of kinetic parameters in the drug zzso it was also found that this enhancing effect was due to the increase of both partition and diffusion zzso of drug zzso through the zzso By experiments to determine the amount of cholesterol extracted from the skin, the zzso effect would be one of the functions of zzso which resulted in the high enhancing zzso Furthermore, according to the zzso test, it was confirmed that zzso showed a low irritation to the zzso
