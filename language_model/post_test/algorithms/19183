zzso zzso treatment planning involves compromising between different planning zzso zzso zzso planning directly addresses this compromising and thus makes it more zzso Usually, several plans are zzso from which the planner selects the most promising following a certain zzso zzso zzso navigation for this selection step simultaneously increases the variety of planning options and zzso the identification of the most promising zzso zzso navigation is an interactive zzso zzso method that consists of the two navigation mechanisms zzso and zzso The former allows the zzso of wishes whereas the latter allows the exclusion of unwanted zzso They are realized as zzso problems on the so-called plan bundle -- a set constructed from zzso zzso They can be approximately reformulated so that their solution time is a small fraction of a zzso Thus, the user can be provided with immediate feedback regarding his or her zzso zzso navigation was implemented in the zzso zzso software and allows real-time manipulation of the current plan and the set of considered zzso The changes are triggered by simple mouse operations on the so-called navigation star and lead to real-time updates of the navigation star and the dose zzso Since any zzso plan in the plan bundle can be found with just a few navigation operations the zzso zzso allows a fast and directed plan zzso Besides, the concept allows for a refinement of the plan zzso thus offering a middle course between single plan zzso and zzso zzso zzso navigation offers so far zzso real-time zzso ease of use and plan zzso setting it apart from the zzso zzso planning methods proposed so zzso
