zzso zzso in plants, while generally similar to the processes in zzso and zzso is thought to involve plant specific zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are typically strongly enriched in U zzso and zzso or zzso segments are thought to be involved in zzso recognition, zzso site selection, and zzso zzso We have applied zzso models to find optimal combinations of zzso site variables for the purpose of separating true zzso sites from a large excess of potential zzso It is shown that plant zzso site prediction from sequence inspection is greatly improved when compositional contrast between zzso and zzso is considered in addition to degree of matching to the zzso site consensus zzso zzso The best model involves zzso of zzso sites according to the identity of the base immediately upstream of the zzso and AG signals and gives substantial performance gains compared with conventional profile zzso
