We present a zzso learning technique to zzso the zzso cup in zzso images for glaucoma zzso In contrast to previous approaches which rely on low-level visual cues, our method instead considers the input image as a whole and zzso its zzso cup parameters from a zzso of manually labeled reference images based on their similarity to the input and their contribution towards reconstructing the input zzso We show that this approach can be formulated as a zzso solution without any search, which leads to highly efficient and zzso zzso zzso Our tests on the zzso and zzso zzso show that the performance of this method compares favorably to those of previous techniques while operating at faster zzso This suggests much promise for this approach to be used in practice for zzso
