This study focused on the impact of noise on the reliability of zzso zzso and complexity zzso zzso to discriminate between different trauma patients and to monitor individual zzso zzso interventions zzso were chosen as an zzso because performance of zzso is a critical aspect of trauma patient zzso Noise was modeled and simulated by zzso original zzso zzso zzso sequences via zzso zzso and division of zzso as well as zzso detection using the zzso zzso showed that under increasing simulated noise, zzso and zzso measures can still effectively discriminate between zzso and zzso patients and monitor individuals over zzso
