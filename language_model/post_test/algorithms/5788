The discovery of regulatory motifs embedded in upstream regions of plants is a particularly challenging zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that motifs in plants are short compared with those found in zzso Furthermore, plant zzso have undergone several diversification mechanisms such as zzso zzso events which impact the evolution of regulatory zzso In this article, a systematic zzso comparison of upstream regions is conducted to further identify features of the plant regulatory zzso the component of zzso regulating gene zzso to enable future de zzso zzso The findings highlight differences in upstream region properties between major plant groups and the effects of divergence times and zzso zzso First, clear differences in upstream region evolution can be detected between zzso and zzso thus suggesting that a separation of these groups should be made when searching for novel regulatory zzso particularly since universal motifs such as the zzso box are zzso Second, investigating the zzso rate of significantly aligned regions suggests that a divergence time of zzso zzso sets a limit for reliable zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso presented here will set a framework to help identify embedded motifs of functional relevance by understanding the limits of zzso detection for zzso
