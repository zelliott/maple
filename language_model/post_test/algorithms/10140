A new zzso approach called zzso sampling of zzso acid zzso zzso has been elaborated to explicitly account for the protein side chain flexibility in modeling zzso protein zzso In zzso a protein is viewed as a graph whose zzso zzso to structurally independent groups and whose edges connect the interacting zzso Each zzso has its set of states describing zzso and zzso of the group, and each edge is assigned an array of zzso interaction zzso between the adjacent zzso By treating the obtained graph as a zzso well-established mathematical zzso partition function of each zzso is zzso In the current work we used zzso to calculate partition functions of the zzso forms of protein zzso A simplified version of a zzso molecular mechanical scoring function, borrowed from our Lead zzso zzso software, was used for energy zzso The accuracy of the resulting model was validated on a set of zzso zzso determined zzso values of protein zzso The average correlation zzso zzso between calculated and experimental zzso values was zzso ranging from zzso (for zzso to zzso (for zzso It appeared that the hydrogen bond interactions and the zzso of side chain sampling made the most significant contribution to the accuracy of zzso zzso
