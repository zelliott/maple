The existing differential approaches for zzso of 3-D zzso point landmarks in 3-D images are sensitive to noise and usually extract numerous zzso zzso The zzso zzso approaches are not practically usable for zzso of landmarks that can not be modeled by simple zzso zzso Some dedicated methods using zzso knowledge to identify particular landmarks are not general enough to cope with other zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso zzso approach to automatically zzso 3-D point landmarks in zzso To zzso a landmark, the zzso zzso (meaning the zzso of a part of the studied structure in a certain neighborhood of the zzso is first achieved by an active surface model, and then the landmark is localized by analyzing the segmented part zzso The joint use of global zzso zzso zzso structure zzso active zzso zzso and zzso surface registration makes our method robust to noise and shape zzso To evaluate the method, we apply it to the zzso of zzso landmarks including zzso zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso with 48 clinical and 18 simulated magnetic resonance zzso zzso images show that the proposed approach is able to zzso these landmarks with an average accuracy of 1 zzso zzso at the level of image zzso We also illustrate the use of the proposed approach to cortical landmark identification and discuss its potential applications ranging from zzso zzso and surgery to zzso registration with zzso
