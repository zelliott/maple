zzso zzso monitoring of patients with cerebral zzso increases the detection rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso this leads to improved zzso regimens aimed at preventing zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare a zzso monitoring zzso alone or in combination with prior selection via zzso zzso zzso to a standard zzso using a zzso zzso 

Lifetime cost, zzso life years zzso and incremental zzso ratios zzso were estimated for a cohort of patients with acute cerebral zzso and no zzso to oral zzso A zzso model was developed to simulate the long-term course and progression of cerebral zzso considering the different diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso by zzso Clinical data for these zzso were derived from the prospective zzso zzso study zzso zzso 

zzso lifelong discounted costs were zzso zzso for patients diagnosed by the zzso and zzso zzso by the standard zzso zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso compared to zzso for the zzso The zzso dominated the zzso in the zzso scenario and remained cost-effective in extensive sensitivity analysis of key input zzso with a maximum of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients for the zzso had no positive effect on the zzso 

A zzso to detect zzso in patients with cerebral zzso is zzso It increases the detection which leads to improved zzso zzso therefore, it avoids zzso strokes, saves future costs, and decreases quality of life zzso zzso patients by zzso does not improve zzso
