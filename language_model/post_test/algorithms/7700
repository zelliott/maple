Fisher information provides a bound on the zzso of any unbiased estimate for zzso tasks involving zzso zzso In addition, a Fisher information approximation for zzso zzso has been zzso We adopt and zzso such an approximation to establish a method to assess a system's ability to detect small changes in zzso zzso By representing the zzso by a size zzso the ability to detect small changes can be zzso by a function involving the size difference and the Fisher zzso A concept, termed the zzso least required difference zzso is introduced and evaluated as an upper bound for assessing a system's power in size zzso We present a simulation study for lung zzso as an example to illustrate such a zzso where the image model incorporates a simulated CT imaging system, a zzso background and zzso zzso The noise is assumed to be zzso zzso and the noise power spectrum zzso method is used to estimate the zzso zzso for the Fisher information zzso In addition to zzso performance, our results also provide insights into factors, including zzso characteristics and acquisition zzso that influence zzso zzso This framework can be extended to connect other discrimination and zzso tasks, zzso objective assessment and zzso of quantitative imaging zzso
