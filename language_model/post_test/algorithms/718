The zzso detection of zzso became an essential task with increasing automation of quantitative electroencephalogram zzso analysis during zzso zzso The different zzso published so far required individual manual adjustment or have been based on limited decision zzso In this study, we developed an artificial neural zzso method for automated detection of zzso and zzso suppression zzso 72 zzso zzso recorded before, during and after zzso with zzso have been zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso s length were used to train the ANN zzso zzso 8 hidden and 4 output zzso with error back zzso The detection performance of the zzso method was tested with processing epochs between 1 zzso zzso Related to examiner zzso zzso the average detection performance of the method was zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for zzso and zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for zzso zzso The improvement in zzso ratio with automated zzso processing was zzso times for the spectral edge frequency 95 zzso and zzso times for the approximate zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso provide an useful tool for automated zzso evaluation in zzso zzso
