zzso of the change in shape of a residual limb over time is relevant to the fitting of an external zzso Three zzso were developed and evaluated to align residual limb zzso zzso closest points zzso mean absolute difference, and weighted surface zzso absolute zzso zzso were conducted by aligning residual limb shapes with known zzso and transformations with their original zzso zzso showed that zzso did not perform well in that it tended to favor a global distribution of local shape difference rather than zzso of the zzso The mean absolute difference zzso performed well as long as the shape difference was localized to one zzso zzso mean surface zzso difference provided the best alignment results, performing well both if shape changes were localized and if they were globally zzso Mean alignment errors for this method were less than zzso zzso for each of the three translation directions and less than zzso degrees for each of the three rotation zzso This zzso could be helpful to patients, zzso and researchers developing treatments to overcome the zzso fitting effects of residual limb shape zzso
