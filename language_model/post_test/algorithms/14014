The zzso measurement and imaging of tissue elasticity is currently under wide investigation and development as a clinical tool for the assessment of a broad range of diseases, but little account in this field has yet been taken of the fact that soft tissue is porous and contains mobile zzso The ability to squeeze fluid out of tissue may have implications for conventional elasticity imaging, and may present opportunities for new investigative zzso When a zzso zzso zzso zzso material with a zzso elastic solid phase and zzso solid and fluid constituents is subjected to stress, the zzso of the induced internal strain field is influenced by three material zzso the Young's zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso of the solid zzso and the zzso zzso of the solid zzso to the pore zzso New zzso expressions were derived and used to model the zzso zzso of the strain field inside simulated homogeneous zzso samples of such a zzso material undergoing sustained zzso zzso A zzso reconstruction technique was developed to produce images of parameters related to the zzso material zzso zzso zzso zzso from a comparison of the measured and predicted zzso zzso varying zzso zzso Tests of the method using simulated noisy strain data showed that it is capable of producing three unique zzso zzso an image of the zzso ratio of the solid zzso an image of the zzso strain (which was not zzso subsequent to the application of the zzso and an image representing the product of the zzso zzso zzso of the solid zzso and the zzso of the solid zzso to the pore zzso The zzso expressions were further used to zzso validate a finite element model and to clarify previous work on zzso
