As a result of an analysis of data relating tissue response to radiation absorbed dose the zzso has recommended a target for accuracy of zzso 5 for dose delivery in radiation zzso This is a difficult overall objective to achieve because of the many steps that make up a course of zzso The calculation of absorbed dose is only one of the steps and so to achieve an overall accuracy of better than zzso zzso the accuracy in dose calculation must be better zzso The physics behind the problem is sufficiently complicated so that no exact method of calculation has been found and consequently approximate solutions must be zzso The development of computer zzso for this task involves the search for better and better approximate zzso To achieve the desired target of accuracy a fairly sophisticated calculation procedure must be zzso Only when this is done can we hope to further improve our knowledge of the way in which zzso respond to radiation zzso
