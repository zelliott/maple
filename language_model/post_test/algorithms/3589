Image correlation zzso methodology was extended and used to determine zzso the density, dynamics and interactions of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso clusters containing zzso zzso before it is zzso zzso The zzso in nascent zzso as identified by the presence of zzso is approximately zzso times more zzso approximately zzso times more clustered and much less mobile than in surrounding zzso Thus, while zzso are clustered throughout the cell, they differ in nascent zzso and appear to initiate zzso formation, despite their lack of visible zzso In more mature zzso where the zzso is visibly organized there are approximately 900 zzso zzso (about fivefold higher than surrounding zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso but not zzso reside in a complex throughout the cell, where they diffuse and flow together, even in regions where they are not zzso During zzso zzso some zzso diffuse away slowly, zzso zzso a directed movement at speeds similar to zzso retrograde flow zzso zzso zzso while all of the zzso zzso away zzso
