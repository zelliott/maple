zzso spatial zzso is an important alternative to tracking for designing zzso aware zzso zzso for procedures such as laser zzso and zzso It requires independent, fast registration of each image frame from a digital video stream zzso zzso zzso zzso to a spatial map of the zzso Recently, we have introduced a spatial zzso zzso that works in three primary steps: 1) tracing the retinal zzso to extract image feature zzso 2) zzso indexing to generate hypothesized landmark zzso and initial zzso and 3) alignment and zzso steps to robustly estimate a zzso zzso spatial transformation between the image frame and the zzso The goal of this paper is to introduce techniques to minimize the amount of zzso for successful spatial zzso The fundamental driving idea is to make feature extraction zzso to registration and, therefore, only produce the information needed for verified, accurate zzso To this end, the image is analyzed along zzso vertical and horizontal grid lines to produce a regular sampling of the zzso needed for step 3) and to initiate step zzso zzso of the vascular is then zzso zzso to quickly extract landmarks and groups zzso of landmarks for zzso Finally, the tracing and spatial zzso zzso are integrated so that landmark zzso found by tracing are tested zzso The resulting zzso is an zzso faster with the same success zzso The average total zzso time is zzso zzso per image on a zzso zzso zzso zzso
