To evaluates a zzso method for zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement using zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso 

This retrospective zzso zzso study was approved by our zzso zzso maximum diameters of outer wall to outer wall were studied in fifty patients at seven zzso locations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso junction zzso mid ascending zzso zzso at the level of right pulmonary artery, zzso zzso arch zzso immediately zzso to zzso artery, zzso zzso arch zzso immediately zzso to left zzso artery, and descending zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso were performed using a manual method and zzso zzso All readers repeated their zzso zzso zzso and zzso agreements were evaluated according to zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number of cases with manual zzso or center line adjustment for the zzso method and also the zzso time for each method were zzso 

The mean difference between zzso and manual methods was less than zzso at all seven zzso Strong zzso zzso and zzso agreement was recorded at all levels zzso zzso zzso The maximum rate of manual adjustment of center line and zzso was at the level of zzso The average time for manual zzso of the zzso was 19 zzso zzso zzso while it took zzso zzso zzso zzso to do the zzso with the zzso tool zzso version zzso zzso The center line was edited manually at all levels, with most corrections at the level of zzso zzso while the zzso was adjusted at all levels with highest and lowest number of corrections at the levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

Compared to the commonly used manual method, zzso measurement of vessel dimensions is feasible in the zzso zzso with the advantage of reduced zzso zzso
