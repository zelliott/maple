In clinical applications the analysis of X-ray contrast zzso acquired in regions of interest zzso over the zzso is disturbed by many complex zzso For this reason we acquire redundant zzso information for quality control before zzso zzso zzso In our approach, initially some stable measures of quality for zzso are used to lower the influence of poor quality zzso by a quality weighted zzso For example a shape quality measure, zzso is calculated using regions of optimal and minimal acceptable quality defined with respect to a zzso zzso Not a few zzso zzso yield zzso that differ from zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso of different zzso beds or the position of the zzso relative to the coronary zzso or zzso This might result in a zzso shape with zzso or plateau zzso For zzso of a such general shape many parameters defined in the usual way do not depend smoothly on the zzso zzso The conventional definitions of some parameters zzso time, rise zzso are therefore extended for application to zzso zzso as well as to zzso These new methods are evaluated using digitized clinical zzso and are applied to zzso imaging zzso in a slightly modified zzso Taking into account the zzso quality, its shape and its origin results in a considerable improvement both for zzso and zzso imaging of zzso zzso
