zzso were built by evolution to react swiftly to environmental zzso Thus, sensory stimuli must be processed ad zzso zzso zzso a large zzso the momentary brain state zzso prevailing during stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso strives to model the robust processing of stimuli in the presence of zzso cortical zzso A pivotal feature of ongoing brain activity is the regional predominance of zzso zzso such as the zzso alpha or the zzso zzso rhythm, both zzso zzso at 10 zzso Here, we establish a novel generalized concept to measure zzso zzso zzso which allows one to model neural zzso dynamics also in the presence of zzso cortical zzso Specifically, we demonstrate that a zzso stimulus causes a zzso sequence of first an zzso and then an ensuing zzso zzso zzso zzso which at a zzso cortical state becomes evident only if the natural relaxation dynamics of zzso zzso rhythms is zzso as reference zzso Moreover, this zzso approach also encompasses the more general notion of a zzso zzso through which candidate explanatory variables can be scrutinized with regard to their possible impact on a particular zzso dynamics under zzso Thus, the generalized zzso represents a powerful novel analysis tool for extending our understanding of zzso zzso of evoked responses and therefore the robust processing of environmental zzso
