This paper proposes zzso models for zzso spectral zzso with application to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso approaches for zzso spectral zzso use zzso zzso zzso zzso models with zzso state zzso The zzso zzso is solved by a conventional Kalman zzso This study uses zzso state noise to model zzso zzso zzso variation with zzso by a zzso Carlo particle filter zzso Use of zzso noise such as zzso distribution is motivated by its ability to track abrupt and smooth zzso zzso changes, which are zzso modeled by zzso zzso Thus, more accurate spectral estimates and better zzso tracking can be zzso This study further proposes a zzso state space zzso of zzso zzso moving average zzso models to improve the spectral zzso zzso on zzso process with abrupt zzso variation shows superior tracking performance of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso data shows that the zzso models provide more accurate detection of abrupt changes in alpha rhythm zzso Among the proposed zzso models, zzso shows better spectral representations while maintaining reasonable good zzso tracking zzso
