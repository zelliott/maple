zzso the zzso analysis, we study the zzso operating characteristics in a zzso ring zzso zzso operation is found not stable in a silicon ring because of the existence of zzso zzso Using polar zzso which have different forward and backward zzso gain or introducing external optical injections helps to establish stable zzso operation in a zzso ring zzso
