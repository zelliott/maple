This study highlights a novel spinal zzso analysis method and the feasibility of X-ray imaging zzso to accurately assess zzso spine zzso The advanced X-ray zzso method and analysis were used to zzso the zzso range of motion in zzso vertebra zzso in zzso This zzso X-ray imaging method was compared with a standardized method using the zzso zzso motion capture zzso Linear zzso analysis showed an excellent and significant correlation between the two methods zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso suggesting that the analysis of spinal zzso range of motion using X-ray imaging zzso was accurate and comparable to the conventional zzso motion analysis zzso zzso this novel finding is compelling evidence demonstrating that zzso with X-ray imaging are useful to accurately decipher pathological spinal alignment and movement zzso in idiopathic zzso zzso
