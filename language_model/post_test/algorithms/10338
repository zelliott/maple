This works addresses the problem of reconstructing multiple zzso or zzso images of the same anatomical cross section from partially sampled zzso zzso Previous studies in reconstructing magnetic resonance zzso images from partial samples of the zzso used compressed sensing zzso techniques to exploit the spatial correlation of the images (leading to zzso in zzso zzso Such techniques can be employed to reconstruct the individual zzso or zzso zzso However, in the current context, the different images are not really zzso they are images of the same cross section and, zzso are highly zzso We exploit the correlation between the images, along with the spatial correlation within the images to achieve better reconstruction results than exploiting spatial correlation zzso For individual MR images, zzso techniques lead to a zzso zzso problem in the zzso zzso In this article, we show that the same framework can be extended to incorporate correlation between images leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso for solving such zzso problems have already been developed in the zzso zzso We show that significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy can be achieved by considering the correlation between different zzso and zzso zzso If the reconstruction accuracy is considered to be constant, our proposed group sparse zzso can yield the same result with zzso less zzso samples compared with simple zzso zzso Moreover, the reconstruction time by our proposed method is about two to four times less than the previous zzso
