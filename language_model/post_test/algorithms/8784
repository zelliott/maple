In this paper, we present a novel technique, based on zzso sensing principles, for reconstruction and enhancement of zzso image zzso Our method is a major improvement and zzso of the zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso zzso we recently introduced for reducing zzso zzso Our new technique exhibits several advantages over zzso including its capability to simultaneously reduce noise and zzso missing zzso Unlike zzso our new method does not require an a zzso high-quality image from the target imaging subject and thus offers the potential to shorten clinical imaging zzso This novel image restoration method, which we termed zzso based simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso zzso sparse representation zzso constructed from previously collected zzso We tested the zzso zzso on retinal spectral domain optical zzso zzso images captured in the zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso other state-of-the-art zzso
