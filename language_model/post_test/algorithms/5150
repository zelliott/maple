The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship of third order zzso on dental casts with those on lateral zzso and to identify those zzso features on zzso which can best explain third order zzso on dental zzso zzso zzso and corresponding dental casts were obtained from 39 zzso Caucasians (12 zzso 27 zzso mean age zzso years; standard zzso zzso zzso with zzso relationships considered to be zzso The upper zzso and lower zzso zzso were assessed with reference to the zzso plane perpendicular which was established on the lateral zzso including third order angles zzso zzso which were also derived from direct dental cast zzso zzso zzso Both single zzso and multiple linear zzso analysis with zzso variable selection were performed using third order zzso on casts as the dependent variable and crown axis zzso zzso root axis zzso zzso zzso connecting line zzso zzso and zzso third order zzso as independent zzso Single zzso analysis indicated an overall difference of zzso degrees between zzso third order inclination and cast assessment in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A change of 1 degree in zzso third order inclination would produce a change of zzso degrees for zzso and zzso degrees for zzso zzso Third order zzso on dental casts can best be explained by a linear combination of zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the functional zzso between two different third order assessments and the most common zzso features on lateral zzso Both methods of third order evaluation show sufficient reliability and are appropriate for routine zzso zzso
