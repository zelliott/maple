One common variety of zzso artifact is baseline wander resulting from movement, zzso and poor zzso zzso Although filters can be designed to remove much of this baseline variation, they will distort the zzso components of the zzso complex, such as the zzso the zzso and, most zzso the zzso The zzso is the most zzso relevant measure of the zzso taken during zzso While linear baseline zzso and removal may be adequate at lower heart rates, they also will introduce significant zzso This is particularly evident when excessive zzso wander is present, as seen at higher heart rates and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso of baseline zzso known as the cubic zzso has been used for nearly 15 zzso It is a very robust technique applied to exercise zzso zzso Since the cubic zzso is not a filter and use an a zzso knowledge of the shape of the zzso zzso it estimates the true baseline and avoids distortion zzso The more common zzso of this technique use relatively short zzso zzso With the advent of increasing power in computerized zzso systems, the zzso of the cubic zzso zzso for removing baseline wander in zzso zzso zzso records and in real-time processing is being zzso However, the correct application of the cubic zzso to continuous recordings is not straightforward and involves a number of previously unforeseen zzso The accuracy and resolution of both floating point and zzso operations is critical during long-term application of the cubic zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
