Acute traumatic zzso injuries zzso following blunt zzso trauma require rapid and accurate diagnosis for institution of lifesaving zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of such injuries continues to improve and has the potential to become the diagnostic zzso of choice in many trauma zzso A standardized diagnostic model may contribute to improvements in zzso interpretation of CT for zzso 

The following diagnostic criteria were used to develop a diagnostic model for zzso 11 areas of potential zzso formation were identified in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso diameters of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso information zzso change, zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso wall was zzso These characteristics were zzso and analyzed for statistical significance, allowing for the development of an injury assessment zzso 

The diagnostic model was used to score 69 blunt zzso trauma patient zzso Average weighted zzso was zzso showing strong agreement among two observers and zzso of the zzso The model improved injury assessment by zzso zzso cases as either positive or zzso The zzso curve calculated from the original zzso interpretation contained zzso area under the curve, while the curve for the new model contained zzso The likelihood ratio increased from zzso to zzso The degree to which the new measure improved prediction over the original zzso reading was tested using a zzso model and yielded a reliable zzso in model fit zzso analysis: zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso Finally, beta weights calculated from each variable were used to create a quantitative zzso diagnostic model for future zzso 

We have developed a diagnostic tool that may help zzso better evaluate CT for zzso
