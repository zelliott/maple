A dynamic complex zzso imaging technique is developed with the aid of the zzso Kalman filter zzso for real-time reconstruction of the human zzso The forward problem is solved by an zzso method based on the separation of variables and zzso zzso The inverse problem is treated as a state zzso zzso The zzso measurement equation is zzso about the best homogeneous zzso value as an initial guess, and the zzso distribution is estimated with the aid of the Kalman zzso The Kalman gain zzso is zzso and stored zzso to minimize the zzso zzso zzso zzso and phantom experiment are reported to illustrate the reconstruction performances in the sense of zzso resolution in a simplified geometry of the human zzso
