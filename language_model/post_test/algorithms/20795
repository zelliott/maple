zzso models and differential responses of species to environmental zzso offer complementary explanations of species abundance distribution and zzso Under what circumstances one model prevails over the other is still a matter of zzso We show that the zzso of similarity over time in rocky zzso zzso of algae and zzso sampled over a period of 16 years was consistent with the predictions of a zzso model of ecological drift at time scales larger than 2 years, but not at time scales between 3 and 24 months when similarity was zzso with an index that reflected changes in abundance of rare zzso A field experiment was performed to examine whether zzso responded zzso or zzso to changes in zzso zzso of zzso The experimental results did not reject neutrality, but identified a positive effect of intermediate levels of environmental zzso on the abundance of rare zzso This effect translated into a marked decrease in the characteristic time scale of species zzso highlighting the role of rare species in driving zzso dynamics in fluctuating zzso
