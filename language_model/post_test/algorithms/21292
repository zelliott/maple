The role of zzso zzso hormones in the zzso of early zzso diabetes zzso zzso was studied by zzso methods in rats with zzso zzso Seven to ten days after zzso injection, zzso diabetic rats had elevated zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso zzso rate zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso (5 zzso markedly reduced urinary and zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso but zzso and zzso did not zzso In a second group, zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to inhibit zzso also had no effect on zzso or zzso In a third group, zzso infusion of zzso II zzso II, zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso plasma flow zzso zzso and zzso plasma flow rate zzso to values close to those in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction rose significantly with zzso II, but zzso pressure zzso was zzso zzso fluid zzso increased in response to zzso zzso zzso infusion following zzso II returned zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso levels, and PG zzso In chronically zzso normal rats, the responses to zzso zzso II and zzso were similar to those observed in the diabetic zzso We conclude that zzso in early zzso is not dependent on intact zzso zzso or zzso zzso The results with zzso II infusion indicate that zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells of the diabetic kidney are able to zzso in response to this zzso
