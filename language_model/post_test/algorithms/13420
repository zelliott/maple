This paper presents unique approaches to enable control and zzso of zzso cell membrane zzso or zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that were targeted to the plasma membrane of zzso cells generated zzso and temporally controlled membrane disruption with high zzso Using zzso patch clamp recording combined with zzso zzso we obtained zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the size and zzso rate of zzso We measured the zzso diffusion zzso of zzso zzso from zzso transport of an zzso fluorescent dye into and within single zzso We achieved zzso controlled delivery with zzso precision and calcium signaling in targeted cells by selective zzso of zzso Finally, we zzso zzso to deliver zzso a zzso zzso of zzso resistance zzso zzso into zzso cells, which zzso zzso and monitored the zzso zzso by zzso This approach made it possible to measure the zzso rate in individual cells and to compare it directly to the zzso rate in parental control cells that do not express zzso
