The aim of this study was to provide a framework for the analysis of visceral obesity and its zzso in women, where complex zzso are observed among lifestyle, nutritional and zzso zzso Thirty-four zzso related to lifestyle, zzso body fat distribution, blood lipids and zzso sizes have been considered as potential zzso of visceral obesity in zzso To properly address the difficulties in managing such interactions given our limited sample of 150 women, zzso zzso networks were constructed based on novel zzso learning methods that appeared recently in the statistical learning zzso zzso significance of edge strengths was evaluated and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network zzso To allow accessible interpretation and integrate biological knowledge into the final network, several zzso edges were afterwards directed with zzso expertise according to relevant zzso 

zzso experiments on synthetic data sampled from a known zzso network show that the algorithm, called zzso zzso Parents and Children zzso zzso state-of-the-art zzso that appeared in the recent zzso Regarding biological zzso we found that the zzso results obtained with the proposed method were in excellent agreement with biological zzso For example, these analyses indicated that visceral zzso tissue zzso is strongly related to blood zzso zzso independent of overall obesity zzso 

zzso Networks are a useful tool for investigating and zzso evidence when complex relationships exist among zzso in particular, as in the case of zzso conditions like visceral zzso when there is a concurrent zzso for several zzso interacting in a complex zzso The source code and the data sets used for the empirical tests are available at zzso
