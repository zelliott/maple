zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently developed imaging technique that has the potential to advance the early diagnosis of diseases in the human gastrointestinal zzso zzso How ever, the high scattering nature of zzso tissue limits its imaging depth and zzso For more effective diagnosis using zzso a concurrent improvement of imaging depth and contrast is, therefore, zzso In this work, we investigate the administration of chemical agents to the tissue as a means of improving the capability of zzso imaging of clinically relevant zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso including stomach and zzso were obtained from patients in hospital, and were zzso with zzso within zzso hours of zzso Immediately after the first imaging of the specimens with zzso about zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso solution was applied onto the tissue surface and the tissue allowed to absorb the chemical compounds for 20 zzso Another image was then taken at the same zzso The specimens were then embedded and stained in preparation for zzso zzso zzso of the images obtained using zzso before and after the topical application of the zzso zzso solution, and standard zzso processing provided basis for zzso 

More detailed zzso including the zzso layer position and the cellular composition of the zzso layer of zzso tract zzso were observed after the topical application of zzso zzso solution, while these structures were not resolvable in the conventional zzso zzso 

zzso zzso could be used as a contrasting agent for zzso imaging of human zzso tract zzso allowing an increased capability of zzso for rapid clinical diagnosis in zzso
