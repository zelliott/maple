We propose a framework for the extraction of zzso from zzso zzso representing zzso brain zzso zzso coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a zzso exists, about the zzso clinical zzso Our framework incorporates subject zzso into the zzso learning zzso Apart from gender and age, information such as zzso or a derived zzso is often available in clinical studies and can inform the zzso of a query zzso Such information, whether discrete or zzso is used as an additional input to zzso learning, extending the zzso zzso objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from zzso image zzso The zzso identified with the proposed method are zzso in contrast to a zzso defined zzso derived from, zzso manual or automated zzso They form a unified representation of both the imaging and zzso zzso providing a natural use for data analysis and zzso We test the method to zzso subjects with Alzheimer's Disease zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and healthy controls enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso zzso used are zzso zzso a risk factor associated with zzso and the zzso of zzso an established zzso for zzso In addition, we use zzso volume as a derived zzso to enrich the learned zzso Our zzso results compare favorably to what has been reported in a recent zzso using established zzso methods on the same zzso
