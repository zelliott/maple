During the last few years a need for simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso Besides the direct use of such measured quantities a series of zzso has been developed, especially to describe series of oxygen parameters of the zzso A zzso study involving 20 hospital centers in Denmark and Sweden was zzso zzso zzso gas zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso Denmark were zzso Each center was requested to perform daily quality control procedures using the zzso quality control system from zzso Blood samples were analyzed simultaneously on both types of zzso using local zzso During the study zzso blood data sets were zzso The quality control procedures showed that the zzso performed according to specifications with a few exceptions during the zzso Measured values of zzso were obtained for some samples allowing for calculation of a zzso equation for zzso and total zzso Average values for total zzso from zzso and zzso samples showed zzso zzso which is well below the typical normal value of zzso zzso This was reflected in the calculated value for total oxygen zzso zzso The measured quantities made calculation of zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso results, an internal quality procedure has been zzso zzso zzso was calculated based on actual values of pH and zzso and the standard zzso zzso curve, and then compared to the measured oxygen zzso The zzso between the calculated and measured values for the different types of blood samples showed that calculation of oxygen zzso should be used with great care for zzso values below 10 zzso and especially for zzso and zzso blood zzso
