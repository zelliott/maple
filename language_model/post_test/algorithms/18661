zzso chemistry experiments, such as zzso zzso require zzso techniques to reduce the effects of random errors of the measurement zzso The existing approaches have primarily relied on assumption of zzso models and zzso zzso Such models by constraining the data to remove random fluctuations may distort the data and cause loss of zzso The better the removal of random errors the greater is the likely introduction of systematic errors through the constraining fit zzso An alternative technique, reverse zzso is suggested that makes use of a more zzso approach of exponential smoothing of the first zzso zzso smoothing approaches have been generally unsatisfactory because they introduce significant data zzso The approaches given here compensates for the lag zzso and appears promising for the smoothing of many experimental data zzso including the zzso concentration data generated by zzso zzso Test results on simulated zzso data indicate that a zzso reduction in error may be typical over standard analyses zzso
