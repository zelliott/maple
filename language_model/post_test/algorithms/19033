zzso zzso threshold zzso zzso zzso for the X zzso states of zzso and zzso were measured using vacuum ultraviolet radiation generated by zzso mixing in zzso zzso density functional theory calculations at the zzso level and zzso calculations were made to aid zzso zzso Each zzso band consisted of several zzso due to different zzso zzso which could be assigned by using molecular parameters determined in the previous high resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso of generating zzso zzso selected and zzso zzso beam with decent intensity by zzso zzso was zzso The zzso energies to the X zzso states of zzso and zzso corrected for the zzso contribution were zzso and zzso zzso zzso
