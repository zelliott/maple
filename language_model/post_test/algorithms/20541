The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of zzso variables in spring hurdles and to find out how many trials are needed to achieve reliable zzso Seven British National level athletes in sprint hurdles were videotaped and all eight trials of each athlete were digitized from two camera views to produce three zzso zzso The reliability of 28 zzso variables across eight trials ranged from zzso to zzso for females and from zzso to zzso for zzso The number of trials needed to reach a certain reliability level was evaluated using zzso zzso formula, and in the worst case zzso zzso lost for zzso 78 trials would be needed to reach zzso zzso The results showed reasonably high zzso and the values for the female trials were generally higher than the male zzso The relative height of the hurdles zzso a more demanding clearance for males that can lead to increased variation within the subjects and thus lowered zzso zzso the results indicate that often more than one trial is needed to provide accurate quantitative results of the zzso
