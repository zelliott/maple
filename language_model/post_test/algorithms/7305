Digital Image zzso zzso is a well-established zzso optical zzso zzso It employs digital image analysis to extract the zzso zzso and strains that occur in objects subjected to external zzso Despite recent zzso progress, many problematic areas which greatly affect accuracy and that can zzso be avoided, received very little zzso zzso posed by the presence of sharp displacement zzso reflections, object borders or edges can be linked to the zzso zzso properties and zzso Other problematic areas, such as image noise, localized reflections or shadows are related more to the image acquisition zzso This paper proposes a new zzso zzso robust zzso method for zzso displacement measurement which addresses all of these problems in a straightforward and unified approach, significantly improving zzso measurement accuracy compared to classic zzso The proposed approach zzso a robust energy functional which zzso weighs zzso differences in the motion zzso zzso The aim is to limit the negative influence of zzso that present erroneous or inconsistent motions by enforcing local motion zzso The proposed method is compared to the classic zzso zzso method in terms of displacement accuracy in three zzso The first experiment is zzso and presents three combined problems: sharp displacement zzso missing image information and image zzso The second experiment is a real experiment in which a plastic zzso is developing a lateral crack due to the application of zzso zzso The region around the crack presents both reflections that zzso the image intensity levels leading to missing image information, as well as sharp motion zzso due to the plastic film zzso The third experiment compares the proposed and classic zzso approaches with generic computer vision optical flow methods using images from the popular zzso optical flow evaluation zzso zzso in all experiments clearly show the proposed zzso improved measurement accuracy with respect to the classic approach considering the challenging zzso Furthermore, in image areas where the classic approach completely fails to recover motion due to severe image zzso the proposed method provides reliable zzso
