The main aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of zzso in the assessment of left zzso zzso zzso volumes zzso zzso and ejection fraction zzso from gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso as the reference zzso By further comparing zzso and zzso with zzso the zzso characteristics were zzso to zzso clinical zzso zzso patients with suspected or proven coronary artery disease zzso were examined with gated zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso about 60 zzso after zzso injection at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated from gated zzso zzso using zzso and zzso On the same day, zzso (20 zzso zzso was performed, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso calculated using zzso zzso Both zzso worked with all data zzso zzso between the results of gated zzso zzso and zzso was high for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was significantly underestimated by zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso and zzso revealed no significant differences, whereas zzso yielded significantly lower values than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, agreement between gated zzso zzso and zzso is good across a wide range of clinically relevant zzso volume and zzso values assessed by zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso should be accounted for in the clinical context and limits interchangeable use of zzso
