This article compares three penalty terms with respect to the efficiency of supervised learning, by using zzso and zzso zzso learning zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Our experiments showed that for a reasonably adequate penalty factor, the combination of the squared penalty term and the zzso learning zzso drastically improves the convergence performance in comparison to the other combinations, at the same time bringing about excellent zzso zzso Moreover, in order to understand how differently each penalty term works, a function surface evaluation is zzso Finally, we show how cross validation can be applied to find an optimal penalty zzso
