The effects of zzso forming and breaking zzso on the linear and coherent zzso infrared zzso of the OH stretch of zzso in zzso are described by zzso not necessarily zzso fluctuations and simulated using the zzso zzso zzso Slow zzso zzso fluctuations are represented by a collective zzso zzso whereas fast zzso zzso frequency fluctuations are described using either a second collective zzso coordinate or a zzso jump zzso model for zzso zzso zzso for both models were obtained using a zzso zzso trajectory calculated using the zzso force field combined with an zzso zzso zzso zzso The asymmetry of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the blue side than on the red zzso predicted by the zzso is in better agreement with recent zzso
