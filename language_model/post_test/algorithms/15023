A zzso technique for the direct setup alignment of zzso circular fields from an zzso zzso to treatment room laser zzso is zzso zzso is achieved by acquiring images of the treatment room positioning laser zzso superimposed on the zzso circular field zzso An alignment zzso zzso the center of the zzso field image as well as the intersection of the laser zzso This determines any alignment zzso and the information is then used to translate the zzso zzso to its correct aligned zzso Two zzso each being sensitive to the zzso and zzso radiation, were used to acquire the zzso zzso The first detector consists of a zzso layer of zzso zzso deposited on a zzso copper plate and the second is zzso The zzso and detector system can detect zzso with a precision of approximately zzso zzso A device with zzso degrees of freedom was built in order to firmly hold the detector at any orientation perpendicular to the zzso beam zzso This device was used in conjunction with our alignment zzso to zzso the zzso sphere relative to the treatment room zzso over all zzso and couch angles used in dynamic zzso zzso
