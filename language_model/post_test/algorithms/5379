A new approach for zzso zzso in chemical zzso has been recently proposed zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2010, zzso zzso It makes use of an zzso criterion based on a zzso Fisher zzso zzso Its utility has been demonstrated with two reaction mechanisms, the zzso and zzso which are zzso stiff zzso In this zzso the performance of the zzso zzso is compared to that obtained from zzso of the squared distances between the observed and predicted zzso obtained by solving the corresponding initial value problem (we call this latter approach zzso for zzso zzso of the proposed zzso zzso method with the zzso one has revealed their differences in zzso This difference can be seen as a zzso between speed (which favors zzso and accuracy (which favors the traditional zzso The zzso and zzso systems are again chosen as case zzso An zzso analysis is performed for both of them, followed by an optimal experimental design based on the Fisher Information zzso zzso This allows to identify and overcome most of the previously encountered zzso issues, improving the zzso zzso With the new data, obtained from zzso designed experiments, it is now possible to estimate effectively more parameters than with the previous zzso This result, which holds for both zzso and traditional methods, stresses the importance of an appropriate experimental zzso Finally, a new hybrid method that combines advantages from the zzso and traditional approaches is zzso
