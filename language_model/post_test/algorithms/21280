zzso zzso of zzso has been used to measure the dependence of zzso zzso zzso on oxygen concentration in suspensions of isolated rat liver zzso An instrument has been designed which simultaneously monitors the zzso lifetime of a zzso and the reduction of zzso c by dual wavelength zzso The zzso lifetime method gives very rapid (less than 100 zzso measure of the oxygen concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Green, zzso zzso and Wilson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso characteristic of zzso media to as low as 2 zzso zzso zzso The results may be summarized as zzso For well coupled rat liver zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso as the oxygen concentration was zzso increased zzso c reduction was observed to begin at oxygen zzso greater than 20 zzso For zzso in the presence of zzso zzso c reduction began at oxygen zzso less than zzso zzso The oxygen dependence of reduction of zzso c in well coupled zzso treated with zzso was strongly dependent on the pH of the suspending zzso Reduction of zzso c began at higher oxygen zzso as the pH was made more zzso The oxygen concentration for zzso respiratory rates was much larger for well coupled zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso treated with zzso (less than zzso zzso It is concluded that the oxygen dependence of zzso zzso zzso is such that zzso could function in their proposed role of tissue oxygen sensors for regulation of such diverse functions as local blood flow and electrical activity in the carotid zzso
