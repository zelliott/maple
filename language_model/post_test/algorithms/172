We consider curve evolution based on comparing zzso of features, and its applications for scene zzso In the first part, we promote using zzso metrics such as the Earth zzso zzso zzso instead of standard zzso metrics as the zzso or zzso zzso To derive flow equations for minimizing zzso involving the zzso we employ a zzso expression for calculating zzso between one-dimensional zzso We then apply the derived flows to various examples of single image zzso and to scene analysis using video zzso In the latter, we consider the problem of zzso a scene to spatial regions in which different activities zzso We use a zzso local representation of the regions by considering multiple one-dimensional zzso of zzso zzso zzso We then obtain zzso zzso of regions using the flows derived in the first part of the zzso Our results are demonstrated on challenging surveillance scenes, and compare favorably with state-of-the-art results using zzso representations by dynamic systems or zzso of zzso
