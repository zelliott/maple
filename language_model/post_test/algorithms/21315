The hypothesis that energy zzso at individual spatial locations in single zzso zzso zzso zzso projection images can be analyzed to separate the zzso component from the zzso component is tested zzso An zzso zzso phantom consisting of a cylinder with a sphere is zzso with either the cylinder or the sphere containing zzso An zzso zzso zzso and a fitting zzso are given and employed to analyze the acquired zzso zzso separation into an zzso component and a zzso component is judged on the basis of zzso reconstruction of corrected zzso In the zzso zzso correction is based on the known geometry and the total zzso cross section for zzso An independent test of the accuracy of separation is not zzso For both zzso reconstructed slices for the zzso zzso phantom have the correct shape as confirmed by simulation results that take into account the measured dependence of system resolution on zzso For the inverse zzso a hot sphere in a cold zzso quantitative results with the fitting zzso are accurate but with a particular number of zzso of the erosion zzso are less zzso (A greater number of zzso would improve the zzso error with the algorithm, zzso These preliminary results encourage us to believe that a method for correcting for zzso in a wide variety of objects can be found, thus helping to achieve quantitative zzso
