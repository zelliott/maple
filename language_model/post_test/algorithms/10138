zzso zzso are critical for numerous diagnostic and therapeutic applications, yet their utility is limited by their variable propensity to zzso either at low zzso for zzso fragments or high zzso for full-length zzso zzso determining the sequence and structural features that differentiate zzso zzso from zzso ones is critical to improving their zzso We have investigated the molecular origins of zzso zzso for human zzso domain zzso that differ only in the sequence of the zzso containing their zzso determining regions zzso yet such zzso possess dramatically different zzso zzso in a manner not correlated with their zzso zzso We find the propensity of these zzso to zzso after being zzso unfolded is not a distributed property of the zzso zzso but can be localized to zzso hotspots within and near the first zzso zzso Moreover, we have identified a zzso of charged zzso within zzso and a single charged zzso adjacent to zzso that zzso the poorly soluble zzso with the desirable zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso we find that several other charged zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso scaffold are incapable of preventing zzso We expect that our identification of zzso hotspots that govern zzso zzso within and zzso to zzso zzso will guide the design and selection of zzso that not only possess high affinity and zzso stability, but also extreme resistance to zzso
