We have measured the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso adhesive protein zzso on a zzso zzso zzso gold surface, using three independent zzso zzso crystal zzso with dissipation monitoring zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso data shows that, after zzso to zzso of zzso zzso of the protein layer using zzso zzso it from an extended zzso 20 zzso zzso and zzso state to a much thinner zzso 5 zzso zzso and less zzso zzso Furthermore, we show how quantitative data about the zzso zzso elastic zzso and zzso zzso of the protein film can be obtained with the zzso technique, even beyond the zzso regime, if frequency zzso and energy dissipation zzso zzso measured at multiple zzso are combined with theoretical simulations using a zzso zzso zzso The modeling result was confirmed by substituting zzso for zzso As expected, the zzso substitution does not influence the actual zzso behavior, but resulted in expected differences in the estimated effective density and zzso zzso These results provide new insight and understanding about the zzso zzso and zzso behavior of zzso They also demonstrate how the above three techniques complement each other for zzso zzso zzso
