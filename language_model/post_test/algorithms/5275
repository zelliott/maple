zzso zzso is a zzso modification of many zzso and zzso zzso It zzso zzso interactions that are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the intrinsic feature of zzso protein remains elusive and remains to be zzso This investigation presents zzso which is a zzso method based on a support zzso machine zzso for predicting protein zzso zzso The approach was developed to consider structural information such as concerning the secondary structure and zzso accessibility of zzso acids that surround the zzso zzso One hundred zzso zzso verified zzso zzso sites were identified using zzso release zzso The results of a zzso zzso evaluation suggest that the accessibility of the zzso around the zzso sites contributes substantially to zzso zzso The zzso zzso can achieve an accuracy of zzso in zzso cross validation when sequence zzso weighted zzso zzso is coupled with values of the accessible surface area zzso The proposed method significantly zzso previous methods for accurately predicting the location of zzso zzso zzso
