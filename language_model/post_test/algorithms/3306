The objective of this work was to evaluate the zzso detection performance of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction schemes using zzso acquired zzso A zzso zzso phantom was set up to mimic zzso zzso zzso cancer imaging and scanned 12 times in zzso mode, obtaining count levels typical of noisy clinical zzso Eight of the scans had 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso placed throughout the phantom with various zzso zzso This provided zzso and zzso zzso with known truth appropriate for evaluating zzso zzso by zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso Four reconstruction schemes were zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4) zzso zzso with an accurate zzso function zzso zzso Two forms of zzso analysis were zzso First, a zzso zzso zzso observer was used to zzso processing parameters zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the human observer zzso Human observers then rated each image and selected the zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve ( zzso and the probability of correct zzso were used as zzso The results of the human observer study found no statistically significant difference between zzso and zzso ( zzso and zzso respectively), an increase in zzso detection performance for zzso ( zzso zzso and additional improvement with the use of the zzso model ( zzso zzso The zzso zzso observer provided the same rankings among zzso but obtained different values of zzso These results show improved zzso detection performance for the reconstruction zzso with more sophisticated statistical and imaging models as compared to the zzso zzso
