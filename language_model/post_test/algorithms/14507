The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared through the zzso process using zzso Black 5 zzso and zzso zzso Orange zzso zzso zzso respectively, as templates and zzso as a zzso The zzso exhibited significantly higher zzso capacities of the zzso than other zzso formed without a dye template and with three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso on the zzso was affected by the initial zzso dye zzso and zzso The results were in accordance with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the E values of the zzso calculated using the zzso model revealed that the zzso process may be due to the dual nature of the process, zzso and zzso and that zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso processes in the zzso were spontaneous and zzso Moreover, competition zzso through analysis of the zzso diffusion model apparently favored the zzso dye more than the zzso dye on the zzso in mixture solution zzso The zzso for the zzso of the zzso were zzso efficiently through the alkaline solution and were then zzso for dye zzso
