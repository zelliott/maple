Research on motion analysis of swimmers is commonly based on video recordings of the zzso motion, which are analyzed by manual zzso of feature points by an zzso This procedure has two main zzso it is zzso and it is affected by low zzso zzso the application of zzso automatic approaches to motion analysis was zzso A zzso zzso system for the analysis of arm movements during front crawl swimming was zzso The method proposed by zzso et zzso zzso was modified in order to be used into water zzso Three zzso coordinates of shoulder, elbow and wrist zzso centers of 5 sprint swimmers performing front crawl swimming were zzso zzso joint zzso was also zzso zzso and reliability of the proposed technique were evaluated by means of comparison with traditional manual zzso zzso Reality Motion Systems zzso Root mean square distance zzso values between zzso estimated with the two techniques were zzso zzso show good accuracy for wrist joint zzso and zzso evaluated on one subject, comparable to the zzso zzso associated with the manual zzso zzso The proposed technique is therefore very promising for zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso
