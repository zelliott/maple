In this paper we present results of zzso calculation of the zzso zzso model of biological aging, modified for the case of a zzso zzso rate zzso where a is the parent's zzso The zzso rate zzso is the probability per bit of an extra bad zzso introduced in offspring inherited zzso We assume that zzso increases with age zzso As compared with the reference case of the standard zzso model based on a constant zzso rate m , the dynamics of the population growth shows distinct changes in age distribution of the zzso Here we concentrate on mortality zzso a fraction of items eliminated from the population when we go from age zzso to zzso in simulated transition from time zzso to next time zzso The zzso observed zzso dependence essentially follows the zzso exponential law for a above the minimum reproduction zzso zzso from the zzso law is however observed for the very old items, close to the zzso zzso This effect may also result from an increase in zzso rate m with age a discussed in this zzso The zzso calculations are based on zzso solution of the zzso model, presented in a series of papers by Coe et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso calculations are supported by the data obtained from computer simulation based on the solution by Coe et zzso
