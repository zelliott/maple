A strategy for modeling continuous as well as zzso sites in protein structures has been zzso Central to this modeling strategy is the search zzso of zzso a program to search a given target structure for suitable combinations of backbone positions mirroring as closely as possible the geometric relationships of a source structural motif of zzso All target sites detected by zzso are further refined to mimic the source zzso The zzso zzso library concept fails to precisely describe side chains involved in zzso bonding zzso metal binding zzso Therefore an zzso using detailed zzso bonding zzso information was applied for the zzso zzso The zzso program and the subsequent processing of the program output are presented in a test zzso The zzso zzso a zzso bundle structure, served as the target zzso It was searched for candidate sites to model a variety of metal binding sites, with structures extracted from Brookhaven zzso Database zzso The preliminary protein models were investigated for structural zzso with neighboring zzso by interactive computer zzso if required, additional changes were zzso A set of parameters for energy zzso with zzso (including metal zzso was developed, and the completed zzso zzso were energy zzso Finally, 12 potentially metal binding zzso zzso were selected for production via genetic zzso
