zzso zzso is a simple, yet effective method to discover all the genes present in a variety of zzso Although using zzso is a cost-effective approach in gene discovery, the amount of data, and hence the zzso resources required, make it a very challenging zzso Time and storage requirements for zzso zzso problems are zzso zzso zzso tools have zzso time complexity resulting from all against all sequence zzso With the rapid growth of zzso data we need better and faster zzso zzso In this paper, we present zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso We report that zzso can cluster a 10,000 Human zzso zzso (which is also used in zzso zzso in zzso minutes on a 1 zzso zzso III zzso which is 36 times faster than the original zzso zzso A parallel version of zzso zzso is also developed and used to cluster zzso soybean zzso sequences on zzso Linux cluster at National Center for zzso zzso at zzso The parallel zzso exhibited excellent zzso over its sequential counterpart and its memory requirements are almost negligible making it suitable to run virtually on any data zzso The performance of the proposed zzso zzso is compared against other known zzso techniques and results are reported in the zzso
