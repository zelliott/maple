In this paper, a new dynamic zzso neural network zzso with online adjusting hidden layer and weights is proposed for a class of extended Hammerstein systems with zzso zzso zzso zzso to the network is first determined by means of system order zzso using a designated input zzso Then the hidden layer is generated online, which consists of a growing step according to the plant dynamics and a revised pruning step used to refine the hidden structure such that the generated model can be a minimal realization with satisfactory zzso The zzso is capable of adjusting both the network structure and weights simultaneously by using of weight variations as the conditions of structure zzso An integrated performance including the identification error and an additional zzso penalty term is employed such that the model can zzso the zzso noises as well as match the unknown plant automatically with a suitable zzso zzso of the weights is guaranteed by suitably choosing the learning zzso The proposed zzso can be established without a zzso knowledge of the unknown zzso The efficiency of the method is illustrated through the applications to three different Hammerstein zzso
