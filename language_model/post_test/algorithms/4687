We present a novel zzso for baseline zzso in zzso The new zzso which we have named as accelerated zzso moving average zzso is combined to three zzso zzso zzso zzso moving average, and zzso moving average zzso to achieve real-time baseline correction with commercial zzso The successful performance of zzso is demonstrated with simulated and experimental zzso zzso comparison of experimental data clearly shows the improvement zzso provides to the linear fitting, zzso and accuracy zzso zzso of zzso zzso
