The ability of the zzso force field to reproduce partition zzso between water and two less polar zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of 18 of the 20 naturally occurring zzso acids has been zzso The zzso of the zzso free energies in water, in zzso solution, and zzso solution are based on zzso integration free energy calculations using molecular dynamics zzso The calculations show that while the force field reproduces the experimental zzso free energies of zzso zzso with reasonable accuracy the zzso free energies of polar zzso in water are systematically overestimated zzso zzso The dependence of the calculated free energies on the atomic partial charges was also zzso
