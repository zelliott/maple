Using a zzso equation approach, we obtain zzso equations for zzso population zzso and mean fitness functions for zzso and zzso zzso biological evolution models with general smooth zzso fitness zzso Our zzso solutions of zzso biological evolution models confirm the zzso equations zzso We also study the parallel zzso model for the simple case of zzso and calculate the zzso of distribution, which is consistent with zzso zzso
