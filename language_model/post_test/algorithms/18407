Human serum contains a complex array of zzso derived peptides zzso zzso that may provide a correlate of biological events occurring in the entire zzso for instance, as a diagnostic for solid tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hitt, zzso zzso Levine, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Steinberg, zzso zzso Mills, zzso zzso Simone, zzso Fishman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2002, zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel, automated technology platform for the simultaneous measurement of serum peptides that is simple, zzso and generates highly zzso zzso zzso are captured and concentrated using zzso zzso batch processing in a magnetic zzso format, automated on a liquid handling robot, and followed by a zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The protocol is based on a detailed investigation of serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso selection, zzso zzso design, an zzso spectral acquisition program, and consistent peak extraction plus zzso across a study zzso The improved sensitivity and resolution allowed detection of 400 zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso 50 zzso of serum, and almost 2000 unique peptides in larger sample sets, which can then be analyzed using common zzso data analysis zzso A pilot study indicated that zzso from brain tumor patients can be distinguished from controls based on a pattern of zzso zzso zzso This, in turn, served to create a learning zzso that correctly predicted zzso of the samples as either normal or zzso
