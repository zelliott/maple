The zzso protein zzso is an essential component of zzso II zzso and is present in all zzso zzso zzso allows correct water splitting and oxygen evolution by stabilizing the reactions driven by the zzso zzso Despite its important role, its structure and detailed functional mechanism are still zzso In this article we propose a structural model based on fold recognition and molecular zzso This model has additional support from a study of the distribution of characteristics of the zzso sequence family, such as the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and correlated zzso Our zzso results consistently showed zzso as an zzso zzso zzso with two zzso beta zzso of approximately 120 zzso acids linked by a flexible zzso zzso zzso These features are compatible with a general zzso and flexible architecture, in which the two zzso form a zzso structure with Greek key zzso The first domain is predicted to include 8 to 9 zzso the second domain 6 to 7 zzso An zzso zzso structure was selected as a template to build the 3-D zzso The second domain has, between the zzso zzso rich in Pro and zzso that are difficult to zzso One of these long zzso includes a highly zzso region (between zzso and zzso and a short zzso (between zzso and zzso These regions are characteristic parts of zzso and show that the second domain is not so similar to the zzso Overall, the model was able to account for much of the experimental data reported by several authors, and it would allow the detection of key zzso and regions that are proposed in this article as essential for the structure and function of zzso
