We demonstrated an unexplored issue in zzso Mass zzso zzso site zzso and formulated zzso to distinguish true zzso from false zzso We showed how the zzso site clusters skew zzso database zzso zzso the information content of an in zzso zzso of a zzso both the number of matches of long peptides and the number of such peptides an entry can generate are taken into zzso The zzso zzso allows tolerance of zzso of query mass values from theoretical mass values and fewer matches are needed to identify true zzso
