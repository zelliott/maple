zzso quality correction zzso zzso which reflects the absorbed energy dependence of the zzso is calculated for solid state detector materials zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso source using the zzso zzso zzso code zzso The study also includes calculation of zzso phantom scatter corrections zzso zzso solid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso solid water, virtual water and plastic zzso Above corrections are calculated as a function of distance r along the zzso axis of the zzso zzso zzso is about unity for the zzso zzso zzso detector shows a gradual decrease in zzso zzso with r zzso is about zzso over the distance range of 1 - 15 zzso Diamond detector shows a gradual increase in zzso zzso r (about zzso larger than unity at 15 zzso the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso with r steeply (about zzso over the distance range of 1 - 15 zzso The study shows that some solid state detectors demonstrate zzso zzso zzso but the degree zzso from unity depends on the type of solid phantom and the zzso
