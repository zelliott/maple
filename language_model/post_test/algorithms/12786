Analysis of zzso from our zzso dynamics simulation package, zzso is used to find regions on the surface of zzso proteins that form frequent and tenacious encounter complexes with their binding zzso zzso partners are significantly more likely to sojourn around true binding regions than around the remainder of the protein zzso This information is used to restrict the search space for flexible zzso zzso using our zzso algorithm, reducing the zzso expense of zzso and improving or matching the ranking of successfully zzso poses for all but four of 26 test zzso Running the simulations with external zzso zzso at near zzso zzso further enhances the binding region, compared to simulations without external zzso Information gleaned from these simulations can give zzso insights into binding zzso The application of these techniques to zzso targets 32 and zzso is zzso
