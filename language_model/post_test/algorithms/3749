To evaluate the early clinical results achieved with an zzso adjusted for an expanded range of correction in zzso customized zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Fort Worth, zzso 

Fifty-five consecutive eyes from 31 patients underwent zzso zzso laser in zzso zzso zzso zzso and BD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso These were normal zzso and zzso eyes that had never been operated zzso The zzso equivalent zzso error was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ranged from 0 to zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eyes were treated according to the zzso protocol using the commercial zzso zzso Patients were followed for at least 2 months and standard visual zzso were taken and recorded at 1 day and 1, 3, and 6 months after zzso The results of treatment were assessed using the following zzso zzso visual acuity zzso and best zzso visual acuity zzso manifest zzso equivalent zzso error; zzso measurement of high order zzso and zzso reports of visual symptoms by zzso 

One month after zzso the mean manifest zzso equivalent zzso error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent and zzso of eyes had manifest zzso equivalent zzso error within zzso D and zzso D of attempted zzso respectively, with zzso of eyes with zzso or better zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso and zzso zzso The mean high order aberrations zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso preoperatively and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High order aberrations were either reduced, zzso or increased by zzso in zzso of zzso zzso patients reported no visual symptoms and had no complaints regarding the quality of their zzso 

The new zzso zzso for higher zzso errors appears to be effective in improving zzso and a minority of patients demonstrated an increase in the magnitude of high order aberrations when compared to zzso zzso A slight zzso equivalent refraction zzso will be addressed with future zzso zzso
