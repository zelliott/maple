This study sought to compare increasing doses of zzso zzso zzso or zzso sodium zzso versus intravenous zzso zzso for fractional flow reserve zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is the critical prerequisite for zzso zzso Despite zzso zzso currently representing the recommended approach, zzso administration of zzso or other coronary zzso constitutes a valuable alternative in everyday zzso However, it is surprisingly unclear which zzso strategy allows the achievement of zzso values comparable to zzso zzso 

Fifty intermediate coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso measurement were zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso induced by incremental zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso 600 zzso zzso by zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso values, symptoms, and development of zzso block were zzso 

zzso doses of zzso zzso and zzso were well tolerated and associated with fewer symptoms than zzso zzso zzso doses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a significant decrease of zzso compared with baseline levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only was associated with zzso values similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among the 10 patients with zzso values zzso with zzso 5 were correctly identified also by zzso 6 by zzso 7 by zzso and 6 by zzso 

zzso zzso at doses higher than currently suggested, allows obtaining zzso values similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso which remains the gold standard, might thus be reserved for those zzso with zzso zzso values after high (up to 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso
