We tested the impact of different values of the relaxation zzso zzso zzso on contrast and noise in zzso zzso maximum likelihood zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Phantom studies were performed on a zzso XL zzso zzso The zzso (National zzso Manufacturers zzso zzso technical zzso torso phantom was used and acquisition data were reconstructed with zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso Quality of the reconstructed images was evaluated by contrast recovery zzso and background zzso values according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso recovery zzso and background zzso increased significantly when zzso zzso The best zzso zzso was obtained with zzso in the zzso zzso For zzso zzso the manufacturer allows a possible zzso choice from zzso to zzso We would not advise too small zzso or too large zzso zzso values which result in too smooth or too noisy zzso 

We determined optimal zzso values in zzso on a zzso XL zzso zzso zzso is needed when using zzso values out of that zzso
