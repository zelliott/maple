Recently, the first drug in a new class of zzso zzso drugs was approved, the fusion inhibitor zzso We develop a mathematical model that describes the binding of the virus to T zzso We model the effect of zzso upon this process using impulsive differential zzso We find zzso and determine stability in the case of no therapy and then when therapy is taken with perfect zzso We determine zzso thresholds for the dosage and dosing intervals to ensure the zzso equilibrium remains zzso We also explore the effects of partial zzso Our theoretical results suggest that partial adherence may, at times, be worse than no therapy at all, but at other times may in fact as good as perfect zzso It follows that patients should be zzso on the importance of adherence to this new zzso zzso
