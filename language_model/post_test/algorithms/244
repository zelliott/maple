zzso sampling of signals is a key issue for zzso zzso experiments to establish the best ratio between experiment time and spectral zzso zzso on the most widely used sampling strategy using standard zzso sampling and data analysis by zzso zzso a central question is concerned with determining the optimal maximum sampling time in the individual zzso The spectral resolution depends directly on this choice, as do the overall experiment times when addressing the indirect zzso We present a zzso zzso and experimental analysis of the sampling space problem and propose approaches to efficient sampling for typical zzso
