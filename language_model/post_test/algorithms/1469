This paper describes the use of a visual programming environment zzso for the flux analysis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathways are constructed in software from individual reaction elements zzso which are linked together to indicate potential flux zzso zzso zzso data are then used to supply the zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso The zzso system can be zzso at different levels of complexity and new pathways can be inserted into existing zzso To illustrate this, flux analyses are performed on three zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso deletions and zzso The first analysis looks at organic acid production and the second at the effect of the presence in zzso coli of an engineered zzso for zzso zzso
