We have developed an approach to identify zzso zzso that is based on zzso and zzso technologies, without the use of zzso zzso The approach, designed for use on zzso of small size zzso zzso was tested on cells infected by either of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The viral zzso were scanned zzso for zzso using an zzso zzso we have zzso zzso zzso suggested by this analysis were then zzso as zzso on zzso and the zzso were zzso with small zzso from infected zzso zzso zzso that scored positive on the zzso were then subjected to zzso Northern zzso zzso Using this approach, 10 of the known zzso zzso were identified, as well as a novel zzso that had earlier escaped zzso This method also led to the identification of seven new zzso zzso by using additional zzso approaches, we identified a total of 18 new zzso zzso that produce 22 mature zzso zzso thereby more than zzso the total number of zzso known zzso zzso The advantages and limitations of the approach are zzso
