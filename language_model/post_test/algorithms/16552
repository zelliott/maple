Biological processes often depend on zzso binding events, yet accurate calculation of the associated zzso remains as a significant challenge of central importance to zzso drug zzso Recently, we have proposed that the displacement of zzso waters by the zzso replacing them with groups complementary to the protein surface, is the principal driving force for zzso zzso and we have introduced the zzso method to account this zzso However, in spite of the zzso zzso abhors zzso one can occasionally observe situations in which a portion of the zzso active site is so zzso for water molecules that a void is formed zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of dry regions in the zzso has a zzso effect on zzso binding zzso and suggest that such regions may represent a general motif for molecular recognition between the dry region in the zzso and the zzso groups in the zzso With the introduction of a term attributable to the occupation of the dry regions by zzso zzso combined with the zzso zzso we obtain excellent agreement with experiment for the prediction of relative binding affinities for a number of zzso zzso series binding to the major urinary protein zzso In addition, zzso when combined with the cavity contribution is more zzso than at least one specific zzso zzso zzso Young zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J Am zzso zzso zzso of the popular zzso approach to binding affinity zzso
