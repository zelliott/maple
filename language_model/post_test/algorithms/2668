Interest point detection is an important research area in the field of image processing and computer zzso In particular, image retrieval and object categorization heavily rely on interest point detection from which local image zzso are zzso for image zzso In general, interest points are based on zzso and color has been largely zzso However, the use of color increases the distinctiveness of interest zzso The use of color may therefore provide selective search reducing the total number of interest points used for image zzso This paper proposes color interest points for sparse image zzso To reduce the sensitivity to varying imaging conditions, zzso interest points are zzso Color statistics based on occurrence probability lead to color zzso points, which are obtained through zzso feature zzso Furthermore, a principal component zzso scale selection method is proposed, which gives a robust scale zzso per interest zzso From large-scale experiments, it is shown that the proposed color interest point detector has higher zzso than a zzso zzso Furthermore, in the context of image zzso a reduced and predictable number of color features show an increase in performance compared to state-of-the-art interest zzso Finally, in the context of object recognition, for the Pascal zzso 2007 challenge, our method gives comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods using only a small fraction of the features, reducing the computing time zzso
