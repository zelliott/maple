The performance of an image registration zzso software was evaluated for automatically detecting known errors simulated through the movement of zzso using an onboard zzso zzso zzso errors (11 zzso 10 zzso 6 translation and zzso were simulated by introducing offset up to zzso 15 zzso in three principal axes and zzso to zzso zzso in zzso For every simulated error, zzso zzso zzso and cone beam CT were acquired in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were automatically zzso to reference digitally reconstructed zzso zzso and planning CT using zzso and zzso matching software based on mutual information zzso A total of 79 image sets zzso pairs of zzso zzso and 69 session of zzso were analyzed to determine the zzso zzso of zzso outcome and zzso residual error, defined as the zzso between the known and zzso software detected displacement in translation and zzso The zzso of automatic zzso of planning CT and repeat zzso taken with and without zzso detector and zzso X-ray source arm movement was excellent with mean zzso of zzso zzso in the translation and zzso in zzso The average residual errors in translation and rotation were within zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for setup simulated only in translation, zzso and both translation and zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso was largest when only zzso error was simulated and was zzso zzso zzso for zzso match of reference zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso match of reference CT and zzso with full fan and half fan, zzso In conclusion, the zzso radiation therapy zzso system is accurate within zzso zzso and zzso and zzso under control zzso Inherent error from any zzso process should be taken into account while setting clinical zzso zzso
