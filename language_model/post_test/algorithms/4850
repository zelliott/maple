We introduce an original pulse zzso zzso which is a block zzso zzso sequence employing as basic element a zzso pulse sandwiched by zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso method allows the efficient zzso of zzso zzso between zzso zzso submitted to very large chemical shift zzso We demonstrate that this technique can be employed in zzso zzso zzso correlation experiment at high magnetic field zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso The performances of zzso are compared to those of the zzso zzso methods, such as BABA and bracketed zzso which were already employed at fast zzso zzso The zzso sequence displays a higher zzso to zzso and offset than the other existing zzso
