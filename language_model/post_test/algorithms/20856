A method is presented to use continuous wave electron zzso resonance imaging for rapid measurement of oxygen partial pressure in three spatial zzso A particulate zzso probe is employed to create a sparse distribution of spins in a volume of zzso Information zzso location and spectral zzso is collected by varying the spatial orientation and strength of an applied magnetic zzso zzso Data processing exploits the spatial zzso of spins to detect zzso with zzso spin and to estimate the spectral zzso for those zzso The zzso representation of spin locations and zzso permits an order of magnitude reduction in data acquisition time, compared to zzso zzso reconstruction using traditional zzso zzso The proposed zzso method is zzso demonstrated for a zzso zzso zzso zzso probe using an zzso zzso zzso
