Support zzso machines zzso are the state-of-the-art models for many zzso problems, but they suffer from the complexity of their training algorithm, which is at least zzso with respect to the number of zzso zzso it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundred thousand examples with zzso This article proposes a new mixture of zzso that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each zzso is trained on a small subset of the whole data zzso zzso on a large benchmark data set zzso yielded significant time improvement zzso complexity appears zzso to locally grow zzso with the number of zzso In addition, and surprisingly, a significant improvement in zzso was zzso
