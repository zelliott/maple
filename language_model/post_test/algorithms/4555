An inclusion complex of zzso zzso zzso an zzso highly water soluble zzso and zzso zzso was prepared by the zzso zzso The complex was further characterized by differential scanning zzso zzso X-ray powder zzso zzso zzso zzso red zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and in zzso dissolution zzso The dissolution of zzso from the inclusion complex studied by the dispersed powder technique showed significant dissolution enhancement in case of the zzso product zzso compared to pure zzso The complex possessed good zzso and the zzso so compressed displayed good dissolution zzso The dissolution data were characterized by different model independent parameters such as dissolution efficiency zzso difference factor zzso and similarity factor zzso
