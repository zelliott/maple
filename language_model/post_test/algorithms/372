Copy number variations zzso may play an important role in disease risk by altering dosage of genes and other regulatory zzso which may have functional and, ultimately, zzso zzso zzso determining whether a zzso is associated or not with a given disease might be relevant in understanding the genesis and progression of human zzso Current stage technology give zzso probe signal from which copy number status is zzso zzso uncertainty of zzso calling in the statistical analysis is therefore a highly important zzso In this paper, we present a framework for assessing association between zzso and disease in zzso studies where uncertainty is taken into zzso We also indicate how to use the model to analyze continuous traits and adjust for zzso zzso 

Through simulation studies, we show that our method zzso other simple methods based on zzso the underlying zzso and assessing association using regular tests that do not zzso call zzso We apply the method to a real data set in a controlled zzso experiment showing good zzso The methodology is also extended to illustrate how to analyze zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that our method is robust and achieves zzso theoretical power since it zzso uncertainty when copy number status are zzso We have made R functions freely zzso
