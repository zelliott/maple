Nuclear zzso effects zzso were measured between water zzso and zzso of the zzso acid side chain of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Positive zzso were observed between the gamma zzso group of zzso and the water zzso with similar zzso zzso at pH zzso and pH zzso in both the laboratory frame and the rotating frame of zzso These results indicate that the residence times of the zzso water molecules near the zzso zzso zzso are shorter than 500 zzso for both the charged form and the zzso form of zzso and hence comparable to the water residence times near zzso zzso acid side zzso Furthermore, this study shows that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid groups is not likely to interfere with the observation of zzso water zzso which is in contrast to the zzso zzso of the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso
