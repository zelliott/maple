A molecular zzso protocol is proposed for finding and scoring zzso binding zzso This protocol uses the recently developed reconnaissance zzso method, which employs a zzso zzso to construct a bias that pushes the system away from the kinetic traps where it would otherwise zzso The exploration of phase space with this zzso is shown to be roughly six to eight times faster than unbiased molecular dynamics and is only limited by the time taken to diffuse about the surface of the zzso We apply this method to the well-studied zzso system and show that we are able to zzso all the poses obtained from a reference zzso blind zzso zzso These poses can be scored based on the length of time the system remains trapped in the zzso zzso one can perform zzso reduction on the output trajectory and obtain a map of phase space that can be used in more expensive zzso zzso
