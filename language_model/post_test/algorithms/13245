A rigorous surface integral equation approach is proposed to study the spontaneous zzso of a quantum zzso embedded in a multilayered zzso structure with the presence of arbitrarily shaped metallic zzso With the aid of the zzso golden rule, the spontaneous zzso of the zzso can be calculated from the local density of states, which can be further expressed by the imaginary part of the zzso Green's function of the whole electromagnetic zzso To obtain this Green's function zzso a surface integral equation is established taking into account the scattering from the metallic zzso zzso the modeling of the zzso multilayered structure is simplified by applying the layered medium Green's function to reduce the zzso domain and hence the memory zzso Regarding the evaluation of zzso zzso in the layered medium Green's function, the discrete complex image method is adopted to accelerate the evaluation zzso This work offers an accurate and efficient simulation tool for analyzing complex multilayered zzso system, which is commonly encountered in the design of optical elements and zzso
