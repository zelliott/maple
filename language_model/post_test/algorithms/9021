zzso crashes are dynamic and complex events in which head impacts with the roof can cause catastrophic neck zzso zzso zzso and zzso models are valuable in understanding, and ultimately zzso these zzso Although neck posture and muscle activity influence the resulting injury, there is currently no in zzso data describing these parameters immediately prior to a head-first zzso The specific objectives of this study were to determine the in zzso neck zzso alignment and muscle zzso levels when upside down, a condition that occurs during a zzso Eleven human subjects zzso zzso were tested while seated upright and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso alignment was measured using zzso and muscle activity was recorded using surface and zzso zzso in eight superficial and deep neck zzso In zzso zzso alignment and muscle zzso levels differed between the upright and zzso zzso When zzso and relaxed, the neck was more zzso C1 was aligned zzso to zzso the zzso plane was extended, and the activity of six muscles increased compared to upright and zzso When zzso subjects were asked to look forward to eliminate head extension, zzso muscle activity increased, zzso was more zzso and C1 was aligned anterior to zzso versus upright and zzso Combined with the large zzso zzso observed, these findings indicate that zzso or zzso models designed to study injuries and prevention devices while zzso need to consider a variety of postures and muscle conditions to be relevant to the in zzso zzso
