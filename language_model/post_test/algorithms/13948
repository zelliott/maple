We present a novel approach to optical zzso and initial clinical zzso We have designed and developed a zzso zzso optical scanner that performs a zzso zzso scan of the female breast in approximately 3 zzso The probing light is a zzso zzso and 810 zzso zzso average zzso zzso laser zzso and the detection optical fiber is 5 zzso in zzso The zzso zzso and phase data are processed with use of an zzso that performs edge effect corrections, thereby enhancing image zzso This contrast enhancement results in a greater tumor zzso compared with simple light intensity zzso The optical zzso are displayed on a computer screen in real zzso We present zzso and optical zzso from two patients with breast zzso Our initial clinical results show that the zzso zzso even at the present stage of development, has the potential to be a useful tool in zzso
