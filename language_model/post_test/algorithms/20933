In this paper, we present a model that explains the zzso of zzso vessel zzso in collagen zzso This model is derived using the theory of two phase rubber material due to zzso and zzso and it consists of two coupled fourth order partial differential equations describing the evolution of the collagen volume zzso and the evolution of the zzso concentration in a collagen zzso as described in experiments of zzso and Swartz zzso zzso 92, zzso zzso Using linear stability analysis, we find that above a critical level of zzso zzso spatial patterns form due to small zzso in the initially uniform steady zzso Using a long wavelength reduction, we can reduce the two coupled partial differential equations to one fourth order equation that is very similar to the zzso zzso however, it has more complex zzso and zzso We present the results of zzso simulations and discuss the biological implications of our zzso
