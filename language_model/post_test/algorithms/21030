zzso zzso zzso has a trend towards higher resolution and higher zzso This development has increased the interest in zzso smoothing techniques for CT, which aim to reduce noise while preserving structures of zzso However, existing smoothing techniques are slow, which makes clinical application zzso Furthermore, the published methods have limitations with respect to preserving small details in CT zzso This paper presents a widely zzso speed zzso framework for zzso smoothing zzso A second contribution of this paper is an extension to an existing smoothing technique aimed at better preserving small structures of interest in CT zzso Based on zzso image structure, the method first determines an importance map, which indicates potentially relevant structures that should be zzso zzso an zzso diffusion process is zzso The diffused data is used in most parts of the images, while structures with significant zzso information are zzso The method is zzso evaluated against an zzso diffusion method without structure preservation in an observer study to assess the improvement of 3-D zzso of CT series and zzso by determining the reduction of the difference between low and high dose CT scans of in zzso carotid zzso
