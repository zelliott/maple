The partial zzso volume changes in the transfer of several zzso zzso which are composed of aromatic rings and an zzso chain of different zzso from carbon zzso to water zzso are calculated using the three-dimensional interaction site model theory of molecular zzso The theory reproduces recent experimental zzso the addition of a zzso group decreases zzso in contrast, the addition of an aromatic ring increases zzso The zzso is found to originate from the difference between chain and ring structures rather than that between zzso and zzso Furthermore, a general rule of the variation in zzso due to the addition of a hydrocarbon is found through the theoretical zzso An outward addition at the trans position, which is to form chain structure, decreases zzso while an inward addition at the zzso position, which is to form ring structure, increases zzso This is explained in terms of zzso packing rather than the so-called zzso zzso The present findings argue against the traditional idea that the zzso zzso can be represented by the observed values of zzso
