zzso realistic and zzso detailed zzso computer models of the heart are playing an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of integrated cardiac function in health and zzso Such detailed simulations, however, are zzso vastly zzso which is a limiting factor for a wider adoption of zzso zzso While current trends in zzso computing zzso hardware promise to alleviate this problem, exploiting the potential of such zzso remains challenging since strongly zzso zzso are necessitated to reduce execution zzso zzso acceleration technologies such as graphics processing units zzso are being zzso While the potential of zzso has been demonstrated in various applications, benefits in the context of zzso simulations where large sparse linear systems have to be solved in parallel with advanced zzso techniques are less zzso In this study, the feasibility of zzso zzso simulations is demonstrated by running strong zzso benchmarks using a state-of-the-art model of rabbit zzso The model is zzso zzso using the finite element methods zzso on fully zzso zzso The zzso code is directly derived from a large pre-existing code, the zzso zzso Research Package zzso with very minor zzso of the code zzso Overall, zzso simulations were zzso up by a factor of zzso to zzso in benchmarks running on zzso zzso compared to the same number of CPU zzso To match the fastest zzso simulation which engaged 20 zzso zzso CPU zzso were required on a national zzso zzso
