To use structural magnetic resonance zzso images to identify a pattern of regional zzso characteristic of mild zzso disease zzso and to investigate whether presence of this pattern zzso can aid prediction of zzso clinical decline and increased structural loss in mild cognitive impairment zzso 

The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and compliance with zzso zzso Written informed consent was obtained from each zzso zzso zzso zzso and cortical surface reconstruction methods were applied to MR images from 84 subjects with mild zzso 175 with zzso and 139 healthy control zzso zzso zzso linear zzso analysis was used to identify regions that best can aid discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with zzso A zzso trained on data from HC subjects and those with zzso was applied to data from subjects with zzso to determine whether presence of zzso zzso zzso at baseline was zzso of clinical decline and structural zzso 

zzso in zzso and lateral zzso zzso cingulate, and zzso areas aided discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with zzso with fully zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso with zzso who had zzso zzso zzso showed significantly greater zzso clinical decline and structural loss than those who did not and were more likely to have progression to probable zzso zzso progression rate of zzso for subjects with zzso who had zzso zzso vs zzso for those who did zzso 

zzso individually specific quantitative MR imaging methods can be used to identify a pattern of regional zzso in zzso that is zzso of clinical zzso Such information may aid in prediction of patient prognosis and increase the efficiency of clinical zzso
