Recent advances in mass zzso have enabled the identification of hundreds of low molecular weight zzso peptides that have previously been difficult to detect in human zzso zzso zzso patterns can now be analyzed using commercially available statistical programs to identify potential zzso patterns that may correlate with the presence or absence of specific zzso A serum zzso profile zzso which is unique to each patient, can be created and compared to a known zzso from a specific zzso The zzso thus serves as a potential early stage zzso prior to the clinical manifestation of zzso A unique and automated technology platform has been developed by members of the zzso Center at Memorial zzso Cancer Center zzso It involves a magnetic zzso approach to extract zzso peptides from serum, placing them by robotic automation on a stainless steel zzso target plate, subjecting them to mass zzso analysis, and using zzso software to analyze the zzso zzso Human serum from a cohort of 27 patients with zzso zzso cancer and 32 controls were analyzed on the zzso zzso zzso individual zzso peptides were zzso A zzso composed of 98 zzso zzso peptides was able to distinguish between the two groups of serum samples with high statistical zzso We believe that our automated system will serve as a model for future biotechnology laboratories in the quest for hidden diagnostic clues that may be detected by simply analyzing a drop of zzso
