To construct a population zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso bipolar zzso 

Plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, zzso zzso on day 1, 2 and 3 in nine patients following a zzso infusion of zzso zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso model was constructed that included all zzso zzso and unknown parameters were estimated with an zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present during the first zzso post infusion and significant zzso zzso were observed on day zzso Plasma zzso of zzso and zzso were below the limit of zzso The average zzso plasma zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso while no significant zzso was observed for zzso There were large zzso variations in terminal zzso and relative zzso zzso at zzso zzso was the major zzso in four out of nine patients, zzso in three out of nine patients and zzso in two out of nine zzso The final zzso model included three compartments for zzso two compartments for zzso and single compartments for zzso and zzso All zzso profiles were well zzso and parameters for zzso and zzso were in agreement with prior zzso 

This represents the first zzso analysis of zzso and zzso The results demonstrate that while zzso is the initial zzso it is not the main zzso suggesting that future zzso studies should include the analysis of the major zzso
