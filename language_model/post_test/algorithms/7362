On the pretext that sequence reads and zzso often exhibit the same kinds of base usage that is also observed in the sequences from which they are zzso we offer a base composition analysis zzso Our tool uses these natural patterns to determine zzso across sequence zzso We introduce spectrum sets zzso of zzso which are permutations of bacterial restriction sites and the base composition analysis framework to measure their zzso content in sequence zzso We suggest that this framework will increase the efficiency during the zzso stages of zzso sequencing and assembly zzso 

Our method is able to differentiate organisms and their reads or zzso The framework shows how to successfully determine the zzso between these reads or zzso by comparison of base zzso In particular, we show that two types of zzso data are fundamentally different by analyzing their spectrum set motif proportions zzso By the application of one of the four possible spectrum sets, encompassing all known restriction sites, we provide the evidence to claim that each set has a different ability to differentiate sequence zzso Furthermore, we show that the spectrum set selection having relevance to one zzso but not to the others of the data set, will greatly improve performance of sequence differentiation even if the zzso size of the read, zzso or sequence is not zzso 

We show the proof of concept of our method by its application to ten trials of two or three freshly selected sequence fragments zzso and zzso for each experiment across the six organisms of our zzso Here we describe a novel and zzso effective zzso step for zzso sequencing and assembly zzso Furthermore, our base composition method has applications in zzso where it can be used to zzso evolutionary distances between organisms based on the notion that related organisms often have much zzso zzso
