zzso is a model drug with zzso structure with zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties of its zzso derivatives were studied to find a proper zzso zzso The experimental study of zzso delivery of derivatives was combined with the theoretical approach in which the partition zzso of substances were estimated by means of fragmentation or quantum chemical zzso All modes applied showed differences in the transport properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental results obtained for the flux of zzso were higher by one order of magnitude than for the other derivatives and the parent zzso The results are discussed from the point of view of zzso properties of zzso We concluded that the exceptional zzso value of zzso zzso results from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso constant, and arrangement of zzso zzso
