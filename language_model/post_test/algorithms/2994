This study evaluated whether improved zzso zzso zzso in recovery from acute exercise zzso with reduced zzso zzso content in human zzso Furthermore, we investigated whether a high-fat diet zzso zzso zzso would alter the content of zzso and insulin action compared with a zzso diet zzso zzso zzso After 4 days of zzso diet on two occasions zzso 12 male subjects performed 1 h of zzso knee zzso exercise zzso zzso peak zzso Four hours after exercise, zzso zzso zzso was determined in both legs during a zzso zzso Muscle zzso were obtained in both legs before and after the zzso Four hours after exercise, zzso zzso zzso was improved zzso zzso zzso independent of diet composition and despite normal zzso regulation of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, exercise resulted in a sustained reduction zzso zzso zzso in zzso content 4 h after exercise that correlated zzso zzso with improved zzso zzso zzso Four days of Fat diet resulted in an increased content of zzso zzso zzso but did not influence muscle zzso content or whole body zzso zzso zzso However, at the muscular level zzso insulin signaling and zzso zzso zzso appeared to be compromised, although to a minor extent, by the Fat zzso zzso this study indicates that reduced muscle zzso content in recovery from exercise may be part of the zzso response leading to improved insulin action on zzso zzso after exercise in human zzso
