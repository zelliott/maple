zzso experiments were performed in zzso rats to ascertain the zzso zzso sites at which zzso interact with the zzso nerve and zzso zzso Renal nerve stimulation zzso of 3 zzso alone decreased zzso zzso zzso rate zzso by zzso the consequence of 10 and zzso reductions in the zzso zzso zzso pressure difference zzso P) and the zzso plasma flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in zzso secondary to 1) a further diminution in delta P and in zzso via heightened zzso and zzso zzso and 2) a marked decline in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso less than zzso Acute zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rats zzso with zzso partially attenuated the effects of zzso on vascular zzso and therefore on delta zzso zzso and zzso and prevented the reduction in zzso Thus zzso zzso act as local zzso of both zzso nerve and zzso II zzso actions on zzso and zzso zzso
