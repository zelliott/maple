zzso statistical methods, such as zzso are flexible tools to analyze data when the population distribution is not zzso With minimal assumptions and better statistical power compared to the zzso tests, zzso tests have recently been applied to the zzso filtered zzso zzso data for group zzso To perform zzso tests on zzso data, an empirical zzso zzso distribution has to be found, which is free from any activated zzso to determine the threshold to zzso the zzso as active at a given probability zzso An zzso procedure is used to determine the distribution by computing the zzso distribution, which is zzso when a possible activated zzso is found within the current zzso Besides the high zzso costs associated with this approach, there is no guarantee that all activated zzso are excluded when constructing the zzso zzso distribution, which may reduce the statistical zzso In this study, we propose a novel way to construct the zzso zzso distribution from the data of the resting zzso The approach is tested on the zzso data from a zzso experiment, and demonstrated that the approach could improve the power of the zzso test while reducing the zzso cost at the same zzso
