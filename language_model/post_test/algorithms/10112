Right zzso pacing zzso to the development of heart failure and zzso zzso Automatic zzso search zzso zzso is a commonly used strategy to decrease the percentage of right zzso pacing zzso in patients without permanent zzso block, but the results have not been zzso 

The randomized, crossover zzso study evaluated whether an enhanced zzso with two new features can reduce zzso compared with standard zzso The new features are the repetitive zzso zzso from extended to basic zzso delay after a consistent loss of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso lasting for six consecutive zzso zzso and the scan zzso zzso zzso search extension over six consecutive zzso zzso Both standard zzso and enhanced zzso performed a periodic zzso search every 180 cardiac cycles and operated with a basic zzso of 225 zzso and a zzso maximum zzso of 300 zzso for paced and sensed zzso zzso 

Among 178 patients, zzso had no evidence of zzso block at enrollment and zzso had history of intermittent zzso zzso The median zzso was decreased by enhanced zzso compared to standard zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso particularly in patients with a history of zzso block zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso The primary study hypothesis that zzso of all patients would experience zzso zzso relative zzso reduction was not met as 46 zzso patients zzso confidence zzso zzso presented such relative zzso 

The enhanced zzso zzso reduces zzso compared with standard zzso in patients with intermittent zzso zzso
