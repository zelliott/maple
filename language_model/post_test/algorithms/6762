Clinical and experimental data suggested a long delay between the plasma concentration versus time course of zzso and the time course of its central zzso zzso This study was aimed at the zzso of the transfer zzso zzso of this zzso 

zzso size was used as a measure of central zzso zzso Eight healthy volunteers (four men, four zzso participated in that zzso zzso crossover zzso Median zzso administered zzso were zzso zzso zzso as loading dose followed by zzso zzso given as infusion over a period of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as loading dose followed by zzso zzso zzso given over a period of zzso zzso The duration of the infusion was tailored to achieve zzso zzso zzso The zzso diameter was assessed every 20 zzso for approximately 18 zzso zzso of zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso 

The estimated median zzso of zzso was zzso h zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso was zzso h zzso zzso zzso The individual zzso of zzso was always longer than that of zzso Judged by the concentration at zzso effect zzso values of the zzso zzso size at maximum zzso zzso model describing zzso zzso zzso was apparently 22 times less potent than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso model did not significantly differ between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To produce similar zzso effects, the zzso dose had to be zzso times greater than the zzso zzso 

The reported zzso value of the zzso of zzso in humans obtained after direct administration of zzso is a step toward a complete modeling approach to the prediction of the clinical effects of zzso The study raises questions about the high zzso zzso of the transfer zzso between plasma and effect site zzso values and the apparent low potency of zzso
