To determine whether zzso zzso MR images are sensitive to liver zzso zzso zzso zzso of 71 patients zzso zzso 28 zzso age range, zzso years; mean, 61 zzso without zzso and with zzso significant zzso portal vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso tract obstruction in 10) by tumors were examined with zzso zzso sequences zzso for b factors of 1, 28, 66, 288 and 600 zzso On the basis of zzso theory, zzso assuming zzso of signal intensity for liver zzso is zzso attenuated versus zzso of a smaller b factor, we defined the slope of the line as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of these zzso were calculated from images with b factors of 1, 28, and 66 zzso The zzso apparent diffusion zzso values for diffusion zzso zzso were calculated from images with b factors of 288 and 600 zzso The zzso with significant portal vein zzso had statistically lower mean zzso values than the zzso without portal vein zzso zzso on the zzso U zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso values between these liver types zzso The zzso value calculated from zzso zzso sequences with zzso smaller b factors may be sensitive to liver zzso zzso
