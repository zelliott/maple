zzso methods of zzso zzso seizure detection attempt to highlight the evolving, zzso zzso nature of zzso seizure while rejecting the zzso zzso zzso zzso background in the presence of various zzso zzso An important aspect of zzso seizure detection is, therefore, the accurate representation and detection of zzso in the zzso zzso This paper describes a method of detecting zzso components associated with zzso zzso seizure based on a novel signal representation; the zzso frequency marginal zzso The zzso can be considered as an alternative zzso distribution zzso frequency zzso This method zzso the zzso along zzso zzso paths that are automatically extracted from the zzso using an edge linking procedure and has the advantage of reducing the dimension of a zzso The reduction in dimension zzso the process of zzso a decision statistic designed for the detection of the zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The use of the zzso resulted in a significant detection improvement compared to existing stationary and zzso zzso The decision statistic estimated using the zzso was then combined with a measurement of zzso zzso and nominal zzso and zzso stages to form a seizure detection zzso This zzso was tested on a zzso zzso database of 18 zzso 826 h in length with zzso seizures, and achieved comparable performance to existing second generation zzso (a median receiver operating characteristic area of zzso zzso zzso across 18 zzso
