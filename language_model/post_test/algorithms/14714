This paper presents an overview of the literature on zzso and zzso models of parallel mechanisms, the influence of sensors in the mechanism accuracy and parallel mechanisms used as zzso The most relevant zzso to obtain and solve zzso models and to identify geometric and zzso parameters in the zzso of parallel robots are discussed, examining the advantages and disadvantages of each method, presenting new trends and identifying zzso zzso This overview tries to answer and show the solutions developed by the most up-to-date research to some of the most frequent questions that appear in the zzso of a parallel zzso such as how to measure, the number of sensors and necessary zzso the type and influence of errors or the number of necessary zzso
