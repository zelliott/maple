In application of the zzso selectively refocused insensitive zzso enhanced polarization transfer zzso technique to the detection of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso seriously zzso the zzso These zzso can be conventionally removed by two soft zzso zzso in the zzso evolution period which selectively zzso the zzso zzso However, the zzso pulse sequence can be simplified by replacing the pulse train zzso zzso zzso zzso with a single soft zzso pulse that selectively zzso the zzso zzso zzso analysis in this study demonstrates the correctness of this approach in zzso zzso on a milk phantom allowed us to investigate and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the proposed zzso with respect to the original zzso Furthermore, comparison of different selective zzso made it possible to demonstrate that the proposed zzso experiment is not sensitive to errors in pulse zzso zzso and zzso field strength of the selective pulse when zzso pulse is used for selective zzso
