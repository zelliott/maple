The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of moisture on zzso efficiency of hydrogen zzso zzso by impregnated activated carbon zzso zzso nitrate was used as an zzso Two zzso conditions of zzso zzso and gas stream containing moisture, were zzso The experimental results revealed that the copper species onto the zzso was suggested to be zzso that deposited on activated carbon during the zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso by copper impregnated zzso was proposed, involving zzso and chemical zzso Moreover, the zzso breakthrough capacity decreased with increasing the relative humidity of gas zzso The causes were attributed to three points as zzso the competition zzso occurred between moisture and zzso the zzso species reduced to zzso species leading to zzso zzso and the rate of chemical reaction restrained by zzso
