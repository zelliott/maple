zzso zzso are known to be a powerful technique in solving hard zzso zzso To design a zzso algorithm, one needs to make a host of zzso zzso the population size is one of the most important among zzso Most of the zzso in the literature fix the population size to a certain constant zzso This reduces the zzso quality since the optimal population size varies for different instances, local search procedures, and zzso In this paper we propose an adjustable population zzso It is calculated as a function of the zzso of the whole zzso and the average zzso of the local search for the given zzso Note that in many applications the zzso of a zzso should be limited and, therefore, we use this bound as a zzso of the zzso The average zzso of the local search procedure is measured during the zzso zzso Some zzso which are independent of the instance and the local search are to be tuned at the design time; we provide a procedure to find these zzso The proposed approach was used to develop a zzso zzso for the zzso assignment problem zzso We show that our adjustable population size makes the zzso flexible to perform efficiently for a wide range of running times and local searches and this does not require any additional tuning of the zzso
