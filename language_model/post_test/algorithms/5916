To avoid zzso zzso and improve the level of safety and precision, artificial potential field zzso can be employed to generate virtual forces around protected tissue and to provide surgeons with real-time force zzso through zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a potential zzso force model using the generalized zzso function, and show that it can represent a large class of zzso The proposed approach has several advantages such as zzso efficiency, easily adjustable level of force reflection, and force zzso
