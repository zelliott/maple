Currently, zzso is used as the zzso to define success with zzso therapy zzso in patients with high-grade zzso zzso zzso despite zzso zzso are zzso The role of zzso in assessing response to zzso remains zzso The objectives of the current study were 1) to assess zzso in a prospective cohort of patients with zzso cancer before and after zzso and 2) to correlate zzso status after zzso with zzso 

Patients who underwent zzso for zzso cancer were studied zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso every zzso zzso zzso zzso of visible zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples were obtained by using standard zzso zzso zzso were assessed by using zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso that were assessed included loss of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gains of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and multiple zzso Patients received zzso 48 hours after the administration of sodium zzso zzso and clinical variables were collected zzso Patients were followed with zzso and repeat zzso for zzso The zzso test was used to compare zzso proportions before and after zzso 

Thirty-one patients were zzso The median patient age was 66 years zzso range zzso zzso zzso and 28 patients zzso were zzso The mean Barrett segment length was 5 zzso zzso error of the mean, zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained after a median duration of 9 months zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of several zzso assessed after zzso Six patients without zzso after zzso still had positive FISH results for 1 or more zzso of these, 2 patients zzso developed zzso zzso 

In this initial study, zzso zzso of zzso after zzso was associated with the loss of zzso that have been associated with progression of zzso in Barrett zzso Patients with persistently positive zzso appeared to be at a higher risk of zzso zzso These findings should be confirmed in a larger zzso
