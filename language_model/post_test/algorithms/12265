zzso zzso are frequently applied to dynamic zzso problems in which the objective varies with zzso It is desirable to gain an improved understanding of the influence of different genetic operators and of the parameters of a strategy on its tracking zzso An approach that has proven useful in the past is to zzso analyze the zzso behavior in simple, idealized zzso The present paper investigates the performance of a zzso evolution strategy that employs cumulative step length adaptation for an zzso task in which the target moves zzso with uniform zzso Scaling laws that quite accurately describe the behavior of the strategy and that greatly contribute to its understanding are zzso It is shown that in contrast to previously obtained results for a randomly moving target, cumulative step length adaptation fails to achieve optimal step lengths if the target moves in a linear zzso zzso for the choice of population size parameters are zzso
