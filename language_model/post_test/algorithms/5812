Previous studies have shown that human body sway during standing zzso the mechanics of an zzso zzso zzso at the ankle zzso In this study, a robotic balance system incorporating a Stewart platform base was developed to provide a new technique to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in standing zzso The robotic system, programmed with the mechanics of an zzso zzso controlled the motion of the body in response to a change in applied ankle zzso The ability of the robotic system to replicate the load properties of standing was validated by comparing the load zzso generated when subjects balanced their own body to the zzso mechanical load programmed with a low zzso zzso or high zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso load zzso was not significantly zzso zzso zzso different for standing and the robotic zzso Dynamic load zzso for the robotic system increased with the frequency of zzso as predicted by the mechanics of an zzso zzso with the higher inertia being accurately matched to the load properties of the human zzso This robotic balance system accurately zzso the physical model of standing and represents a useful tool to simulate the dynamics of a standing zzso
