Using average zzso zzso theory, we analyze recently introduced zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences for exciting zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso spin zzso zzso undergoing zzso Several previously observed differences among the zzso schemes concerning their compensation to resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso may zzso be rationalized by an zzso analysis up to third zzso order, despite its omission of zzso zzso zzso General aspects of the engineering of zzso pulse sequences zzso to zzso spins are discussed, emphasizing the improvements offered from a diversity of zzso providing enhanced suppression of zzso zzso zzso between resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso
