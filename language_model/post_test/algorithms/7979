The leader gene approach is a zzso method based on the systematic search for the genes involved in a specific process and their ranking according to the zzso with the other genes zzso The application of this zzso to human zzso gave promising zzso The present study used this zzso to formulate new hypotheses about the association between zzso and type 2 zzso 

The genes involved in a given process were identified via interrelated queries of several zzso The interactions among such genes were mapped and given a significance zzso The weighted number of links zzso of weighted scores for every interaction in which a gene is zzso was calculated for each zzso Genes were clustered according to this zzso those in the highest cluster were termed leader zzso This zzso was applied to diabetes and zzso zzso was chosen as a control because it is an inflammatory infectious disease like zzso The results were compared to those previously calculated for zzso 

zzso and diabetes share four leader zzso all leader genes are linked in a complex map of zzso zzso and zzso share no leader zzso no interactions were zzso 

Even with the limitations of zzso zzso zzso these theoretical results might suggest the existence of some common zzso pathways between zzso and type 2 diabetes, despite the different zzso of these zzso In particular, the shared leader genes could have an important role in this relationship, which may be investigated further with targeted zzso
