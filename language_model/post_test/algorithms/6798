The change in zzso from circular zzso arcs to shaped zzso fields for zzso zzso raises questions regarding zzso of dose zzso between the zzso This study aims to zzso the zzso of planning parameters to achieve dose zzso minimizing dose to healthy zzso zzso volume zzso were calculated and averaged from several patient treatments to measure dose zzso and healthy tissue zzso inherent in variable zzso margins, the effect of increasing numbers of zzso shaped fields, the dose zzso outside the zzso and of field zzso Our results show that adding a 2 zzso margin around the target volume when defining field shapes zzso dose coverage and zzso without substantially increasing the volume of healthy tissue zzso to high dose zzso We demonstrate that 5-6 zzso fields may be optimal for typical zzso and that placement of these fields may not always play a major role in healthy tissue zzso This work illustrates a systematic approach to zzso zzso field treatment plan zzso which relies on the prior determination of parameters such as optimum margin zzso to account for field zzso Complex zzso shaped zzso still require careful zzso assessment of healthy tissue zzso
