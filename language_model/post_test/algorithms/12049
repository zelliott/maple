The resonant recognition model zzso is a model which treats the protein sequence as a discrete zzso It has been shown previously that certain zzso zzso in this signal zzso protein biological zzso The zzso was employed to determine the characteristic zzso of the hormone zzso zzso and to identify zzso acids zzso zzso mostly contributing to these zzso and thus proposed to mostly contribute to the biological zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found in the highly zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso Our predictions agree with previous zzso tested zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
