A method to estimate pulmonary zzso capacity for zzso zzso during exercise based on routine zzso and zzso transport variables is zzso It is based on the fitting of a mathematical model to gas exchange zzso The model includes zzso zzso as two exchanging zzso diffusion limitation and zzso zzso Mass conservation equations and zzso integration were solved to calculate partial pressures in each zzso zzso was distributed with zzso zzso ventilation and zzso zzso were estimated at rest during conditions of negligible diffusion zzso These zzso were used during hypoxic and zzso exercise to obtain the zzso from the model zzso zzso compatible with experimental zzso Three zzso four zzso patients and four patients after lung zzso were zzso An independent technique for carbon monoxide was used to provide experimental estimates of zzso zzso zzso technique for zzso patients and single breath for lung zzso zzso was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the slope of the zzso line was not statistically different from zzso The mean zzso - zzso difference was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that use of a refined zzso procedure allows for assessment of zzso from routine zzso and zzso zzso comparable with those obtained from independent carbon monoxide zzso The method may be an alternative for estimates of zzso during zzso
