Identification of spikes in the electroencephalogram zzso plays an important role during the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as zzso Automatic spike detection zzso is attractive because it reduces the diagnostic time and improves objectivity of the zzso Unfortunately, automatic detection is sometimes zzso by artifacts, particularly motion artifacts which can be frequent in ambulatory recording, in the zzso when recording from restless patients or children, zzso zzso systems have recently been improved by using active zzso and zzso circuits zzso to reduce motion zzso However, the performances of zzso zzso both with zzso and improved zzso systems, are difficult to zzso in patients because of poor zzso of the zzso In this paper, a test zzso was used to evaluate the performance of active zzso and zzso and assess if they can be zzso or zzso by a spike detection zzso in avoiding motion zzso zzso show that motion artifacts can largely degrade spike detection when a traditional zzso system is used, whereas an zzso fitted with active zzso and a zzso allows high quality zzso When using a traditional zzso the choice of a spike detection zzso has a large influence on detection zzso
