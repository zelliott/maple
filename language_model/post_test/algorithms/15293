We implemented zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso balanced steady state free zzso zzso zzso for mapping blood flow in the human brain, zzso and zzso free of distortion and signal zzso which are typically observed in the most commonly used zzso imaging zzso High resolution functional brain imaging in the human visual zzso was feasible with zzso zzso zzso Blood flow of the human zzso could be zzso with zzso and zzso in conjunction with a phase cycling approach to suppress the zzso artifacts associated with zzso Furthermore, zzso based zzso enabled us to map zzso blood flow within a single breath zzso Control and zzso experiments suggested that the measured blood flow values in zzso and kidney were zzso Because there is no specific imaging tool for mapping human zzso blood flow and the standard contrast agent technique for mapping zzso blood flow can cause problems for patients with kidney dysfunction, zzso based zzso may provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of retinal and zzso diseases and can complement existing imaging zzso
