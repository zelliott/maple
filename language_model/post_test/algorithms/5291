Mass zzso based structural zzso approaches for probing protein structures are increasingly gaining in zzso The potential for such studies is limited because of the lack of zzso techniques for the automated interpretation of resulting zzso In this article, a suite of zzso called zzso is developed, zzso and implemented specifically for the comprehensive automatic analysis of mass zzso data obtained for protein structure studies using zzso zzso The functions include data format conversion, mass spectrum zzso zzso and zzso of all zzso species, confirmation of the modified zzso products, and zzso of the extent of zzso zzso The results thus obtained provide valuable data for use in combination with zzso approaches for protein structure zzso The structures of both zzso and zzso forms of insulin were investigated by zzso protein zzso followed by high-resolution mass zzso The zzso data was analyzed both manually and using zzso without any manual zzso The results obtained using the two methods were found to be in close agreement and overall were consistent with predictions from the zzso zzso
