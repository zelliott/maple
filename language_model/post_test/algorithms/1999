Despite the American Society of zzso recommendation to use left zzso volume zzso for body surface area zzso for zzso of left zzso size, a variety of methods are used in clinical zzso Our objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso LA size estimates to zzso and to determine their ability to predict left zzso zzso zzso 

In 150 consecutive patients, LA diameter zzso LA diameter zzso for body surface area zzso LA area in the zzso two- and zzso views zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso LA volume zzso and zzso were zzso The accuracy of these methods to zzso LA enlargement by zzso correlation with clinical zzso and ability to act as a surrogate for zzso dysfunction were determined using zzso correlation zzso along with zzso and multiple zzso zzso 

The true degree of LA size (with zzso as zzso was identified by zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso All methods showed positive correlation with age, zzso zzso zzso and right zzso size and negative correlation with ejection zzso zzso was the strongest method to predict any zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso All methods have greater capacity to identify moderate or severe zzso dysfunction than any degree of zzso dysfunction zzso 

zzso and zzso methods zzso zzso LA size and are inferior to zzso to predict zzso zzso
