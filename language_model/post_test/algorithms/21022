With continuing improvements in spatial resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small patient movements during PET imaging become a significant source of resolution zzso This work develops and investigates a comprehensive zzso for accurate zzso reconstruction which at the same time is very feasible in the context of high-resolution zzso In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random zzso in the context of motion (which is similarly zzso to various other motion correction zzso The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and zzso incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the zzso following motion zzso The proposed approach has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work, and the results for a dynamic patient study are also zzso
