Previous studies showed that loss of zzso zzso input to the zzso zzso zzso leads to a dramatic reduction in tear zzso and profound changes to LG zzso In this study, we used DNA zzso to examine the regulation of the gene expression of the genes for zzso function and organization of the zzso zzso rats zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso zzso underwent unilateral zzso of the greater superficial zzso zzso the input to the zzso zzso After 7 days, tear zzso was measured, the animals were killed, and structural changes in the LG were examined by light zzso Total zzso from control and experimental zzso zzso zzso 5) was used for DNA zzso analysis employing the zzso zzso Three statistical zzso zzso change call, and signal log zzso were used to determine differential gene expression using the zzso Suite zzso and Data Mining zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced and zzso zzso developed in all experimental zzso Light zzso showed breakdown of the zzso structure of the zzso DNA zzso analysis showed zzso of genes associated with the zzso zzso and zzso including genes involved in protein folding and zzso zzso transcripts for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The number of significantly zzso genes zzso was substantially greater than the number of zzso genes zzso zzso of the main zzso input to the rat LG resulted in clinical symptoms associated with severe dry zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso affected, and the increase in cell proliferation and inflammation may lead to loss of organization in the zzso zzso zzso
