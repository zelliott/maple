zzso zzso DNA from pools of individuals is an effective strategy to detect new zzso in targeted regions and compare them between cases and zzso There are numerous ways to assign individuals to the pools on which they are to be zzso The zzso zzso pooling scheme (many individuals to one zzso in zzso use today offers insight into zzso zzso but does not offer the identity of an zzso zzso We present a framework for overlapping pool design, where each individual sample is zzso in several pools (many individuals to many zzso Upon discovering a zzso the set of pools where this zzso is observed reveals the identity of its zzso We formalize the mathematical framework for such pool designs and list the requirements from such zzso We specifically address three practical concerns for pooled zzso designs: zzso zzso due to errors introduced during amplification and zzso zzso zzso due to zzso particular zzso aggravated by zzso zzso and consequently, zzso ambiguous identification of individual carriers in the presence of zzso We build on theory of zzso codes to design pools that overcome these zzso We show that in practical parameters of zzso studies, our designs guarantee high probability of zzso singleton carrier identification while maintaining the features of zzso pools in terms of sensitivity, zzso and the ability to estimate zzso zzso We demonstrate the ability of our designs in zzso rare variations using short read data from the 1000 zzso Pilot 3 zzso
