We use optical zzso filtering implemented with a digital zzso device to achieve zzso sensitivity to changes in the size of finite and periodic objects zzso at low zzso The method consists of applying an optical zzso filter bank consisting of zzso filters of varying periods and zzso the optimum filter period that zzso the filtered object zzso Using this optimum filter period as a measure of object size, we show sensitivity to a zzso zzso change in the period of a chirped phase mask with period around 1 zzso We also show 30 zzso sensitivity to change in the size of polystyrene spheres with diameters around 500 zzso Unlike digital zzso our optical processing method retains its sensitivity when implemented at low zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the optimum zzso filter period found zzso is zzso related to sphere diameter over the range zzso zzso zzso and does not rely on a zzso scatter model such as zzso zzso The technique may have applications in high zzso optical analysis of zzso zzso to study zzso function in living zzso
