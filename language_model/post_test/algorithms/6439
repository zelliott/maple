The commercial BD zzso zzso zzso system for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from clinical specimens was compared with our in-house zzso real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso initially positive by the zzso system were zzso by our zzso zzso Our results for zzso zzso testing indicate a zzso agreement when the results of 114 clinical zzso initially positive by zzso over a wide range of zzso zzso scores, were zzso by our zzso zzso The agreement between the two systems improved to zzso when only zzso scores of zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso The overall agreement between the two systems for zzso zzso detection from 155 clinical specimens was only zzso with agreement particularly low zzso for zzso scores ranging from 2,000 to zzso Repeat testing of specimens with the zzso only closely correlated with that seen by others demonstrating that zzso of the zzso system for specimens initially within the zzso score range from 2,000 to zzso is problematic, especially for zzso zzso zzso With our study, we proposed an zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso testing which involves screening with the zzso system followed by selective use of our in-house zzso zzso
