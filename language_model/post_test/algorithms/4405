In zzso zzso free zzso zzso functional zzso zzso functional contrast originates from a bulk frequency shift induced by a zzso zzso concentration change in the activated brain zzso This frequency shift causes a magnitude and/or zzso change depending on the zzso distribution of a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso However, in early zzso studies, only the magnitude signal zzso were zzso In this paper the zzso zzso change is presented in a high-resolution (1 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso zzso To include this phase zzso in a functional analysis, a new complex domain data analysis method is zzso The results show statistically significant zzso changes in a large number of zzso comparable to that of the zzso zzso The zzso analysis method successfully includes these phase zzso in the zzso map and thus provides wider coverage compared to zzso analysis zzso
