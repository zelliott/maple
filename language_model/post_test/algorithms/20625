We construct generalized translation networks to approximate zzso a class of zzso continuous zzso defined on zzso zzso zzso for zzso s zzso or zzso 1, 1 zzso or zzso p zzso zzso or C zzso zzso We obtain lower bounds on the possible order of approximation for such zzso in terms of any approximation process depending continuously on a given number of zzso Our networks almost achieve this order of approximation in terms of the number of parameters zzso involved in the zzso The training is simple and zzso in particular, we avoid any zzso such as that involved in the usual zzso
