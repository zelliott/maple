Peak instantaneous power is a zzso index of zzso function but is difficult to zzso It is relatively load independent when corrected by zzso zzso zzso to acquire power estimates have been zzso mean and simplified zzso These require only echo zzso flow and cuff pressures, but their relationship to zzso derived results has not been zzso Using a zzso zzso model of the cardiovascular system, different estimates of power were compared for varying zzso zzso and zzso All power results were divided by zzso Estimates of power correlate with peak power over a wide range of zzso zzso power estimates were independent of zzso and zzso but predictably increased with zzso Different estimates of zzso corrected power can be derived from zzso obtained variables and correlate with corrected peak instantaneous zzso
