With the advent of sequencing technology opening up a new era of personal zzso sequencing, huge amounts of rare zzso data have suddenly become available to researchers seeking genetic zzso related to human complex zzso There is an urgent need for the development of novel statistical methods to analyze rare zzso in a statistically powerful zzso While a number of statistical tests have already been developed to analyze collapsed rare zzso identified by association tests in zzso studies, to date, only two zzso zzso zzso in the updated zzso version zzso have applied collapsing methods zzso in zzso zzso For further research in this area, this study aims to introduce three new zzso weight tests for detecting rare zzso for quantitative traits in nuclear zzso In addition to evaluating the performance of these new methods, it also evaluates that of the two zzso zzso using extensive simulations of situations with and without linkage zzso zzso from these simulations suggest that the four tests using zzso weights outperform the two collapsing methods used in zzso zzso and zzso In addition, both the linear combination method zzso in the zzso menu zzso and the multiple zzso method zzso zzso and Ridge zzso performed better than the other two zzso weight tests we zzso Following testing and zzso we submitted four new zzso weight methods of statistical analysis in a computer program to the Comprehensive R zzso Network zzso for general zzso
