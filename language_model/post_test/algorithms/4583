We have developed a new technique to estimate the clinically relevant zzso pressure zzso from zzso less zzso measured peripheral artery pressure zzso The technique is based on zzso blind system identification in which two or more measured zzso zzso artery pressure zzso of a zzso zzso system zzso zzso are zzso analyzed so as to reconstruct the common zzso input zzso pressure zzso to within an arbitrary scale zzso The technique then zzso zzso law to zzso the reconstructed zzso to absolute zzso zzso in contrast to previous related efforts, the technique does not zzso a generalized transfer function or any training data and is therefore entirely patient and time zzso To demonstrate proof of concept, we have evaluated the technique with respect to four zzso in which peripheral artery pressure zzso from the zzso and zzso arteries and a reference zzso pressure zzso from the descending zzso zzso were simultaneously measured during diverse zzso zzso We report that the technique reliably estimated the entire zzso pressure zzso with an overall root mean squared error zzso of zzso zzso For comparison, the average overall zzso between the peripheral artery pressure and reference zzso pressure zzso was zzso zzso Thus the technique reduced the zzso by zzso As a result, the technique also provided similar improvements in the zzso of zzso pressure, pulse pressure, and the ejection zzso With further successful testing, the technique may ultimately be employed for more precise monitoring and zzso of therapy in, for example, critically ill and hypertension zzso
