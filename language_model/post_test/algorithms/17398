We have developed a novel method for molecular diversity sampling called zzso zzso zzso guided evaluation of molecular zzso zzso in chemical databases or virtual zzso libraries are conventionally represented as points in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso selects a desired number of zzso diverse points zzso from a zzso The diversity of a subset of points is measured by a specially designed diversity function, and the most diverse subset is selected using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso Application of zzso to two simulated data sets of randomly distributed points in two-dimensional space afforded diverse and representative selection as judged by visual zzso zzso was also applied, in comparison with random zzso to two other simulated data sets with points distributed among many zzso We found that zzso sampling covered significantly more clusters than the random zzso By defining a fraction of data points as active, we also compared zzso with random sampling in terms of hit zzso We showed that when the percentage of active points was low, the hit rates obtained by zzso were always higher than those obtained by random zzso When the percentage of active points was high, the performance of zzso in terms of individual hit rates, depended upon the data zzso However, in all cases, zzso performed better than random sampling when cluster hit rates were used as the zzso
