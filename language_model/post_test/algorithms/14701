Energy efficiency and balancing is one of the primary challenges for wireless sensor networks zzso since the tiny sensor zzso cannot be easily zzso once they are zzso Up to now, many energy efficient zzso zzso or protocols have been proposed with techniques like zzso data zzso and location tracking zzso However, many of them aim to minimize parameters like total energy consumption, zzso zzso which cause hotspot zzso and zzso network due to the overuse of certain zzso In this paper, a zzso Energy zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to ensure energy efficiency and energy balancing based on theoretical analysis of different energy and traffic zzso During the zzso process, we consider individual distance as the primary zzso in order to adjust and zzso the energy consumption among involved zzso The residual energy is also considered as a secondary zzso In this way, all the intermediate zzso will consume their energy at similar rate, which zzso network zzso zzso results show that the DEAR zzso can reduce and balance the energy consumption for all sensor zzso so network lifetime is greatly prolonged compared to other zzso zzso
