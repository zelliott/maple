A method for improving the contrast resolution of zzso images is proposed by combining the zzso technique of frequency compounding zzso and the coded zzso and zzso technique called resolution enhancement zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso but at the expense of a reduction in zzso zzso Using zzso the zzso resolution and bandwidth of the imaging system was zzso zzso by combining zzso with zzso zzso the zzso between zzso resolution and contrast enhancement was extended zzso zzso and experimental zzso were conducted with a zzso zzso zzso having a center frequency of zzso zzso and a zzso bandwidth of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso targets were zzso Four zzso cases were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the true impulse response zzso The image quality metrics used to compare zzso to conventional pulsing zzso and zzso were zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso intensity, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained in experiments when comparing zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cases to zzso Furthermore, smaller increases in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were obtained in experiments when comparing zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso cases to zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed by using zzso
