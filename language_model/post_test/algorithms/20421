The selection of medium feed rates for zzso zzso represents a challenge for process zzso particularly in zzso that are sampled zzso When the present and immediate future of a zzso can be adequately zzso zzso control can minimize zzso from set points in a manner that can maximize process zzso zzso control of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in a series of zzso cell cultures that compared operator control to computer zzso of feed zzso zzso software routines were developed to estimate the current and predict the future zzso zzso and zzso production of the zzso at each sampling zzso The current and future zzso zzso rates were used to select the zzso feed rate in a designed response to zzso from the set point zzso The routines presented a zzso user interface through which the operator was able to view the up-to-date culture performance and assess the model description of the immediate future culture zzso In addition, fewer samples were taken in the zzso cultures, reducing labor and zzso zzso The use of these zzso controller routines and the zzso user interface decreased the zzso and zzso concentration zzso up to zzso and zzso yields increased by zzso to zzso
