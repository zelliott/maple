zzso Bottom Ash (a power plant zzso and zzso zzso (an agricultural zzso exhibit good efficacy to zzso a highly toxic zzso zzso Through the batch technique equilibrium zzso of the dye is observed at different zzso pH of the solution, dosage of zzso and sieve size of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are successfully employed on both the zzso and on the basis of these models the zzso parameters are zzso zzso investigations reveal that more than 50% zzso of dye is achieved in about zzso in both the cases, zzso equilibrium establishment takes about zzso The linear plots obtained in rate constant and mass transfer studies further confirm the zzso of first order rate expression and mass transfer model, zzso The kinetic data treated to identify rate controlling step of the ongoing zzso processes indicate that for both the systems, particle diffusion process is zzso at higher zzso while film diffusion takes place at lower zzso The column studies reveal that about zzso zzso of both the columns is attained during their exhaustion, while about 88 and zzso of the dye material is recovered by zzso dilute zzso solution through exhausted Bottom Ash and zzso zzso zzso zzso
