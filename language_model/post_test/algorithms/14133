zzso size is often determined from zzso zzso zzso images to assess disease zzso A study was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the fuzzy zzso zzso zzso for zzso analysis of zzso liver zzso in comparison with manual zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed for manual zzso and the zzso zzso in a study involving zzso zzso CT images of 43 zzso liver zzso from 15 patients with a history of zzso zzso zzso accuracy and zzso zzso of the zzso and manual methods were assessed in a phantom study using zzso zzso In the clinical imaging study, zzso zzso zzso was reduced using the zzso zzso as compared with manual zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of the measurement of the zzso volume was improved using the zzso method as compared with the manual method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso volumes was measured using the zzso method as compared with the manual method zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso volume was highly correlated with the manual zzso volume zzso zzso zzso Finally, the shorter time spent in calculating tumor volume using the zzso method versus the manual zzso method was marginally statistically significant zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso has substantial advantages over manual zzso for zzso measurement of zzso liver zzso from zzso
