It has been nearly a decade since Goldman's zzso zzso to predict zzso zzso was zzso Despite the potential to avoid admission of patients without acute zzso zzso zzso to the coronary care unit zzso the routine use of computer-generated protocols has not been widely zzso 

Two hundred consecutive patients admitted to a zzso community hospital with the suspected diagnosis of zzso as determined by physicians without the aid of the Goldman protocol underwent a blinded prospective evaluation to assess the performance of the Goldman zzso in predicting the presence of zzso Over the same time period, the Goldman zzso was applied by retrospective chart review in zzso patients with zzso admitting zzso Prospective history, physical examination, and zzso data were obtained within 24 hours of admission to the zzso by a physician blinded to each patient's clinical zzso zzso chart reviews were conducted for zzso patients with chest pain given with zzso zzso 

The diagnosis of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso of patients with suspected zzso admitted to the zzso In prospective parallel evaluations the Goldman zzso predicted the presence of zzso in 167 zzso of these 200 zzso All 137 confirmed patients with zzso were correctly identified by the Goldman zzso All major zzso complications occurred in the 137 patients who were diagnosed as having zzso Of the zzso patients with chest pain with zzso diagnoses, only 27 zzso sustained an zzso The Goldman zzso predicted the presence of zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso zzso to the use of Goldman's zzso in the zzso of chest pain could have prevented zzso of zzso admissions for zzso 

zzso adherence to the Goldman zzso for the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain could have decreased the number of zzso admissions for suspected zzso by zzso zzso Because major zzso complications occurred only in patients with zzso this strategy would result in significant cost savings to our health care system without jeopardizing patient zzso
