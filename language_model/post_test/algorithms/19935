A biomedical signal can be defined by its zzso features zzso and zzso shift and zzso and intrinsic features zzso after zzso of zzso zzso In this study, an zzso zzso utilizing the method of differential zzso descent is developed, and is tested by zzso of zzso features in complex zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso shift and scale are first zzso The zzso is implemented for real-time analysis of zzso acquired during zzso zzso zzso Data was acquired at a zzso zzso sampling rate from 10 zzso and 10 persistent zzso patients undergoing clinical zzso study and zzso zzso zzso Over 24 trials, zzso characteristics using the new zzso with four weights were compared to the zzso zzso zzso with four tapped zzso The time for zzso and the mean squared error zzso after zzso were zzso The new zzso zzso was also applied to lead zzso of the zzso in one patient with longstanding persistent zzso to enhance the F wave and to monitor zzso changes in signal zzso The average zzso over a 25 s zzso was used as a zzso reference signal for matching with the zzso zzso 

Based on the derivation zzso the zzso and zzso adjustments of the new zzso zzso were shown to be equivalent to the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso adjustments, rather than implementing a long tapped delay as in zzso zzso the new method uses only two zzso After zzso the zzso for matching zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso for the new zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso for matching persistent zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso for the new zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso error for zzso versus persistent zzso From all trials, the mean convergence time was approximately 1 second for both zzso The new zzso zzso was useful to enhance the zzso F wave by zzso of an zzso weighted zzso reference signal from the zzso zzso The zzso weighting over 25 s demonstrated that zzso functions such as patient zzso could be identified and zzso 

A new zzso zzso was derived and used for zzso of the zzso features in zzso and for zzso zzso The weighting at convergence provides an estimate of the degree of similarity between two signals in terms of zzso and zzso shift and zzso The zzso is zzso efficient with low zzso zzso Based on the results, proposed applications include monitoring of zzso and intrinsic features of repetitive patterns in zzso enhancement of the zzso F wave and monitoring of zzso signal properties, and to zzso characterize zzso differences in zzso versus persistent zzso
