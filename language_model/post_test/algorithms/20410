The face is a rich source of information about human zzso Available methods for coding facial displays, however, are zzso dependent, labor zzso and difficult to zzso To enable rigorous and efficient quantitative measurement of facial displays, we have developed an automated method of facial display zzso In this report, we compare the results with this automated system with those of manual zzso zzso Action zzso System, zzso & zzso zzso zzso One hundred university students were videotaped while performing a series of facial zzso The image sequences were coded from videotape by certified zzso zzso Fifteen action units and action unit combinations that occurred a minimum of 25 times were selected for automated zzso zzso features were automatically tracked in digitized image sequences using a zzso zzso for zzso optical zzso The zzso were zzso for variation in position, orientation, and zzso The image sequences were randomly divided into a training set and a zzso set, and zzso function analyses were conducted on the feature point zzso In the training set, average agreement with manual zzso coding was zzso or higher for action units in the zzso eye, and mouth zzso In the zzso set, average agreement was zzso zzso and zzso for action units in the zzso eye, and mouth regions, zzso zzso face analysis by feature point tracking demonstrated high concurrent zzso with manual zzso zzso
