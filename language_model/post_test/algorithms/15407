zzso is regarded as the tool of choice for early diagnostic investigations in patients with suspected blunt abdominal zzso Although its sensitivity is too low for zzso exclusion of abdominal organ injury, proponents of ultrasound argue that zzso clinical pathways enhance the speed of primary trauma assessment, reduce the number of zzso zzso scans and cut zzso 

To assess the effects of trauma zzso that include ultrasound examinations in patients with suspected blunt abdominal zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's zzso zzso CENTRAL (The Cochrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso publishers' databases, controlled trials registers and the zzso zzso of identified articles and conference abstracts were searched for further zzso zzso Trial authors were contacted for further information and individual patient zzso The searches were updated in February zzso

There is currently insufficient evidence from zzso to justify promotion of zzso clinical pathways in diagnosing patients with suspected blunt abdominal zzso
