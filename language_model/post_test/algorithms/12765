zzso neural zzso that deliver focal electrical stimulation upon demand are rapidly emerging as an alternate therapy for roughly a third of the zzso patient population that is medically zzso zzso detection zzso enable feedback mechanisms to provide zzso and temporally specific zzso zzso feasibility and zzso complexity often limit most reported detection zzso to zzso using computers for bedside monitoring or external devices zzso with the implanted zzso A comparison of zzso based on detection efficacy does not present a complete picture of the feasibility of the zzso with limited zzso power, as is the case with most zzso zzso We present a two-dimensional design zzso approach that takes into account both detection efficacy and hardware cost in evaluating zzso for their feasibility in an zzso zzso zzso features are first compared for their ability to detect zzso zzso from zzso data recorded from zzso zzso Circuit models are then used to estimate the dynamic and leakage power consumption of the compared zzso A score is assigned based on detection efficacy and the hardware cost for each of the features, then plotted on a two-dimensional design zzso An optimal combination of compared features is used to construct an zzso that provides zzso detection efficacy per unit hardware zzso The methods presented in this paper would facilitate the development of a common platform to benchmark seizure detection zzso for comparison and feasibility analysis in the next generation of zzso zzso devices to treat zzso
