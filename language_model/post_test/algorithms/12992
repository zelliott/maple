zzso & Xu zzso developed a statistical method for computing the statistical power for detecting a quantitative trait locus zzso located in a marker zzso Their method is based on the zzso zzso mapping method and allows zzso to effectively investigate the power for detecting a zzso in a zzso This paper continues to work on the power analysis of separating zzso zzso We propose simple zzso to calculate the power of separating closely linked zzso located in marker zzso The proposed zzso are simple functions of information numbers, zzso inflation factors and genetic parameters of a statistical model in a zzso Both zzso and maximum likelihood zzso zzso suitable for detecting zzso in the marker intervals are zzso In addition, the issue of separating linked zzso in the progeny populations from an zzso subject to further self and/or random mating is also touched zzso One of the primary keys to our approach is to derive the zzso zzso of three and four zzso for evaluating the correlation structures between zzso zzso zzso in the model across zzso The proposed zzso allow us to predict the power of separation when several factors, such as sample sizes, sizes and directions of zzso effects, distances between zzso zzso sizes and relative zzso positions in the zzso are considered together at a time in different experimental zzso zzso justifications and zzso Carlo simulations were provided for confirmation and zzso
