Technical improvements in planning and dose delivery and in zzso of patient positioning have substantially widened the therapeutic window for radiation treatment of zzso However, changes in patient anatomy during the treatment limit the exploitation of these new zzso To further improve radiation treatments, anatomical changes need to be modeled and accounted for zzso registration can be used for this zzso This article describes the design, the zzso and the validation of a new framework for zzso registration for zzso zzso The core of this framework is an improved version of the thin plate zzso robust point matching zzso zzso The zzso zzso estimates a global correspondence and a transformation between the points that represent zzso of interest belonging to two image zzso However, the zzso does not allow for the inclusion of prior knowledge on the correspondence of subset of points, and therefore, it can lead to inconsistent anatomical zzso In this article zzso was improved by employing a novel correspondence filter that supports simultaneous registration of multiple zzso The improved method allows for coherent organ registration and for the inclusion of zzso landmarks, lines, and surfaces inside and outside of structures of zzso A procedure to generate control points from segmented zzso is zzso The framework parameters r and zzso which control the number of points and the zzso of the zzso respectively, were zzso for three sites with different degrees of deformation zzso and neck, zzso and zzso using two cases per zzso For the head and neck cases, the zzso zzso were manually contoured on CT scans, for the prostate cases the prostate and the zzso and for the zzso cases the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso The transformation error obtained using the best set of parameters was below 1 zzso for all the studied zzso The lengths of the deformation zzso were on average zzso 1 standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the head and neck cases, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the prostate cases, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso anatomical features were identified for each case and were used to validate the registration by calculating residual distances after transformation: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the head and neck, zzso and zzso sites, zzso Finally, the authors demonstrated how the inclusion of these anatomical features in the registration process reduced the residual distances to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the head and neck, zzso and zzso sites, zzso The inclusion of additional anatomical features produced more zzso coherent transformations without compromising the transformation zzso The authors concluded that the presented zzso registration framework is a powerful tool to simultaneously register multiple segmented zzso with very different zzso
