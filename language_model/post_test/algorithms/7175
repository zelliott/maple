Due to the zzso and zzso local deformation of zzso zzso it is difficult to match a number of feature points distributing somewhat uniform in the zzso from MR images for deformation zzso This paper proposes zzso zzso based method of feature point matching and elimination of zzso First, zzso and Harris operator are zzso to extract the feature points in the initial MR image, and the matching region is identified by zzso transformation model for every query point in the zzso zzso Then the zzso zzso and the proposed zzso Association zzso zzso method are combined to match the feature zzso Finally, by zzso the coordinate differences between the matching points obtained by zzso and the matching points calculated by zzso model, most incorrectly matched points are zzso After every zzso processing of matching and zzso zzso the updated zzso model becomes more accurate and more correctly so that the matched points can be identified than those of last zzso The experimental results show that the proposed zzso was efficient and that zzso based method outperformed the single zzso or zzso zzso
