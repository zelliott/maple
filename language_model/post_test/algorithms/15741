A critical review is given of the present state of group zzso schemes for the calculation of partial zzso volumes and heat capacities of unfolded zzso The comparison between the experimental values and the predictions based on the different models shows clearly that only the zzso zzso scheme represents properly both the absolute values and the temperature dependence of these zzso zzso
