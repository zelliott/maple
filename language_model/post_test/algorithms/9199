In recent years, development of zzso arthritis zzso drug therapy has been more directly targeted to counteract specific mechanisms of zzso and it is now believed that early aggressive treatment with disease zzso drugs is important to inhibit future structural joint zzso The development of these new treatments has increased the need for zzso to assess disease activity in zzso and monitor the effectiveness of drug zzso Unlike zzso which shows only structural bone damage, magnetic resonance imaging zzso can depict soft tissue damage and zzso the primary pathology of zzso Recent studies have also indicated that zzso is sensitive to zzso changes that may zzso zzso zzso and may predict future joint zzso In this study, we have developed a computer automated analysis technique for MR wrist images that provides an objective measure of zzso zzso This method applies a zzso zzso model to every zzso of a dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting zzso zzso The aim of this technique is to not only zzso zzso the severity of zzso zzso but to also locally determine where areas of serious disease activity are situated through kinetic modeling of zzso zzso zzso results show good correlation to early enhancement rate, which has previously been shown to be a useful clinical marker of zzso zzso However, the use of zzso kinetic modeling methods potentially provides more specific information regarding underlying zzso zzso This approach could provide a useful new tool in zzso patient management and could substantially improve zzso therapeutic studies by calculating objective zzso of the disease zzso
