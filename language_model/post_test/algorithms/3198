zzso double quantum zzso zzso signals that result from simultaneous transitions of two or more separated zzso are known to produce images that are highly sensitive to zzso structure, particularly local zzso Here we demonstrate how zzso signal can be used to efficiently detect the zzso created in breast tumor zzso and prostate tumor zzso by targeted zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby distinguishing the zzso area from the surrounding tumor zzso
