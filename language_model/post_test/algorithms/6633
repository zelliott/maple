zzso and information, fundamental to technological and biological organization, are also an essential aspect of many elementary physical phenomena, such as molecular zzso Here we report the molecular zzso using two-dimensional zzso of DNA tiles, of a cellular zzso whose update rule zzso the zzso function zzso and thus zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso it zzso To achieve this, abstract tiles were translated into DNA tiles based on zzso zzso Serving as input for the computation, long zzso DNA molecules were used to zzso growth of tiles into zzso zzso For both of two independent molecular zzso atomic force zzso revealed recognizable zzso zzso containing zzso correct zzso zzso rates during assembly appear to range from zzso to zzso Although imperfect, the growth of zzso zzso demonstrates all the necessary mechanisms for the molecular zzso of arbitrary cellular zzso This shows that engineered DNA zzso can be treated as a zzso zzso system, capable of implementing any desired zzso for zzso or construction zzso
