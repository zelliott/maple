A zzso method to extract zzso refraction and scattering information for hard zzso grating zzso is zzso The method comprises a zzso approach alternative to the conventional phase stepping procedure and is inspired by a similar zzso technique developed for zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained with this zzso are zzso comparable with zzso This method can be further extended to samples with negligible zzso where only two images are needed to separate zzso and refraction zzso Thanks to the limited number of images required, this technique is a viable route to zzso imaging with zzso grating zzso In addition our method zzso and strengthens the formal and practical analogies between grating zzso and the zzso zzso enhanced imaging zzso
