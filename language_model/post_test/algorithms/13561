In 2005, a National Institutes of Health consensus conference was held to refine methods for research in patients with chronic zzso disease, including proposed objective response measures and a provisional zzso for calculating zzso and overall zzso In this study, we used weighted zzso statistics to evaluate the level of agreement between zzso response ratings and calculated response categories in patients with chronic zzso zzso The study included 290 patients who had paired enrollment and follow-up zzso Based on a set of objective measures, 37% of the patients had an overall complete or partial response, whereas clinicians reported an overall complete or partial response rate of zzso zzso to fair agreement, weighted zzso zzso zzso rates between calculated zzso responses and zzso changes in skin, mouth, and eyes were fair to moderate (weighted zzso zzso We conclude that for both overall and zzso zzso zzso response ratings did not agree well with calculated response zzso zzso reasons for this zzso include a high clinical sensitivity for detecting response, a clinical predisposition to recognize selective improvements as overall response, the large change in objective measures proposed to define response, and the high zzso of progressive disease based on new zzso zzso from prior literature reporting high overall response rates based on zzso judgment would not be supported if the provisional zzso had been applied to calculate zzso Our analysis also highlights the need to define an overall response measure that incorporates both zzso and objective measures and accurately reflects the outcome in patients with a mixed response in which one organ or site zzso whereas another shows new zzso
