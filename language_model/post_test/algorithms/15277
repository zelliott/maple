This paper presents a computer aided design zzso framework for zzso and reliability analysis of zzso hybrid circuits used in zzso It is envisioned that similar to integrated circuit zzso zzso design tools, the proposed framework will be useful for system level zzso of zzso and for discovery of new sensing zzso without resorting to zzso fabrication and experimental zzso The framework referred to as zzso analyzes zzso circuits by solving inverse problems involving zzso functional elements that admit zzso relationships between different circuit zzso In this regard, zzso uses a zzso zzso as a user interface and solving the inverse problem zzso passing zzso between the internal zzso of the zzso zzso analysis techniques like density evolution are used to understand the dynamics of the circuit and estimate the reliability of the zzso As an example, we present a complete design flow using zzso for zzso analysis and zzso of our previously reported zzso zzso that uses zzso circuits to implement forward zzso zzso
