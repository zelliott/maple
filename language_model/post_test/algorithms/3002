zzso molecular markers such as zzso are important tools used to understand the dynamics of natural zzso but their identification and development are typically time consuming and labor zzso The recent emergence of so-called next-generation sequencing raised the question as to whether this new technology might be applied to zzso zzso Following this view, we considered whether deep sequencing using the zzso Life zzso zzso zzso sequencing system could lead to a rapid protocol to develop zzso zzso as markers for genetic zzso For this purpose, zzso DNA was zzso from three unrelated zzso a fungus (the pine pathogen zzso zzso an insect (the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso Two methods, zzso zzso isolation by zzso of sequences containing zzso and zzso zzso sequence repeat zzso were used to generate zzso DNA for the zzso zzso From the resulting zzso zzso of DNA sequence data, we were able to identify 873 zzso that have sufficient zzso sequence available for primer design and potential zzso This approach to zzso discovery was substantially more zzso effective, and economical than other methods, and this study has shown that zzso provides an outstanding new technology that can be applied to this zzso
