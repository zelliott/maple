Human observers can compare the physical zzso of objects zzso moving at different distances quite well, although the zzso retinal zzso zzso may vary zzso This zzso ability is called zzso zzso We conducted a number of experiments to investigate what mechanisms observers use to attain this constancy and if pure motion signals can also be matched according to their physical zzso zzso were asked to match the zzso of two moving stimuli presented at different viewing zzso The stimuli consisted of sparse zzso zzso or drifting zzso zzso The subjects matched the true physical zzso of the stimuli provided that the two visual scenes contained identical size zzso zzso of the actual viewing distances proved to be irrelevant for evaluating the physical zzso of the zzso We conclude that zzso constancy is based upon a relative zzso zzso
