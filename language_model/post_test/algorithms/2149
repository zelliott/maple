The aim was to select an optimal technique for zzso high-resolution CT of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were performed on a zzso zzso phantom using zzso zzso for 4 CT protocols and 2 conventional zzso protocols used for zzso zzso Six available reconstruction zzso were tested on CT protocols using zzso zzso and 120 or 130 zzso settings and zzso zzso sections with zzso zzso zzso with optimum performance on phantom tests were also applied in a series of 10 patients with zzso zzso 

A CT protocol using 120 zzso zzso zzso slice zzso table zzso implied the lower radiation dose among all examination protocols tested and provided high image quality of the zzso A reconstruction zzso yielding images of improved spatial resolution with acceptable noise was zzso 

A high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm, and 120 zzso and 508 zzso were considered optimal for a zzso CT examination of the zzso that employed narrow zzso zzso slice images with zzso
