In health policy and economics studies, the incremental zzso ratio zzso has long been used to compare the economic consequences relative to the health benefits of zzso Due to the skewed zzso of the costs and zzso much research has been done on how to obtain confidence intervals of zzso using either zzso or zzso methods, with or without the presence of zzso In this paper, we will examine and compare the finite sample performance of many approaches via simulation zzso For the special situation when the health effect of the treatment is not statistically zzso we will propose a new zzso approach to improve upon the zzso zzso method that is currently zzso The most efficient way of constructing confidence intervals will be identified and extended to the censored data zzso Finally, a data example from a cardiovascular clinical trial is used to demonstrate the application of these zzso
