zzso zzso zzso design methods typically require some predetermined surface to be specified upon which the precise locations of zzso zzso are zzso with respect to zzso zzso and other measures of zzso zzso In contrast, in this paper an zzso inverse method is presented for the theoretical design of zzso zzso coils in which the precise zzso geometry of the coils is obtained as part of the zzso zzso This method has been described previously for zzso zzso zzso and is extended here for open zzso zzso A zzso current density solution is obtained using zzso series combined with zzso zzso The examples presented involve a minimum power penalty function and an optional shielding zzso A zzso set of zzso zzso zzso is obtained using an zzso streamline seeding zzso zzso for an zzso example display a concentration of zzso within the portion of the zzso volume nearest the imaging region and zzso return path zzso taken away from this zzso However, for a zzso example the zzso zzso are found to lie almost exclusively on zzso surfaces, suggesting that this is the optimum geometry for a zzso minimum power open zzso
