As one of the most pervasive methods of individual identification and document zzso signatures present convincing evidence and provide an important form of indexing for effective document image processing and retrieval in a broad range of zzso However, detection and zzso of zzso objects such as signatures from clustered background is currently an open document analysis zzso In this paper, we focus on two fundamental problems in zzso document image zzso First, we propose a novel zzso approach to jointly detecting and zzso signatures from document zzso Rather than focusing on local features that typically have large variations, our approach captures the structural zzso using a signature production model and zzso the dynamic zzso of zzso zzso fragments over multiple zzso This detection framework is general and zzso zzso Second, we treat the problem of signature retrieval in the zzso setting of translation, scale, and rotation zzso zzso shape zzso We propose two novel measures of shape zzso based on zzso zzso and registration residual error and present a supervised learning framework for combining complementary shape information from different zzso metrics using zzso We zzso study state-of-the-art shape zzso shape matching zzso measures of zzso and the use of multiple instances as query in document image zzso We further demonstrate our matching techniques in zzso signature zzso zzso experiments using large real-world collections of English and Arabic zzso and handwritten documents demonstrate the excellent performance of our zzso
