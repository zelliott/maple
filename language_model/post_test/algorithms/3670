zzso of several organic zzso of different chemical composition zzso organic fraction of municipal solid waste, zzso raw zzso zzso zzso zzso sludge and paper zzso was carried out under controlled conditions to study the suitability of different biological indexes zzso zzso rate, zzso index, and respiratory zzso to monitor the biological activity of the composting zzso Among the indexes tested, oxygen zzso rate (also referred to as dynamic zzso zzso provided the most reliable values of microbial activity in a zzso zzso On the other hand, values of the zzso zzso index measured at process temperature, especially in the early stages of the composting process, were significantly lower than those of the dynamic index, which was probably due to oxygen diffusion limitations present in zzso zzso Both zzso and dynamic indexes were similar during the maturation zzso zzso zzso index measured at 37 degrees C should not be used with samples obtained during the zzso phase, since it resulted in an zzso of the zzso zzso Respiratory zzso presented only slight variations when changing the process temperature or the waste considered, and its use should be restricted to ensure zzso conditions in the composting zzso
