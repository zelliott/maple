One of the key pathological hallmarks of zzso disease zzso is the zzso of paired zzso filaments zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mass zzso was employed to examine zzso zzso zzso in particular protein zzso and zzso to shed light on their role in the early stages of zzso zzso zzso from zzso disease brain was zzso by zzso zzso zzso to isolate a soluble fraction of zzso in a zzso unique to human zzso zzso A large number of zzso sites were identified by employing a zzso neutral loss zzso to trigger zzso scans of zzso It was found that soluble zzso is zzso at its zzso domain at zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso may be an earlier pathological event than previously thought and that zzso could play a regulatory role in modulating the integrity of zzso during the course of zzso zzso mass zzso data for zzso itself indicate that zzso is modified by three zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso Relative quantitative analysis indicates that zzso zzso is the primary form of zzso with a minor portion of zzso linked at zzso and zzso Because modification by zzso zzso chains is known to serve as the essential means of targeting proteins for degradation by the zzso system, and it has been reported that modification at zzso zzso zzso protein degradation, a failure of the zzso system could play a role in initiating the formation of zzso zzso zzso
