A novel method for zzso a field of fiber orientation distribution zzso based on signal zzso from a given set of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance zzso images is zzso We model the zzso by higher order Cartesian zzso basis using a zzso that explicitly zzso the positive zzso property to the zzso zzso The zzso Cartesian zzso dubbed Cartesian zzso zzso are zzso positive zzso zzso whose zzso can be efficiently estimated by solving a linear system with zzso zzso Next, we show how to use our method for converting zzso diffusion zzso to zzso which is an essential task since the zzso of zzso zzso do not zzso to the underlying fiber zzso Finally, we propose a diffusion zzso index zzso directly from zzso using higher order zzso distance measures thus consolidating the whole analysis pipeline of diffusion imaging solely using zzso We evaluate our method zzso and zzso using simulated zzso images, phantom images, and human brain real zzso The results zzso demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over several existing zzso reconstruction zzso
