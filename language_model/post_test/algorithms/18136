In medical area, interactive three-dimensional volume zzso of large volume zzso is a challenging zzso One of the major challenges in graphics processing unit zzso volume rendering zzso is the limited size of texture memory imposed by current zzso zzso We attempt to overcome this limitation by rendering only visible parts of large CT zzso In this paper, we present an efficient, high-quality volume rendering zzso using zzso for rendering large CT zzso at interactive frame rates on standard PC zzso We zzso the volume zzso into uniform sized blocks and take advantage of combinations of early ray zzso zzso skipping and visibility zzso to accelerate the whole rendering process and render visible parts of volume zzso We have implemented our volume rendering zzso for a large volume data of 512 zzso 304 zzso 1878 dimensions zzso zzso and achieved real-time performance zzso zzso frames per zzso on a zzso 4 zzso PC equipped with zzso zzso zzso graphics card ( 256 zzso video zzso This method can be used as a zzso zzso tool of large CT zzso for doctors or zzso
