zzso sequencing instruments can generate zzso sequences with the potential to greatly improve zzso and zzso zzso However, the error rates of zzso reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to zzso zzso To address this zzso we introduce a correction zzso and assembly strategy that uses short, zzso sequences to correct the error in zzso zzso We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a zzso zzso instrument from zzso zzso and zzso whole zzso including the previously zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as for zzso reads of the corn zzso zzso zzso Our zzso correction achieves zzso zzso zzso leading to substantially better zzso than current sequencing zzso in the best example, the median zzso size was zzso relative to zzso second-generation zzso Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of zzso bacterial zzso zzso
