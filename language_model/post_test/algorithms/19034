A new zzso determined potential energy surface zzso for zzso is zzso This surface is constructed by adjusting the high accuracy zzso zzso zzso of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by fitting to both published experimental data and our still unpublished zzso This refinement used zzso derived term values up to 25,000 zzso and with zzso or zzso a data set of zzso energy levels once some levels with ambiguous assignment is zzso To improve the zzso properties of the empirical zzso the restraint that the resulting zzso remain close to the zzso zzso surface was zzso The new zzso zzso reproduces the experimental data, including high J levels not included in the fit, with a root mean square error of zzso zzso zzso for zzso term values up to zzso are zzso
