zzso in zzso chemistry and zzso screening technology have enabled the synthesis and screening of large molecular libraries for the purposes of drug zzso zzso to initial expectations, the increase in screening library size, typically combined with an emphasis on compound structural diversity, did not result in a comparable increase in the number of promising hits zzso In an effort to improve the likelihood of discovering hits with greater zzso potential, more recent approaches attempt to incorporate additional knowledge to the library design process to effectively guide the zzso zzso zzso methods capable of taking into account several chemical and biological criteria have been used to design collections of compounds satisfying simultaneously multiple zzso relevant zzso In this chapter, we present our efforts to implement a zzso zzso method, zzso zzso to the library design zzso The method exploits existing knowledge, zzso from previous biological screening experiments, to identify and profile molecular fragments used subsequently to design compounds compromising the various zzso
