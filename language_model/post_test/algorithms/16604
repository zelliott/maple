Users of recreational waters may be exposed to elevated pathogen levels through various zzso zzso Typical daily zzso rely on microbial analysis of indicator organisms zzso zzso zzso that require 18, or more, hours to provide an adequate zzso Modeling approaches, such as zzso linear zzso zzso and artificial neural networks zzso have been zzso to provide quick predictions of microbial zzso for zzso purposes, but generally suffer from high false negative zzso This study introduces the use of learning zzso zzso zzso direct zzso zzso comparison with zzso and ANN approaches and zzso input selection for model development with respect to primary and secondary water quality standards within the Charles River zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and microbial explanatory zzso zzso input selection into model development showed that discharge variables were the most important explanatory variables while zzso zzso and time since previous events were also zzso With respect to zzso all three models adequately represented the zzso samples zzso The zzso approach had the highest false negative rates associated with zzso violated samples zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso when using five or more explanatory zzso The ANN performance was more similar to zzso when a larger number of explanatory variables were zzso but the ANN performance zzso toward zzso performance as explanatory variables were zzso Overall, the use of zzso as a direct zzso provided the best overall zzso ability with respect to zzso samples for both zzso
