We consider two zzso approaches, the zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso and variable selection in the accelerated failure time model with multiple zzso based on zzso weighted least squares zzso The zzso zzso uses zzso weights to account for zzso in the least squares zzso The weighted least squares objective function makes the adaptation of this approach to multiple zzso settings zzso zzso We use zzso zzso and a modified zzso Information zzso for tuning zzso selection, and a zzso approach for zzso zzso The proposed method is evaluated using simulations and demonstrated on a real data zzso
