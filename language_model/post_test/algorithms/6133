A substantial proportion of zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso colon cancer syndrome zzso families are characterized by zzso zzso either within the coding sequence zzso or silent zzso or in zzso The question of whether these zzso affect the normal function of zzso mismatch DNA repair proteins and thus lead to the predisposition to cancer is zzso in genetic zzso Recent studies have suggested that some zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso by zzso zzso elements such as zzso enhancers zzso zzso disruption has been proposed to be the mechanism that zzso the presumed pathological zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso To investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso and its relevance to predicted zzso we conducted a systematic zzso screening of a series of 60 patients who carried unrelated zzso or zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in 15 cases, five of which were associated with zzso zzso We evaluated the link between those zzso zzso and predicted putative zzso by using the zzso tools zzso and zzso Our study shows that the zzso zzso prediction cannot be definitely correlated to experimental observations from zzso zzso By using zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso are the direct cause of the zzso zzso This is the first systematic screening for the effect of zzso and silent zzso on zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso identified in this study will contribute to the assessment of zzso zzso in genetic zzso Our results also suggest that one must use caution when determining the zzso effect of a zzso or silent zzso using zzso prediction zzso Analysis at the zzso level is therefore zzso
