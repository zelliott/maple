The aim of the present study was to simulate the input system and the zzso zzso pool of the MN zzso complex zzso zzso zzso which can originate from command centers in the central nervous system or from sensory zzso activate the MN zzso They generate sequences of action zzso the frequency of which is zzso to a zzso zzso factor (which is an input to the zzso Different connection patterns between the input fibers and motor units zzso are zzso For simplicity and since no precise experimental data are available, 70 input fibers and 4 zzso per fiber and MN are simulated (this zzso approximately to the zzso zzso input of the cat zzso zzso zzso Each zzso generates the same zzso change in the zzso zzso The zzso are modeled with a single compartment and a homogeneous zzso According to experimental data, the membrane leakage zzso and zzso are zzso zzso Since the precise relation is zzso zzso the zzso relation between zzso contraction force and the MN leakage zzso was taken from a zzso zzso model, and zzso the zzso was assumed to be zzso to the leakage zzso The MN membrane includes zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso and slow zzso and low- and zzso zzso zzso The density and time constant of the slow zzso channels and the density of the zzso channels were fitted to approximate zzso characteristics and zzso current relations of zzso cat zzso If the membrane reaches a zzso threshold the zzso generate action zzso which were simulated by zzso zzso The zzso of the MN pool of the human first zzso zzso muscle was simulated with injected and synaptic currents in order to illustrate the size principle, synaptic noise, and other features of muscle zzso It is concluded that the present model reproduces the main properties of the zzso relations of different MN types within a zzso Together with the simulation of the muscle force and the surface zzso which will be published in subsequent papers, it will be a powerful tool for zzso experiments on the motor system and investigating functional mechanisms of motor zzso
