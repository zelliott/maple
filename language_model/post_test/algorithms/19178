Global organizational principles are critical for understanding cortical zzso Recently, we proposed a global zzso of the zzso zzso into two large-scale zzso One system, labeled zzso comprises the zzso cortex, and is associated with the external zzso The second system, labeled zzso zzso substantially with the previously described zzso network, and is likely associated with zzso zzso This global partition of the cerebral zzso emerged from zzso imaging data the analysis of which was constrained by zzso zzso Here we applied a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a large set of zzso zzso The two clusters delineated by this zzso zzso procedure showed high anatomical consistency across individuals, and their cortical topography coincided largely with the previously determined zzso and intrinsic zzso These new zzso results confirm that the zzso subdivision constitutes a fundamental cortical zzso
