A novel zzso called a genetic neural network zzso has been developed for obtaining quantitative zzso relationships zzso for zzso data sets zzso zzso zzso 1996, 39, zzso The zzso method uses a neural network to correlate activity with zzso that are zzso by a genetic zzso To provide an extended test of the zzso method, the data on 57 zzso given by zzso and Johnston zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, 38, zzso have been examined with an enhanced version of zzso and the results are compared with the excellent zzso of zzso The problematic zzso descent training has been replaced by the scaled zzso zzso zzso This leads to a substantial gain in performance in both zzso of prediction and speed of zzso The zzso zzso simulation and the subsequent run based on an unbiased and more efficient protocol led to the discovery of other zzso zzso that are superior to the best model of zzso based on backward elimination selection and neural network zzso zzso from a series of zzso with a different number of zzso showed that a neural network with fewer zzso can produce zzso as good as or even better than those with higher zzso The zzso models from a zzso simulation using only six input zzso are zzso and the chemical significance of the chosen zzso is zzso The statistical significance of these zzso zzso is zzso The best zzso are used to provide a zzso tool that aids the design of new drug zzso By replacing functional groups at the 7- and zzso with ones that have optimal zzso zzso a number of new zzso with high potency are zzso
