zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be employed in a variety of quantitative research applications such as zzso interventions or characterization of medical zzso To ensure the highest geometric zzso of images for these applications, a phantom and image processing zzso have been developed to zzso the zzso accuracy of zzso scanners to a traceable standard and provide corrections to image zzso zzso 

The zzso phantom contains six zzso beads whose zzso have been measured to a traceable zzso An image processing zzso compares the known zzso of the beads to their zzso in zzso zzso A zzso solution is used to determine linear zzso correction factors along each of the three scanner axes to minimize errors in the zzso zzso within the images by correcting the image zzso zzso The correction factors were applied to images of a similar phantom with beads at different positions to evaluate the ability of the correction factors to reduce errors at points independent of the zzso locations in the zzso zzso The zzso phantom was used to evaluate the zzso accuracy of five different zzso scanners representing four different scanner zzso 

In two of the five scanners zzso the correction factors significantly reduced the mean error in zzso zzso in the images from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso of the actual zzso zzso zzso zzso yielding similar zzso sizes possessed comparable geometric errors after correction using the zzso 

Although the magnitude of the corrections is small, such corrections can be important for demanding zzso zzso Even if no zzso size correction is required, the phantom provides an easily implemented method to verify the geometric zzso of zzso scanners to a traceable standard of zzso
