We have investigated the feasibility to use zzso as a method to estimate sleep zzso This manuscript presents a zzso of this zzso zzso healthy subjects aged zzso years participated in the zzso The subjects were deprived of sleep for up to 36 zzso Their zzso stability was measured as a function of sleep deprivation zzso As a reference the critical fusion frequency method for measuring zzso was zzso The zzso zzso parameters used for analyzing the zzso data were found from the zzso Of these zzso the zzso dimension of the sway path, the most common frequency of the zzso the zzso for zzso control of stance, and the most common zzso of the sway showed the highest linear correlations with sleep deprivation zzso Using these four parameters we were able to estimate the sleep deprivation time with an accuracy better than 5 h for zzso of the zzso
