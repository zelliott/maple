Identification of zzso that are expressed during host colonization and characterization of their zzso properties are prerequisite to understanding their role in the zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso were identified in the analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized zzso play an important role in protein zzso However, several members of the zzso gene family are predicted to be zzso The biological role of such zzso zzso in host colonization has not been zzso Here, we characterized a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and found that the mature zzso is a zzso capable of zzso zzso linked zzso The gene is expressed during growth in zzso and during colonization on rice plants, however, deletion of the gene did not affect zzso Five other members of the zzso of zzso zzso were expressed with a pattern similar to zzso suggesting the potential for functional zzso These results form the basis for additional studies on the role of this gene family in the rice blast fungus and its interaction with zzso
