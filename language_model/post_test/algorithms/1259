We evaluated a novel combined zzso CT and zzso medical imaging system for quantitative in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in an animal model of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from 7- to zzso zzso The zzso CT image was used to generate an zzso zzso map that was incorporated into an zzso zzso zzso for reconstruction and zzso correction of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso images were zzso in units of zzso zzso zzso then compared against in zzso zzso activity concentration measured from the excised zzso In addition, the zzso zzso CT image was used to determine anatomical boundaries for zzso of zzso regions with low zzso 

The accuracy of the quantitative measurement of in zzso activity concentration in the zzso zzso was improved by zzso zzso zzso However, an additional correction for partial volume errors was required to retrieve the true activity concentration from the reconstructed zzso zzso 

zzso absolute zzso zzso required zzso correction for zzso and partial volume zzso Additional anatomical information from the zzso CT image was helpful in defining regions of interest for zzso of the zzso zzso
