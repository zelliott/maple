A detailed three-dimensional zzso model of the coronary artery tree with cardiac motion has great potential for applications in a wide variety of medical imaging research zzso In this work, we first developed a computer-generated zzso model of the coronary zzso tree for the heart in the extended zzso zzso zzso thereby creating a realistic computer model of the human zzso The coronary zzso tree model was based on two zzso zzso a gated cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from a normal human subject and zzso statistical zzso data of zzso zzso The initial zzso segments of the zzso and the anatomical details of the boundaries of the zzso were defined by zzso the CT zzso An zzso zzso generation method was developed and applied to extend the coronary zzso tree beyond the initial zzso zzso The zzso was governed by three factors: zzso statistical zzso zzso of the zzso lengths and diameters of the zzso zzso zzso avoidance forces from other vessel segments and the boundaries of the zzso and zzso zzso principles which minimize the drag force at the zzso of the generated zzso Using this algorithm, the zzso zzso model of the largest six orders of the coronary zzso tree was generated, which spread across the zzso of the left and right zzso The zzso coronary zzso tree model was then extended to zzso to simulate different cardiac zzso by zzso the original zzso model according to the motion zzso map of the zzso cardiac model of the zzso phantom at the corresponding zzso As a result, a detailed and realistic zzso model of the coronary zzso tree was developed for the zzso phantom by imposing constraints of anatomical and zzso characteristics of the coronary zzso This new zzso coronary artery tree model provides a unique simulation tool that can be used in the development and evaluation of zzso and methods for imaging normal and pathological hearts with zzso zzso zzso
