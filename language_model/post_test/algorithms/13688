The interaction between zzso to affect zzso is called zzso It is strict zzso if no proper subset of the interacting zzso exhibits a marginal zzso For many diseases, it is likely that unknown zzso interactions affect disease zzso A difficulty when mining zzso interactions from zzso zzso concerns the curse of zzso There are too many combinations of zzso to perform an exhaustive zzso A method that could locate strict zzso without an exhaustive search can be considered the brass ring of methods for analyzing zzso zzso 

A zzso pattern is a zzso network representing zzso zzso The zzso score for a zzso pattern is the probability of the data given the pattern, and has been used to learn zzso zzso We identified a bound for the score of a zzso zzso The bound provides an upper limit on the zzso score of any pattern that could be obtained by expanding a given zzso We felt that the bound might enable the data to say something about the promise of expanding a zzso pattern even when there are no marginal zzso We tested the bound using simulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso We found that the bound was able to dramatically reduce the search time for strict zzso Using an Alzheimer's zzso we showed that it is possible to discover an interaction involving the zzso gene based on its score because of its large marginal effect, but that the bound is most effective at discovering interactions without marginal zzso 

We conclude that the bound appears to zzso the curse of zzso in zzso zzso This is a very consequential result and could be pivotal in our efforts to reveal the dark matter of genetic disease risk from zzso zzso
