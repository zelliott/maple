zzso maps of a zzso obtained by zzso reconstruction from thousands of zzso projections exhibit strong changes in local definition and zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These changes complicate the interpretation of density maps in terms of molecular zzso A three-dimensional zzso zzso map provides an effective tool to assess the structural definition in each volume zzso In this work, the different contributions to the 3-D zzso in a zzso reconstruction are discussed, and an effective method for the zzso of the 3-D zzso map is proposed, using a zzso technique of zzso zzso with test data confirm the zzso zzso efficiency, and accuracy of the method under conditions encountered in practical zzso
