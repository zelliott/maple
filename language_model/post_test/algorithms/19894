This paper presents a novel method for zzso registration of zzso ultrasound and magnetic resonance prostate images based on a zzso zzso framework of point zzso obtained from a statistical measure of zzso The segmented prostate shapes are represented by zzso and the zzso distance between the shape representations is used to find the point zzso between the zzso fixed and moving zzso The registration method involves zzso zzso of the zzso zzso between the zzso images and has its basis in solving a set of zzso equations of zzso zzso The solution is obtained as the zzso solution of an zzso system of zzso equations constructed by zzso a set of zzso functions over the fixed and moving zzso However, this may not result in clinically acceptable transformations of the anatomical zzso zzso the zzso zzso energy of the zzso zzso along with the zzso error of established zzso should be included in the system of zzso The registration zzso of the proposed method are evaluated in 20 pairs of prostate zzso ultrasound and magnetic resonance zzso The results obtained in terms of zzso similarity zzso show an average of zzso average zzso zzso distance of zzso zzso and mean target registration and target zzso errors of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
