We have presented a new generation mechanism of slow zzso or repetitive zzso with extraordinarily long zzso intervals using the modified zzso equations zzso and zzso zzso This generation process of slow firing is completely different from that of the well-known zzso zzso in that the zzso zzso relation of the zzso model is zzso rather than the zzso one of the zzso In this paper, we extend the previous results and show that the very slow zzso generically appears in both the three-dimensional zzso equations and the three zzso zzso der Pol (or zzso zzso The generation of repetitive zzso or the zzso of the unique equilibrium point zzso zzso is a simple zzso zzso We also show that the generation of slow zzso does not depend on the stability of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso The dynamics of slow zzso is investigated in detail and we demonstrate that the zzso of slow zzso can be zzso into two types according to the type of the corresponding zzso of a fast zzso zzso or zzso zzso
