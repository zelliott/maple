A statistical mechanical description of flexible and zzso zzso chains in a poor zzso is developed in the constant force and constant distance zzso We predict the existence of many intermediate states at low temperatures stabilized by the zzso A unified response to pulling and zzso forces has been obtained in the constant distance zzso We show the signature of a crossover length which increases zzso with the chain zzso Below this crossover zzso the critical force of unfolding decreases with temperature, while above, it increases with zzso For stiff zzso we report for the first time zzso behavior in the zzso zzso which has been seen earlier in the case of protein zzso
