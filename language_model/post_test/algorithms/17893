The zzso zzso is used for zzso the zzso zzso zzso the selection of appropriate zzso is crucial in zzso zzso since the weights for the zzso are generated from the selected zzso Since zzso proposed a method for obtaining the ordered weighted averaging zzso zzso via the three relative zzso used for the zzso zzso limited efforts have been devoted to developing new zzso that are suitable for use in zzso zzso In this correspondence, we propose some new zzso functions that are based on the weighting functions characterized by showing a constant value of zzso independent of the number of criteria zzso The proposed regular increasing monotone and regular decreasing monotone zzso produce the same zzso as the weighting functions from which each zzso function zzso Further, the zzso zzso rapidly zzso into the value of zzso of the weighting functions having a constant value of zzso This result indicates that a zzso zzso zzso will result in a similar zzso in case the number of criteria is not too zzso
