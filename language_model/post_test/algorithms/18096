Recent advances in sequencing techniques have yielded enormous amounts of protein sequence data from various zzso This large zzso allows sequence comparison between zzso and zzso proteins to identify motifs or functional positions that account for the differences of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and the zzso analysis zzso have been developed to detect such specificity positions from a multiple sequence alignment zzso grouped into classes according to certain biological zzso Other zzso such as zzso zzso a zzso and then predict specificity positions associated with zzso However, there are still many unresolved questions: Was the optimal subdivision of a protein family zzso Do the definitions at different levels of the zzso tree affect the prediction of specificity zzso Can the whole zzso tree be used instead of only one level in it to predict specificity zzso 

Here we present a novel method, zzso zzso zzso to trace the evolutionary pressure from the root to the branches of the zzso zzso At each level of the tree, a zzso plot is produced to capture the signal of the evolutionary zzso A consensus zzso plot is composed from the whole series of plots to provide a condensed zzso zzso related to functions that evolved early zzso or later zzso are close to the zzso or zzso corner of the zzso plot, zzso This novel approach allows an zzso zzso analysis of zzso relevance in a protein zzso We compared our zzso method with various zzso using both synthetic and real protein zzso The results show that our method is zzso sensitive to subtle differences in evolutionary pressure during evolution and comprehensive because all positions in the zzso are presented in the consensus zzso 

All computer programs and zzso used in this work are available at zzso for academic zzso
