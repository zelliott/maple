zzso candidate zzso zzso in a protein is a basic and fundamental step in many zzso zzso Due to the zzso of experimental approaches to systematically scan the entire zzso a zzso tool that predicts the most probable zzso regions is zzso 

The zzso server is a zzso tool that aims to predict zzso regions in either a protein three-dimensional structure or a linear zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that was trained to discern zzso features within a given zzso The zzso zzso has been compared to other available zzso prediction tools and was found to have higher zzso zzso A special emphasis was put on the development of a zzso zzso interface for displaying the zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso that predicts zzso regions for both a protein structure and a protein zzso Its accuracy and functionality make it a highly useful zzso zzso is available at zzso and includes extensive explanations and example zzso
