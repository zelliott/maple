zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso seem to improve the early diagnosis of acute zzso zzso zzso but it is unknown how to best use them in clinical zzso Our objective was to develop and validate an zzso for rapid zzso and zzso of zzso 

A prospective zzso study enrolling 872 zzso patients with acute chest pain presenting to the emergency zzso zzso cardiac zzso T zzso was measured in a blinded fashion at presentation and after 1 zzso The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent zzso An zzso zzso incorporating baseline values as well as absolute changes within the first hour was derived from zzso randomly selected patients and validated in the remaining zzso zzso The primary zzso end point was death during 30 days of zzso 

Acute zzso zzso was the final diagnosis in zzso of zzso After applying the zzso zzso developed in the derivation cohort to the validation zzso 259 patients zzso could be classified as zzso 76 patients zzso as zzso and 101 patients zzso as in the zzso zzso within 1 zzso Overall, this resulted in a sensitivity and negative zzso value of zzso for zzso a specificity and positive zzso value of zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso and a prevalence of zzso of zzso in the zzso zone zzso zzso 30-day survival was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients classified as zzso zzso zone, and zzso zzso 

Using a simple zzso incorporating zzso baseline values and absolute changes within the first hour allowed a safe zzso as well as an accurate zzso of zzso within 1 hour in zzso of zzso patients with acute chest zzso This novel strategy may zzso the need for prolonged monitoring and serial blood sampling in 3 of 4 zzso
