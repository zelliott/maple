Analysis of microbial communities by zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso has transformed microbial ecology research and led to the observation that many communities contain a diverse assortment of rare zzso phenomenon termed the zzso zzso Multiple studies have investigated the effect of zzso read quality on operational zzso unit zzso richness for contrived communities, yet there is limited information on the zzso of community structure estimates obtained through this zzso Given that zzso biases are widely zzso and further unknown biases may arise from the sequencing process itself, a zzso assumptions about the neutrality of the data generation process are at best zzso Furthermore, zzso quality control zzso have not been explicitly evaluated for the accuracy of recovered representative sequences and its impact on downstream zzso reducing useful discussion on zzso reads to their diversity and zzso Here we report on community structures and sequences recovered for in zzso communities consisting of zzso zzso zzso gene clones tiered at known zzso zzso zzso libraries of the zzso and zzso zzso regions from the in zzso communities were zzso using the Roche zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used quality control protocols resulted in the formation of zzso with zzso abundance composed entirely of erroneous zzso while zzso zzso approaches zzso real, expected zzso The zzso process itself did not appear to impose significant biases on overall community structure estimates, although the detection limit for rare zzso may be affected by zzso zzso size and quality control approach zzso Meanwhile, zzso biases associated with the initial zzso generation may impose greater zzso in the observed community zzso
