When conservative treatment of zzso disease fails, the optimal surgical approach is not well zzso Multiple factors, including penile zzso degree of zzso zzso narrowing with hinge effect and zzso response to zzso penile injections, indicate that no single approach is likely to solve the problem in all zzso 

A surgical zzso was developed for the treatment of zzso Disease based on our previous surgical experience, which was used zzso in 103 consecutive zzso zzso zzso without zzso was offered to patients with adequate rigidity for zzso Specifically, for mild to moderate zzso less than 60 degrees without hourglass or hinge effect zzso the less complicated zzso zzso zzso procedure was zzso For those men with more zzso complex zzso greater than 60 degrees and/or significant hourglass or hinge effect zzso plaque incision or partial zzso with zzso zzso was offered to limit zzso zzso and to reconstruct a zzso with normal caliber to provide optimal zzso support during zzso For men with poor sexually induced zzso and/or inadequate response to zzso zzso penile zzso placement was recommended to provide adequate zzso and zzso 

Of 22 patients who underwent zzso procedures zzso remained potent and the zzso remained straight zzso Of 52 patients who underwent an incision or partial zzso and zzso zzso 48 had zzso zzso with the zzso remaining straight in zzso and zzso remaining potent zzso A total of 29 patients received a zzso with the zzso remaining straight in zzso who were sexually active zzso During the follow up period zzso zzso zzso there have been no mechanical device zzso 

zzso outcome was zzso with this algorithm, which zzso surgical complexity to the underlying severity of the penile zzso and zzso zzso
