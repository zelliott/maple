A novel zzso zzso grafted titanium dioxide zzso was zzso through zzso self assembly methods, and its structure was zzso The zzso hybrid zzso showed high zzso under visible light zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and simulated solar zzso zzso zzso 365 zzso zzso of Orange II followed the zzso zzso zzso The initial rate zzso of Orange II degradation increased by zzso zzso and zzso times in the zzso conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 365 zzso zzso zzso increased the lifetimes of the excited states of the zzso guests and facilitated the electron transfer from the excited dye to the zzso zzso band, which enhanced the dye zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to be the main zzso species that caused the degradation of Orange II under visible zzso
