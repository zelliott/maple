The zzso of an acute zzso cardiac event is traditionally based on cardiac zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso The impact of new specific cardiac markers on the diagnostic zzso of suspected acute zzso zzso remains poorly zzso We therefore set out to compare the diagnostic and zzso information provided by the zzso code and a patient zzso based on the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso The significance of typical pain and various zzso zzso were separately zzso 

The study population consisted of 311 consecutive patients who were evaluated for suspected acute zzso zzso in a regional referral zzso Patients were zzso classified according to the zzso criteria, by a simplified code combining symptoms and zzso zzso zzso and solely using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Total mortality was followed for 1 and 5 zzso The zzso zzso zzso based zzso was shown to be the strongest predictor of mortality zzso zzso for outcome both at 1 and 5 zzso Typical pain and a positive Minnesota zzso had no zzso zzso However, an analysis zzso of the admission zzso was zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of suspected acute zzso zzso could be based solely on a specific cardiac marker, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach contains zzso information and is accurate enough for the structured diagnosis of acute zzso zzso Other outcome zzso could be used to identify patient zzso and assess zzso
