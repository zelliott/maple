We studied the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects of brief light flashes presented as zzso just prior to the acoustic startle zzso zzso in intact rats and in rats that had a bilateral zzso of visual zzso zzso The zzso and control groups zzso 5) were near identical in zzso for flashes presented zzso zzso before the zzso and near identical in zzso for flashes presented 60 zzso before the zzso These findings differ from those of a case report of a human patient following zzso zzso zzso for whom light flashes failed to produce either acoustic startle zzso or zzso if the flash were presented to the portion of the visual field in which she could not zzso they differ also from data obtained in functionally zzso rats, for which a light flash produced no startle zzso but instead a zzso exaggerated zzso In the present experiment the zzso was restricted to zzso while in contrast the zzso zzso in the human patient included zzso areas of the zzso and zzso zzso and functional zzso in the rat zzso the entire zzso The greater extent of these two effective surgical procedures may have been responsible for their greater zzso zzso otherwise, the complete loss of zzso control by zzso stimulation in the human patient but not in the rat may reflect the greater functional importance and anatomical complexity of the VC in zzso
