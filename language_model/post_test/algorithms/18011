Animals must quickly recognize objects in their environment and act zzso Previous studies indicate that looming visual objects trigger avoidance zzso in many species zzso however, such zzso operate over a close range and might not detect a threatening stimulus at a safe zzso We analyzed how fruit flies zzso zzso respond to simple visual stimuli both in free flight and in a zzso zzso Whereas zzso like many other insects, are attracted toward long vertical objects zzso we found that smaller visual stimuli elicit not weak attraction but rather strong zzso Because zzso to small spots depends on the vertical size of a moving object, and not on zzso it can function at a much greater distance than zzso zzso The opposing responses to long stripes and small spots reflect a simple but effective object zzso zzso zzso toward long stripes would lead flies toward zzso perches or feeding sites, whereas zzso from small spots would help them avoid aerial predators or zzso with other zzso The motion of flying zzso depends on a balance of these two systems, providing a foundation for studying the neural basis of behavioral choice in a genetic model zzso
