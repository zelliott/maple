The objective of this paper is to validate angle independent zzso zzso methods for blood zzso zzso Conventional zzso ultrasound zzso only estimates the blood zzso along the US beam direction where the estimate is angle corrected assuming zzso flow parallel to vessel zzso This results in incorrect blood zzso estimates, when angle of zzso approaches 90 degrees or when blood flow is zzso Three angle independent zzso zzso methods are evaluated in this zzso directional zzso zzso synthetic zzso flow imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso The performances of the three methods were investigated by measuring the stroke volume in the right common carotid artery of 11 healthy volunteers with magnetic resonance phase contrast zzso zzso as zzso The correlation with confidence intervals zzso between the three zzso zzso methods and zzso were: DB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and TO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were observed for any of the three comparisons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TO zzso zzso zzso zzso plots were additionally constructed, and mean differences with limits of agreements zzso for the three comparisons were: DB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso TO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso According to the results, reliable volume flow estimates can be obtained with all three zzso The three US zzso zzso techniques can yield quantitative insight into flow dynamics and zzso complex flow patterns, which potentially can give the zzso a novel tool for cardiovascular disease zzso
