For a long period of time, scientists studied zzso while assuming they are zzso Recently, zzso zzso capture zzso technologies, such as zzso have been developed that provide the zzso contact zzso among zzso pairs in a zzso zzso The technology unveiled that two zzso zzso can interact in the tested zzso It indicated that the tested zzso forms a three-dimensional zzso zzso structure within the zzso With the available zzso data, our next challenge is to model the zzso zzso structure from the zzso data zzso This article presents a deterministic method called zzso which applies zzso programming techniques to find the best structure fitting the observed data and uses golden section search to find the correct zzso for converting the contact frequency to spatial zzso Further, we develop a measure called consensus index to indicate if the zzso data zzso to a single structure or a mixture of zzso To the best of our knowledge, zzso is the only method that can guarantee recovering the correct structure in the zzso zzso In addition, we prove that the zzso of conversion from contact frequency to spatial distance will change under different resolutions theoretically and zzso Using simulation data and real zzso data, we showed that zzso is much more accurate and robust than existing zzso Finally, we demonstrated that interesting biological findings can be uncovered from our predicted zzso zzso
