zzso electrical field flow zzso zzso is a variation on electrical field flow zzso zzso where cyclical electrical fields are used instead of steady DC fields to increase the effective field experienced by particles in the flow zzso Even though the effective field increases more than zzso compared to normal zzso the retention and resolution in zzso has not been shown to be better than in zzso In this paper we report how one can zzso operational parameters in zzso to obtain good retention and resolution in zzso The effects of offset zzso frequency, zzso concentration of particles and sample size on zzso resolution and retained zzso peak ratio have been zzso The results obtained from these experiments were analyzed and suggestions have been made to improve both retention and zzso A zzso improvement in retention without a significant increase in band broadening is zzso
