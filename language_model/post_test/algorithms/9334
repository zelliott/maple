Brain function requires oxygen and maintenance of brain zzso zzso is zzso We evaluated how faithfully frontal lobe zzso zzso zzso follows zzso zzso zzso and how calculated zzso oxygen tension zzso influences motor zzso Twelve healthy subjects (20 to 29 zzso zzso and seated, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with and without added zzso carbon dioxide and during zzso Two measures of frontal lobe zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were compared with zzso oxygen zzso zzso as calculated from the zzso content of zzso zzso and right internal jugular zzso zzso At control zzso zzso zzso was halfway between the zzso zzso and jugular zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso devices monitored zzso zzso within approximately zzso as zzso increased from zzso to zzso with an increase in the zzso ultrasound zzso determined middle cerebral artery flow zzso from zzso to zzso zzso When zzso fell below approximately zzso with reduced flow and inspired oxygen tension, zzso decreased zzso and brain zzso release increased zzso zzso zzso strength correlated with the measured zzso and calculated zzso zzso values as well as with zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso is an adequate cerebral zzso zzso measure during manipulation of cerebral blood flow or inspired oxygen tension, or both, and suggest that motor performance zzso with the frontal lobe COLD zzso
