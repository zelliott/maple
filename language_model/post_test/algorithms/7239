A method to generate first passage times for a class of zzso processes is zzso It does not require construction of the zzso as usually needed in simulation studies, but is based on an integral equation whose unknown quantity is the probability density function of the studied first passage times and on the application of the hazard rate zzso The proposed procedure is particularly efficient in the case of the zzso process, which is important for modeling zzso zzso zzso
