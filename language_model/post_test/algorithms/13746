In zzso zzso systems the received zzso zzso zzso signal is multiplied by a zzso reference signal and subsequently averaged over a short depth range to obtain a sample of the complex zzso zzso The mean frequency of the sampled zzso zzso obtained with the zzso function, reflects the mean zzso of the zzso moving through the sample zzso An alternative is to evaluate the two-dimensional cross correlation function of a short segment of the zzso signals over subsequent lines, giving the mean zzso of the zzso Both methods of zzso zzso were applied to computer-generated zzso signals with varying zzso zzso zzso ratio, and mean and zzso of the imposed zzso zzso The length of the zzso signal segment and the number of lines for zzso zzso zzso zzso affects the accuracy of the zzso zzso It can be concluded that the cross correlation technique behaves zzso especially for a low zzso zzso Furthermore, the standard zzso of the zzso estimate decreases for an increasing sample volume length and package zzso while the performance of the conventional zzso technique is rather independent of the length of the sample zzso The difference between both techniques decreases for a greater package length or for signals simulating a wide zzso zzso
