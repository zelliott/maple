DNA zzso technology provides us with a first step toward the goal of uncovering gene functions on a zzso zzso In recent years, vast amounts of gene expression data have been collected, much of which are available in public databases, such as the Gene zzso zzso zzso To date, most researchers have been manually retrieving data from databases through web browsers using zzso numbers zzso or zzso but zzso patterns are not considered when retrieving such zzso The zzso zzso was recently introduced to compare gene expression data by introducing zzso signatures zzso by a set of genes with zzso or zzso labels according to their biological zzso and is available as a web tool for detecting similar zzso signatures from a limited data set zzso 7,000 expression profiles representing zzso zzso In order to support researchers to zzso the public gene expression data more zzso we developed a web tool for finding similar gene expression data and generating its zzso networks from a publicly available zzso 

zzso a web tool for searching gene expression data, allows users to search data from zzso using zzso signatures or gene expression ratio data as a query and retrieve gene expression data by comparing zzso pattern between the query and zzso gene expression zzso The comparison methods are based on the zzso zzso pattern matching approach of Lamb et zzso zzso 2006) with the additional calculation of statistical zzso The web tool was tested using gene expression ratio data randomly extracted from the zzso and with in-house zzso data, zzso The results validated the ability of zzso to retrieve gene expression entries biologically related to a query from zzso For further analysis, a network zzso interface is also zzso zzso genes and gene zzso are zzso linked to external data zzso 

zzso was developed to retrieve gene expression data by comparing query zzso pattern with those of zzso gene expression zzso It could be a very useful resource for finding similar gene expression profiles and constructing its gene zzso networks from a publicly available zzso zzso was designed to be zzso and is expected to support knowledge zzso zzso is freely available at zzso
