zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso has been shown to be a highly sensitive and specific imaging zzso in the diagnosis of primary and zzso tumors and in the control of therapies in numerous zzso zzso It was the aim of this review to validate the significance of PET as a diagnostic tool in zzso tumors of the zzso zzso A systematic review of the current literature concerning the role of PET for zzso tumors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried zzso The role of zzso PET for zzso cell cancer can be seen in the detection of zzso after definitive local therapy and zzso The higher sensitivity of PET in comparison to other therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell cancer suggests a supplemental role of this diagnostic procedure to complement other imaging zzso clinical value of PET is established for the identification of vital tumor tissue after chemotherapy of zzso germ cell zzso This diagnostic method has little significance for primary tumor staging and diagnosis of zzso germ cell tumor because of the high probability of zzso results in adult zzso zzso PET is not sensitive enough in the diagnosis of primary or zzso tumors in prostate or zzso zzso Also PET did not prove to be superior to conventional bone zzso in the detection of mostly zzso zzso in prostate zzso The recent use of alternative zzso which are partly not eliminated by urinary zzso zzso zzso has increased the sensitivity and specificity of PET also in this tumor entity so that further clinical investigations are needed to validate these technical modifications in their significance for this imaging zzso PET appears to be sufficiently evaluated only for the diagnostic follow-up of patients with zzso germ cell tumors after chemotherapy to regard it is the diagnostic tool of first zzso For all other tumors of the zzso tract this proof is still zzso
