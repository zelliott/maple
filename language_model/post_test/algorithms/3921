In the scope of reference zzso of zzso beams, zzso Carlo zzso simulations are widely used to zzso zzso chamber dose response zzso zzso related to the transport zzso can be verified performing zzso tests, zzso the so-called zzso cavity zzso The zzso cavity test is based on the zzso zzso which states that under charged particle equilibrium conditions, the charged particle zzso is independent of the mass density of the media as long as the zzso are zzso Such tests have not been performed yet for zzso codes simulating zzso zzso The objectives of this study are to design a new zzso cavity test for zzso zzso and to implement the methodology in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso extended to zzso zzso 

The new zzso test is designed to evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso particles with an energy of zzso and a mass zzso cross section of zzso are zzso having the ability to generate zzso with kinetic energy zzso and to be restored after each interaction, thus providing zzso zzso To perform the test, the authors use a simplified simulation model and rigorously demonstrate that the zzso cavity dose per incident zzso must equal zzso as expected in classic zzso zzso The zzso of the test is performed in zzso and zzso The geometry used for testing is a 10 zzso 10 zzso parallel virtual field and a cavity (2 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso in a water phantom with dimensions large enough to ensure zzso zzso 

For conservative zzso simulation parameters (leading to small step zzso both zzso and zzso pass the zzso cavity test within zzso However, differences of zzso and zzso were observed for zzso and zzso respectively, using larger step zzso For zzso the difference is attributed to the zzso method that introduces an artificial energy zzso if step size is not small zzso 

Using conservative zzso simulation zzso both zzso and zzso pass the zzso cavity test for zzso zzso Our methodology is zzso to any kind of charged zzso provided that the considered zzso code is able to track the charged particle zzso
