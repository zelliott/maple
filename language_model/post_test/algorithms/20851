zzso spin states have been observed in a variety of zzso Although the dynamics underlying the long lifetimes of these states are well understood in the case of zzso systems, the corresponding dynamics in systems containing more spins appear to be more zzso Recently it has been shown that a selection rule for transitions zzso by zzso zzso relaxation may play a role in determining the lifetimes of zzso states in systems containing arbitrary numbers of zzso Here we present a theory of zzso states in systems containing three and four spins and demonstrate how it can be used to identify states that have little or no zzso zzso zzso
