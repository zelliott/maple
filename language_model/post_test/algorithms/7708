A bottleneck in the analysis of zzso MR scans with white matter brain zzso is the temporally consistent zzso of the zzso We identify zzso in zzso within a spectral graph zzso zzso Our zzso approach simultaneously segments and tracks the evolving zzso by identifying characteristic image patterns at each zzso and zzso zzso across zzso For each zzso image, our method zzso a graph where weights between zzso capture the zzso of two zzso belonging to the same zzso Based on these zzso we then establish rough zzso between graph zzso at different zzso along estimated pathology evolution zzso We combine the zzso by aligning the weights to a reference zzso thus zzso zzso information across the zzso images, and formulate the zzso zzso problem as a zzso zzso of this zzso The resulting zzso is very robust to local intensity fluctuations and yields better results than zzso generated for each zzso
