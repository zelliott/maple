Recent works suggest that one of the roles of gap junctions in sensory systems is to enhance their dynamic range by avoiding early zzso in the first processing zzso In this work, we use a minimal zzso model of the ON rod pathways in the zzso zzso to study the effects of electrical synaptic zzso via gap junctions among rods and among zzso zzso cells on the dynamic range of the zzso The model is also used to study the effects of the maximum zzso of rod zzso activated current zzso on the dynamic range of the zzso allowing a study of the zzso between this intrinsic membrane zzso with those two zzso connectivity zzso Our results show that for realistic values of zzso zzso the dynamic range is enhanced by zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is less relevant to dynamic range amplification in comparison with zzso zzso Furthermore, a plot of the zzso output response versus input intensity for the optimal zzso zzso is well fitted by a power law with zzso approximately zzso The results are consistent with predictions of more theoretical works and suggest that the earliest expression of gap junctions along the rod zzso together with appropriate values of rod zzso zzso has the highest impact on zzso zzso dynamic range zzso
