A computer program, zzso identifies zzso and zzso zzso The program employs zzso zzso to predict zzso secondary structure, based on zzso with recognized zzso consensus sequences and ability to form a zzso zzso zzso genes are identified using a modified version of the BRUCE zzso zzso achieves a detection sensitivity of zzso from a set of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes and detects all complete zzso sequences in the zzso database, improving on the performance of the BRUCE zzso Recently discovered zzso genes in the zzso of two species from the zzso algae lineage are zzso The output of the program reports the proposed zzso secondary structure and, for zzso zzso the secondary structure of the zzso domain, the zzso gene zzso the tag zzso and a list of organisms with matching zzso zzso zzso
