Recently, the zzso approximation zzso Carlo zzso has been proposed by Liang et zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and simulation zzso An zzso version of this zzso was developed for real small protein folding zzso The zzso results indicate that it zzso simulated zzso and conventional zzso Carlo zzso as a zzso zzso zzso We also propose one method for the use of secondary structures in protein zzso The predicted protein structures are rather close to the true zzso
