The authors assessed the diagnostic value of brain tissue oxygen tension zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso and cerebral energy zzso zzso in detecting acute critical impairment of cerebral energy zzso Each single zzso as well as derived zzso zzso zzso difference in oxygen content zzso cerebral zzso rate for oxygen zzso fractional zzso oxygen extraction zzso were investigated during controlled variation of global cerebral zzso using a zzso infusion technique in 16 zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether acute changes between normal, zzso and critically reduced cerebral zzso as well as frank zzso defined by local cortical blood flow zzso brain electrical activity zzso and brain stem zzso control can be reliably identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not cerebral zzso pressure, were closely linked to zzso and zzso and allowed discrimination between normal, moderately reduced, and critically reduced cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio varied significantly only between moderately reduced cerebral zzso and frank zzso zzso loss of zzso and brain stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and the zzso ratio, reliably predict the transition from moderately to critically reduced cerebral zzso with impending energy zzso
