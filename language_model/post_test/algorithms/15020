We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso scanner for imaging soft tissue in the human zzso zzso signals are induced in soft tissue by zzso with 434 zzso zzso zzso The zzso signals are detected by an array of zzso mounted on a zzso zzso A zzso filtered zzso zzso is used to reconstruct zzso zzso patterns within soft zzso We have demonstrated soft tissue differentiation sufficient to delineate the normal internal structures of an excised lamb kidney using safe levels of zzso zzso
