zzso and zzso are widely used and fully automated zzso for measuring whole brain volume and volume change in zzso and zzso zzso studies and are particularly useful in studies of brain zzso The zzso of the zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso weighted zzso scans from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso The back-to-back zzso zzso scans in the zzso data set makes it a valuable benchmark against which to assess the performance of zzso of measuring zzso in the human brain with zzso zzso A total of zzso subjects were included for zzso and 385 subjects for zzso The annual percentage brain volume change zzso rates were zzso for the healthy controls, zzso for mild cognitively impairment zzso and zzso for zzso in line with previous zzso The median of the absolute value of the zzso of zzso zzso brain volume zzso was zzso while the 90th zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso had a median of zzso and a 90th zzso of zzso While the median zzso for zzso zzso was in line with the values previously reported in the literature, the median zzso of zzso zzso was about twice that zzso Also, the 90th zzso for both zzso and zzso were about twice the size that would be expected for a zzso zzso Because of the natural variation of the disease among patients over a year, a perfectly zzso whole brain zzso zzso would reduce the estimated group size needed to detect a specified treatment effect by only zzso to zzso as compared to zzso
