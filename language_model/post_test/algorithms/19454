zzso proteins are vitally important for many biological processes and have become an attractive target for both basic research and drug zzso zzso of membrane protein types often provides useful clues in zzso the functions of zzso membrane zzso With the unprecedented increasing of newly found protein sequences in the zzso era, it is highly demanded to develop an automated method for fast and accurately identifying the types of membrane proteins according to their zzso acid zzso Although quite a few identifiers have been developed in this regard through various approaches, such as zzso zzso zzso support zzso machine zzso artificial neural network zzso and zzso neighbor zzso zzso the way they operate the identification is basically zzso As is well known, wise persons usually take into account the opinions from several experts rather than rely on only one when they are making critical zzso Likewise, a sophisticated zzso should be trained by several different zzso In view of this, based on the frame of zzso acid that can incorporate a considerable amount of zzso effects, a novel approach called zzso zzso or zzso has been zzso Unlike the zzso and zzso approaches which only combine the zzso of a same type, the stacking approach can combine several different types of zzso through a zzso to maximize the zzso zzso The results thus obtained were very zzso It is anticipated that the stacking approach may also hold a high potential to improve the identification quality for, among many other protein zzso zzso location, zzso family class, zzso type, and zzso interaction zzso The stacked zzso zzso is available as a zzso named zzso at: zzso
