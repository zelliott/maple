Currently, linear zzso reconstruction is the only feasible method for zzso information about zzso distributed current sources from zzso of neural magnetic zzso We present the results of a systematic study of the effect of the zzso ratio on the imaging quality of one such zzso in zzso well as zzso zzso In particular, we will discuss the necessary zzso between the contradictory goals of a minimum norm of the reconstructed current density distribution and of a minimal zzso of the reconstructed fields from the measured zzso As an example, we show the reconstruction of a simple arrangement of two nearly parallel zzso in two different depths inside a zzso volume conductor, discussing the differences between the computer simulation without noise and simulation with a realistic noise zzso
