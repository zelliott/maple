zzso zzso zzso are mainly intended for people unable to perform any muscular movement, such as patients in a complete zzso zzso The majority of zzso interact visually with the user, either in the form of stimulation or zzso However, visual zzso challenge their ultimate use because they require the subjects to zzso explore and shift zzso using their muscles, thus excluding patients in a complete zzso state or under the condition of the unresponsive zzso zzso In this study, we present a novel fully auditory zzso based on a zzso listening paradigm using human voice for zzso This interface has been evaluated with healthy volunteers, achieving an average information transmission rate of zzso bits zzso in full-length trials and zzso bits zzso using the optimal length of trials, recorded with only one channel and without formal zzso This novel technique opens the door to a more natural communication with users unable to use visual zzso with promising results in terms of performance, zzso training and cognitive zzso
