The zzso of phase refinement with the imposition of zzso constraints is the essence of the zzso zzso Typically, these constraints prevent trial structures from falling into local zzso Nevertheless, zzso structures appear to migrate to false zzso with significant zzso These false zzso are characterized by the presence of a large zzso peak on the corresponding zzso zzso Fortunately, they can be recognized and avoided by considering the values of the minimal function both before and after the application of zzso However, it appears that finding solutions for large zzso structures is likely also to require zzso conditions different from those that have been found to work well in other space zzso In fact, these conditions often yield an unusually high percentage of zzso
