The study of interactions among zzso is of fundamental interest and practical importance in zzso zzso However, a final agreement on the definition of agent interaction is zzso and therefore, particular care should be adopted when using the terms zzso zzso and zzso unless the exact zzso pathways of the compounds studied are zzso Two main different approaches, the Bliss independence criterion and the zzso zzso model, have been generally used in zzso zzso In some cases, they can present dramatically different results, depending on the slope of the pure zzso zzso of single zzso Here, we consider both models in in zzso experiments, where the zzso zzso can be zzso zzso and limitations of both approaches are discussed, using several mathematical simulations to better explain them, and applying the Hill function for the zzso model zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso model is slightly preferable because of a general higher biological zzso However, which model to use must be determined case by case and the evaluation can be aided by experimental approaches, such as the study of multiple zzso and zzso zzso
