zzso the interaction between a system's components and the zzso evolution of the system are two common ways to uncover and characterize its internal zzso Recently, several maps from a time series to a network have been proposed with the intent of using network metrics to characterize time zzso Although these maps demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct zzso properties, it remains unclear how these zzso properties relate to the original time zzso Here, we propose a map from a time series to a network with an approximate inverse operation, making it possible to use network statistics to characterize time series and time series statistics to characterize zzso As a proof of concept, we generate an ensemble of time series ranging from periodic to random and confirm that application of the proposed map retains much of the information zzso in the original time series (or zzso after application of the map (or its zzso Our results suggest that network analysis can be used to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series and, perhaps more importantly, time series analysis can provide a powerful set of tools that augment the traditional network analysis zzso to zzso networks in new and useful zzso
