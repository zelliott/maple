zzso is a dual inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso This study investigated the zzso and clinical effects of zzso in patients with locally advanced zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso 

In total, 107 zzso patients with locally advanced zzso were zzso zzso to receive zzso or zzso for 2-6 weeks before zzso therapy zzso zzso included zzso and proliferation rates, clinical response, and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly increase zzso detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A statistically significant decrease in proliferation using zzso zzso was observed zzso In a subset of 40 patients that received zzso weeks of zzso or zzso objective response rate zzso was zzso zzso vs zzso zzso In the zzso zzso responders, all had zzso zzso 50% had zzso amplification, and 50% had zzso expression by zzso (including one patient with zzso zzso However, these patients showed variable zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on drug zzso Following zzso there was a statistically zzso difference in zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no clear correlation between changes in zzso or proliferation and response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most commonly reported adverse events with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso did not demonstrate zzso changes, but provided evidence of clinical activity in locally advanced zzso and warrants further investigation in this zzso
