Progress made in applying agent systems to molecular zzso biology is reviewed and strategies by which to exploit agent technology to greater advantage are zzso Communities of software agents could play an important role in helping zzso scientists design zzso for future zzso The advent of zzso sequencing in cattle and zzso increases the complexity of data analysis required to conduct research in livestock zzso zzso are always expanding and semantic differences among data are zzso Agent platforms have been developed to deal with generic issues such as agent communication, life cycle management and advertisement of services zzso and yellow zzso This frees zzso biologists from the zzso of having to zzso the wheel on these common zzso giving them more time to focus on biology and zzso Agent platforms that comply with the Foundation for zzso Physical Agents zzso standards are able to zzso In other words, agents developed on different platforms can communicate and cooperate with one another if zzso zzso communication protocol details are agreed upon between different agent zzso Many software agent platforms are zzso which means that even if some of the agents and data zzso are temporarily zzso a subset of the goals of the system can still be zzso Past use of software agents in zzso indicates that an agent approach should prove zzso zzso of current problems in zzso indicates that existing agent platforms should be adaptable to novel zzso
