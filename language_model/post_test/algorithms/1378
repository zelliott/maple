This paper presents an approach to zzso patient zzso information from a set of zzso zzso images and representing the kinetic information in zzso image zzso In this approach, three or four pairs of simultaneously acquired anterior and zzso images, for internal zzso with zzso are obtained at zzso zzso Each pair of anterior and zzso images is converted to a zzso zzso The sequential zzso images are then zzso registered to each other using a zzso zzso matched filter zzso With the registered images, the value at each zzso location, over time, is fitted to a zzso zzso The resulting zzso constant and intercept parameters are then represented as zzso and zzso zzso Further zzso integration of the exponential function results in a zzso zzso Phantom studies demonstrated that the proposed method is accurate and reliable in the registration and kinetic data extraction of the zzso zzso Clinical application of the approach to patients with zzso zzso showed that regions of rapid zzso or clearance that would not otherwise be highlighted were easily identified and some regions with unexpected zzso were zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso and zzso images provide a rapid and comprehensive visual assessment of patient zzso The technique may have a greater impact on the care of patients with extensive and distributed zzso
