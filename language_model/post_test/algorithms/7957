In modern zzso optical scanning instruments, like scanning microscopes, the zzso mismatch between the sample and the immersion medium introduces a significant amount of zzso aberration when imaging deep inside the zzso spreading out the impulse zzso Since such aberration depends on the zzso depth, it is not possible to achieve a zzso global compensation for the whole zzso sample in scanning zzso Therefore a zzso impulse response is zzso zzso the design of zzso elements that increase the tolerance to this aberration is of great zzso In this paper we report a hybrid technique that provides a focal spot that remains almost zzso in the zzso processing of thick zzso This zzso allows the application of zzso zzso techniques to that provide an improved recovery of the zzso structure when imaging thick zzso
