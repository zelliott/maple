The inferior zzso zzso zzso is a functionally and zzso zzso zzso Much of the information about the anatomical connectivity and zzso of this region was obtained from zzso studies on zzso zzso However, whether these findings from zzso primates can be applied to the human inferior zzso zzso especially the left inferior zzso zzso which shows evidence of considerable evolution from primates to humans, remains zzso In this study, diffusion zzso was employed to investigate the anatomical zzso of the human left inferior zzso zzso Using a new algorithm, spectral zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to search for regional variations in the zzso connectivity profiles of all left inferior zzso zzso zzso with all the rest of the brain identified six zzso with distinctive connectivity properties in the left inferior zzso zzso zzso with zzso findings, four zzso were found in the left zzso zzso and two zzso in the left angular zzso The specific connectivity patterns of each zzso of the left inferior zzso zzso were supported by both the anatomical and functional connectivity properties for each zzso as calculated by a zzso target method and by zzso whole brain anatomical and functional connectivity zzso The proposed zzso scheme for the human left inferior zzso zzso and the maximum probability map for each zzso may facilitate more detailed future studies of this brain zzso
