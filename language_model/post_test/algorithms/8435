The authors modeled the influence of zzso on the dynamics of zzso using three parameters derived from the zzso zzso spectral edge frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Index zzso 

zzso patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were zzso of which 12 received a target zzso concentration of 0 zzso eight 2 zzso eight 4 zzso and another eight 8 zzso Next zzso zzso several zzso changes in the zzso zzso concentration zzso were zzso A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded zzso the raw zzso zzso and zzso The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an zzso zzso zzso model to describe the relation between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Model parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso were estimated using the population data analysis program zzso zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Determined from zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso but caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase at 8 zzso and decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction at 8 zzso Determined from zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease at 8 zzso with no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Determined from zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease at 8 zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Median zzso values of the pooled data set were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso values for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting its hypnotic potency as determined from zzso and zzso In terms of zzso the zzso zzso model describes the zzso relation zzso
