The majority of multiple sclerosis zzso patients develop some form of lower urinary tract dysfunction, usually as a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients identify urinary zzso as one of the worst aspects of this zzso Despite the high prevalence of zzso zzso evaluation and treatment are significantly zzso in this zzso The objectives of this study were: 1) to adapt the previously validated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a short form for ease and zzso of application in a clinical setting that is clinically zzso and 2) to develop a scoring zzso that would be zzso in terms of zzso precise diagnosis and zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso study was conducted to assess the zzso properties of the zzso among patients who have zzso with and without zzso Mixed zzso methods zzso classical statistics zzso theory zzso zzso New York: zzso 1994) and item response methods zzso the zzso zzso Fundamental zzso in the Human zzso New Jersey: Lawrence zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the zzso and clinical zzso of the shortened zzso The latter included clinicians flagging clinically meaningful items and associated response options which would indicate the need for further evaluation or zzso 

A total of 151 patients, all with zzso and with and without zzso were recruited by 28 clinicians in various US geographical zzso zzso zzso of patients reported a history of or currently having urinary zzso and/or urinary zzso The prediction model across the entire range of zzso thresholds was zzso plotting the true positive identification rate against the false positive rate zzso for various cut zzso In this study, the zzso or total score of greater than or equal to 6 had a sensitivity of approximately zzso and specificity of approximately zzso zzso zzso patients would warrant being referred to a zzso and zzso of the patients whose symptoms would not warrant zzso zzso 

zzso the short form zzso demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as it maintained the integrity of the longer form zzso zzso zzso for each zzso as well as zzso and concurrent zzso of the total shortened instrument was zzso This instrument provides a new method for assessing zzso problems among zzso patients, and may facilitate earlier and more precise diagnosis, treatment, and/or referral to a zzso
