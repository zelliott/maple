The objective of this study was to separate multiple signal components present in functional zzso zzso data zzso Blind source separation techniques were applied to the analysis of zzso data to determine multiple zzso relevant independent signal zzso 

Computer simulations were performed to test the reliability and zzso of the independent component analysis zzso Four subjects (3 males and 1 female between 14 and 29 years old) were scanned under various stimulus conditions: zzso rest while breathing room air, zzso bilateral finger tapping while breathing room air, and zzso zzso during bilateral finger zzso 

zzso performed on synthetic data sets demonstrated that not only could the zzso reliably detect the shapes of each of the source signals, but it also preserved their relative zzso The zzso also performed robustly in the presence of zzso With use of zzso time series data sets from bilateral finger tapping during zzso distinct zzso relevant independent sources were reliably zzso One independent component corresponded to the zzso cerebrovascular response, and another independent component corresponded to cortical zzso from bilateral finger zzso In three of the four subjects, the underlying fluctuations in signal related to baseline respiratory rate were identified in the third independent zzso Principal component analysis zzso could not separate these two independent zzso zzso 

With use of zzso signals originating from independent sources could be separated from a linear mixture of observed zzso zzso of zzso were also zzso
