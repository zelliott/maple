zzso zzso is an indispensable technique in medical science, especially in zzso association zzso Although the conventional method of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is one standard approach, as its calculation cost is an exponential function of the maximum number of zzso zzso it has not been widely zzso We propose a method of zzso zzso that can zzso accommodate up to several tens of single zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso block while maintaining criteria that are exactly equivalent to those of the zzso zzso The idea is to reduce the cost of calculating the zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso exploiting the symmetrical and inclusive relationships of zzso based on the zzso zzso Testing of the proposed method using real data sets revealed that it has a wider range of applications than the zzso zzso
