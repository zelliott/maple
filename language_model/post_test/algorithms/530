The authors examined the relative zzso zzso of knowledge structure zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the utility of using a combination of knowledge structure zzso in the prediction of skill acquisition and zzso zzso from an zzso of 5 independent samples (N zzso zzso whose participants underwent training on a complex computer simulation indicated that zzso and the zzso zzso yielded comparable zzso zzso zzso Support for the incremental zzso of using a combination of zzso was zzso the most, albeit small, gain came in pairing zzso and closeness when predicting zzso After controlling for baseline zzso general mental ability, and zzso knowledge, only zzso explained a statistically significant amount of unique zzso in zzso Overall, the results suggested that the different zzso largely overlap in their representation of knowledge organization, but that zzso better reflects adaptable aspects of knowledge organization important to skill zzso
