We investigate the diffusion zzso of the time integral of the zzso order zzso in globally coupled zzso phase zzso This zzso represents the zzso of the time integral of the order zzso from its mean value on the sample zzso In other words, this zzso characterizes long-term fluctuations of the order zzso For a system of N coupled zzso we introduce a statistical quantity D, which denotes the product of N and the diffusion zzso We study the zzso law of D with respect to the system size zzso In other well-known models such as the zzso model, the zzso property of D is zzso for both coherent and incoherent regimes except for the transition zzso In contrast, in the globally coupled phase zzso the zzso law of D is different for the coherent and incoherent zzso zzso with a certain constant zzso in the coherent regime and zzso in the incoherent zzso We demonstrate that these zzso laws hold for several representative zzso zzso
