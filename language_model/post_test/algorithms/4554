In this study the zzso partition and releasing balances of zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso of zzso drug zzso zzso zzso on the base of its zzso from zzso solutions on the surface of activated zzso were obtained in the temperature range of 25 to 45 degrees C used zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental data have been analyzed by zzso and zzso equations to obtain parameters describing properly this zzso zzso The zzso parameters zzso change zzso Gibbs zzso zzso and zzso were calculated and zzso The partition zzso of zzso zzso in the system organic zzso phase with different organic zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso method have been zzso The experimental partition zzso of zzso increased from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso The influence of the concentration of zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso used for preparation of the zzso zzso on zzso release has been zzso Both the zzso of zzso and the drug had influence on the release zzso
