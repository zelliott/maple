zzso zzso are localized regions in a light field where one or more of the field zzso such as phase or zzso become singular with associated zero zzso zzso beam zzso exploits the fact that the strong variations of the optical field around the zzso are highly sensitive to changes in their zzso As a consequence, analysis of the light field scattered from the object during a scanning process can yield useful information about the object zzso We present a theoretical background, zzso simulations, and experimental zzso zzso experiments have demonstrated a sensitivity of 20 zzso in the position and size of simple objects, with theoretically estimated 1 zzso capability under the assumption of a reasonable and conservative 30 zzso signal to noise zzso
