The purpose of this study is to develop a zzso model to describe a zzso new zzso zzso approach based on zzso zzso model zzso and zzso zzso zzso to allow the linkage between valve closure behavior and sodium zzso transport mechanism in freshwater clam zzso zzso in response to zzso copper zzso We test the proposed model against published data regarding Na zzso zzso in rainbow trout and Na zzso profile in zzso zzso confirming that the zzso model is zzso Here, we show that the predicted zzso maximum zzso zzso flux in zzso zzso is zzso zzso with a zzso affinity constant of zzso zzso zzso of Na zzso and valve closure daily rhythm driven by external zzso can also be predicted zzso We suggest that this zzso zzso closure zzso approach might provide the basis of a future design of zzso zzso
