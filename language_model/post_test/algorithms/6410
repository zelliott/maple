Metal zzso serve many purposes in natural zzso from the stabilization of zzso structure to the direction of protein folding to crucial roles in electron transfer and zzso There is considerable interest in creating metal binding sites in designed proteins to understand the structural role of metal zzso and to design new zzso with useful zzso The de zzso design of zzso and the role of metals in the folding of designed proteins are reviewed here, with particular focus on the design, zzso and activities of the zzso zzso This zzso is constructed by the zzso attachment of zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and it is assembled into a folded zzso coiled zzso by the addition of a zzso transition metal zzso and the resulting zzso collapse of the zzso The zzso structure has been employed in diverse applications, ranging from electron transfer zzso studies to the study of optimal zzso packing in a virtual library to the construction of receptors and zzso
