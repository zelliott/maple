The purpose of this study was to design a clinically zzso zzso for zzso zzso fractures that would provide guidance to the surgeon with regard to surgical approach and operative zzso The new zzso was assessed by use of the original zzso from a study comparing zzso zzso fracture zzso undertaken in Oxford, England, and was validated by use of the exact methodology of that zzso Nine independent zzso were asked to zzso 33 sets of zzso on 2 separate occasions using the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso as well as the new zzso zzso With the use of the zzso zzso the level of zzso and zzso agreement was zzso The new zzso system was found to be both substantially reliable zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The new zzso achieved superior zzso and zzso agreement compared with the other 3 zzso systems, with a low proportion of zzso zzso Used in conjunction with a management algorithm, we believe that the new zzso aids the surgical decision-making process for these complex zzso
