zzso zzso zzso of a zzso is often used to measure zzso function with zzso zzso We evaluated the effect of zzso count loss on the calculation of fractional zzso zzso of zzso zzso In 15 patients, dynamic zzso zzso was performed after the injection of 250 zzso of zzso A reference source was placed on the periphery of the field of view of the gamma camera to monitor the loss of counts in dynamic zzso The activity in the syringe was also counted with the camera to measure the injected dose, and the zzso count loss in the syringe was zzso from the observed count rate and zzso in imaging a point zzso zzso zzso zzso the ratio of zzso zzso on dynamic imaging to the injected dose, was assessed with and without correction for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso with no zzso zzso when the value after correction for loss in both syringe counts and dynamic imaging was used as a zzso It was underestimated by zzso with correction for syringe counts zzso The results suggest that correction for count loss only in measuring the injected dose does not lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of zzso zzso function with zzso zzso
