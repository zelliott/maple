The effect of various zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated on ex zzso zzso of zzso zzso across rat zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso its stratum zzso zzso partition zzso and zzso energy for diffusion across skin with or without zzso in vehicle zzso ethanol in water) were determined to understand their mechanism of zzso All the zzso studied significantly increased zzso flux of zzso in comparison to vehicle zzso and their enhancement activities are in the following decreasing order: zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso partition zzso of zzso were not significantly altered zzso by zzso zzso energies of zzso zzso across rat skin from water, vehicle and zzso in vehicle were measured to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and SC lipids were studied with molecular modeling and found that zzso form hydrogen bonds zzso zzso zzso with zzso head zzso The mechanism of zzso enhancement of zzso by zzso was explained with zzso activity, zzso partition zzso zzso energy and molecular modeling zzso
