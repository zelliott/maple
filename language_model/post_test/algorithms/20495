zzso zzso of zzso at 254 zzso generates several different types of DNA zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso in zzso require the development of suitable structure determination methods such as mass zzso In an earlier study zzso et zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso Ion zzso 1997, zzso zzso we showed that fast atom zzso and tandem sector mass zzso can be used to locate the site of zzso and identify most of the zzso of zzso One goal of the present research was to expand the method to the more sensitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso A second goal was to test the zzso of the methods by investigating not only the zzso of zzso but also those of three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these sequences were separated by zzso and gave characteristic zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso of zzso zzso
