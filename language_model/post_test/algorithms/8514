Identification of a zzso binding site on a protein is pivotal to drug zzso To date, no reliable and zzso feasible general approach to this problem has been zzso Here we present an automated efficient method for determining binding sites on proteins for potential zzso without any a zzso zzso Our method is based upon the zzso concept where we deal with a hierarchy of models generated using a zzso zzso zzso for the potential zzso This is done in a simple approach zzso a potential zzso is represented by a growing number of feature zzso At each increasing level of detail, a pruning of potential binding site is zzso A zzso energy function is used to score the interactions between molecules at each zzso The technique was successfully employed to seven zzso zzso In the current paper we show that the zzso considerably reduces the zzso effort required to solve this zzso This approach offers real opportunities for exploiting the large number of structures that will evolve from structural zzso
