A novel technique for the production of zzso zzso zzso that uses standard zzso processes and zzso zzso is reported here in zzso These zzso zzso edge zzso zzso zzso have been zzso with highly zzso control of the key array dimensions, including the size and pitch of the individual elements and, most importantly, the zzso of the zzso zzso The definition of lateral features to zzso dimensions typically requires expensive patterning techniques that are complex and zzso However, the fabrication methodology used here relies on the fact that vertical dimensions zzso layer zzso have long been zzso at the zzso using thin film deposition techniques that are well established in mainstream zzso The authors report for the first time two aspects that highlight the particular suitability of these zzso array systems for probe zzso zzso The first is zzso which shows the enhanced sensitivity to the zzso reaction of the solution zzso zzso The second is the enhancement of probe film zzso observed for the probe film model zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Such surface modification for specific probe layer zzso and detection is of significance for a wide range of biomedical and other sensing and zzso zzso
