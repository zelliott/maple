The purpose of this study was to verify the zzso performance of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso radiation therapy zzso and zzso arc therapy zzso 

The zzso Physics Center zzso head and neck zzso phantom was used for all calculations and zzso in this zzso zzso equivalent zzso and zzso plans were created on the zzso zzso phantom in the Eclipse treatment planning system zzso zzso by using zzso dose prescription zzso The dose zzso were calculated with two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two dose report modes of zzso were recorded: zzso in medium zzso and zzso in medium zzso Each treatment plan was delivered to the zzso phantom three times for zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso linear zzso Absolute point dose and zzso dose were measured with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso film, zzso Profile comparison and zzso gamma analysis were used to zzso the agreement between the film zzso and the calculated dose zzso from both zzso and zzso The zzso times for AAA and zzso were also zzso 

Good agreement was observed between measured doses and those calculated with AAA or zzso Both AAA and zzso calculated doses within zzso of zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso were slightly better than AAA zzso to zzso or zzso zzso to zzso The gamma analysis for both AAA and zzso met the zzso zzso zzso criteria (over zzso zzso whereas zzso met zzso zzso criteria in most zzso AAA was 2 to 3 times faster than zzso for zzso whereas zzso was 4-6 times faster than AAA for zzso 

zzso was found to be zzso accurate when compared to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso results were equal to or better than those obtained with film zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reporting mode was found to be closer to zzso and film zzso than was the zzso zzso zzso calculation time was found to be significantly shorter zzso than AAA for zzso
