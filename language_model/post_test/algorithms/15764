Research into zzso is needed in developing zzso Assessment of variations in disease frequency between regions might enhance our understanding of the disease, but zzso difficulties need to be zzso We aimed to develop and test a culturally and educationally unbiased diagnostic instrument for zzso 

In a zzso study, the zzso zzso Research Group interviewed zzso people aged 60 years and older in 25 zzso most in Universities, in India, China and southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and zzso zzso had zzso and three groups were free of zzso 702 had depression, zzso had high education (as defined by each zzso and 760 had low education (as defined by each zzso Local clinicians diagnosed zzso and zzso An interviewer, masked to zzso diagnosis, administered the geriatric mental state, the community screening instrument for zzso and the modified zzso to zzso a zzso of Alzheimer's Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Each measure independently predicted a diagnosis of zzso In an analysis of half the sample, an zzso derived from all three measures gave better results than any individual zzso zzso to the other half of the sample, this zzso identified zzso of zzso cases with zzso rates of zzso zzso and zzso in the depression, high education, and low education groups, zzso 

Our zzso is a sound basis for culturally and educationally sensitive zzso diagnosis in clinical and zzso research, supported by translations of its constituent measures into most languages used in the developing zzso
