Previous studies have reported low zzso of zzso zzso measures during emotion processing zzso It is not clear, however, whether low zzso is a result of changes in the underlying neural signal over time, or due to insufficient reliability of the acquired zzso signal caused by noise zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of zzso the zzso zzso by correcting for zzso noise and for differences in zzso zzso on measures of zzso Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned on two different occasions, performing an emotion provocation task with faces zzso 50% fearful, zzso zzso followed by a zzso paradigm to provide a marker of zzso zzso zzso of signal distribution zzso zzso and zzso of signal zzso within two regions of interest zzso and zzso zzso were estimated by calculating the zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso was only found within the right zzso during the perception of 50% fearful faces, but disappeared when zzso noise correction was zzso zzso zzso was higher within the zzso zzso than within the amygdala, and better at the group level than at the participant zzso Neither zzso noise zzso nor consideration of zzso zzso assessed through the zzso increased zzso The findings lead to the conclusion that low zzso of zzso response zzso to emotional faces is more likely to be explained by the lack of stability in the underlying neural signal than by zzso noise zzso Furthermore, reported zzso might be a result of zzso of zzso zzso variation rather than neural zzso This means that the emotion paradigm used in this study might not be useful for studies that require the zzso response to be a stable measure of emotional processing, for example in the context of zzso
