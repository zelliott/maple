Recently, mass zzso has been applied to studies of hydrogen exchange of backbone zzso allowing analysis of large proteins at zzso zzso Low resolution spatial information is obtained by digesting proteins after exchange into zzso using zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso by mass increases of resulting zzso This study develops modeling zzso to increase resolution, using the signal zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for larger, less stable zzso zzso data for peptides were analyzed by zzso least squares and a maximum zzso method, distinguishing zzso into fast, zzso slow, and zzso zzso Analysis of completely zzso or zzso peptides and peptides with sequence zzso showed that zzso zzso were generally hydrogen bonded and zzso constrained or buried zzso or zzso zzso A from the protein surface, while fast exchanging zzso were generally exposed at the protein zzso In order to more fully understand the intermediate and slow exchanging classes, an empirical model was developed by analyzing published exchange rates in zzso zzso The model correlated protection factors with a combined dependency on surface accessibility, hydrogen bond zzso and position of zzso from alpha zzso zzso Together with analysis of partial zzso products, the derived rules for exchange allowed modeling of exchange behavior of zzso zzso zzso from the predicted rates in some cases suggested a role for zzso freedom in regulating fast and intermediate exchanging zzso
