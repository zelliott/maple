This report describes a mathematical approach for zzso two-dimensional zzso maps without spot detection or pattern zzso Analysis of zzso was performed using wave packet zzso of the zzso The scanned images were automatically zzso into a set of zzso organized in a tree zzso Each zzso contained relevant information such as its energy, or zzso zzso the zzso position itself of the zzso reflected a frequency zzso A distance was then defined using the tree zzso of these zzso Finally a statistical zzso on the tree structures was performed, terminating with a zzso of the images according to their zzso zzso The zzso has been applied to zzso zzso zzso light chain patterns and proved useful to automatically detect zzso zzso or zzso zzso
