We develop a zzso model for zzso stepping of zzso engineered with extended neck zzso This requires that we consider the separation in zzso binding sites between the heads of the motor at the beginning of a zzso We show that this separation is stationary and can be included in the calculation of standard experimental zzso We also develop a corresponding zzso zzso framework for conducting computer zzso Our zzso approach is more efficient zzso than large-scale zzso Carlo zzso This efficiency greatly zzso sensitivity analysis, an important feature when there is considerable uncertainty in the physical parameters of the zzso We demonstrate the application and effectiveness of our approach by showing that the zzso chain model for the neck zzso can explain recently published experimental zzso While we have focused on a particular scenario for zzso these methods could also be applied to zzso and other zzso zzso
