In this paper, we propose a new zzso retrieval algorithm, zzso zzso The performance of a retrieval system is critically decided by the accuracy of adopted similarity measures zzso or zzso In zzso zzso ideally, zzso objects should have smaller distances than zzso zzso However, it is a difficult task to design an ideal metric to account for the large zzso zzso Different types of measures may focus on different aspects of the objects: for example, measures zzso based on contours and skeletons are often complementary to each zzso Our goal is to develop an zzso to fuse different similarity measures for robust shape retrieval through a zzso learning zzso We name our method zzso which is inspired by the zzso zzso Given two similarity measures and a query shape, the zzso zzso zzso the most similar shapes using one measure and assigns them to a pool for the other measure to do a zzso and vice zzso Using zzso we achieved an improved result of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso data set over the state-of-the-art zzso We also present an zzso called zzso to fuse zzso similarities, and it achieved zzso on the zzso data zzso Our zzso is general, and it can be directly applied on input similarity zzso it is not limited to object shape retrieval and can be applied to other tasks for zzso
