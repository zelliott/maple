This paper focuses on the intricate relationship between smooth and zzso phenomena in an zzso zzso In particular a boundary zzso solution, that is born in a zzso fold, is zzso zzso boundary zzso solutions play a key role in determining the global dynamics of a system and here we will show how grazing zzso can affect their zzso
