zzso is a key zzso feature that allows discrimination between different zzso zzso sensations are highly dependent on the zzso evolution of the power spectrum of an audio zzso In order to zzso characterize such zzso the shape of the power spectrum has to be zzso in a way that preserves certain physical and zzso zzso zzso it is common practice to zzso zzso power zzso using zzso frequency zzso In this paper, we study and characterize the statistical properties of such zzso here called zzso zzso In particular, we report on zzso zzso of zzso zzso extracted from zzso hours of audio coming from disparate sources such as speech, music, and environmental zzso zzso to text zzso we find a zzso zzso distribution with zzso close to zzso zzso this distribution is found independently of different zzso decisions and regardless of the audio zzso Further analysis on the intrinsic characteristics of most and least frequent zzso reveals that the most frequent zzso tend to have a more homogeneous zzso We also find that speech and music databases have specific, distinctive zzso while, in the case of the environmental sounds, this zzso zzso are not zzso Finally, we find that a zzso process with memory provides a reasonable quantitative approximation for our data, suggesting the existence of a common simple zzso mechanism for all considered sound zzso
