In this paper, we consider a learning strategy that allows one to transmit information between two coupled phase zzso systems (called teaching and learning systems) via frequency zzso The dynamics of these systems can be modeled with reference to a number of partially synchronized cluster states and transitions between zzso zzso the teaching system by steady but zzso zzso zzso produces zzso sequences of transitions between the cluster states, that is, information about zzso is zzso via a zzso zzso process into zzso zzso The large variety of codes can be learned by the learning system that adapts its zzso to those of the teaching zzso We zzso the dynamics using zzso order parameters zzso that are analogous to zzso field zzso in neural zzso Since zzso coding is a mechanism that appears in zzso systems, the developed learning rules may help to extract information from these neural zzso
