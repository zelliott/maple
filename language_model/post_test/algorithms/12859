In this paper, we present a simple and efficient zzso for multiple zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are first transformed into a zzso zzso The zzso is then converted into a Directed zzso zzso zzso zzso finding the alignment is reduced to finding the longest path in the zzso which is zzso in linear zzso The experiments show that the zzso can correctly find the zzso and runs faster than zzso and zzso In addition, our zzso can handle the alignments with overlapping zzso and has both weighted and zzso zzso It provides the flexibility for the alignments depending on different zzso
