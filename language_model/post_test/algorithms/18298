To determine the appropriate zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction zzso for a quantitative zzso trial of diffuse lung zzso 

Phantom images were reconstructed using relevant reconstruction zzso from 2 CT manufacturers to measure mean CT numbers and image zzso zzso spatial resolution and edge response function were determined for each zzso Clinical images of patients with diffuse lung disease were evaluated by a zzso zzso in terms of image quality and disease zzso 

The CT numbers were accurate for most reconstruction zzso for both manufacturers, although some zzso with strong zzso enhancement altered CT zzso The Bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided the higher spatial resolution deemed clinically necessary for imaging diffuse lung disease while preserving CT number zzso The extent of diffuse lung disease was strongly dependent on the reconstruction zzso 

A moderately sharp reconstruction zzso zzso was selected for the evaluation of diffuse lung zzso
