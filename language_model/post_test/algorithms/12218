zzso is a novel computer code, which has been developed for the prediction of various zzso properties such as heat of formation, heat of explosion, volume of explosion gaseous products and other related performance zzso In this paper, we report zzso zzso zzso code which has been zzso for the zzso of various high explosives in different combinations to obtain maximum possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso code will vary the composition of mixed explosives automatically in the range of zzso and zzso the oxygen balance as well as the zzso of detonation for various compositions in zzso zzso Further, the code suggests the compositions for which least oxygen balance and the higher zzso of detonation could be zzso zzso the code can be applied for two component explosive zzso The code has been validated with well-known explosives like, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, zzso and zzso in different zzso The new zzso incorporated in zzso zzso zzso enhances the efficiency and makes it a more powerful tool for the zzso working in the field of high energy zzso zzso
