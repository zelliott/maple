The present study investigates the relationship between the changes in complex zzso and zzso zzso Principal component zzso analysis is applied to a zzso data set obtained from the in zzso monitoring of the curing of zzso zzso of zzso A with the zzso zzso The values of complex zzso obtained by dynamic mechanical analysis during the cure process were used as a zzso The zzso zzso recorded throughout the reaction, unlike the zzso data analysis at some zzso of the zzso contain a sufficient amount of information to estimate the complex zzso The relationship found was high and the results demonstrate the quality of the fitted zzso Also, a simple zzso procedure for applying the model, focused on the user, is zzso
