A theoretical model for predicting intrinsic and induced DNA zzso as well as their zzso properties is zzso zzso zzso zzso are evaluated by zzso local zzso from the zzso zzso of the different zzso zzso zzso zzso are obtained by adopting the principle of minimum deformation free energy, evaluated in the zzso space, in the framework of zzso zzso Finally zzso stacking energies and melting temperatures are considered to account for local zzso In fact the two scales are strongly zzso The model works very zzso in predicting the zzso effects on the DNA experimental behavior, such as the gel zzso zzso the writhe transitions in zzso constrained zzso the zzso zzso of zzso reactions as well as the zzso zzso stability zzso
