Several commercial products are currently available for clinical application as bone graft zzso These products can be broadly classified into two zzso synthetic and zzso zzso bone is a popular source for several of the natural bone zzso The availability of bovine derived zzso bone zzso has made it possible to avoid traumatic and expensive secondary surgery to obtain zzso bone once thought essential for effective bone zzso While zzso bone still remains the zzso zzso zzso in bone zzso the realization that bone requirement in several clinical applications is as effectively met by zzso has lead to their widespread zzso But the convenience of using zzso is tempered by the possibility of disease transmission from cattle to zzso The recent incidents of bovine zzso zzso zzso in humans have underscored this zzso In this paper, we report a risk analysis performed to assess the possibility of such disease transmission from a commercially available bone graft substitute zzso that is popularly used in clinical zzso 

An extensive review of current literature on the status of risk assessment of zzso transmission was conducted, and two risk assessment models were identified as zzso to the present zzso zzso assessment models developed by the German Federal Ministry of Health and by the zzso Research and Manufacturers Association of America were applied to zzso 

zzso from the analyses conducted using both models showed that the risk of disease zzso transmission from zzso was negligible and could be attributed to the stringent protocols followed in sourcing and processing of the raw bovine bone used in the commercial zzso 

Based on the risk analysis, it is evident that the risk of zzso infection from zzso is several orders of magnitude less than that posed by the risk of death related to, lightning, zzso or similar remote zzso However, this low risk can only be maintained as long as an effective and active risk management program is implemented in operations that involve processing zzso tissue for human zzso
