To determine the discrimination characteristics of a new zzso and two existing symptom scoring systems for identification of patients with suspected zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso by a zzso study and assessment of discrimination characteristics using receiver operating characteristics zzso zzso Three zzso cancer scoring systems were zzso The zzso zzso zzso which we derived from a large primary care zzso the zzso score, previously derived from a primary care zzso study and a symptom score derived from National Institute of Clinical Excellence zzso guidance for urgent referral of symptomatic zzso Their discrimination characteristics were investigated in two zzso the zzso derivation zzso and the zzso score derivation zzso The main analyses were zzso zzso and the areas under them for all three zzso in both zzso Setting Electronic primary care zzso Main outcome measures Diagnosis of zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso areas under the curve were: zzso equation zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso guidelines zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In the zzso zzso areas under the curve were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso guidelines zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In subjects under 50 the discrimination characteristics of zzso referral guidelines were no better than zzso 

Both multivariable symptom scoring systems performed significantly better than zzso referral zzso
