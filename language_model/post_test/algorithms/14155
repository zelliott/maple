A zzso systematic zzso is zzso consisting of a genetic programming module and a zzso neighbor zzso to automatically create artificial zzso features possibly without a known physical zzso from the reconstructed zzso trajectory of zzso zzso signals that reveal zzso patterns of zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated with zzso data from seven patients, with prediction defined over a horizon of zzso zzso before unequivocal zzso zzso A total of 59 baseline epochs zzso and 55 zzso epochs zzso were used for validation zzso Among the results, it is shown that 12 zzso out of 55 were missed while four baseline epochs were zzso yielding zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso
