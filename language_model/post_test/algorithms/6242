zzso zzso zzso is routinely used in clinical practice to measure left zzso zzso mass, dimensions, and zzso The reliability of these zzso is highly dependent on the ability to obtain zzso long axis zzso images of the left zzso from zzso zzso acoustic zzso Real time three-dimensional zzso zzso is a novel imaging technique that allows the acquisition of dynamic zzso data structures encompassing the entire zzso and could potentially overcome the effects of LA zzso zzso the aim of this paper was to develop a nearly automated method based on optical flow techniques for the measurement of the left zzso zzso LA throughout the cardiac cycle from zzso zzso The zzso LA zzso obtained with the automated technique has been compared with LA zzso derived from manual selection of the LA from a zzso display of zzso zzso High correlation zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso no significant bias zzso zzso and narrow limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso were zzso The comparison between the LA length derived from zzso and zzso data showed significant zzso of the zzso based zzso In conclusion, this study proves that zzso data overcome the effects of zzso and indicates that the method we propose allows fast and accurate zzso of LA length throughout the cardiac zzso
