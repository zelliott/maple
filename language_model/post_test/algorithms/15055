To determine whether zzso zzso zzso assessed in the different zzso layers by zzso zzso may help to discriminate between various degrees of zzso injury in zzso zzso 

Dogs underwent 90 minutes of coronary zzso and 24 hours of zzso Using a zzso T zzso MR zzso zzso zzso images were acquired before and 24 hours after surgery on the short axis plan of the left zzso and analyzed to evaluate the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the different zzso Based on the residual blood flow, animals were assigned to group I zzso flow zzso zzso or group II zzso flow zzso zzso 

Dogs in group I developed larger zzso zzso zzso zzso of the area at risk, zzso zzso 5) compared with those in group II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, P zzso zzso In the jeopardized zone, the % zzso of the zzso decreased more significantly in group I zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso compared with group II zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a fast and zzso means of measuring % zzso The MR measurement of this zzso in the zzso layer appears quite accurate in describing the degree of damage in zzso zzso
