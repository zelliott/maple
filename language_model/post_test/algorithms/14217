An zzso that alerts zzso zzso zzso patients, in case of abnormal lead zzso zzso zzso mark, zzso may help to recognize lead zzso We aimed to determine the utility of Patient zzso for zzso zzso detection in a prospective zzso 

Three hundred and sixty zzso patients were followed for zzso zzso Patient zzso was active for pacing zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso conductor zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ten alert events and a total of 29 severe system complications zzso Patient zzso detected three of 10 zzso lead failures, with a positive zzso value zzso of zzso for any severe system zzso zzso analysis identified 23 patients with a sensing integrity counter zzso zzso and revealed an additional four prior zzso lead zzso zzso detected zzso lead failure with zzso sensitivity and a zzso of zzso Eight of nine patients with a zzso zzso had an integrated bipolar zzso Patient zzso combined with zzso detected all zzso lead failures and zzso of all severe lead zzso 

Patient zzso based on daily zzso zzso detected one-third of all zzso lead zzso Combined use with continuous lead integrity monitoring zzso increased sensitivity to zzso Integrated bipolar leads may yield a zzso zzso zzso zzso and automated zzso threshold measurement may improve Patient zzso sensitivity for severe lead zzso
