We measure the instantaneous electronic zzso zzso index of zzso zzso and zzso at room temperature for a 90 zzso and 800 zzso laser zzso zzso are zzso by zzso molecular alignment through a polarization zzso At low intensity, zzso zzso zzso are zzso At higher zzso a strong negative contribution with a higher zzso appears, which leads to an overall negative zzso Kerr zzso index in air above 26 zzso
