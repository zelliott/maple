A zzso standard zzso value zzso of zzso has been commonly adopted for zzso PET to evaluate pulmonary zzso but false results can zzso Studies have shown the usefulness of delayed PET for improving zzso This study was designed to examine the efficiency of delayed PET of pulmonary zzso with an initial mean zzso less than zzso 

zzso zzso PET studies were conducted with imaging 1 and 2 hours after zzso injection, and pulmonary zzso with an initial mean zzso less than zzso were zzso zzso with zzso reports were included in the zzso The differences in mean zzso zzso zzso and retention index between benign and zzso pulmonary zzso were zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminating zzso of the retention zzso 

A total of 31 zzso (15 benign, 16 zzso were included in the zzso Among the benign zzso 12 were zzso zzso including 10 tuberculosis zzso and two zzso zzso and three were focal zzso A retention index greater than zzso was observed in zzso of the benign zzso zzso of the benign zzso had a retention index greater than zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso had a retention index greater than zzso and zzso had a retention index greater than zzso We found no significant differences in mean zzso zzso zzso and retention index between benign and zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve did not differ from zzso 

Delayed zzso PET is not useful for zzso benign and zzso pulmonary zzso with an initial mean zzso less than zzso in geographic regions with epidemic zzso disease such as tuberculosis or in patients at high risk of zzso zzso
