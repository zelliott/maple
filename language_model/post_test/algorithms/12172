To develop a method of identifying patients at high risk of zzso to hospital in the next 12 months for practical use by primary care zzso and general practices in the zzso in zzso 

Data from hospital episode statistics showing all admissions in zzso zzso in England over five years, zzso to zzso data from the 2001 census for zzso zzso All residents in England admitted to hospital in the previous four years with a subset of zzso conditions for which improved management may help to prevent future zzso 

zzso statistical analysis of routinely collected data to develop an zzso to predict patients at highest risk of zzso in the next 12 zzso The zzso was developed by using a zzso sample of hospital episode statistics data for all of England for the period zzso The zzso for 21 most powerful (and statistically zzso variables were then applied against a second zzso test sample to validate the findings of the zzso from the first zzso 

The key factors predicting subsequent admission included age, sex, ethnicity, number of previous admissions, and clinical zzso The zzso produces a risk score (from 0 to zzso for each patient admitted with a reference zzso At a risk score threshold of 50, the zzso identified zzso of patients admitted with a reference condition who would have an admission in the next 12 zzso zzso of patients were zzso incorrectly (they would not have a subsequent zzso At risk score threshold levels of 70 and 80, the rate of incorrectly zzso patients dropped to zzso and zzso but the zzso found a lower percentage of patients who would be zzso The zzso is made freely available to primary care zzso via a zzso 

A method of predicting individual patients at highest risk of zzso to hospital in the next 12 months has been developed, which has a reasonable level of sensitivity and zzso Using various assumptions a zzso zzso has been zzso to demonstrate to primary care zzso and practices the potential costs and impact of an intervention using the zzso to reduce hospital zzso
