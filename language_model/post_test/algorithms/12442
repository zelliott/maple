A novel measure of spectral distance is zzso which is inspired by the prediction residual zzso presented by zzso in 1975, but derived from frequency domain data and extended to include zzso moving average zzso zzso This new zzso is applied to electroencephalogram zzso data from newborn zzso exposed to zzso for the purpose of early detection of zzso The performance is evaluated using parameters relevant for potential clinical use, and is found to outperform the zzso distance, which has proved to be useful for this zzso Additionally, we compare the performance with various zzso previously used for the detection of zzso from zzso Our results based on zzso from newborn zzso show that some detector statistics divert significantly from a reference period less than 2 zzso after the start of general zzso Among these successful zzso the proposed spectral distance is the only zzso zzso It therefore appears that spectral changes due to zzso are best described by use of an zzso zzso spectral estimate, but the drawback of the presented method is high zzso zzso
