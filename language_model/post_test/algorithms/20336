We revisit the zzso zzso (in sample zzso behavior of the zzso or weight estimate returned by any member of a large family of neural network training zzso By properly accounting for the characteristic property of neural networks that their empirical and zzso errors possess multiple zzso we rigorously establish conditions under which the zzso estimate zzso strongly into the set of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso estimate to a particular value cannot be guaranteed under our zzso We then evaluate the zzso distribution of the distance between the zzso estimate and its nearest neighbor among the set of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on this question have appeared numerous times and generally assert zzso zzso the conclusion expected from familiar statistical arguments concerned with maximum likelihood zzso These conclusions are usually reached on the basis of somewhat informal calculations, although we shall see that the situation is somewhat zzso The preceding results then provide a derivation of learning zzso for zzso and empirical errors that leads to bounds on rates of zzso
