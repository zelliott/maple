We show how bright, zzso fully coherent hard X-ray beams can be generated through zzso zzso of zzso laser zzso By driving the zzso harmonic generation process using zzso zzso light, we show that, in theory, fully zzso frequency zzso can extend into the hard X-ray region of the zzso We verify our zzso predictions zzso by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum around 330 zzso using zzso driving laser zzso at zzso zzso in an extended, zzso zzso zzso gas zzso We also show through calculations that zzso of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making zzso fully zzso zzso X-ray sources zzso The rapidly decreasing microscopic zzso yield, predicted for zzso driven by zzso zzso is compensated zzso by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing zzso of the generated zzso
