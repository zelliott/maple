zzso zzso zzso may cause inappropriate shocks in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso options to prevent zzso are usually implemented only after zzso has occurred, and they may compromise sensing of zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate an zzso zzso that zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso or zzso to prevent inappropriate detection of zzso when zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso based on both the differential frequency content of R vs T waves and their alternating zzso Algorithm parameters were developed from a database of stored zzso The zzso was validated on a hardware system consisting of actual zzso zzso by using an independent database of stored zzso including inappropriate zzso of both zzso caused by spontaneous zzso and induced true zzso to assess delays in zzso 

We tested 83 inappropriate zzso of zzso due to zzso from 22 zzso All 22 patients had at least 1 successful rejection of zzso and rejection was effective in 80 of the 83 zzso After adjustment for multiple episodes per patient, specificity was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso In 166 episodes of true zzso in 92 patients, the sensitivity for zzso detection was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso at a nominal sensitivity of zzso zzso the new zzso zzso did not delay the detection of zzso 

A novel zzso rejection zzso is designed to operate in real zzso The zzso reduced inappropriate zzso of zzso in spontaneous zzso episodes by zzso while maintaining zzso sensitivity for detecting true zzso
