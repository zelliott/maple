zzso interaction zzso extraction is an important and widely researched task in the biomedical natural language processing zzso zzso zzso machine learning methods have been used widely to extract zzso automatically, and several kernels focusing on different parts of sentence structure have been published for the zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a method to combine kernels based on several zzso zzso in order to retrieve the zzso possible range of important information from a given zzso We evaluate the method using a support zzso machine zzso and we achieve better results than other state-of-the-art zzso systems on four out of five zzso Further, we analyze the zzso of the five zzso from the viewpoint of zzso zzso and we see that some of them have small zzso but they can still be combined with a little zzso
