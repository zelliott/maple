The received signal in zzso zzso inspection can be modeled as a zzso between an impulse response and the reflection zzso which is the impulse characteristic of the inspected zzso zzso aims at approximately zzso this process to improve the time resolution so that the overlap between echoes from closely spaced zzso becomes zzso This paper presents a modified minimum zzso blind zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Enhancement of the resolution is achieved by using the presented zzso In addition, the presented approach will, in many cases, lead to a faster zzso A zzso function is the key point to the efficiency of the modified blind zzso algorithm, which is used to increase the zzso of the iteration output and to decrease the influence of the added noise by replacing each iteration output by output of the zzso zzso zzso showed the efficiency of the modification as compared with minimum zzso zzso when zzso synthetic zzso zzso Experimental results using real zzso data evaluated further that the exact solution consistently yields good zzso The thickness of a thin steel sample can be calculated by the modified blind zzso filter with a reasonable zzso
