Active zzso systems can provide good target detection potential but are limited in shallow water environments by the high level of zzso produced by the interaction between the acoustic signal and the ocean zzso The nature of the zzso is highly variable and depends critically on the ocean and seabed properties, which are typically poorly zzso This has motivated interest in techniques that are zzso to the zzso In passive zzso a zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso has been introduced to describe the slope of zzso observed in zzso In this work, an zzso for active zzso is zzso This active zzso is shown to be present in the zzso structure observed in zzso data from the zzso zzso and the structure agrees with results produced from normal mode zzso The application of this feature in active tracking zzso is zzso
