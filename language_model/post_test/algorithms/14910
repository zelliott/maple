The effectiveness of various stimulus identification zzso procedures for zzso the information carried by the responses of a population of zzso to a set of repeatedly presented stimuli is studied zzso in the limit of short time zzso It is shown that in this limit, the entire information content of the responses can sometimes be zzso and when this is not the case, the lost information is zzso In particular, the mutual information extracted by taking into account only the most likely stimulus in each trial turns out to be, if not equal, much closer to the true value than that calculated from all the probabilities that each of the possible stimuli in the set was the actual zzso The relation between the mutual information extracted by decoding and the percentage of correct stimulus zzso is also derived zzso in the same limit, showing that the metric content index can be estimated reliably from a few cells recorded from brief zzso Computer simulations as well as the activity of real zzso recorded in the zzso zzso serve to confirm these results and illustrate the utility and limitations of the zzso
