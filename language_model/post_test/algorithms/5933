An zzso element approach is presented for the modeling of zzso zzso embedded in a zzso zzso The inside of each domain may consist of an arbitrary number of aquifers separated by leaky zzso The zzso element solution is obtained through a combination of existing zzso and zzso zzso elements and allows for the zzso zzso of head and leakage at any point in the zzso Along the boundary of an embedded zzso domain, the normal flux is continuous zzso continuity of head across the boundary is met exactly at zzso points and zzso but very accurately, in zzso The zzso element solution compares well with an existing exact zzso A hypothetical example with a river zzso two embedded zzso illustrates the practical application of the proposed zzso
