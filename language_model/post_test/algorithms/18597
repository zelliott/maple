Spike triggered averaging zzso is a technique to extract an estimate of a recurring motor unit potential from a complex zzso zzso zzso In conventional zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso of single intramuscular motor units are isolated and used to trigger an zzso to obtain an individual zzso motor unit potential zzso from an zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso signal decomposition zzso determine zzso of a number of different motor units (4 to 10) that can be used to trigger an zzso to obtain their corresponding zzso We tested the accuracy of zzso and averaging zzso using zzso compared to zzso for the same zzso zzso 

We compared the intramuscular zzso used for triggering and the zzso averaged zzso that were common in both zzso 

We found no statistically significant differences in the metrics used to describe the triggering zzso and zzso 

We conclude that zzso is an accurate and efficient method to obtain a large number of intramuscular motor unit zzso and their corresponding zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
