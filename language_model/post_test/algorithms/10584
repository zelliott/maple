We demonstrate that two mechanisms used by biological zzso channels to select particles by size are driven by zzso With zzso particles in an infinite cylinder, we show that a channel that attracts particles is zzso selective and that a channel that zzso water from the wall is zzso zzso Comparing against the extensive zzso theory calculations of our model, we find that the main physics can be understood with surprisingly simple bulk models that neglect the zzso geometry of the channel zzso
