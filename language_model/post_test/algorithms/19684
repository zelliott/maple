This paper investigates the method of forecasting stock price difference on artificially generated price series data using zzso systems and neural zzso As trading profits is more important to an investor than statistical performance, this paper proposes a novel rough zzso zzso stock trading decision model called stock trading using rough zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the price difference forecast method with a forecast bottleneck free trading decision zzso The proposed stock trading with forecast model uses the zzso zzso based fuzzy neural network using the compositional rule of zzso zzso with fuzzy rules identified using the zzso zzso as the underlying predictor model and simple moving average trading rules in the stock trading decision zzso Experimental results using the proposed stock trading with zzso forecast model on real world stock market data are zzso Trading profits in terms of portfolio end values obtained are zzso against stock trading with dynamic evolving zzso zzso system zzso forecast model, the stock trading without forecast model and the stock trading with ideal forecast zzso Experimental results showed that the proposed model identified rules with greater zzso and yielded significantly higher profits than the stock trading with zzso forecast model and the stock trading without forecast zzso
