To zzso evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several zzso findings that may be seen with zzso pancreatic zzso in the diagnosis of zzso at magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

This study was institutional review board approved and zzso zzso From January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007, electronic zzso and pathology databases were searched to identify patients with pancreatic zzso zzso or zzso who underwent pancreatic MR zzso Twenty-two patients with zzso pancreatic zzso that were confirmed at surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso fluid analysis zzso zzso 10) were zzso Of 20 patients with pancreatic zzso seven had zzso that were identified at zzso zzso and 13 had a clinical history of zzso with initial zzso zzso zzso revealing no pancreatic zzso and subsequent follow-up MR imaging depicting zzso zzso Two abdominal zzso independently and randomly evaluated each case for presence or absence of zzso and internal dependent debris and for external zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso images and three-dimensional zzso zzso images obtained before and after intravenous contrast agent zzso zzso zzso for correlated data was used to assess the usefulness of internal debris, external zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso from zzso 

The readers' assessments of the presence or absence of zzso debris were zzso for 40 zzso of the 42 patients, with a zzso zzso of zzso which indicated nearly perfect zzso Thirteen zzso of 14 zzso found to have debris by either or both readers were zzso and only one zzso of the 22 zzso zzso had zzso Both readers were more likely to identify zzso within zzso zzso than within zzso however, the difference was not significant for either zzso The readers were more likely to observe zzso zzso in zzso zzso than in zzso with the difference between these zzso types, in terms of prevalence of zzso zzso exhibiting a trend zzso not zzso significance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of internal dependent debris appears to be a highly specific MR finding for the diagnosis of pancreatic zzso
