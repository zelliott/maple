zzso zzso zzso and bottom-up zzso processing are intimately interconnected in visual zzso An internal cognitive model of the external world must necessarily control not only our recognition but also the zzso sequence of eye zzso of attention zzso A zzso process based on principal component analysis and zzso experimental data are used in this paper to define spatial visual zzso from the zzso of the zzso sequence image zzso Eight different classes of images are used as both training and testing zzso We first demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be zzso in terms of these bottom-up zzso zzso zzso We can finally define a zzso processing zzso and measure its ability to predict human zzso as evidenced by the zzso similarity measure zzso Some computer vision applications will also be zzso
