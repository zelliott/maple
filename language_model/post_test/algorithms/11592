In this article, a zzso scale for zzso acids is derived using only two zzso zzso a set of zzso zzso segments from membrane protein crystal structures and zzso the request that each component of the set has a free energy lower than that of a typical soluble protein sequence of the same zzso Although the most widely used zzso scales satisfy this request, we use an zzso procedure that allows for extraction of an optimal scale, which zzso equally well with those zzso We show that, if the choice of the sequence database is accurate, significant zzso zzso which are robust with respect to changes in the learning set, can be easily zzso The obtained scales can be used for zzso zzso zzso The zzso power of one of these scales is tested on membrane zzso soluble zzso and signal peptides databases, finding that its performances is comparable with those of the zzso zzso
