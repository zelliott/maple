zzso genes and pathways indicative of disease is a central problem in zzso zzso This problem is especially challenging when parsing zzso zzso zzso A number of tools, such as zzso based zzso and its extensions elastic net and fused zzso have been introduced to deal with this zzso However, these approaches tend to ignore the vast amount of a zzso biological network information curated in the zzso 

We propose the use of graph zzso zzso zzso zzso to integrate biological networks into disease zzso and zzso association zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the performance of the proposed zzso is superior to elastic net and lasso zzso zzso of this zzso is also validated by its ability to reliably differentiate breast cancer zzso using a large breast cancer zzso recently generated by the Cancer Genome zzso zzso zzso Many of the zzso interaction zzso identified by our approach are further supported by evidence published in the zzso zzso code of the proposed zzso is freely available at zzso 

zzso zzso with graph zzso zzso is an effective zzso for identifying key pathways and zzso associated with disease zzso With the rapid expansion of our knowledge of biological regulatory networks, this approach will become more accurate and increasingly useful for mining zzso zzso and other types of zzso wide association zzso
