Traveling waves of zzso zzso have been observed in many cortical regions, including the motor and sensory zzso Such waves are often modulated in a zzso fashion although their precise functional role remains a matter of zzso Here we conjecture that the zzso can zzso the direction and wavelength of traveling waves to zzso zzso We present a novel neural mechanism by which such information may be zzso by the spatial arrangement of receptors within the zzso zzso zzso In particular, we show how the density zzso of zzso and zzso receptors can combine to act as a spatial filter of wave zzso The proposed zzso mechanism ensures that the zzso selectively responds to specific wave patterns, thus zzso a neural basis of pattern zzso We validate this proposal in the descending motor system, where we model the large zzso fields of the zzso tract zzso - the principle zzso of the motor zzso - decoding motor commands zzso in the direction of traveling wave patterns in motor zzso We use an existing model of field zzso in motor zzso to investigate how the zzso of the zzso cell zzso field acts to tune the cells responses to specific zzso wave patterns, even when those patterns are highly zzso The model replicates key findings of the descending motor system during simple motor tasks, including variable zzso intervals and weak zzso zzso By additionally showing how the nature of the wave patterns can be controlled by modulating the zzso of local zzso connections, we hence propose a novel integrated zzso model of zzso and decoding motor zzso
