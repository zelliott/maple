Our objective was to develop a precise method for zzso of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the human zzso This objective required that an appropriate spectral model be created and that the zzso was performed using a zzso fitting zzso The precision of the zzso was assessed using zzso standard zzso and compared using two different spectral models: one containing a pair of zzso representing zzso the other excluding this zzso The data was zzso using a zzso zzso zzso incorporating prior knowledge with a zzso singular value decomposition zzso performed initially to provide zzso estimates for the zzso zzso zzso was performed on two different in zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso the first examined 11 normal controls, the second examined a single individual six zzso zzso from a region in the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso standard zzso were significantly lower for some zzso with zzso in the model: in the repeat study mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the 11 controls mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
