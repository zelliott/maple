The identification of zzso interaction sites is essential for the zzso design and prediction of zzso zzso The interaction sites of zzso units were predicted using support zzso machines zzso and the profiles of zzso neighboring zzso plus additional zzso When only sequence information was used, prediction performance was highest using the feature zzso zzso neighboring profiles and predicted interaction site ratios, which were calculated by zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso When structural information was also used, prediction performance was highest using the feature zzso zzso neighboring zzso profiles, accessible surface areas, and the zzso protein interaction sites ratios predicted by zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso In the latter case, the precision at recall zzso 50% was zzso for a zzso mixed test set and zzso higher than for random zzso zzso zzso of the zzso wrongly predicted as interaction sites were the closest zzso neighboring on the interaction site zzso The predicted zzso covered zzso of the actual zzso zzso of zzso with over 20 zzso This prediction performance appeared to be slightly higher than a previously reported zzso Comparing the prediction accuracy of each zzso it seems to be easier to predict interaction sites for stable zzso
