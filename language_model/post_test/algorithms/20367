An zzso is described which zzso the zzso mask generated by the zzso technique to calculate a zzso molecular zzso In the case where zzso symmetry zzso is present in the crystal and zzso angles are known from a zzso function, the zzso zzso envelopes can be used to search for the translation component of the zzso element by a three-dimensional search in real zzso In the absence of zzso angles, the zzso envelope may be used to derive the zzso operators by zzso zzso Thus, an automatic procedure for averaging directly from the zzso stage can be zzso The procedure was instrumental in the structure solution of zzso zzso D, which is presented as an zzso
