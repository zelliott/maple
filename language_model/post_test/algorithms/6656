zzso zzso zzso exploits the energy dependence of atomic scattering factors to locate resonant atoms within the electron density distribution of thin zzso We apply the technique to a zzso of zzso acid at the zzso zzso The data collection protocol employed cycles through several energies in the vicinity of the zzso K zzso edge and verifies that the energy zzso observed are indeed resonant zzso The analysis specifies the location of the zzso atom with zzso precision and must consider both the real and imaginary parts of the changes in the scattering factor to be consistent with the known structure and zzso of this test zzso
