We consider point estimates and confidence intervals for the difference in location or scale between two populations when the observations are subject to zzso We suggest procedures analogous to those for the zzso zzso A rigorous justification is presented to support the proposed confidence zzso zzso Finally, some simulations verify the properties of the zzso and confidence zzso We illustrate the procedure using data on tumor zzso
