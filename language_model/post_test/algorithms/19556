zzso results are reported of a zzso project to verify electron dose zzso calculated by treatment planning systems zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which use different electron beam dose distribution zzso Treatment of gross zzso volumes representing lung and zzso cancer was simulated in an zzso zzso phantom with zzso detectors zzso zzso placed at selected measurement points inside its zzso The observed zzso between relative values of dose calculated and measured by zzso at each of the measurement points and those calculated by the different zzso at the same points is zzso
