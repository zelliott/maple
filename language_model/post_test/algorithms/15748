zzso zzso characterize many pathological voices, but zzso aspects of zzso are poorly zzso To investigate this relationship, 2 zzso models were implemented in a custom voice zzso The first modulated fundamental frequency zzso with a sine zzso The second provided irregular zzso Control parameters in both models were the frequency and zzso of the zzso modulating zzso zzso zzso samples of zzso produced by speakers with vocal pathology, were modeled in the zzso zzso copies of each vowel were created by using zzso parameters derived from different features of zzso versus time plots of the natural stimuli or by using parameters chosen to match the original stimuli zzso Listeners compared synthetic and original stimuli in 3 zzso zzso wave and irregular zzso models both provided excellent matches to zzso of the zzso The zzso importance of the shape of the modulating zzso depended on the severity of the zzso with the choice of zzso model increasing in importance as the zzso increased in zzso The average frequency zzso from the mean zzso proved a good predictor of the perceived zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso rats were easiest to hear when the zzso was zzso and of small zzso zzso in zzso rate were difficult to judge for zzso of large zzso or in the context of irregularities in the pattern of frequency zzso These results suggest that difference zzso are larger for zzso rates and zzso when the zzso pattern is zzso Further, zzso rate, zzso and zzso zzso so that the zzso importance of any one dimension depends on values of the zzso
