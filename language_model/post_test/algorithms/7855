The planning and control of motor actions requires knowledge of the dynamics of the controlled limb to generate the appropriate muscular commands and achieve the desired zzso Such planning and control imply that the zzso must be able to deal with forces and constraints acting on the zzso such as the omnipresent force of zzso The present study investigates the effect of zzso induced by zzso flights on the trajectory of vertical pointing movements to test the hypothesis that motor commands are zzso with respect to the effect of gravity on the zzso zzso performed vertical pointing movements in normal gravity and zzso We use a model based on optimal control to identify the role played by gravity in the optimal arm trajectory with minimal motor zzso First, the simulations in normal gravity reproduce the asymmetry in the zzso profiles (the zzso reaches its maximum before half of the movement zzso which typically characterizes the vertical pointing movements performed on zzso whereas the horizontal movements present symmetrical zzso zzso Second, according to the simulations, the optimal trajectory in zzso should present an increase in the peak acceleration and peak zzso despite the increase in the arm zzso In agreement with these predictions, the subjects performed faster movements in zzso with significant increases in the peak acceleration and peak zzso which were accompanied by a significant decrease in the movement zzso This suggests that movement zzso change in response to an increase in gravity, which is consistent with the hypothesis that motor commands are zzso and the action of gravity on the limb is taken into zzso The results provide evidence for an internal representation of gravity in the central planning process and further suggest that an adaptation to altered dynamics can be understood as a zzso zzso
