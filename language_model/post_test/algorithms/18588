Under the Animal zzso Drug Use zzso Act of 1994, veterinarians are legally allowed to use drugs in zzso animals in an zzso zzso This could potentially lead to zzso zzso in food of animal zzso It is therefore essential that an appropriately extended withdrawal zzso be zzso zzso these extended withdrawal intervals should be calculated on the basis of the tissue zzso of the drug in the target zzso However, these data are not readily available for all drugs of zzso use in zzso zzso For this reason, the use of a zzso zzso has been proposed as a simple alternative method to estimate the effective tissue zzso of a zzso zzso withdrawal zzso estimated using various zzso zzso were compared with the withdrawal intervals calculated using actual tissue zzso For the group of drugs investigated, a zzso zzso of 5 resulted in estimates of extended withdrawal intervals that were potentially inadequate to prevent zzso tissue zzso for drugs that had relatively long tissue zzso high zzso or zzso This is possibly because fewer zzso are required for these drugs to reach the target tissue zzso following administration at label zzso Use of a smaller zzso zzso (in this case 3) is therefore suggested to ensure that extended withdrawal intervals are adequate to prevent zzso tissue zzso
