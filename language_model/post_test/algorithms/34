zzso profiling of foods is defined as the science of ranking or zzso foods based on their zzso zzso zzso profiles can be calculated based on 100 g or 100 zzso of food or on standard serving zzso The objective of this study was to compare the performance of zzso profiles based on 100 zzso 100 zzso and zzso serving sizes, and to identify the optimal base of zzso 

zzso profiles tested were composed of positive zzso based on nutrients to encourage and negative zzso based on nutrients to zzso Alternative profiles, zzso using different bases of zzso were used to rank order zzso commonly consumed foods from a food frequency zzso Profile performance was tested with respect to the zzso energy zzso 

Serving sizes, defined by the US Food and Drug Administration as reference amounts zzso consumed zzso were zzso linked to energy density of zzso Positive zzso based on 100 zzso were equivalent to those calculated using zzso zzso zzso zzso performed better when based on 100 g as opposed to 100 zzso 

Models based on serving sizes and on 100 zzso were preferable for positive zzso and models based on 100 g of food were preferable for negative zzso zzso profiles may represent an attractive option for the US zzso
