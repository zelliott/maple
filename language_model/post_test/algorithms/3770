In the period from 1949 to 1956, liquid radioactive waste was routinely and accidentally discharged by the zzso zzso Association, Southern zzso Russia, into the zzso zzso Based on a novel approach, the contamination of the zzso river water, the bottom sediments and the adjacent flood plains was zzso and internal and external doses were estimated for two villages located downstream of the site of liquid radioactive waste zzso Altogether, 11 zzso that occurred in the liquid radioactive waste were included in the zzso The results suggest significantly higher doses than previously zzso with the major contribution in the year zzso zzso with zzso of less than 1 year, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent the major sources and, in contrast, zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso that have so far been assumed to be most important, did not dominate the zzso For adults from the village zzso located 7 zzso downstream of the site of liquid radioactive waste zzso the committed effective doses due to intake of zzso were calculated to be about zzso zzso while the external doses were between about zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, for adults from zzso located 75 zzso zzso the committed effective doses due to intake of zzso were calculated to be about zzso zzso while the external doses were between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The values for the skin doses to the zzso and zzso populations were about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the current dose estimates for the residents of the zzso river need, therefore, zzso
