A new scheme is proposed for very fast acquisition of three-dimensional zzso zzso based on minimal zzso instead of the customary zzso exploration of all of evolution zzso The method relies on prior experiments to determine accurate values for the evolving zzso and zzso from the two-dimensional zzso zzso recorded by setting zzso or zzso With this prior knowledge, the entire three-dimensional spectrum can be reconstructed by an additional measurement of the response at a single location zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso and zzso zzso are fixed values of the evolution zzso A key feature is the ability to resolve problems of overlap in the acquisition zzso zzso to a small zzso zzso the three-dimensional zzso spectrum is obtained 35 times faster than systematic Cartesian sampling of the evolution zzso The extension to zzso zzso is zzso
