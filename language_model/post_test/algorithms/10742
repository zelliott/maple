zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso which is highly distributed to the lung and other zzso In the present study, to characterize the distribution mechanism of zzso to the zzso the zzso of zzso by isolated rat lung cells was examined in zzso zzso was rapidly taken up by the cells, and the zzso reached a zzso within 5 zzso The zzso concentration ratio at equilibrium was zzso zzso zzso which was much higher than the cellular zzso zzso zzso consisted of a zzso component zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso component zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso and by the replacement of sodium with zzso in the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is at least partially zzso by an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to be reduced in the presence of other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso but was only minimally affected by the zzso of several zzso mechanisms already identified in the liver and kidney such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggested that zzso is taken up by the lung partially via zzso transport zzso distinct from the identified zzso and such active transport systems may at least partially account for the efficient distribution of zzso to the zzso
