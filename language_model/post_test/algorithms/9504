zzso assignment of zzso zzso of zzso proteins is made difficult by severe overlap due to the lack of secondary zzso Fortunately, this drawback is partially zzso by the narrow zzso due to the internal zzso zzso sampling schemes can be used to achieve better resolution in less experimental zzso zzso schemes (such as zzso zzso suffer however from the presence of systematic zzso Random acquisition patterns can alleviate this problem by zzso the zzso We show in this communication that quantitative zzso zzso can be zzso provided that the data points are properly weighted before zzso These weights can be evaluated using the concept of zzso cells associated with the data zzso The introduced artifacts do not affect the direct surrounding of the zzso and thus do not alter the zzso and frequency of the zzso This procedure is illustrated on zzso viral zzso which lacks any persistent secondary structure and thus exhibits major signal zzso
