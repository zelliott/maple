The accurate zzso of the teeth from the digitized representation of a dental study model is an important component in computer-based zzso for zzso feature detection and measurement and in the simulation of zzso procedures such as tooth zzso This paper presents an automated method for tooth zzso from the three-dimensional zzso digitized image captured by a laser zzso We avoid the complexity of directly processing 3-D mesh data by proposing the innovative idea of detecting features on two range images zzso from the 3-D zzso The dental arch is first obtained from the zzso range zzso Using the arch as the reference, a panoramic range image of the dental model can be zzso The zzso between the teeth are detected separately in the two range images, and results from both views are combined for a determination of zzso locations and zzso Finally, the teeth are separated from the gums by zzso the gum zzso The zzso was tested on 34 dental models representing a variety of zzso and was found to be robust and zzso
