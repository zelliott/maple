The cellular zzso model zzso is a zzso zzso methodology for simulation of biological zzso and zzso Both tissue physiology and zzso depend on diffusion of chemical zzso in the zzso fluid or zzso zzso Standard diffusion zzso applied to the cellular zzso model use finite difference methods on the underlying zzso zzso However, these methods produce a zzso field tied to the underlying zzso which is inaccurate in many biological situations in which cell or zzso movement causes zzso rapid compared to zzso zzso difference schemes suffer zzso zzso solving the resulting zzso zzso To circumvent these problems we simulate zzso diffusion within the framework of the zzso using zzso zzso zzso We define a set of generalized fluid particles which zzso zzso and diffusion from the zzso zzso occurs between neighboring fluid particles by local averaging rules which approximate the zzso Directed spin flips in the zzso handle the zzso movement of the fluid zzso A constraint on relative zzso in the fluid explicitly accounts for fluid zzso We use the zzso to solve various diffusion examples including multiple instantaneous sources, continuous sources, moving sources, and different boundary zzso and conditions to validate our approximation against zzso and established zzso zzso We also verify the zzso results for zzso flow and zzso zzso
