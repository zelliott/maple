zzso may be classified according to their positions of occurrence in the zzso of the sampled DNA sequences from a zzso A zzso is said to be of size i if it has i descendants in the zzso Such zzso for zzso may yield detailed insights into the evolutionary history and properties of the zzso zzso methods based on such zzso have been developed and shown to be efficient and zzso However, the utility of these statistical methods critically depends on reliable and robust recovery of zzso of different zzso We investigated the zzso changes of zzso of different sizes due to zzso reconstruction using the zzso zzso method with zzso mean zzso and the performance of zzso method in zzso zzso of different sizes on a given zzso zzso reconstruction by zzso was found to change the distribution of zzso of different sizes on constructed zzso Multiple hits at some zzso sites made it difficult to zzso zzso of different sizes with the zzso method, even when the true zzso was zzso These results suggest that while the newly developed statistical methods employing information on zzso of different sites are powerful, they also impose significant new challenges for developing methods to accurately recover zzso of different sizes from population DNA sequence zzso
