The potential use of systems that seek to communicate a warning of impending collision directly to the driver is zzso zzso advances in zzso systems include reliable, low-cost zzso sensors with low noise levels, and the development of accurate detection zzso for particular crash types, zzso zzso zzso However, fundamental practical constraints make perfect sensor detection difficult to zzso zzso detection zzso the false alarm rate and experience with other technologies confirms driver zzso to false zzso Although sensitive alarm systems with high detection rates and low false alarm rates have been developed, the zzso probability of a collision given an alarm can be quite low because of the low base rate of collision zzso As a result, only a small proportion of alarms will represent true collision zzso These and other factors can conspire to reduce alarm effectiveness in zzso zzso The problem is illustrated zzso and potential solutions are zzso
