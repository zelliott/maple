Recent theoretical advances in the field of zzso zzso referred to as compressed sensing zzso considerable promise for practical applications in zzso but the fundamental condition of zzso required in the zzso framework is usually not fulfilled in MR zzso However, in dynamic imaging, data zzso can readily be introduced by applying the zzso transformation along the zzso dimension assuming that only parts of the zzso zzso change at a high zzso rate while other parts remain stationary or change zzso The second condition for zzso random zzso can easily be realized by randomly skipping zzso lines in each dynamic zzso In this work, the feasibility of the zzso framework for accelerated dynamic zzso is zzso zzso zzso are used to compare the reconstruction results for different reduction factors, noise, and zzso zzso In zzso cardiac zzso data and zzso zzso data of the carotid artery are used to test the reconstruction performance relative to zzso zzso linear acquisition zzso technique zzso zzso zzso Given sufficient data zzso and base zzso ratio zzso zzso is demonstrated to result in improved zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso reconstructions for the example data sets used in this zzso
