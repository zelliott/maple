In the context of the increasing worldwide occurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated a possible zzso mechanism relating to the zzso zzso outer membrane zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether this zzso may be a diffusion zzso for zzso in zzso zzso 

By zzso and comparing the sequences of zzso with protein zzso we identified two major groups of sequences that we named zzso and zzso We zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso by affinity zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso from both zzso Their functional properties were investigated and compared by zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

This functional study showed that zzso and zzso exhibit identical single-channel zzso zzso 20 zzso in 1 M zzso and similar poor zzso zzso Both channels were not specific towards zzso and zzso acid and poorly specific towards zzso but they presented a marked specificity towards zzso From the calculated binding constants, we highlight that the zzso channel was twice as specific as the zzso channel for this zzso Moreover, the zzso channel could facilitate zzso diffusion when the zzso channel would zzso 

We provide here the first evidence that zzso channels possess an zzso (but not zzso binding site, and that their zzso depend on their primary zzso Any decrease in zzso expression would thus reduce the zzso of zzso zzso to this zzso
