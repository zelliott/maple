The objective of this paper was to investigate the impact of zzso of porous media on zzso characteristics of residual zzso phase liquids zzso zzso X-ray zzso was used to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional images of zzso wet sand systems with mean grain size of 250 zzso zzso characteristics of zzso zzso such as volume, zzso zzso areas, and zzso index were zzso using three-dimensional image processing zzso Four systems comprised of 100, 50, 25, and zzso zzso mass zzso containing the residual zzso were zzso and zzso zzso indicate that spatial variation in zzso of porous media surfaces has a significant impact on zzso characteristics of residual zzso zzso in saturated porous media zzso As the porous media comprises more zzso surfaces, residual zzso zzso increase in size and length due to the zzso at large pore zzso zzso zzso areas tend to increase as the zzso surface zzso increase in the zzso zzso residual zzso zzso are less in zzso wet systems and increase as the systems become more zzso or zzso
