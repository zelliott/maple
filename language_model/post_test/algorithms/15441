zzso zzso disease zzso which affects zzso million Americans, is characterized by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produces a progressive zzso of zzso injury to the legs, zzso as a gradual degradation of zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that quantitative zzso parameters of zzso zzso change in a consistent manner during the progression of zzso provide an objective grading of muscle zzso in the zzso zzso and correlate to a clinical stage of zzso zzso were collected with a zzso needle from zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and critical limb zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chains were labeled for zzso detection and quantitative analysis of zzso zzso including area, zzso zzso equivalent diameter, major and minor zzso zzso and fiber zzso The muscle specimens were separated into training and validation data sets for development of a zzso model for zzso muscle samples on the basis of disease zzso The parameters for this model included standard zzso of zzso standard zzso of zzso of zzso and fiber zzso For the validation data set, the zzso model accurately identified control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients, with an overall zzso accuracy of zzso zzso zzso provided a zzso model that establishes a correlation between zzso progression and advancing muscle zzso This model effectively separated zzso and control patients and provided a grading of muscle zzso within clinical stages of zzso
