A neural network computer program, trained to predict secondary structure of proteins by exposing it to matching sets of primary and secondary structures from a database, was used to analyze the human zzso virus zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso from their zzso acid zzso The results are compared to those obtained by the zzso zzso Two zzso sequences corresponding to the putative zzso domain and to the zzso domain of zzso could be predicted, as well as a possible binding site between zzso and zzso On the basis of the secondary structure predictions, a three-dimensional model of zzso was zzso This model was found to represent a stable zzso by an analysis using an zzso zzso The model predicts that zzso is attached to the membrane only by the zzso zzso in zzso with the zzso of the gag protein of other zzso and also with the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso part of zzso may act as a zzso by zzso interaction with zzso
