A prediction of the probability of safe loading of the zzso neck, based on zzso theory, is zzso The following methods have been zzso zzso criterion of bone fracture was formulated, taking into consideration the complex state of zzso in the zzso zones of the zzso zzso zzso stresses around pores in the stretched zone of the bone were zzso zzso the influence of random events of the critical regimes of loading was zzso The evaluation of the probability of safe loading of bones was obtained based on the levels of the zzso zzso Young's zzso and ultimate zzso stresses which are affected by the increase in bone zzso and the distribution of the zzso Examples of analysis involving typical mechanical properties of bone in areas of vascular and zzso zzso are zzso The ranges of initial average values of effective Young's zzso and ultimate zzso strengths were taken as zzso and zzso zzso The present analysis discovers the existence of three levels of safe zzso zzso a relatively safe level of the nominal zzso stresses (smaller than zzso where the probability of safe loading is of the order of zzso for the bone zzso which is less than zzso zzso an intermediate level of safety where the nominal zzso stresses are below zzso and the probability of safe loading is zzso or higher, for the same level of bone zzso zzso a critical level of safe loading where the nominal zzso stresses are about zzso they lead to sharp drop of probabilities of safe loading to zzso if the zzso is about zzso and to probabilities of zzso if the zzso is about zzso
