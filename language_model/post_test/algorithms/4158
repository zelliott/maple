zzso disease zzso a persistent and slow progressing infection of zzso such as cows and zzso is caused by slow replicating zzso zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso infecting zzso in the zzso zzso animals initially mount a zzso zzso T cell response against zzso which is characterized by the production of zzso gamma zzso zzso Over time, zzso response diminishes in most animals and zzso response to zzso zzso becomes dominant zzso zzso The switch from zzso to zzso response occurs zzso with disease progression and shedding of the bacteria in zzso zzso controlling this zzso switch remain poorly zzso Because zzso and zzso responses are known to zzso each other, it is unclear why initially strong zzso response is lost over zzso Using a novel mathematical model of the immune response to zzso infection we show that the ability of zzso bacteria to persist outside of zzso naturally leads to switch of the cellular response to zzso zzso Several additional mechanisms may also contribute to the timing of the zzso switch including the rate of proliferation of zzso responses at the site of infection, efficiency at which immune responses zzso each other, and the rate at which zzso response becomes exhausted over zzso Our basic model reasonably well explains four different kinetic patterns of the zzso responses in zzso sheep by zzso in the initial bacterial dose and the efficiency of the zzso T cell zzso Taken together, our novel mathematical model identifies factors of bacterial and host origin that drive zzso of the immune response to zzso and provides the basis for testing the impact of vaccination or early treatment on the duration of zzso
