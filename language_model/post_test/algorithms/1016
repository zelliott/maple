To correctly evaluate realistic treatment plans in terms of absorbed dose to the clinical target volume zzso equivalent uniform dose zzso and tumor control probability zzso in the presence of execution zzso and preparation zzso geometric zzso 

The dose zzso is blurred with all execution errors to estimate the total dose distribution of all zzso To include preparation zzso the zzso is randomly displaced (and zzso zzso many times with respect to its planned position while computing the dose, zzso and zzso for the zzso using the blurred dose zzso zzso zzso of these parameters are zzso by combining the results with the probability of each particular preparation zzso We verified the method by comparing it with an zzso zzso Next, idealized and realistic prostate plans were tested with varying margins and varying execution and preparation error zzso 

zzso levels for the minimum dose, zzso with the new method, are within zzso of the zzso zzso The impact of zzso depends strongly on the zzso zzso A margin of 10 zzso between the zzso and planning target volume is adequate for zzso prostate treatments given the accuracy level in our department; zzso the zzso in a population of patients, zzso is reduced by less than zzso due to geometric zzso When reducing the margin to 6 zzso the dose must be increased from 80 to 87 zzso to maintain the same zzso Only in regions with a high-dose zzso does such a margin reduction lead to a decrease in normal tissue dose for the same zzso Based on a rough correspondence of zzso minimum dose with zzso zzso a margin recipe was zzso To give zzso of patients at least zzso zzso the planning target volume margin must be approximately zzso zzso + zzso zzso - 3 zzso where zzso and zzso are the combined standard zzso of the preparation and execution zzso This recipe zzso accurately with zzso zzso loss for prostate plans with clinically reasonable values of zzso and zzso 

The new method zzso in a few minutes the influence of geometric errors on the statistics of target dose and zzso in clinical treatment zzso Too small margins lead to a significant loss of zzso that is difficult to compensate for by dose zzso
