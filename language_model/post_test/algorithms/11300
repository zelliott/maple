zzso of the double sampling zzso X chart are traditionally based on the average run length zzso zzso However, the shape of the run length distribution changes with the process mean shifts, ranging from highly skewed when the process is zzso to almost zzso when the mean shift is zzso zzso we show that the zzso is a complicated performance measure and that the median run length zzso is a more meaningful measure to depend zzso This is because the zzso provides an intuitive and a fair representation of the central zzso especially for the rightly skewed run length zzso Since the zzso X chart can effectively reduce the sample size without reducing the statistical efficiency, this paper proposes two optimal designs of the zzso zzso X chart, for minimizing zzso the zzso average sample size zzso and zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso Comparisons with the optimal zzso zzso X and zzso X charts demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimal zzso zzso X chart, as the latter requires a smaller sample size on the average while maintaining the same detection speed as the two former zzso An example involving the added zzso zzso in a zzso manufacturing process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso zzso X chart in reducing the sample size zzso
