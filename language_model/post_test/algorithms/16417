To zzso the degree of zzso with zzso zzso analysis and investigate the change of zzso zzso properties under different zzso 

zzso subjects in persistent zzso state zzso 16 in minimally conscious state zzso and 30 normal conscious subjects zzso zzso with brain trauma or stroke were involved in the zzso zzso was recorded under three conditions: eyes closed, auditory stimuli and painful zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso complexity zzso approximate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were calculated for all the zzso 

The zzso subjects had the lowest zzso zzso followed by the zzso subjects and the control group had the zzso The zzso and zzso group had poorer response to auditory and painful stimuli than the control zzso Under painful zzso zzso zzso of subjects who recovered zzso increased more significantly than zzso zzso 

With zzso zzso analysis, the degree of suppression for zzso and zzso could be zzso The changes of brain function for unconscious subjects could be captured by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis could zzso the changes of brain function for unconscious state and might have some value in predicting prognosis of unconscious zzso
