A new strategy is presented to reduce primary X-ray damage in zzso zzso The strategy is based on separating the zzso and damaged regions as much as zzso The source of the radiation damage to zzso zzso is from two primary zzso the direct zzso of electrons by zzso and zzso scattering of the zzso The first produces zzso with their accompanying zzso electrons from relaxation of the core hole and the second creates Compton zzso The properties of these two mechanisms and calculations of primary X-ray damage zzso how to modify the spatial distribution of zzso to reduce the deleterious effects of radiation zzso By focusing the incident zzso into vertical zzso it is estimated that the survival (the time during which quality zzso data can be obtained with a given X-ray zzso of large zzso can be increased by at least a factor of zzso while for very small zzso zzso the survival can be increased by up to a factor of zzso
