The present study concerns the production and characterization of zzso zzso zzso as drug delivery systems for zzso taken as model zzso zzso 

zzso were produced by zzso and homogenization of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso distribution of the disperse phase have been characterized by zzso electron zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso X-ray zzso has been performed to determine the structural organization of the disperse zzso zzso field flow zzso zzso has been performed to investigate drug distribution in the zzso An in zzso diffusion study was conducted by Franz cell associated to stratum zzso zzso membrane on zzso zzso zzso by zzso In zzso studies based on skin zzso zzso and tape stripping were performed to better investigate the performance of zzso as zzso delivery zzso 

zzso studies showed the coexistence of zzso and zzso X-ray zzso revealed the presence of a zzso cubic phase of spatial symmetry zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that no free drug was present in the zzso zzso incorporated in zzso zzso zzso exhibited a lower flux with respect to the analogous zzso containing the free drug in the zzso phase and to the control zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso incorporated into zzso zzso can be released in a prolonged zzso zzso experiments zzso this zzso 

zzso zzso can be proposed as zzso systems able to control the zzso zzso of zzso
