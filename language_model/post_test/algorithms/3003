One approach for zzso zzso sequencing of targeted intervals in the human zzso is to amplify the regions using long-range zzso zzso followed by sequencing with next-generation sequencing zzso zzso zzso this method, we have observed that the 50 zzso located at the zzso ends account for more than 50% of the zzso bases and that the sequence coverage depth of base pairs within an zzso is highly zzso Here we propose an explanation for the overrepresentation of the zzso ends and show that the use of zzso zzso for the zzso reaction reduces their zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that using a zzso library insert size rather than the standard zzso insert size results in more uniform sequence coverage zzso The capability to increase sequence coverage uniformity greatly improves the effective zzso of zzso zzso
