A growing body of research on US Veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq zzso zzso and Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn zzso has described the zzso clinical zzso zzso traumatic brain injury zzso zzso stress disorder zzso and zzso zzso research has not explored zzso clusters in this population more broadly, particularly zzso chronic zzso 

The aim of the study was to identify zzso clusters among diagnoses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso hypertension, zzso conditions, and to examine the association of these clusters with health care zzso and adverse zzso 

This was a retrospective cohort zzso 

The cohort comprised zzso Veterans who received care in the Veterans Health Administration in fiscal years zzso zzso 

We identified zzso using validated zzso zzso zzso and zzso data, followed by which we applied zzso class analysis to identify the most statistically distinct and clinically meaningful patterns of zzso We examined the association of these clusters with process zzso using zzso zzso to correlate medication use, acute health care zzso and adverse outcomes in zzso 

In this cohort zzso we found 6 zzso zzso zzso 1: zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mental zzso Abuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso 5: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Relatively Healthy zzso zzso health care zzso patterns and adverse events were consistent with disease zzso 

These zzso clusters extend beyond the zzso and may be used as a foundation to examine zzso of care and outcomes for zzso Veterans with different patterns of zzso
