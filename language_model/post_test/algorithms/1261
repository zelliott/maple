It has been demonstrated that in two-dimensional zzso zzso a resolution model can improve image resolution while controlling zzso With the lower noise levels of three-dimensional PET volume imaging, these zzso reconstruction advantages may be extended to three dimensions to further improve the reconstructed image zzso 

We have implemented three-dimensional versions of zzso filtered zzso zzso and the maximum likelihood by expectation zzso zzso reconstruction zzso and applied them to three-dimensional PET volume zzso The results were compared to images obtained using the standard three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso zzso 

For zzso with 15 zzso and no zzso compared to zzso both using a ramp zzso the zzso resolution improved zzso and the zzso resolution improved zzso With a strong zzso the zzso and zzso resolution improvements were reduced to zzso and zzso zzso If a zzso zzso is applied to the ramp filter in the zzso direction, the zzso resolution for zzso without zzso improved zzso compared to zzso with zzso the improvement dropped to zzso The zzso resolution for zzso and zzso was unaffected by this zzso smoothing in the reconstruction zzso With the same zzso zzso the noise for zzso without zzso increased by a factor of 6 compared to zzso with zzso the noise was increased only by a factor of zzso Compared to zzso the three-dimensional zzso reconstruction produced similar resolution improvements with a much smaller increase in noise and slower zzso Resolution improvements from both zzso and zzso reconstructions are visually apparent in three-dimensional zzso brain images and result in increased zzso signals in a three-dimensional zzso functional zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that resolution improvement is possible for zzso and zzso compared to zzso with or without noise zzso
