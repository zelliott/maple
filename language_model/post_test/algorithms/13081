The dynamics of many biological processes of interest, such as the folding of a zzso are slow and complicated enough that a single molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of the entire process is difficult to obtain in any reasonable amount of zzso Moreover, one such simulation may not be sufficient to develop an understanding of the mechanism of the process, and multiple simulations may be zzso One approach to circumvent this zzso barrier is the use of zzso state zzso These models are useful because they can be constructed using data from a large number of shorter simulations instead of a single long zzso This paper presents a new zzso method for the construction of zzso models from simulation zzso A zzso model is specified by zzso where zzso is the zzso time step, P is a partition of zzso space into zzso and T is an zzso transition rate zzso for transitions between the zzso in one zzso time step, where zzso is the number of zzso in zzso The method presented here is different from previous zzso methods in several zzso zzso The method uses zzso analysis to determine the partition as well as the transition zzso zzso The method allows the construction of a zzso model for any chosen zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso zzso models for which the diagonal elements of T are all equal to or greater than zzso Such a model will be called a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Such models have important advantages for providing an understanding of the dynamics on a zzso zzso The zzso method uses simulation data to find a zzso probability distribution for zzso for any chosen zzso This distribution can be regarded as the zzso probability that the zzso observed in the zzso simulation data on the zzso zzso zzso was generated by the zzso specified by zzso An zzso zzso is used to find the most probable zzso for the chosen zzso time zzso We applied this method of zzso model construction to several toy systems zzso walks in one and two zzso as well as the dynamics of zzso zzso in zzso The resulting zzso state models were indeed successful in capturing the dynamics of our test systems on a variety of zzso zzso
