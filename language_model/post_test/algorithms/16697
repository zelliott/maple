zzso zzso are used to assess the likelihood of adverse drug reaction zzso zzso The preferred instrument for use in the intensive care unit zzso is not zzso 

The primary objective of this study was to compare the agreement between the Kramer algorithm, zzso criteria and Jones zzso for the evaluation of zzso in the zzso A secondary objective was to compare the agreement between the same zzso zzso for zzso determination when applied in a retrospective versus concurrent fashion in the zzso 

There were two zzso in this zzso Phase I was the retrospective evaluation zzso after the patient was discharged from the zzso conducted in patients admitted during July 2005 to June zzso Phase II was the concurrent phase zzso while the patient was in the zzso conducted over 6 weeks in zzso Both zzso were conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and included adult patients admitted to the medical zzso 

In phase I, a random sample of 261 medication signals were evaluated individually for potential zzso using the Kramer algorithm, zzso criteria and Jones zzso In phase II, an active medication monitoring system was used to detect five abnormal laboratory values, resulting in a random sample of zzso signals that were evaluated using the same three zzso 

Percentage agreement among the zzso for all levels of causality was estimated using a zzso statistic for both zzso of the zzso 

For phase I, the zzso values were all zzso ranging from zzso to zzso between instruments, with zzso versus Kramer having the highest zzso which is considered excellent zzso The zzso statistic between individual instruments for phase II are zzso ranging from zzso to zzso which is considered moderate agreement, with zzso versus Jones displaying the lowest zzso while still exhibiting moderate zzso For phase II, the Kramer zzso had better agreement with both the zzso criteria and the Jones zzso 

These instruments demonstrated similar results for evaluating zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that instrument selection with any of the three instruments is zzso For concurrent zzso evaluations, there is greater zzso in the level of causality obtained among zzso zzso and Kramer displayed better agreement with its zzso A suggestion for a more definitive concurrent zzso assessment is to use more than one zzso This may be challenging in daily clinical practice; however, it is a reasonable expectation for zzso
