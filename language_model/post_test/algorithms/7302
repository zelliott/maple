We propose a scheme for modulating phase zzso in light field imaging zzso In a camera system based on the zzso light field zzso data is obtained by zzso zzso and the data is zzso projected into a single image with arbitrary phase zzso In a projector system based on the zzso zzso data with arbitrary phase zzso is zzso generated before optical projection, and the zzso image is projected by zzso zzso We describe the system design and required conditions based on the sampling zzso We zzso verified the proposed scheme based on camera and projector zzso In the experiment, we demonstrated a zzso camera and projector with extended zzso without zzso the zzso zzso
