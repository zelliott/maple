The zzso zzso zzso assist device zzso generates zzso pressure with zzso of bellows instead of using an air zzso This zzso driver has a small volume that is suitable for portable zzso However, improper zzso pressure setup can not only cause a lack of adequate flow generation, but also cause durability zzso In this study, a zzso pressure regulation system for optimal operation of the zzso zzso has been zzso The optimal zzso pressure conditions according to various zzso conditions aiming for optimal flow rates were investigated, and an zzso zzso zzso was zzso The developed regulation system, which consists of a pressure sensor and a zzso zzso zzso estimates the current zzso and regulates the zzso pressure to the optimal point for the current zzso zzso zzso were performed in a mock circulation zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed sufficient performance with the standard zzso of error, zzso zzso zzso The flow rate could be zzso regulated with a developed system under various zzso zzso The shortcoming of a zzso zzso could be handled with this simple pressure regulation zzso
