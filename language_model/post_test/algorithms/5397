The zzso of sensitive techniques of detection of zzso zzso to define and measure zzso has greatly evolved in recent zzso We present here an approach to minimize the risk of zzso zzso in kidney transplantation based on the evaluation of graft accessibility of zzso patients by calculated zzso zzso and zzso of potential matched donors zzso using a national simulation software zzso This study included all registered patients on our waiting list zzso for deceased donor zzso kidney zzso All patients were screened by zzso flow zzso zzso zzso Of the 502 registered patients, 174 zzso were zzso Among these, zzso zzso zzso had a zzso For zzso of zzso patients (90 zzso with zzso and 41 zzso with zzso the flow of zzso was considered sufficient to allow a transplant avoiding all unacceptable zzso The 41 patients with a zzso zzso had a satisfactory donor flow in the framework of the national zzso program for highly zzso zzso Finally, 43 zzso patients zzso were deemed eligible for a strategy of higher zzso risk through zzso protocols or transplantation against zzso This approach provides a logical and systematic strategy to zzso the access of zzso patients to kidney transplantation minimizing the risk of zzso zzso
