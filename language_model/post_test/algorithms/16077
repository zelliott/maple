zzso are the most popular zzso analysis zzso A well-known application of zzso in nuclear magnetic resonance zzso is water peak zzso However, zzso are more familiar with frequency than zzso So, from a zzso point of view, a zzso analysis tool zzso zzso is not natural and a zzso approach would be much more zzso We explain a zzso solution to this problem based on zzso zzso As the two zzso are closely linked together we continuously emphasize their similarities and zzso In particular we show that, here, the zzso method is as efficient as the zzso approach, and we give some zzso Those remarks also apply to other zzso problems solved previously with the continuous zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso phase zzso
