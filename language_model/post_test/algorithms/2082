We introduce a method for finding weak structural similarities in a set of protein zzso zzso are considered at their secondary structure zzso The method uses a rigorous zzso zzso which finds all structural zzso zzso structures are zzso as zzso zzso zzso the so-called protein zzso We suggest that for detecting the similarities between two protein structures it is sufficient to find similarities in the protein core which consists of tightly packed secondary structure zzso zzso we can restrict ourselves to solving the zzso common connected zzso problem instead of the zzso common zzso zzso We have modified the zzso by zzso and zzso for solving that zzso The speed of the zzso increases zzso After calculating all zzso common connected zzso for all zzso comparisons in a set of protein zzso the common zzso in all proteins can be calculated by zzso zzso In this paper we characterize the method briefly and explain the zzso of the protein structure in zzso For the zzso alignment the similarity of zzso zzso with zzso a zzso and zzso protein zzso with DNA zzso III zzso will be zzso In the case of the multiple structure alignment the similarity in zzso of four zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso will be zzso Our first experiments show that the method works correctly and zzso The method can be used for arbitrary zzso Thus, different zzso models of protein structures can be zzso
