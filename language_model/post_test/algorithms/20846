Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evolution Strategy zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a Random Search were assessed for their ability to generate small zzso zzso of molecular compound zzso The zzso zzso were employed to perform an zzso zzso sampling of library molecules avoiding the biological testing of the full zzso This study was performed to find a suitable zzso zzso along with suitable zzso zzso the optimal number of zzso and population size were of zzso zzso were performed with limited resources as the zzso number of compound evaluations was restricted to zzso zzso show that all three zzso zzso are able to produce comparably good results, clearly outperforming a Random zzso While zzso was able to come up with good solutions after a few zzso cycles, zzso favored high numbers of zzso and was therefore less suited for library zzso We introduce zzso as an alternative approach to focused library zzso zzso was able to produce high quality solutions while exhibiting marked zzso Its implicit step size control makes it a straightforward zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate that a nearest neighbor zzso can successfully be applied to map from continuous search space to discrete chemical zzso
