To date, zzso searches for zzso zzso zzso have relied on two zzso The first, zzso zzso has been used to find zzso in zzso zzso but does not directly link DNA sequence with zzso patterns of zzso The second, based on searches for combinations of zzso factor zzso binding zzso has been employed in zzso discovery of similarly acting zzso but requires prior knowledge of the set of zzso acting at the zzso and the zzso binding zzso 

We propose a method for zzso discovery that combines aspects of both approaches in an effort to overcome their individual zzso By treating zzso zzso zzso regions zzso as proxies for zzso we endeavor to find zzso near zzso genes that are comprised of similar short, zzso zzso Using zzso chains as a convenient zzso to assess zzso we develop a sampling zzso to search a large group of zzso for the most similar zzso When starting with a set of genes involved in zzso early zzso development and using zzso comparisons of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show here that our zzso successfully detects known zzso Further, we use our similarity zzso based on zzso chain discrimination, in a zzso search, and uncover additional known and many candidate early zzso zzso 

Software is available via zzso
