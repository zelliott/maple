A new type of three-dimensional zzso display recently introduced on the market holds great promise for the future of 3-D zzso communication, and zzso This so-called zzso display can deliver multiple views without glasses, thus allowing a limited zzso zzso zzso Central to this technology is the process of zzso several views into a single zzso zzso This zzso is a complex process involving irregular zzso of the original zzso If not preceded by zzso zzso it results in zzso that leads to texture as well as depth zzso In order to eliminate this zzso we propose to model the zzso process with zzso find their parameters and then design optimal zzso zzso To this effect, we use zzso sampling theory and basic zzso zzso We derive optimal zzso filters for a specific zzso monitor using three models: the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the union of shifted zzso In the first case, the resulting zzso zzso filter offers significant zzso reduction that is further improved by zzso zzso filter for the zzso lattice zzso A more accurate model is obtained using union of shifted zzso but due to the complex nature of repeated zzso practical filters designed in this case offer no additional zzso We also describe a practical method to design zzso zzso filters that can be implemented using modern graphics zzso
