Gene expression profiling has gradually become a routine procedure for disease diagnosis and zzso In the past decade, many zzso methods have been proposed, resulting in great improvements on various levels, including feature selection and zzso for zzso and zzso In this study, we present zzso a novel method from the feature extraction perspective to further propel gene expression profiling technologies from bench to zzso We define zzso feature zzso for samples based on the gene expression profiles by zzso employment of zzso correlation zzso zzso experiments on both simulated and real gene expression data sets demonstrate that zzso can greatly highlight the zzso patterns underlying noisy gene expression data and thus greatly improve the zzso and accuracy of the zzso currently available for disease diagnosis and zzso based on gene expression zzso
