zzso zzso surface are mostly used for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso organic or zzso molecules onto the zzso zzso In zzso chemistry, the metal zzso zzso was zzso through zzso sensors using zzso zzso One needs to know the zzso correlation between the zzso and zzso agent while choosing zzso which is very important to design the zzso We have used two zzso representative of zzso and zzso zzso We used density functional calculation on all the interacting molecules in both the zzso phase and zzso medium within the domain of hard soft acid base principle zzso to look at the localized activity of the interacting atoms of these reacting molecules to formulate a zzso rule to choose of the best zzso We have as well zzso the mechanism of interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso The results were compared with experiment and it is observed that zzso plays a zzso role in the binding of zzso with zzso zzso The results also show that, the range of zzso index can be used as a suitable property to scale activity of zzso molecules suitable for the sensing zzso It is observed that the zzso zzso binds stronger with both the metal and the zzso zzso whereas for the zzso one, it binds only with the zzso agent when zzso and in all cases the metal zzso binding is weaker compared to that of the zzso zzso
