zzso defects are a major source of noise in gene expression zzso While existing approaches detect noisy zzso based on external information such as zzso zzso we introduce and validate a targeted zzso method for analyzing probe reliability directly from expression data and independently of the noise zzso This provides insights into the various sources of zzso noise and gives tools to guide probe zzso
