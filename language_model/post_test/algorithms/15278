A zzso gate array zzso hardware architecture is proposed and zzso for prediction of zzso population firing zzso The hardware system adopts the zzso zzso zzso generalized zzso model zzso structure to describe the zzso dynamic neural process of zzso brain and can switch between the two important zzso zzso of zzso zzso and prediction of zzso population zzso activity zzso zzso The model zzso are first estimated using the zzso training zzso then the output is predicted using the zzso testing data and the field estimated zzso Test results show that compared with previous software zzso of the generalized zzso zzso running on an Intel Core zzso zzso the zzso hardware system can achieve up to zzso zzso in doing model parameters zzso and zzso zzso in doing model output zzso The proposed hardware platform will facilitate research on the highly zzso neural process of the zzso brain, and the cognitive neural zzso zzso
