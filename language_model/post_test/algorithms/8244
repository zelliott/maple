The Kalman filter has been proposed as a model to decode neural activity measured from the motor zzso in order to obtain real-time estimates of hand motion in behavioral zzso zzso However, currently used linear zzso models underlying the Kalman filter do not take into account other behavioral states such as muscular activity or the zzso level of attention, which are often zzso during experiments but may play important roles in characterizing neural controlled hand zzso To address this issue, we depict these unknown states as one zzso hidden state in the linear zzso zzso This new model assumes that the observed neural firing rate is directly related to this hidden zzso The dynamics of the hand state are also allowed to impact the dynamics of the hidden state, and vice zzso The parameters in the model can be identified by a conventional zzso zzso Since this model still uses the linear zzso zzso zzso decoding can be performed by the efficient Kalman filter zzso Experimental results show that this new model provides a more appropriate representation of the neural data and generates more accurate zzso Furthermore, we have used recently developed zzso efficient methods by incorporating a zzso information of the targets of the reaching zzso Our results show that the zzso model with zzso further improves decoding zzso
