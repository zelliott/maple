zzso learning zzso based on zzso methods have two zzso First, standard zzso methods are zzso for large-scale problems because they require zzso storage space to maintain an approximation to an inverse zzso zzso (N is the number of zzso Second, a line search to calculate a reasonably accurate step length is indispensable for these zzso In order to provide desirable performance, an efficient and reasonably accurate line search is zzso To overcome these problems, we propose a new zzso learning zzso zzso direction is calculated on the basis of a partial zzso zzso update with zzso memory space zzso zzso zzso zzso and a reasonably accurate step length is efficiently calculated as the minimal point of a zzso approximation to the objective function with respect to the step zzso Our experiments, which use a parity problem and a speech synthesis problem, have shown that the proposed zzso outperformed major learning zzso Moreover, it turned out that an efficient and accurate zzso calculation plays an important role for the convergence of zzso zzso and a partial zzso update greatly saves storage space without losing the convergence zzso
