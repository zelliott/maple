Combined interaction of all the genes forms a central part of the functional system of a zzso Thus, especially the zzso modeling of the gene expression network is currently one of the main challenges in the field of systems zzso However, the problem is an extremely zzso and complex one, so that normal identification methods are usually not zzso specially if aiming at dynamic zzso We propose in this paper a zzso identification approach, which is well suited for zzso system modeling and the presented modified version can also handle the zzso case with less data samples than variables zzso The zzso is applied to two public zzso data sets collected from zzso zzso zzso The obtained dynamic state space model is tested by comparing the simulation results with the measured zzso It is shown that the identified model can relatively well describe the dynamics of the general stress-related changes in the expression of the complete zzso zzso However, it seems inevitable that more precise modeling of the dynamics of the whole zzso would require experiments especially designed for systemic zzso
