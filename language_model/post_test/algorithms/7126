A general zzso potential map based on molecular mechanics force field for modeling the zzso I frequency is zzso This map is applied to zzso zzso and designed to be zzso in different zzso The zzso zzso from zzso and zzso side chain are projected on the zzso unit of zzso to induce the frequency shift of zzso I zzso It is shown that the predicted zzso I frequency reproduces the experimental data zzso especially when zzso in polar zzso The zzso I frequency shift is largely determined by the zzso in zzso solution while it is dominated by the local structure of zzso in other zzso zzso The map parameters are further applied on zzso system and the obtained zzso zzso show zzso peak profile with negligible zzso from the experimental data, suggesting the usefulness of this general map for providing information about zzso parameters of zzso motions of zzso in different zzso
