To provide quantitative information on the image registration differences from multiple systems for zzso zzso zzso zzso and margin reduction in clinical zzso 

Images and zzso shift results from three different treatment systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been sent from various institutions to the zzso zzso zzso Center zzso for evaluation for the zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso zzso Nine patient zzso (five zzso and four zzso were included in the comparison, with each patient having zzso daily individual zzso zzso In all cases, daily shifts were zzso by zzso of the planning CT with the daily zzso data using three independent software systems zzso zzso zzso Automatic fusion was used in all zzso The results were compared with those submitted from zzso Similar regions of interest zzso and same initial positions were used in registrations for zzso zzso Different slice zzso for zzso sampling and different zzso for registration were used in some cases to observe the variation of registration due to these zzso 

For the 54 comparisons with zzso zzso the absolute values of differences of the registration results between different systems were zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the 66 comparisons in prostate cases, the differences were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The differences caused by the slice spacing variation were relatively small, and the different zzso selections in zzso and zzso also had limited zzso 

The extent of differences was reported when different systems were used for image zzso zzso examination and quality assurance of the image registration process are crucial before considering margin reduction using zzso in clinical zzso
