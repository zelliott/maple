On the basis of recently developed zzso continuation zzso methods and associated efficient zzso techniques, this text introduces zzso zzso that, due to very low zzso zzso can accurately and efficiently solve the types of zzso partial differential equation zzso models of zzso acoustics in zzso zzso as arise in the simulation of focused medical zzso As demonstrated in the examples presented in this text, the zzso approach can be used to produce solutions to zzso acoustics zzso models with significantly reduced zzso requirements over those associated with zzso zzso and zzso methods, especially in cases involving waves that travel distances that are orders of magnitude longer than their respective zzso In these examples, the zzso methodology is shown to lead to improvements in computing times by factors of hundreds and even thousands over those required by the standard zzso A variety of zzso two-dimensional examples presented in this text demonstrate the power and capabilities of the proposed methodology, including an example containing a number of scattering centers and zzso zzso zzso
