To investigate if zzso complexity in early childhood is related to speech and language outcomes in later childhood in children with cochlear implants zzso 

zzso 

zzso care zzso 

zzso infants with zzso zzso 

zzso received zzso zzso 

zzso vocal recordings were taken during zzso and zzso visits up to 13 months zzso zzso were measured using a scoring system that takes into account the phonetic complexity of infant zzso zzso variables included articulation and language measures collected at 4 years of zzso Data were analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso 

: For infants with at least 6 to 9 months of zzso experience, the phonetic complexity of zzso is significantly correlated with receptive zzso articulation abilities, and global language skills at 4 years of zzso 

The phonetic complexity of zzso zzso is related to later speech and language outcomes in children with zzso This information may be valuable in terms of tracking progress in pediatric zzso zzso
