zzso the mouse zzso is a widespread technology with important applications in many biological fields ranging from cancer research to zzso zzso Likewise, correlations between copy number variations zzso and human diseases are zzso We have developed the zzso zzso zzso method, which is based on quantitative zzso and uniquely designed zzso containing single zzso variations zzso to offer a simple and affordable zzso solution capable of identifying zzso zzso independent of the zzso arm size, determining the zzso status of zzso human zzso and zzso zzso copy number in experimental or commercial zzso In addition, we also present a simple zzso protocol that could be used for the enrichment of zzso zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso
