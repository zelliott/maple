An zzso has been developed for calculation of zzso E fields by the zzso integral equation zzso zzso zzso over surface elements is performed by elementary zzso formulas, assuming a linear zzso of surface zzso zzso points at electrical zzso are split off, well considering the E field behavior at these zzso specifically at sharp zzso and multimedia zzso zzso procedures are zzso in order to avoid undefined or infinite values at critical zzso The zzso is solved by iteration using zzso zzso minimum zzso solver on a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso convergence speed decreases considerably as the zzso of the problem zzso zzso time zzso 20 zzso on a supercomputer for approximately 30,000 zzso needs to be reduced by further code zzso zzso for 3-D test cases zzso wave illuminating a layered zzso generally agree well with the zzso zzso method if high E field zzso occur perpendicular to electrical zzso The zzso method predicts slightly higher E fields only in critical zzso On the other hand, the zzso method at present is more efficient with respect to zzso time for large zzso with high cell numbers zzso 100,000 zzso
