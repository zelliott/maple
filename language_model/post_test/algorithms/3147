A combined zzso model was developed to simulate the response of a rat tumor to zzso a combination of zzso with zzso zzso zzso is oral the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso drug for colon zzso A zzso based zzso zzso model was developed and fitted to experimental data from zzso Three zzso zzso models were developed to describe the tumor cell growth treated with zzso and a dual transit compartment model gave the best zzso This result may be due to dual mechanisms of action of zzso and the dual transit compartment model is able to simulate these better than the other zzso The zzso and zzso models were combined, and various dosing strategies were zzso The optimal ratio of zzso to zzso to maximize tumor reduction and minimize systemic toxicity was found to be consistent with previous zzso The model correctly predicted the toxic effect of low zzso zzso zzso level, consistent with clinical zzso zzso modulating chemotherapy zzso which combines continuous infusion of zzso and periodic administration of zzso was shown to be more effective than the same dose given by continuous infusion zzso This model can guide the development of dosing strategies and patient specific zzso zzso
