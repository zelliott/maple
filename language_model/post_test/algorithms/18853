zzso breast tumors typically appear in zzso with rough, zzso or zzso zzso whereas most benign masses have smooth, round, oval, or zzso zzso Several studies have shown that shape factors that incorporate differences as above can provide high zzso in distinguishing between zzso tumors and benign masses based upon their contours zzso However, global measures of zzso such as zzso are less effective than specially designed features based upon zzso and zzso We propose a method to derive zzso models of contours that preserve zzso and details of diagnostic zzso We show that an index of zzso derived from the turning functions of the zzso models obtained by the proposed method yields better zzso accuracy than a similar measure derived using a previously published zzso The methods were tested with a set of 111 contours of 65 benign masses and 46 zzso zzso A high zzso accuracy of zzso in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was zzso
