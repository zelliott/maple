To explore the impact of common variation on the risk of developing lung cancer, we conducted a zzso zzso association zzso zzso In phase 1, we compared the zzso of zzso tagging single zzso zzso zzso in zzso cases and zzso zzso in phase 2, zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cases and zzso zzso zzso selection was based on best supported P values from phase 1 and two other zzso studies of lung zzso In the combined analysis of zzso 1 and 2, the strongest associations identified were defined by zzso mapping to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Variation at zzso but not zzso or zzso was strongly associated with smoking behavior with risk zzso correlated to higher zzso Variation at zzso was shown to significantly influence induction of lung cancer zzso zzso data from the four series provided zzso zzso for zzso cases and zzso zzso A zzso provided increased support that variation at zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso influences lung cancer zzso The next zzso associations were attained at zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate few common zzso account for zzso of the excess familial risk zzso the necessity of having additional large sample series for gene zzso
