zzso identification and zzso mapping mostly rely on the combination of tandem mass zzso and sequence database zzso Despite constant improvements achieved in zzso search zzso and zzso zzso little effort has been invested in zzso the impact of different zzso zzso releases on the final results of a zzso zzso We have used a large zzso of mass zzso obtained using an zzso zzso XL zzso covering different growth situations of the model species zzso zzso More than one million zzso were analyzed employing the zzso zzso and four different databases corresponding to the major zzso zzso zzso In total more than zzso proteins and about 11,000 peptides were zzso zzso proteins were exclusively detected in assembly zzso in contrast to zzso missing proteins only zzso in other zzso The comparison of the results demonstrates that the database selection affects not only the number of identified proteins but also label free zzso and the biological interpretation of the zzso zzso of protein zzso exclusively assigned to individual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are provided as a resource for zzso zzso
