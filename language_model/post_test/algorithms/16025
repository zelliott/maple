zzso mathematical models of zzso (when applied to tumor zzso zzso have historically assumed that the growth zzso of cells in the zzso state are disregarded and the formation of a single zzso cell is zzso with the emergence of a zzso zzso The justification of this zzso is, from a mathematical point of view, to make the zzso of tumor zzso rates zzso However, zzso forms are not mandatory in the zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated the utility of the zzso backward equations in zzso calculating tumor zzso By extending their results, the cumulative distribution function of the time to a small zzso tumor may be zzso zzso
