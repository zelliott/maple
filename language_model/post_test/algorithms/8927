To estimate the body temperature zzso of seven dinosaurs zzso zzso and zzso zzso used an equation that predicts zzso from the body mass and maximum growth rate zzso with the latter preserved in zzso growth zzso zzso The results of these authors evidence zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that, due to zzso the maximum body size in zzso was ultimately limited by zzso In this paper, I revisit this hypothesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso I first studied whether zzso derived from the zzso of today's zzso birds and zzso are consistent with core temperatures of zzso Second, I applied the zzso to a larger number of dinosaurs than zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In particular, I estimated zzso of zzso (from two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sauropods zzso For extant species, the zzso value estimated from the zzso was a poor estimate of an zzso core zzso For birds, zzso was always strongly overestimated and for zzso zzso for zzso the accuracy of zzso was zzso I argue that zzso differences in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso line, zzso and in the zzso of the zzso model both used in the zzso as well as ecological and evolutionary adaptations of species cause these zzso zzso of the found inaccuracy of zzso estimated from the zzso and contrary to the results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso I found no increase in zzso with increasing body mass across all dinosaurs zzso zzso zzso This observation questions that, due to zzso the maximum size in zzso was ultimately limited by zzso However, the general high inaccuracy of zzso zzso derived from the zzso makes a reliable test of whether body size in dinosaurs was ultimately limited by zzso zzso
