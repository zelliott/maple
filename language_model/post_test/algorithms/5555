As a greedy search algorithm, zzso and zzso tree zzso is easily zzso into zzso while modeling zzso gene expression zzso A straightforward solution is to filter irrelevant genes via identifying significant zzso Considering some significant genes with zzso expression patterns exhibiting systematic difference in zzso samples are difficult to be identified by existing methods, a strategy that zzso transform of variables selected by zzso zzso purity zzso for zzso modeling is zzso First, significant genes exhibiting varied expression patterns can be properly identified by a variable selection method based on zzso zzso zzso Then, zzso transform is implemented to offer zzso featured variables for zzso modeling via feature zzso Because significant genes with complex expression patterns can be properly identified and zzso feature extracted in advance, this developed strategy potentially improves the performance of zzso in combating zzso or zzso while modeling zzso zzso The developed strategy is demonstrated using two zzso data zzso The results reveal that zzso zzso provides superior performance to zzso neighbors or zzso coupled with other gene identifying strategies, indicating zzso zzso holds great promise for zzso data zzso
