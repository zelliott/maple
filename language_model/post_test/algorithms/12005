The zzso zzso zzso method was used to further study zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso quantum yields of selected aromatic zzso The cluster of zzso zzso and zzso was further grouped into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for which zzso were zzso zzso The zzso obtained by zzso are more significant than those obtained in previous zzso The studies showed that only when the compounds belonging to different groups are studies zzso inherent relationships between molecular properties and their structure characteristics can be zzso It can be generally concluded that the zzso quantum yields of the zzso aromatic zzso are dependent on the overall characters of the zzso the characters of the zzso bonds to be broken in the zzso and the character of the zzso atoms to be replaced in the zzso zzso has great relevance to the zzso processes of the zzso zzso aromatic zzso with large average molecular zzso and molecular weight values tend to have low zzso quantum zzso
