To determine the risk of clinical zzso in men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms of zzso outlet obstruction and identify the zzso for progression in this group of zzso 

A total of zzso men who presented to the zzso clinics with mild symptoms of zzso outlet obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso less than 8) were analyzed in this zzso study conducted during a zzso zzso They began with the watchful waiting protocol and were followed up every 3 months for 48 zzso Age, International zzso zzso zzso zzso divided into zzso symptom score and zzso symptom score, serum zzso zzso level, total prostate volume, transitional zone volume, urinary flow rates, and zzso residual urine volume were zzso 

The cumulative zzso of clinical zzso defined as worsening of the zzso with migration to the moderate symptom group zzso 8 to zzso or severe symptom group zzso 19 to zzso and an increase in zzso of more than 2 points, was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months, zzso zzso patients zzso developed acute urinary retention within the zzso follow-up zzso Of these 19 patients, only 2 zzso required zzso zzso of the zzso The variables of importance for disease progression in the artificial neural network analysis were, in order of statistical significance, zzso zzso level, zzso symptom score, and transitional zone zzso 

The risk for men with mild symptoms of zzso outlet obstruction to progress clinically and develop complications such as acute retention of urine is zzso zzso zzso zzso symptom score, and transitional zone volume were identified as important risk zzso
