Conventional zzso cell zzso zzso has a variable natural history, and determining individual prognosis is important to guide zzso We have examined the zzso significance of a large number of zzso and zzso zzso as well as traditional zzso factors in patients with zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso for newly diagnosed zzso between September 1998 and March 2005 were invited to zzso zzso zzso and laboratory data were recorded in each case, and zzso was carried out on a subset of zzso A planned subset analysis of patients presenting with zzso disease was zzso 

Two hundred twelve patients with zzso formed the study zzso In addition to zzso factors, zzso analyses revealed zzso serum sodium concentration to be independently and significantly associated with overall survival and zzso survival when considered as both a continuous variable and when zzso to above and below the median value zzso zzso reference range zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso overall survival estimates for patients above and below the median serum sodium were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings persisted in the zzso zzso zzso 

We have confirmed the zzso value of traditional zzso factors but, to our knowledge, these are the first data to show that low zzso sodium concentration may be an important factor associated with reduced survival in patients with zzso suggesting that serum sodium should be considered with established zzso variables in modeling survival in zzso
