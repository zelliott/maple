zzso is the current strategy for control and prevention of severe zzso infections, a major cause of zzso zzso zzso in young children zzso Public health interventions aimed at improving water, food and sanitation are unlikely adequately to control the zzso The development of vaccines against severe zzso zzso is based upon zzso or zzso protection provided against either a single common G zzso zzso zzso or against multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso strain surveillance has a high priority in disease control zzso zzso The continued identification of the most common G and P zzso for inclusion in vaccines is an important zzso And subsequent to the introduction of a vaccine candidate, not only monitoring of circulating strains is recommended, but also surveillance of potential zzso of animal zzso genes from the vaccine into human zzso strains is zzso Conventional methods used in the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso often fail to identify uncommon and newly appearing zzso The application of newer molecular approaches, including sequencing and zzso zzso zzso may be required to zzso such zzso The present paper presents a brief overview of the variety of standard methods available, followed by suggestions for a systematic approach for routine zzso strain surveillance as well as for zzso of incompletely typed zzso zzso zzso detection and zzso of incompletely typed strains will help to develop a comprehensive strain surveillance that may be required for tailoring effective zzso zzso
