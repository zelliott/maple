The exponential growth of research in molecular biology has brought zzso proliferation of databases for stocking its zzso A variety of protein sequence databases zzso While all of these strive for zzso the range of user interests is often beyond their zzso Large databases covering a broad range of zzso tend to offer less detailed information than smaller, more specialized resources, often creating a need to combine data from many sources in order to obtain a complete zzso Scientific researchers are continually developing new specific databases to enhance their understanding of biological zzso 

In this article, we present the zzso of a new tool for protein data zzso With its zzso user zzso this software provides the opportunity to build more specialized protein databases from a universal protein sequence database such as zzso A family of proteins known as zzso is analyzed as zzso of zzso 

zzso is zzso software that allows the extraction of protein data from the zzso database, sequence analysis zzso zzso profile calculations, zzso sequences search, multiple sequence alignments and the building of new and more specialized zzso It compiles information with relative ease, updates and compares various data relevant to a given protein family and could solve the problem of dispersed biological search zzso
