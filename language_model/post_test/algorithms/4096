Image encryption is an important and effective technique to protect image zzso In this paper, a novel image encryption zzso combining Julia sets and zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso Julia zzso parameters to generate a random sequence as the initial keys and gets the final encryption keys by scrambling the initial keys through the zzso zzso The final zzso image is obtained by zzso zzso and diffuse zzso In this method, it needs only a few parameters for the key generation, which greatly reduces the storage zzso Moreover, because of the Julia zzso properties, such as zzso and chaotic zzso the keys have high sensitivity even to a tiny zzso The experimental results indicate that the zzso has large key space, good statistical property, high sensitivity for the keys, and effective resistance to the zzso zzso
