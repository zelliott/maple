The zzso of zzso on zzso carbon zzso zzso composite zzso by zzso zzso prepared by using zzso zzso technique was investigated by batch technique under ambient zzso The effect of contact time, zzso zzso content, temperature and initial zzso zzso on zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso content, and zzso The zzso was zzso rapidly at the first zzso and thereafter attained the zzso zzso at zzso The zzso kinetic data were well described by the zzso rate zzso The zzso zzso were fitted by the zzso model better than by the zzso zzso The maximum zzso capacity of zzso was zzso The zzso zzso parameters of standard zzso zzso standard zzso changes zzso and standard free energy zzso were calculated from temperature dependent zzso zzso The values of zzso and zzso suggested that the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso interaction, zzso interaction, and Lewis zzso interaction may play an important role in zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso is a promising magnetic zzso for the zzso and separation of organic pollutants from zzso solutions in environmental pollution zzso
