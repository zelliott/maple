A method is presented for the preliminary ordering of zzso on a zzso using zzso linkage zzso The method is based on the biologically reasonable assumption that the zzso order of a set of linked zzso will be the one that zzso the total length of the zzso zzso Here the zzso is defined as the sum of adjacent zzso zzso The method searches for the optimal order, represented by a minimum distance map zzso even when it is not possible to examine the zzso possible distinct orders for zzso zzso A computerized approach, using the simulated zzso zzso of Kirkpatrick et zzso zzso forms the basis of the zzso It can be applied to data from radiation hybrid experiments as well as that from conventional family linkage zzso The technique is applied to several sets of published data to illustrate how it performs in zzso The advantages and the disadvantages of the method are discussed so that it will be clear under what conditions it is likely to work zzso When data sets are zzso in the sense that all possible zzso zzso zzso have estimates, and when no large clusters of extremely tightly linked zzso are present, the method produces ordered sets of zzso that agree well with those generated by other, more complex zzso Any discrepancies that occur are likely to be with respect to the orientation of zzso zzso where relative order cannot be reliably established by any zzso The method thus provides a simple, rapid means of obtaining a preliminary order for a set of zzso known to be in the same linkage zzso
