It is highly desirable to be able to zzso probe biological activities deep inside live zzso By employing a zzso confined zzso via a zzso transition, zzso zzso zzso has become indispensable for imaging scattering zzso However, as the incident laser power drops zzso with imaging depth due to scattering loss, the zzso zzso eventually overwhelms the zzso zzso The resulting loss of imaging contrast defines a fundamental zzso limit, which cannot be overcome by increasing zzso zzso zzso we propose to significantly extend this depth limit by zzso zzso and imaging zzso of zzso zzso The imaging contrast is drastically improved due to the created disparity of zzso quantum states in zzso We demonstrate this new principle by both zzso theory and experiments on tissue zzso labeled with synthetic zzso zzso dye or genetically zzso zzso zzso
