zzso and accurate extraction of the zzso in particular its clinically meaningful zzso from zzso MR images, is of great interest in zzso prostate interventions and diagnosis of prostate zzso In this work, we propose a novel zzso zzso approach to simultaneously locating the boundaries of the prostate and its two major zzso the central zzso and the peripheral zzso The proposed method zzso the prior knowledge of the spatial region consistency and employs a customized prostate appearance model to simultaneously segment multiple clinically meaningful zzso We solve the resulted challenging zzso zzso problem by means of convex relaxation, for which we introduce a novel zzso continuous zzso model and demonstrate its duality to the investigated convex relaxed zzso problem with the region consistency zzso Moreover, the proposed continuous zzso model naturally leads to a new and efficient continuous zzso based algorithm, which enjoys great advantages in zzso and can be readily implemented on zzso zzso using 15 zzso zzso prostate MR images, by zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed zzso
