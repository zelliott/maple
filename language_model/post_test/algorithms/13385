Deep tissue imaging has become state of the art in biology, but now the problem is to zzso spatial information in a zzso zzso zzso Although access to the raw data is no longer a zzso the zzso tools to extract biologically useful information out of these large data sets is still catching zzso In many cases, to understand the mechanism behind a biological process, where molecules or cells interact with each other, it is mandatory to know their mutual zzso We illustrate this principle here with the immune zzso Although the general functions of zzso zzso as immune sentinels are well zzso many cellular and molecular details governing the interactions of zzso and zzso cells remain unclear to date and prevent an in-depth zzso understanding of the immune zzso We zzso ex zzso zzso zzso isolated from both zzso and transgenic mice lacking key factors for zzso cell positioning and used software written in zzso to determine the spatial distances between the zzso cells and the internal high zzso vascular zzso This allowed us to zzso the spatial zzso of the zzso cells in the zzso zzso which is a critical zzso determining the effectiveness of an zzso immune zzso
