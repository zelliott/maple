To evaluate the performance of a zzso zzso diagnosis zzso tool using artificial intelligence techniques for the detection of pulmonary embolism zzso and the possible benefit for general zzso 

Forty zzso row zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso using 100 zzso 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso reconstruction kernel were zzso A total of 80 zzso zzso contrast material was injected at a flow rate of 5 zzso zzso six general zzso marked any zzso using a commercially available lung evaluation software with simultaneous, automatic processing by zzso in the zzso An expert panel consisting of two chest zzso analyzed all zzso marks from the readers and zzso also searching for additional finding primarily missed by both, forming the ground zzso 

The ground truth consisted of 212 zzso Of these, 65 zzso were centrally and 147 zzso were peripherally zzso The readers detected zzso zzso zzso leading to a sensitivity of zzso zzso for central and zzso zzso for peripheral zzso with 9 zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso reaching a sensitivity of zzso for central zzso and zzso for peripheral zzso A total of 154 zzso candidates were considered as false zzso yielding an average of zzso false zzso 

The zzso software showed a sensitivity comparable to that of the general zzso but with more false zzso zzso detection of findings incremental to the zzso suggests benefit when used as a second zzso Future versions of zzso have the potential to further increase clinical benefit by improving sensitivity and reducing false zzso
