The dose response curve is the gold standard for measuring the effect of a drug treatment, but is rarely used in zzso scale zzso profiling due to perceived obstacles of cost and zzso One barrier to examining zzso dose responses is that existing methods for zzso data analysis can identify patterns, but provide no quantitative pharmacological zzso We developed zzso methods that identify transcripts responsive to dose, calculate classical pharmacological parameters such as the zzso and enable an in-depth analysis of coordinated zzso treatment zzso The approach was applied to a zzso profiling study that evaluated four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso across a zzso dose range, using 12 zzso per zzso The transcript responses proved a powerful means to characterize and compare the zzso the distribution of zzso values for the zzso was linked to specific targets, zzso effects on cellular processes were identified using automated zzso analysis, and a connection was seen between zzso in standard cellular zzso and zzso zzso Our approach greatly zzso the information that can be obtained from standard zzso profiling zzso Moreover, these methods are zzso robust to zzso zzso and could be applied to other sources of quantitative zzso
