A method to remove zzso zzso orders of computer-generated zzso phase zzso is zzso Normally, the reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso made from just two phase levels, results in an zzso zzso image from the minus first zzso order, which is zzso with the desired zzso This can be avoided by reconstructing the zzso with a diffuse light field with a zzso but known, phase distribution, which is taken into account for the zzso zzso As a consequence, only the desired image is zzso whereas all residual light is zzso zzso as a diffuse background zzso The method may be advantageous to employ zzso spatial light zzso as holographic display devices, which can display only zzso phase zzso but which have the advantage of fast switching zzso
