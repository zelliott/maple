zzso internal carotid artery zzso is a risk factor for zzso stroke in coronary artery bypass zzso zzso Although both selective and zzso methods of zzso carotid screening have been zzso it is unclear which approach is most clinically zzso 

Hospital records for zzso consecutive zzso patients from January 2000 through April 2002 were zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed across selected parameters to identify risk factors for significant carotid zzso zzso or zzso zzso Patients were zzso zzso into zzso or low-risk groups based on risk factors common to carotid zzso and zzso zzso The prevalence of carotid zzso surgical management, and zzso stroke rates were determined for each zzso 

zzso zzso zzso patients out of zzso patients zzso underwent zzso carotid zzso The prevalence of significant carotid zzso was zzso zzso risk factors for zzso included an age of more than 65 years, peripheral vascular disease, prior cerebrovascular accident, history of cerebrovascular disease, left main coronary disease, carotid zzso female zzso and zzso zzso zzso was a risk factor for stroke, zzso injury, zzso zzso and longer zzso zzso of carotid zzso was greater in high-risk patients zzso N zzso zzso versus low-risk patients zzso N zzso zzso zzso or staged carotid zzso zzso was more commonly performed in the high-risk group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso All nine patients with significant carotid zzso who suffered zzso strokes were in the high-risk group (9 out of zzso vs 0 out of zzso p zzso zzso 

In our zzso selectively screening only patients with either an age of more than 65, carotid zzso or cerebrovascular disease would have reduced the screening load by nearly zzso with negligible impact on surgical management or zzso zzso
