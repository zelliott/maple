We describe a method to identify protein domain boundaries from sequence information alone based on the assumption that zzso zzso cluster together in zzso zzso is a suite of programs developed to predict domain boundaries based on the consistency observed in a set of alternative zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso models generated for a given protein multiple sequence zzso This is achieved by running a distance zzso folding technique in conjunction with a zzso assignment zzso The overall accuracy of our method in predicting the number of zzso for a zzso data set of zzso multiple zzso representing 185 single and 231 zzso zzso is zzso zzso Using domain zzso regions observed in the zzso structures associated with each query alignment as the standard of truth, zzso boundary positions are delineated with an accuracy of zzso % for proteins zzso continuous zzso only, and zzso % for proteins with zzso zzso Overall, domain boundaries are delineated with an accuracy of zzso zzso The prediction accuracy values are independent of the zzso sequence similarities within each of the zzso These results demonstrate the capability of our method to delineate zzso in protein sequences associated with a wide variety of structural domain zzso
