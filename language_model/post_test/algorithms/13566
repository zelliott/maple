This paper deals with the zzso of unknown signals in zzso using sliding zzso zzso attention is drawn to estimate the specific growth rate of zzso from measurement of biomass zzso In a recent article, notions of zzso sliding modes have been used to derive a growth rate observer for batch zzso In this paper we zzso and refine these preliminary zzso We develop a new observer with a different error structure to cope with other types of zzso Furthermore, we show that these observers are zzso under coordinate transformations and time zzso to the classical zzso zzso algorithm, thus inheriting all its distinctive zzso The new zzso family achieves convergence to zzso unknown signals in finite time, and presents the best zzso zzso error order in the presence of zzso In addition, the observers are robust to modeling and zzso uncertainties since they are based on minimal assumptions on zzso zzso In addition, they have interesting applications in fault detection and zzso The observers performance in zzso zzso and continuous zzso is assessed by experimental data obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso
