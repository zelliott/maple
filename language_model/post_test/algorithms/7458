zzso motion due to zzso ultrasound zzso probe pressure and patient movement causes target zzso during zzso zzso zzso Several solutions have been proposed to perform zzso registration for motion zzso To improve registration accuracy and zzso we developed and evaluated a registration zzso whose zzso is based on learned prostate motion characteristics relative to different tracked probe positions and prostate zzso We performed a principal component analysis of previously observed motions and zzso the principal directions to zzso Powell's direction set method during zzso Compared with the standard zzso our approach improved target registration error to zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso Multiple zzso along the major principal directions improved the zzso of the method at the cost of additional execution time of zzso zzso With a total execution time of zzso s to perform motion compensation, this method is amenable to useful integration into a clinical zzso guided prostate biopsy zzso
