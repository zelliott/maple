A method of spectral decomposition in zzso recordings is proposed, which represents the results of zzso zzso zzso identification in terms of zzso and zzso of different zzso zzso For this purpose, a class of zzso dynamic adjustment zzso models in which a zzso zzso zzso network of zzso interactions is fed by zzso zzso zzso processes is zzso zzso relevant to the zzso network zzso interactions zzso and poles relevant to each zzso input are zzso and accordingly zzso The zzso of each channel can be divided into partial zzso each relevant to an zzso Each partial spectrum is affected by the zzso and by the poles of the corresponding zzso consequently, it is zzso into the relevant components by means of the residual zzso zzso different zzso mechanisms, even at similar zzso are classified by different poles and zzso by the corresponding zzso The structure of zzso models is quite flexible and can be adapted to various sets of available signals and a zzso hypotheses about the existing zzso a zzso layout is proposed that emphasizes the zzso sources and the corresponding zzso zzso Application examples relevant to cardiovascular zzso are briefly zzso
