Using zzso with different zzso in diffuse optical zzso zzso zzso has the advantage that the zzso of zzso can be reconstructed zzso In continuous wave spectral zzso it is zzso possible to distinguish between scattering and zzso The choice of the laser zzso has a strong impact on how well the scattering zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso Current methods to zzso the set of zzso disregard the sensitivity of the reconstruction result to uncertainties in the zzso zzso of the zzso But since available zzso zzso show significant zzso it seems to be necessary to take this into zzso The wavelength zzso approach presented here is an extension to a method of zzso et zzso The original method zzso the wavelength sets such that scattering parameters and zzso zzso can be separated zzso We introduce an additional criterion that evaluates the dependence of reconstructed zzso zzso on zzso of the extinction zzso The wavelength sets found by the new approach are different from those determined with the original zzso zzso of simulated data show the effect of using various zzso zzso for reconstruction with different wavelength sets and illustrate the advantages of the new wavelength zzso
