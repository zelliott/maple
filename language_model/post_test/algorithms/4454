Neck pain frequently is managed by physical zzso The development of zzso methods for matching interventions to zzso of patients may improve clinical zzso The purpose of this study was to describe a proposed zzso system for patients with neck pain by examining data for consecutive patients receiving physical therapy zzso 

zzso methods for collecting baseline and intervention data were used for all patients receiving physical therapy interventions for neck pain over 1 zzso zzso variables were the Neck zzso Index zzso zzso pain rating, and number of zzso Treatment was provided at the discretion of the physical zzso After the completion of treatment, each patient was classified by use of baseline zzso The interventions received by the patient were zzso as being matched or not matched to the zzso Outcomes for patients who received matched interventions were compared with those for patients who received zzso zzso The zzso reliability of the zzso zzso was examined with a subset of 50 zzso 

A total of zzso patients were included in this study zzso zzso age zzso zzso The most common zzso was zzso zzso next were exercise and conditioning zzso and mobility zzso The zzso reliability for zzso decisions was high zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso A total of 113 patients zzso received interventions matched to the zzso zzso matched interventions was associated with greater improvements in the zzso zzso zzso points, zzso zzso and in pain ratings zzso zzso point, zzso zzso than receiving zzso zzso 

The development of zzso methods for patients with neck pain may improve the outcomes of physical therapy zzso This study was done to examine a previously proposed zzso system for patients receiving physical therapy interventions for neck zzso zzso interventions matched to the zzso system was associated with better outcomes than receiving zzso zzso Although the design of this study prohibited drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the system, the results suggest that further research on the system may be zzso
