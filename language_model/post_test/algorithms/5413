To evaluate the possibility of an unknown protein to be a resistant gene against zzso zzso zzso zzso a different mode of zzso zzso acid composition zzso is proposed to formulate the protein samples by zzso the zzso acid zzso as well as the zzso games representation zzso zzso Some zzso comparisons of triangle, zzso and zzso polygon zzso are carried to evaluate the efficiency of using these zzso figures in zzso The zzso results show that among the three polygon methods, triangle method owns a good zzso zzso and performs the best in the zzso zzso By using triangle + zzso polygon zzso as the mathematical feature, the zzso achieves zzso in zzso test and zzso achieves zzso
