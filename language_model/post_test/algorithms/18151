A solid-state dynamic zzso barrier zzso display zzso some of the restrictions present in zzso barrier systems, such as fixed zzso range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating zzso By zzso varying barrier parameters in real time, viewers may move closer to the display and move faster zzso than with a zzso barrier system, and the display can switch between zzso and zzso modes by disabling the barrier on a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can output four independent eye channels when two viewers are present, and both zzso viewers receive an independent pair of zzso and zzso perspective views based on their position in zzso zzso The display device is constructed by using a zzso LCD monitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and a modulated virtual environment composed of two or four channels is rendered on the rear zzso zzso was recently demonstrated in a small-scale zzso zzso zzso This paper summarizes the concepts presented earlier, extends the discussion of various topics, and presents recent improvements to the zzso
