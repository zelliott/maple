In this paper, we propose a crowd motion zzso approach based on zzso motion approximation in a scattered motion zzso To represent crowd motion in an accurate and zzso way, we zzso optical flow at the salient locations instead of at all the zzso zzso We then transform the problem of crowd motion zzso into a problem of scattered motion field zzso Based on our assumption that local crowd motion can be zzso by a zzso motion field, we develop a zzso domain zzso zzso model in which the evolution of domain boundaries is derived from the zzso zzso of an objective functional and further extend zzso to the case of scattered motion zzso The experiment results on a set of synthetic zzso fields and a set of videos depicting real-world crowd scenes indicate that the proposed approach is effective in identifying the homogeneous crowd motion components under different zzso
