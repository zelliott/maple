Using a population density approach we study the dynamics of two interacting collections of zzso zzso zzso representing zzso zzso cells from the zzso lateral zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells from the zzso nucleus zzso Each population of zzso is described by a zzso probability density function that zzso a conservation equation with appropriately defined probability zzso and boundary zzso The state variables of each zzso are the membrane potential and the zzso gating variable of the zzso zzso current zzso The synaptic zzso of the populations and external zzso drive are modeled by instantaneous jumps in the membrane potential of zzso zzso The population density model is validated by comparing its response to zzso retinal input to zzso Carlo simulations of the corresponding zzso network composed of 100 to 1,000 cells per zzso In the absence of retinal zzso the population density model exhibits rhythmic bursting similar to the 7 to 14 zzso zzso associated with slow wave sleep that require feedback zzso from zzso to zzso zzso When the zzso and zzso cell zzso leakage zzso are adjusted to represent zzso zzso and zzso of the network, rhythmic bursting of the probability density model may either persists or be eliminated depending on the number of zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso to zzso connections made by each zzso zzso When the probability density model is zzso with constant retinal input zzso zzso a wide range of responses are observed depending on cellular parameters and network zzso These include zzso burst and zzso zzso sleep zzso rhythmic zzso and zzso in population firing rate that are distinguishable from sleep zzso due to their zzso frequency, or the presence of zzso zzso In this context of zzso network zzso we find the population density approach using 2,500 mesh points and resolving membrane zzso to zzso zzso is over 30 times more efficient than zzso zzso Carlo zzso
