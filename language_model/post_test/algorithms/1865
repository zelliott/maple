zzso typing using zzso fixed zzso embedded zzso cervical tissue is used to evaluate zzso vaccine impact, but DNA yield and quality in zzso specimens can zzso affect test zzso This study aimed to evaluate 2 commercial zzso for zzso detection and typing using zzso cervical zzso 

Four large North Carolina pathology laboratories provided zzso specimens from 299 women zzso and older diagnosed with cervical disease from 2001 to zzso For each woman, one diagnostic block was selected and zzso serial sections were prepared for DNA zzso zzso from samples with residual zzso were used to detect and type zzso using parallel and serial testing zzso with the Linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

LA and zzso zzso was zzso for detecting any high-risk zzso and zzso for detecting any low-risk zzso types, with significant differences in marginal proportions for zzso 51, 52, and any zzso zzso zzso results were most often zzso zzso The parallel zzso yielded the highest prevalence of any zzso type zzso zzso type prevalence was similar using parallel zzso and serial zzso zzso zzso 33, and 52 prevalence was slightly lower using the serial algorithm, but the median number of zzso types per woman zzso did not differ by zzso Using the serial algorithm, zzso DNA was detected in zzso of invasive and zzso of zzso zzso The most common type was zzso followed by 52, 18, 31, 33, and zzso zzso was detected in zzso of zzso Multiple zzso types were more common in lower grade zzso 

We developed an efficient zzso for testing and reporting results of two commercial zzso for zzso detection and typing in zzso zzso and describe zzso type distribution in zzso and invasive cervical zzso in a zzso sample prior to zzso vaccine zzso
