This study sought to determine the patterns of zzso response from zzso muscle sites during a symmetrical lift and replace zzso Surface zzso zzso and zzso variables were recorded from 29 healthy zzso zzso recognition techniques were used to examine how zzso zzso patterns changed with the different physical demands of the task zzso phase of zzso The results indicated that there was very little trunk and pelvis motion during the zzso Three principal patterns accounted for zzso of the total variation suggesting that the measured data had a simple underlying structure of zzso zzso results revealed significant differences in principal pattern zzso These differences captured subtle changes in muscle recruitment strategies that most likely reflect different stability and zzso zzso More balanced zzso zzso between the abdominal and back sites were observed during the lighter demands, whereas differential recruitment among the back zzso sites was more zzso in the more demanding zzso A pattern recognition technique offers a novel method to examine the relationships among a large number of muscles and test how different work characteristics change the relationships among the muscle zzso
