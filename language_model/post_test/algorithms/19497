It is often difficult for zzso to identify small zzso zzso zzso due to insufficient contrast zzso zzso we have developed a new zzso zzso and dynamic zzso technique to enhance small zzso after automatically selecting images set at the same anatomical position from the present zzso and zzso CT zzso and previous zzso The present study was performed with CT images from 14 zzso First, we used zzso based on similarities in liver shape between the present zzso and zzso CT zzso and previous zzso CT images at the same zzso zzso zzso images were then obtained by zzso of the previous image from the present image taken at the same position of the zzso Dynamic zzso images were also obtained by zzso of zzso CT images from zzso CT images taken at the same position of the zzso zzso of 22 zzso zzso with contrast enhancement were zzso in zzso and dynamic zzso zzso Compared with present zzso CT images, increases of zzso and zzso in zzso contrast were observed on dynamic and zzso zzso images, zzso These zzso images may be useful as reference images in the detection of small moderately differentiated zzso
