Human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso can cause an adult zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is a life-threatening zzso disorder and is resistant to chemotherapy, the establishment and enhancement of zzso immunity to zzso through the development of therapeutic vaccines could be of zzso Thus, the identification of zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso T cells should facilitate the development of effective zzso Although numerous zzso zzso for zzso have been identified, few zzso recognized by zzso helper T cells against this virus have been zzso 

zzso peptides prepared from several regions of the zzso envelope zzso sequence that were predicted to serve as helper zzso zzso were prepared with use of computer-based zzso and tested for their capacity to trigger in zzso helper zzso responses using zzso from normal zzso 

The results show that the zzso and zzso helper T zzso restricted by zzso and zzso respectively, could recognize intact zzso zzso zzso cells and, as a consequence, zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso helper T zzso restricted by zzso were able to directly kill zzso zzso cells and recognize naturally processed zzso derived from killed zzso zzso cells, which was presented to the helper T cells by zzso zzso zzso 

The present findings hold relevance for the design and zzso of zzso zzso zzso against zzso diseases such as zzso
