Recently, the existed zzso zzso zzso had been used to solve zzso convex zzso zzso As a special zzso convex problem, the zzso zzso constrained zzso programs with box constraints appear in a wide range of zzso zzso we propose an accelerated zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso constrained zzso programs with box zzso At each zzso the zzso whose zzso zzso is diagonal and positive zzso is an easy model which can be solved efficiently via searching a root of a zzso linear zzso It is proved that the new zzso can terminate at an zzso solution within zzso see zzso zzso Moreover, no line search is needed in this algorithm, and the global convergence can be proved under mild zzso zzso results are reported for solving zzso programs arising from the training of support zzso machines, which show that the new zzso is zzso
