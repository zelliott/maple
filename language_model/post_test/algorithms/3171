In this paper, a zzso method for brain zzso and zzso zzso and volume measurement using zzso zzso imaging is zzso This method combines a region growing approach to segment the zzso and a level set zzso technique to segment the zzso The main novelty of this method is the strategy applied to define the propagation function required by the level set zzso To evaluate the method, 18 patients with brain zzso and zzso of different size, shape and location were zzso The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides objective and zzso zzso that are similar to the manually obtained zzso Moreover, the processing time of the proposed method is about 4 zzso compared to the 10 zzso required for manual zzso
