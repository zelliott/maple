We describe the application of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to yield a robust design for a floating sleeve antenna for zzso zzso zzso zzso element models are used to generate the electromagnetic zzso field and zzso distribution in liver given a particular zzso zzso properties of the tissue are assumed to vary within zzso zzso of average properties to simulate the variation among zzso The zzso zzso zzso yields an optimal design that is a zzso improvement over the original design and is more robust in terms of zzso size, shape and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso finds an optimal solution saving zzso simulation of the evaluations compared to the standard zzso zzso zzso
