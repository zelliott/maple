In this paper, the zzso of zzso zzso learning techniques in geometrical transformations of the images is zzso A number of such techniques are presented and tested using four facial expression zzso A strong correlation between the recognition accuracy and the image registration error has been zzso Although it is zzso that zzso methods are sensitive to image registration zzso there is no systematic experiment reported in the zzso As a result of these experiments, the training set enrichment with zzso scaled and rotated images is proposed for confronting the low zzso of these techniques in facial expression zzso Moreover, person dependent training is proven to be much more accurate for facial expression recognition than generic zzso
