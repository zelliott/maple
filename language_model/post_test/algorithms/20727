The Ras zzso of small G proteins zzso zzso cellular processes by virtue of zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes, which are in turn regulated by a number of accessory zzso Members of the zzso zzso are important for correct targeting and fusion of zzso zzso loaded with trafficking proteins and zzso During evolution from a zzso zzso novel functions may be acquired by duplicated daughter zzso for zzso zzso this can be tested by location, which is specifically related to the function of each zzso We have found an example of two zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso that clearly arose by tandem duplication, being highly related to each other and remaining juxtaposed in the zzso whose products have dramatically different zzso locations, indicative of discrete zzso These two zzso zzso isolated on a single zzso zzso are separated by a short intervening sequence and are in a zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the open reading frames and intervening sequence were determined and show that the genes are zzso probably arising from an ancient tandem zzso Both genes are most zzso to zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso while zzso reconstruction indicates that although they have clearly diverged, the proteins are more closely related to each other than to other zzso protein sequences available in the data zzso zzso zzso using zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso clearly demonstrates that the native zzso proteins have completely distinct zzso locations in the zzso zzso is present in a widespread zzso location similar to zzso suggesting an zzso zzso location, while zzso is observed in a discrete structure adjacent to the zzso Most interestingly, the zzso compartment also appears to divide at the same time, or just prior to, the zzso zzso early in zzso suggestive of association with structures in the zzso pocket zzso An estimate of the divergence time indicates that the zzso zzso occurred approximately 100 million years ago, and therefore, the persistence of this pair suggests an essential role in the survival of zzso zzso
