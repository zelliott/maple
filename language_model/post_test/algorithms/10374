zzso a zzso atom correspondence between two chemical compounds is important to measure molecular similarities and to find compounds with similar biological zzso This calculation can be zzso as the maximum common zzso zzso problem, which is well-studied and has been shown to be zzso Although many rigorous and zzso zzso have been developed, none of these zzso is sufficiently fast and zzso We developed a new program, called zzso using a zzso algorithm, which is a type of the greedy zzso zzso The program can search connected and disconnected zzso as well as zzso constrained disconnected zzso zzso which is introduced in this zzso To evaluate the performance of our program, we prepared two correct standards: the exact zzso generated by the maximum zzso zzso and the zzso zzso obtained from superimposed zzso structure of the molecules in a complex zzso structure with the same zzso For the five sets of molecules taken from the protein structure database, the agreement value between the zzso and the exact zzso for the connected zzso is sufficiently high, but the zzso time of the zzso zzso is much smaller than that of the exact zzso The comparison between the zzso and the zzso zzso shows that the zzso has the best agreement value among the other types of zzso Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the molecular similarity and the agreement with the correct and zzso zzso more similar zzso pairs are more correctly zzso zzso pairs with more than zzso zzso similarities can be correctly matched for more than half of the atoms with the zzso zzso
