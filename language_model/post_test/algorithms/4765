zzso of the heart is one of the major concerns during zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso treatment planning would therefore be useful but cannot always be performed for zzso breast treatments, because CT data may not be zzso However, even if zzso dose calculations are available and an estimate of the normal tissue damage can be made, uncertainties in patient positioning may significantly influence the heart dose during zzso zzso zzso reconstruction of the actual heart dose during breast cancer treatment using electronic imaging portal device zzso zzso has been zzso A previously described method to reconstruct the dose in the patient from treatment portal images at the zzso zzso was used in combination with a simple geometrical model of the zzso heart volume to enable calculation of zzso zzso zzso to independently verify this aspect of the treatment without using zzso data from a planning CT zzso To investigate the accuracy of our method, the zzso obtained with full zzso treatment planning system zzso calculations and those obtained after zzso the zzso dose in the zzso zzso were compared for zzso breast cancer patients for whom CT data were zzso In addition, zzso zzso as well as zzso dose calculations using our zzso film zzso and zzso chamber zzso were performed in an zzso zzso It was found that the dose reconstructed using zzso zzso and the dose calculated with the zzso agreed within zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso were used to estimate the normal tissue complication probability zzso for late excess cardiac zzso Although the accuracy of these zzso calculations might be limited due to the uncertainty in the zzso model, in combination with our portal zzso approach it allows incorporation of the actual heart zzso For the zzso zzso and for zzso patients for whom CT data were available to test our method, the average difference between the zzso values obtained with our method and those resulting from the dose zzso calculated with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso Most zzso values were zzso lower than those obtained using the method described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso zzso using the maximum heart distance determined from a simulator image as a single zzso zzso A similar difference between the two methods was found for twelve patients using in zzso zzso zzso the average zzso value obtained with zzso zzso was zzso whereas an average zzso value of zzso was derived using the method of zzso et zzso The results obtained in this study show that zzso zzso is well suited for in zzso zzso of the heart dose during breast cancer treatment, and can be used to estimate the zzso for late excess cardiac zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using portal zzso to calculate a zzso and zzso of an organ at zzso
