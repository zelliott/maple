When only a certain proportion of subjects respond to treatment zzso or may never experience an event of interest zzso zzso mixture models often lead to increased understanding of the treatment or disease zzso This paper focuses on hypothesis testing in a zzso framework and shows that increased power is possible by using a mixture model where both the zzso of the response rate and the response mean are linear functions of the dose zzso Three score tests are developed for testing an overall effect and zzso methods are used to control the type I zzso zzso simulations establish the power properties of the tests and show that our proposed score test has the best zzso The approach is illustrated by a zzso clinical trial of rapid acting zzso zzso
