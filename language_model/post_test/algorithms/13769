The development of new techniques in sequencing zzso acids has produced a great amount of sequence data and has led to the discovery of new zzso In this paper, we study a method for zzso the zzso zzso which detects the presence of statistically significant patterns in DNA zzso zzso zzso an efficient method to identify the presence of statistically significant zzso in a zzso group of zzso It is based on a modified version of the zzso algorithm, which is one of the fastest zzso for string matching available in the zzso The aim of the parallel version of zzso presented here is to speed up the zzso time and allow the analysis of a greater set of longer zzso zzso which is usually zzso with sequential zzso
