zzso zzso zzso by proteins of the zzso family is a unique and complex process involving physical, chemical, and zzso zzso After encounter with the zzso site of zzso the zzso is zzso trapped as a zzso complex resembling the zzso intermediate of zzso The stability of the trap is not permanent and may vary for different zzso In addition, the zzso mechanism is not zzso efficient and a fraction of the zzso may be consumed like a zzso before zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso therefore requires the measurement of three zzso the apparent second order rate constant of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the rate of complex breakdown zzso The basic kinetic methods to establish these parameters are zzso
