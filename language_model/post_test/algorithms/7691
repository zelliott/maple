Group zzso studies of the cerebral zzso benefit from accurate, zzso zzso alignment for investigating brain architecture, function and zzso There is an increasing amount of high quality data zzso However, establishing how different zzso correlate across groups remains an open research zzso One reason for this is that the current methods for zzso based on cortical zzso provide zzso alignment of some functional zzso of the zzso A more flexible framework is needed that will allow robust alignment of multiple zzso We adapt the Fast zzso zzso approach for discrete zzso Random Field zzso zzso to zzso registration by zzso the deformation labels as a discrete set of zzso and propose a novel zzso term, derived from the zzso distance between rotation zzso This zzso allows significant flexibility in the choice of similarity zzso To this end we propose a new zzso cost function based on the zzso of a zzso mutual information zzso zzso are presented for alignment driven by zzso metrics of zzso and zzso and zzso features derived from functional task zzso These experiments demonstrate the potential of this approach for improving the integration of complementary brain data sets in the zzso
