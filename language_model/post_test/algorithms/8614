This paper describes an improved spike triggered averaging technique for the assessment of control properties and zzso zzso zzso of single motor units zzso of the zzso anterior muscle during voluntary muscle zzso The method is based on the detection of zzso surface zzso signals (with linear zzso zzso and zzso recorded single zzso action zzso zzso zzso zzso were inserted in the muscle taking into account the zzso structural properties zzso zone, zzso locations, length of the zzso assessed by the linear array surface zzso detection zzso An zzso for intramuscular zzso signal decomposition is used to identify single zzso zzso The zzso detected by the intramuscular zzso decomposition zzso were used to trigger and average the zzso zzso zzso zzso of single averaged surface zzso was estimated by the use of advanced signal processing methods based on zzso recordings which allow to consistently reduce the zzso of zzso estimates compared with traditional two channel delay zzso The number of averaged zzso can thus be zzso resulting in high zzso resolution zzso zzso The developed technique was tested on recordings from the zzso anterior muscle in 11 volunteers during zzso It was shown that the method allows the assessment of single zzso zzso changes zzso as small as zzso zzso with less than 2 s data zzso The method allows reliable assessment of firing rate and zzso properties of single zzso with applications for the investigation of central and peripheral fatigue zzso
