zzso radiance, measured just above the ocean surface, contains important information about zzso or subsurface processes that occur on or below the deep ocean and coastal zzso As such, retrieving seawater inherent optical properties zzso is an important step to determining water type, subsurface light field, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the retrieval (or zzso of seawater zzso from just above water zzso zzso is a zzso zzso problem that is difficult to solve by conventional zzso zzso The zzso of the simulated zzso zzso zzso is explored as a zzso global zzso to solve this zzso retrieval zzso The zzso zzso is combined with widely known zzso relations for zzso zzso to zzso zzso these properties from simulated and measured zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, given the versatility of the zzso algorithm, the scheme is extended to retrieve water depth from input zzso zzso zzso tests and comparisons with in zzso and simulated data sets compiled by the International zzso zzso Group are zzso Field data include zzso zzso acquired with a handheld zzso 1500 zzso and zzso zzso performed with the zzso instrument on waters around zzso nearby zzso
