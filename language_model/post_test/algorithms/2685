Both multiple sequence alignment and zzso analysis are problematic in the zzso zzso of sequence similarity zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso we explore the accuracy of zzso zzso at extreme sequence divergence using a variety of simulated data zzso We evaluate four leading multiple sequence alignment zzso methods zzso zzso zzso and zzso and six commonly used programs of tree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against a novel zzso method zzso described zzso zzso at zzso zzso genetic distances zzso zzso identity and zzso gaps per zzso zzso returns high-resolution zzso that outperform traditional zzso We reason this is due to zzso capability to amplify zzso positions, even at the most extreme levels of sequence zzso We also assess the zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso deep evolutionary relationships in the divergent zzso protein zzso for which zzso zzso a more robust tree compared to zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso represents a powerful mechanism for mapping uncharted frontiers in highly divergent protein sequence data zzso
