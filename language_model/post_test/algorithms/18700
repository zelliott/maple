zzso gel zzso a routine application in zzso separates proteins according to their molecular mass zzso and zzso point zzso As the zzso sequences for more and more organisms are determined, the zzso and zzso of all their proteins can be estimated zzso The examination of several of these theoretical zzso plots has revealed a zzso zzso distribution, however, no conclusive explanation for this unusual distribution has so far been zzso We examined the zzso distribution of 115 fully zzso zzso and observed that the modal distribution does not reflect zzso or sequence evolution, but rather the chemical properties of zzso zzso We provide a statistical explanation of why the observed zzso of zzso values are zzso
