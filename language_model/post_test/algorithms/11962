We have been developing general user steered image zzso strategies for routine use in applications involving a large number of data zzso In the past, we have presented three zzso zzso live wire, live lane, and a three-dimensional zzso extension of the zzso zzso In this paper, we introduce an zzso zzso method, referred to as live wire on the fly, for further reducing user's time compared to the basic zzso zzso In live wire, zzso zzso object boundaries are segmented in a zzso zzso To segment a two-dimensional zzso boundary, the user initially picks a point on the boundary and all possible zzso paths from this point to all other points in the image are zzso via zzso zzso zzso a live wire is displayed in real time from the initial point to any subsequent position taken by the zzso If the zzso is close to the desired boundary, the live wire zzso on to the zzso The zzso is then deposited and a new zzso segment is found zzso The entire zzso boundary is specified via a set of zzso segments in this zzso A drawback of this method is that the speed of optimal path zzso depends on image zzso On modestly powered computers, for images of even modest size, some zzso appears in user interaction, which reduces the overall zzso zzso In this work, we solve this problem by exploiting some known properties of zzso to avoid unnecessary zzso path zzso during zzso In live wire on the fly, when the user selects a point on the boundary the zzso segment is zzso and displayed in real time from the selected point to any subsequent position of the zzso in the image, even for large images and even on zzso zzso Based on zzso tracing experiments from an actual medical application, we demonstrate that live wire on the fly is zzso times faster than live wire for actual zzso for varying image sizes, although the pure zzso part alone is found to be about 120 times zzso
