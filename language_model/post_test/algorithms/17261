zzso reconstruction of a section of biological tissue by electron zzso requires precise alignment of a series of two-dimensional images of the section made at numerous successive tilt zzso Gold beads on or in the section serve as zzso zzso A scheme is described that automatically detects the position of these markers and indexes them from image to zzso The resulting set of position zzso are arranged in a zzso representation of the tilt geometry and, by zzso alignment information is zzso The scheme is convenient, requires little operator time and provides an accuracy of zzso 2 zzso zzso A tilt series of zzso images can be aligned in approximately 30 zzso on any modern zzso zzso
