The zzso server and revised automatic protocols were used to predict structures for zzso zzso zzso is a publicly available protein structure prediction server zzso that uses the zzso de zzso and zzso modeling structure prediction zzso We incorporated some of the lessons learned in the zzso experiment into the server prior to participating in zzso We additionally tested new ideas that were amenable to zzso with an eye toward improving the zzso We find that the zzso server shows the greatest promise for the more challenging zzso The most significant finding from zzso that automated protocols can be roughly comparable in ability with the better zzso zzso is repeated here in zzso
