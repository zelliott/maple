zzso zzso networks, such as cell zzso differ significantly from their flexible counterparts in their deformation energy storage zzso As a result, the network elasticity is governed by both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect shows two distinct regimes of energy storage zzso the zzso and zzso zzso In the past, zzso modeling on random networks, such as the Mikado model, was used to demonstrate the physical mechanism of mechanical deformation of zzso zzso These models are zzso intensive and hence are difficult to apply to studying whole zzso In this paper, we develop a zzso model to predict the average zzso elastic properties of a random, zzso zzso zzso The model employs a unit cell consisting of four zzso chains and four equivalent zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso model represents a statistically average realization of the actual network and gives the average mechanical properties, such as the zzso zzso Comparisons between the model predictions and Mikado model results confirm that this zzso model captures the essential deformation physics revealed from previous studies on the actual network and is capable of predicting the transition between zzso and zzso zzso This model can be used to develop efficient zzso zzso models of the zzso in the zzso
