zzso state models zzso zzso master equation zzso a powerful way of modeling the structure and function of molecular systems like zzso Unfortunately, zzso with sufficiently many states to make a quantitative connection with experiments zzso tens of thousands of states even for small systems) are generally too complicated to zzso Here, I present a zzso zzso zzso engine zzso for zzso such zzso models, thereby reducing their complexity and making them more zzso An important feature of this zzso is its ability to explicitly account for statistical uncertainty in model parameters that arises from finite zzso This advance builds on a number of recent works highlighting the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the analysis of zzso and provides significant advantages over existing methods for zzso zzso state zzso The zzso expression I derive here for determining which states to merge is equivalent to the generalized zzso zzso an important measure from information theory that is related to the relative zzso zzso the method has an appealing information zzso interpretation in terms of minimizing information zzso The bottom-up nature of the zzso likely makes it particularly well suited for constructing zzso zzso I also present an extremely efficient expression for zzso model comparison that can be used to identify the most meaningful levels of the hierarchy of models from zzso
