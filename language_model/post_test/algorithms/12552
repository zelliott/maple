zzso are often faced with the challenging task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted pediatric head zzso There is currently a disparity in the anecdotal case study literature as to what kinds of injuries can occur in children from low height zzso There is also a paucity of material property data for pediatric skull and zzso at rates similar to those expected in low height zzso We tested human infant zzso year old) zzso bone and zzso from 23 zzso in zzso zzso and tension, respectively, at rates ranging from zzso zzso zzso age was found to have the largest influence on the elastic zzso and ultimate stress of zzso bone, with an increase in age increasing both material zzso In adults, zzso bone and zzso have similar properties and the adult zzso zzso very little prior to zzso In contrast, pediatric zzso bone is 35 times stiffer than pediatric zzso zzso In addition, pediatric zzso zzso zzso 30 times more before failure than pediatric zzso bone and 243 times more than adult zzso zzso The large strains in the pediatric bone and zzso result in a zzso that can undergo dramatic shape changes before zzso potentially causing substantial deformation in the zzso The zzso difference between pediatric bone and zzso material properties also underscores the crucial role that zzso play in the unique response of the pediatric head to impact in low height zzso These data provide necessary information to enhance our understanding of mechanisms of head injury in young zzso
