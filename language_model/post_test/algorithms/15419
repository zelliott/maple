The role of tumor necrosis factor zzso and its receptors after traumatic brain injury zzso remains zzso We evaluated the effects of genetic deletion of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso on zzso outcome, zzso DNA damage and zzso cell zzso gene expression zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and knockout mice after zzso Injured zzso zzso mice showed a significant zzso while zzso zzso mice showed a significant worsening of zzso deficits compared with zzso mice over 4 weeks zzso At the same time point, zzso volume in zzso zzso mice zzso was significantly reduced compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice zzso At zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso mice and was associated with reduced DNA damage terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso reduced zzso expression and increased zzso expression at zzso zzso in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso mice, indicative of a protective zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may exacerbate zzso deficits and tissue damage via zzso zzso zzso whose zzso may represent a specific therapeutic target after zzso
