A strategy for simultaneous study of the structure and internal dynamics of a membrane protein is described using the zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso major coat protein zzso was used as an zzso First, synthetic data is zzso to validate the simultaneous study of structure and dynamics with zzso using zzso restraints and backbone zzso zzso from two different zzso zzso the validated analysis is applied to experimental data and confirms that zzso produces meaningful structures from sparse zzso zzso Furthermore, simulated data from a two-state jump motion is used to illustrate the necessity for simultaneous consideration of structure and zzso zzso internal dynamics during the course of structure determination is shown to produce an zzso that is not related to the two intermediate zzso During the analysis of zzso data from the dynamic model, zzso appropriately identifies the region separating the zzso and dynamic zzso of the zzso Finally, analysis of experimental data strongly suggests the existence of internal motion between the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso form of the zzso The ability to perform fragmented structure determination of each domain without a zzso assumption of the order zzso allows an independent determination of the order zzso which yields a more comprehensive description of protein structure and dynamics and is particularly relevant to the study of membrane zzso
