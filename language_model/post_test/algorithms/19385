A zzso control design for some zzso systems is zzso The design approach is to approximate the zzso systems with neural networks of which the zzso functions satisfy the sector zzso A novel neural network model termed standard neural network model zzso is advanced for describing this class of zzso neural zzso zzso dynamic output feedback control laws are then designed for the zzso with zzso and zzso to stabilize the zzso zzso The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear zzso zzso zzso which can be easily solved by various convex zzso zzso to determine the control zzso It is shown that most zzso zzso systems can be transformed into zzso zzso to be stabilization zzso in a unified zzso Finally, some application examples are presented to illustrate the control design zzso
