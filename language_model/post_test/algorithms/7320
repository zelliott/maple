3-D zzso index zzso distribution is an intrinsic zzso for the chemical and structural information about biological zzso Here we develop an optical zzso zzso technique for the real-time reconstruction of 3-D zzso distribution, employing sparse angle zzso and a graphic processing unit zzso zzso The execution time for the zzso reconstruction is zzso s for zzso zzso which is 17 times faster than that of a conventional zzso We demonstrated the real-time zzso capability with imaging the dynamics of zzso motion of an zzso zzso zzso and the dynamic shape change in a red blood cell upon zzso zzso
