zzso images of the zzso zzso sequence are acquired, based on a new zzso of the inverse problem of zzso in terms of the critical points of the zzso surface zzso zzso It is shown that the method is stable with respect to substantial amounts of correlated noise common in the zzso and modeling of zzso and that problems associated with conventional zzso techniques can be zzso Examples of application of the method to measured human data are zzso This first invasive validation of results compares well to previously published results obtained by using a standard zzso The method can provide additional constraints on, and thus improve, traditional methods aimed at solving the inverse problem of zzso
