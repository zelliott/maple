In this paper we consider the zzso and power of some commonly used statistics for assessing the degree of zzso between trials in a zzso We show, using simulated individual patient data typical of that occurring in zzso controlled trials in pain, that the most commonly used statistics do not give the expected levels of statistical significance zzso the proportion of trials giving a significant result is not equal to the proportion expected due to random zzso when used with truly homogeneous zzso In addition, all such statistics are shown to have extremely low power to detect true zzso even when that zzso is very zzso zzso in most practical situations, failure to detect zzso does not allow us to say with any helpful degree of certainty that the data is truly zzso we advocate the quantitative combination of results only where the trials contained in a zzso can be shown to be clinically zzso We propose as a definition of clinical zzso that all trials have zzso fixed and clearly defined inclusion criteria and zzso fixed and clearly defined outcomes or outcome zzso In pain relief, for example, the first of these would be satisfied by all patients having moderate or severe pain, whilst the second would be satisfied by using at least 50% pain relief as the successful outcome zzso
