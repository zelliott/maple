The reduction of tidal volume during mechanical ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but zzso cell injury can still result from mechanical stresses imposed by the opening of zzso zzso To study these zzso a zzso zzso flow chamber lined with zzso cells was used as an idealized model of an zzso zzso zzso reopening was modeled by the progression of a zzso bubble of air through the length of the channel, which cleared the zzso In our zzso prior study, the magnitude of the pressure zzso near the bubble tip was directly correlated to the zzso cell layer damage zzso zzso Dee zzso and zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in that study, it was not possible to discriminate the stress magnitude from the stimulus duration because the bubble propagation zzso varied between zzso In the present study, the stress magnitude is modified by varying the zzso of the zzso fluid while fixing the reopening zzso across zzso This approach causes the stimulus duration to be zzso related to the magnitude of the pressure zzso Nevertheless, cell damage remains directly correlated with the pressure zzso not the duration of stress zzso The present study thus provides additional evidence that the magnitude of the pressure zzso zzso cellular damage in this model of airway zzso We explore the mechanism for acute damage and also demonstrate that repeated reopening and closure is shown to damage the zzso cell layer, even under conditions that would not lead to extensive damage from a single reopening zzso
