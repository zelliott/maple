The objective of this paper was to develop a zzso framework to explicitly incorporate the factors controlling the zzso zzso and mode of action to enhance zzso ability of zzso zzso toxicity to protect the health of farmed zzso zzso zzso We linked the zzso zzso model and damage assessment model to develop a zzso model for zzso the zzso zzso changes of As zzso and to characterize how the fish regulate the metal zzso We built a zzso of zzso growth toxicity model by linking a zzso growth model and damage assessment model to predict how the As affects on the zzso growth in the entire life span in zzso field zzso Here we show that the proposed model well describes the zzso zzso and zzso variations of As to zzso We selected two local zzso farms with different water zzso located at southwestern Taiwan coast region to implement the proposed zzso to predict the risk of As zzso zzso indicate that the growth toxicity of zzso zzso in zzso is more sensitive than that in zzso We found that the effect of zzso competition on the As zzso and their zzso effects on zzso are more obvious in zzso comparing with that in zzso We suggested that the proposed zzso and mode of zzso framework can be used to capture the biological response and regulation of zzso to As zzso It is zzso for a zzso and long-term zzso risk zzso
