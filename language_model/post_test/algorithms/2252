To estimate regional cerebral blood flow zzso and distribution volume zzso using zzso zzso and two zzso data zzso and delayed zzso measured at two discrete time points, three fast zzso are zzso which are the table zzso method zzso the linear zzso fitting method zzso and the linear search method zzso A zzso model was used as the zzso kinetic zzso These zzso were applied to the early and delayed data measured by the two scan zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso 85 zzso zzso zzso The estimated zzso and zzso values using the present three zzso were in good agreement with those using the zzso zzso fitting technique and dynamic zzso zzso The quantitative value and signal to noise zzso ratio of zzso images by zzso was not changed whether scan A or scan B was zzso However, the zzso of the zzso image by zzso using scan B improved over that using scan zzso The same tendency was observed in the results of zzso and zzso The CPU times for the zzso imaging of zzso and zzso images for one slice zzso zzso 64 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso s using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the present three zzso gave reasonably accurate estimates of zzso and zzso using two zzso data, and are well suited for zzso imaging because of their good statistical properties and high zzso zzso
