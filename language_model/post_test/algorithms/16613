To integrate data from two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso imaging zzso for prediction of left zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso after cardiac zzso therapy zzso It was also compared the evaluation of cardiac zzso by TDI and zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with heart failure, zzso rhythm, zzso zzso 120 zzso functional class III or IV and zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso ECHO with zzso zzso index zzso analysis, and TDI were performed before, 3 and 6 months after zzso zzso zzso analyses by TDI and zzso were compared with the zzso correlation zzso Before zzso a zzso analysis of baseline characteristics was performed for the construction of a zzso zzso model to identify the best zzso of zzso 

After 3 months of zzso there was a moderate correlation between TDI and zzso zzso zzso zzso At other time points, there was no strong zzso Nine of zzso zzso patients presented with zzso 6 months after zzso After zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso was the only independent factor in the prediction of zzso 6 months of zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso After construction of receiver operator characteristic zzso curves, an equation was established to predict zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso with zzso presenting values zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso 

In this study, there was no strong correlation between TDI and zzso An equation is proposed for the prediction of zzso after zzso Although larger trials are needed to validate these findings, this equation may be useful to candidates for zzso
