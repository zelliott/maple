To assess the effect of three-dimensional zzso zzso image zzso of zzso zzso zzso chest scans on zzso detection zzso of solid lung zzso greater than 4 zzso in zzso 

A total of 120 cases, acquired with zzso zzso were collected from 5 different sites, of which zzso were zzso zzso Two chest zzso established that 37 cases had no zzso lung zzso the remaining 83 cases contained 169 zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All cases were compressed using the zzso Set zzso in zzso Trees zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A study of the effect of zzso on zzso detection zzso sensitivity was performed at operating points of zzso false marks zzso 5 zzso and 10 zzso per case using zzso zzso zzso zzso models were used to evaluate the impact on zzso sensitivity by zzso level on zzso and image zzso 

Compared with no zzso there was no significant degradation in zzso sensitivity found at any of the studied zzso levels and operating zzso However, between zzso levels, there was marginal association with zzso Specifically, zzso level was significantly better than zzso at all operating points, and occasionally better than no zzso at 10 zzso Based on zzso analysis, zzso location was found to be a significant predictor zzso zzso zzso with a lower sensitivity associated with zzso zzso zzso size, dose, reconstruction zzso and contrast medium were not significant zzso 

zzso detection performance of solid lung zzso did not suffer until zzso zzso
