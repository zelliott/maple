zzso cuff tears disrupt the force balance in the shoulder and the zzso joint in particular, resulting in compromised arm zzso zzso The zzso between zzso zzso and zzso stability is not yet zzso We zzso that compensation of lost abduction zzso will lead to a superior zzso of the reaction force zzso onto the zzso surface, which will require additional muscle forces to maintain zzso zzso Muscle forces in a single arm position for five combinations of simulated cuff tears were estimated by inverse dynamic simulation zzso zzso and zzso zzso and compared with muscle forces in the zzso zzso Each cuff tear condition was simulated both without and with an active modeling constraint for zzso stability, which was defined as the condition in which the zzso reaction force zzso the zzso zzso For the simulated position an isolated tear of the zzso only increased the effort of the other muscles with zzso and did not introduce zzso For massive cuff tears beyond the zzso instability became a prominent zzso the zzso were not able to fully compensate lost net abduction zzso without introducing zzso forces; zzso zzso muscles zzso in the simulated position the zzso and the biceps zzso remain to compensate the necessary abduction zzso the zzso minor appeared to be of vital importance to maintain zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso is essential to preserve zzso zzso
