Muscle size in the lower limb is commonly assessed in zzso research as it zzso with muscle function and some approaches have been assessed for their ability to provide valid estimates of muscle zzso Work to date has not examined the ability of different measurement approaches (such as zzso area zzso measures on magnetic resonance zzso zzso to accurately track changes in muscle volume as a result of an intervention, such as exercise, injury or zzso Here we assess whether zzso the percentage change in muscle zzso in 17 zzso muscles during 56 days zzso as assessed by five different zzso lies within zzso of the muscle volume change and zzso the zzso of the outcome measure is comparable to that of muscle zzso We find that an approach selecting the MR image with the highest muscle zzso and then a series of zzso measures, the number of which depended upon the muscle considered, immediately zzso and zzso provided an acceptable estimate of the muscle volume zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso muscle groups, accurate results can be attained by increasing the spacing between zzso measures, thus reducing the total number of MR images and hence the measurement zzso In the two heads of biceps zzso zzso and zzso it is not possible to reduce the number of zzso measures and the entire muscle volume must be zzso Using these approaches one can reduce the number of zzso measures required to estimate changes in muscle volume by zzso These findings help to attain more efficient means to track muscle volume changes in zzso zzso
