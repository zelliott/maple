Experimental patterns of zzso cell proliferation in the prostate suggest that cell movement may play an important role in prostate zzso zzso and genes known to regulate cell movement are commonly zzso or deleted in prostate zzso However, the nature of cell movement within the prostate zzso remains zzso Here, the role of cellular movement in the prostate zzso was explored by developing an zzso model of the prostate zzso zzso adult stem cells, transit zzso cells zzso and zzso cells were individually modeled within a three-dimensional reconstruction of a prostate zzso Different movement behaviors for zzso and zzso cells were assessed by their ability to recreate experimental patterns of prostate cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso directed zzso movement toward the zzso region of the prostate duct combined with zzso directed zzso cell movement toward the zzso region of the prostate duct was able to best recreate experimental patterns of prostate proliferation and zzso The effects on cell mobility from abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes which are commonly altered in prostate cancer, were simulated in the zzso These simulations show that altering prostate stem cell movement can zzso zzso zzso and lead to excessive cell growth, suggesting that disruption of cell movement may contribute to prostate zzso
