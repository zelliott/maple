The determination of the spectral distribution of an zzso beam from zzso zzso in a narrow beam has aroused great interest since it was first proposed by Silberstein in zzso Since then, it has become clear that this is an zzso zzso Then, due to the intrinsic difficulties of the problem, care has been taken to improve the mathematical and zzso inversion zzso Alternative ways to circumvent the explicit inversion by using the zzso curve itself to calculate directly generalized moments of the solution have also been zzso In this work, the explicit reconstruction of the spectral distribution is carried out by an zzso method that zzso the a zzso condition of zzso of the solution and allows us to impose the zzso of its support easily, conditions which are known to be fulfilled by physically acceptable zzso The simulations made and the experimental validation of the proposed method allow us to prove its scope and zzso
