zzso is an essential downstream processing step in the production of zzso Here we present an approach to zzso zzso using zzso zzso integrated with general rate zzso This type of zzso takes account all contributions to the mass transfer zzso providing process zzso The model is zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso column and used to predict zzso for 20 zzso height columns from 40 zzso to 160 L zzso zzso were found to be in good agreement with experimental zzso The zzso approach could potentially reduce the number of experiments, shorten development time and reduce zzso
