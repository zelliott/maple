zzso of protein functional sites from zzso data remains an open zzso zzso We have developed a zzso motif zzso functional site prediction approach that identifies functional sites from alignment fragments that parallel the evolutionary patterns of the zzso In our approach, zzso are identified by comparing tree zzso of each alignment zzso to that of the complete zzso zzso we bypass the zzso reconstruction step and identify zzso directly from distance zzso zzso In order to zzso the new algorithm, we consider three different distance zzso and 13 different zzso similarity zzso We assess the performance of the various approaches on a structurally zzso data set that includes three types of functional site zzso Without exception, the zzso power of the original approach zzso the distance zzso zzso While the distance zzso methods fail to improve upon the original approach, our results are important because they clearly demonstrate that the improved zzso power is based on the zzso zzso Meaning that zzso trees are a straightforward, yet powerful way to improve functional site prediction zzso While complementary studies have shown that zzso improves predictions of zzso zzso this report represents the first demonstration that trees improve functional site predictions as zzso
