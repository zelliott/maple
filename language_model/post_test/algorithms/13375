Over the past decade, zzso and zzso enrichment analysis has evolved into the study of zzso functional zzso zzso to poorly zzso and incomplete zzso data, researchers have begun to combine zzso and zzso enrichment analysis as well as network zzso approaches to identify crucial relationships between different molecular zzso 

To meet the new challenge of molecular zzso discovery, in this work, we have developed an integrated online database, the zzso And Gene zzso Database zzso to enable comprehensive searches for zzso zzso gene signatures, zzso targets, and network zzso by zzso zzso prior knowledge as molecular patterns from multiple zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The online database we developed, zzso zzso is by far the most comprehensive public compilation of gene zzso In its current release, zzso contains a total of zzso gene sets, zzso zzso 20 organisms, and zzso records from five major zzso Beyond its size, the advantage of zzso lies in the explorations of relationships between gene sets as zzso association networks zzso Using zzso cancer expression data analysis as a case study, we demonstrate how to query this database resource to discover crucial zzso gene signatures, and gene network zzso specific to zzso cancer functional zzso 

This integrated online database lays a foundation for developing tools beyond third-generation zzso analysis approaches on for discovering molecular zzso especially for zzso zzso enrichment zzso
