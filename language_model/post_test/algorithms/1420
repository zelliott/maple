This work investigates the influence of environmental zzso on the organization of cell regulation networks, using a zzso zzso zzso interactions are modeled by an zzso zzso network, the units of which take continuous zzso In contrast to classical models, we explicitly introduce a zzso to zzso the architecture of the zzso This feature enables us to introduce an evolution model, in which a genetic zzso that mimics the effects of evolution on proteins mutual interactions is zzso We assume an efficient system to respond to persistent environmental zzso independently of their zzso zzso are presented that show a zzso of the network with the emergence of specialized zzso zzso These structures seem to drive the system at the edge of chaos, so that it can present adapted responses to significant environmental zzso
