Free metal zzso in zzso and zzso systems strongly influence zzso and zzso Most zzso techniques determine the total metal zzso including the metal zzso bound by dissolved organic zzso Ion activity can be measured with zzso zzso zzso for some metals, but an zzso for zzso is not commercially zzso As a result, very few data are available on zzso binding by natural dissolved organic zzso The aim of this study is to determine free zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid solutions using the recently developed zzso membrane zzso However, several zzso aspects of the zzso membrane technique had to be clarified before reliable data could be zzso zzso was chosen for zzso This study shows that free zzso zzso as measured by the zzso membrane technique agreed well with zzso zzso zzso It is also shown that the zzso membrane technique could be used at high zzso The zzso membrane technique provided consistent results in a range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at pH 4, 6, and zzso Metal zzso in zzso acid solutions was also calculated with the consistent zzso model using generic zzso The model could zzso describe the experimental data without adjusting any of the parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
