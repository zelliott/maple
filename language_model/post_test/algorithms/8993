zzso skeletal muscle zzso forces using surface zzso zzso signals poses many zzso In general, the zzso zzso are based on single sensor zzso In this paper, two novel hybrid fusion techniques for zzso the skeletal muscle force from the zzso array sensors are zzso The zzso signals are zzso using five different zzso zzso zzso Type II, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Dynamic models are extracted from the acquired data using zzso Wiener Hammerstein zzso models and zzso Analysis zzso zzso Resolution zzso models based system identification zzso A detailed comparison is provided for the proposed filters and models using 18 healthy zzso zzso zzso give higher mean correlation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso models, respectively, when compared to the other filters used in this zzso Experimental zzso of the fusion based hybrid models with zzso transform shows a zzso mean correlation and zzso mean relative error with a standard zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively between the overall hybrid fusion zzso estimated and the actual force for 18 test subjects' zzso cross validation zzso
