There are numerous studies on population zzso of zzso in adult zzso However, there is no such research for Chinese adult zzso This study was conducted to evaluate the zzso performance of reported population zzso models of zzso in Chinese adult patients and to identify some models appropriate for our zzso 

A literature search was conducted in zzso to obtain the population zzso models of zzso published between December 2010 and September zzso The models were assessed using concentration data collected from Chinese patients for external zzso Models with relatively poor predictability were excluded from further zzso The performance of the remaining models was evaluated in patients with different levels of zzso zzso age, body weight and sex by zzso zzso This method was also used to compare the zzso performance based on peak concentration and trough concentration and the predictability based on different number of observed zzso 

One hundred and zzso blood zzso from 72 Chinese adult patients were collected zzso to serve as the test data zzso The evaluated models included all those reported in the seven publications reviewed by zzso et zzso and three other studies published after December zzso Three models with poor performance on external validation were excluded from the next zzso zzso The distribution of zzso in the model building data set had an important effect on zzso The predictability based on zzso concentration was similar among the evaluated models, and no significant difference was found using our data set except for zzso zzso As expected, an increased number of samples improved the performance of the zzso zzso 

With our data set, the performance of the evaluated models zzso The characteristics of the patient population and distribution of zzso should be given more consideration when choosing a model to predict blood zzso The model developed by zzso et zzso using a data set from patients similar to ours is appropriate for zzso dose predictions for zzso zzso in our population of Chinese adult zzso
