Low zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso bypass zzso is associated with higher mortality and other adverse zzso More zzso low zzso is encountered in patients with small body size and women zzso This prompted us to take an aggressive approach in our care of these patients, involving a strategy for predicting patients at risk of low zzso with the aid of an electronic zzso that accurately predicts zzso zzso and two prevention zzso use of a zzso zzso circuit zzso for all adult patients with a body surface area zzso zzso zzso zzso and use of zzso circuit zzso zzso in addition to the zzso volume in some zzso The two zzso of patients in whom these techniques were employed were compared to a group matched for body size where our standard adult circuit zzso was zzso There were 233 patients in the standard group, 139 in the LP group, and 68 in the zzso zzso The zzso circuit prime volume was zzso zzso for the zzso group and 1,110 zzso for the LP zzso Use of zzso zzso techniques further reduced the prime volume by zzso zzso 139 zzso The zzso of low zzso zzso during zzso was thus reduced from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso when using both techniques together without increasing red blood cell zzso zzso These changes in zzso management resulted in a reduction in the zzso of zzso complications zzso zzso zzso LP zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
