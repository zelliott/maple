A data set of 77 zzso zzso gene pairs has been compiled from the zzso zzso database, and their corresponding features zzso This set was used to analyze the degree of conservation of zzso sequences between mouse and zzso A new alignment zzso was developed to cope with the fact that large parts of zzso sequences are not zzso in a meaningful way because of genetic zzso This new algorithm, DNA Block zzso zzso finds zzso blocks that are flanked by zzso sequences of varying zzso The zzso regions of the data set were aligned with zzso The proportion of the zzso regions covered by blocks zzso identical was zzso for upstream regions, 50% for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for 3' zzso These blocks of high identity were more or less evenly distributed across the length of the features, except for upstream regions in which the first 100 zzso upstream of the zzso start site was covered in up to zzso of the gene zzso This data set zzso earlier sets on the basis of zzso sequences and will be useful for further comparative zzso zzso paper contains supplementary data that can be found at zzso zzso
