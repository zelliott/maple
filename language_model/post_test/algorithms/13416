Several popular methods for zzso zzso (or zzso zzso are based on a zzso of zzso distances between zzso (or any kind of zzso The objective is to construct a tree with branch lengths so that the distances between the leaves in that tree are as close as possible to the input zzso If we hold the structure zzso of the tree zzso in some relevant cases zzso ordinary least zzso the optimal values for the branch lengths can be expressed using simple zzso zzso Here we define a general form for these zzso and show that they all have two desirable zzso First, the common tree reconstruction approaches (least squares, minimum zzso when used in combination with these zzso are guaranteed to zzso the correct tree when given enough data zzso second, the branch lengths of all the simple zzso neighbor zzso zzso of a tree can be zzso zzso in zzso time in the size of the tree, thus allowing the efficient application of hill climbing zzso The study presented here is a continuation of that by zzso and zzso on branch length zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso The focus here is on the zzso of the tree itself and on providing a basis for novel zzso to reconstruct trees from zzso
