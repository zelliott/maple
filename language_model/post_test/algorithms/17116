We describe two zzso experiments testing predictions of the square difference mechanism we have previously proposed for zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso the relative contributions of disparity and contrast to zzso stereo by measuring detection zzso The product of disparity and contrast at threshold is shown to be zzso In experiment 2, we measure zzso the global depth position perceived in zzso of zzso smoothly shaded zzso The results show that disparity averaging over the surface involves a zzso weighting zzso The results from both experiments are consistent with predictions derived from the square difference zzso The relation of this mechanism to feature correspondence zzso and zzso is discussed and a general framework for assessing the zzso of zzso is zzso
