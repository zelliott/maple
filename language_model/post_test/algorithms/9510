For zzso zzso imaging, prior knowledge about the spatial support of an zzso object can be exploited in two zzso We can shrink the spatial field of view zzso to closely wrap the object in a sphere or reduce the sweep zzso in a projection dependent zzso Use of a smaller spatial zzso with the same number of samples enhances spatial resolution by reducing zzso volume at the expense of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso We have developed another approach to define sweep zzso that zzso away the portions of the projection sweep with no zzso This reduces data acquisition time for the continuous wave zzso zzso image zzso to the sweep zzso zzso This method also avoids zzso volume zzso Using the zzso method, we decreased the data acquisition time by zzso maintaining spatial and zzso zzso
