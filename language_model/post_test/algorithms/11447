We have developed an imaging system to extract high contrast images from different layers of biological zzso zzso a digital holographic approach, the system works without scanning through layers of the zzso In zzso zzso scattered light has the main contribution in image formation, but in the case of coherent zzso this creates a strong zzso noise that reduces the image zzso To remove this zzso the zzso has been illuminated with various zzso and a zzso has been recorded for each zzso Each zzso has been analyzed separately and the corresponding intensity image has been zzso The final image has been derived by averaging over the reconstructed zzso A correlation approach has been zzso to determine the number of zzso required to achieve a desired contrast and image zzso The reconstructed intensity images in different object layers are shown for different sea zzso zzso Two multimedia files are attached to illustrate the process of digital zzso
