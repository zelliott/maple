The decision of individuals to engage in public avoidance during zzso is modeled and studied using game zzso The analysis reveals that the set of Nash zzso of the model, as well as how the zzso compare to the social zzso depend on the contact function that zzso the rate at which encounters occur in zzso If the contact ratio - defined to be the ratio of the contact rate to the number of people out in public - is increasing with the number of people out in public, then there exists a unique Nash zzso Moreover, in zzso the amount of public avoidance is too low with respect to social zzso On the other hand, if the contact ratio is decreasing in the number of people out in public, then there can be multiple Nash zzso none of which is in general socially zzso Furthermore, the amount of public avoidance in equilibrium with a decreasing contact ratio is too high in that social welfare can be increased if more susceptible individuals choose to go out in zzso In the special case where the contact ratio does not vary with the number of people out in public, there is a unique Nash zzso and it is also the socially optimal zzso
