zzso spreading depression zzso is a zzso phenomenon, which zzso some neurological disorders, such as migraine and stroke, but its mechanisms are still not completely zzso One of the striking facts is that the zzso evolution of zzso wave is zzso Observations in experiments reveal that a zzso wave may zzso through the entire cortex, or just bypass some areas of the zzso In this paper, we have applied a zzso zzso equation with recovery term to study the zzso evolution of zzso By modulating the recovery rate from zzso in the modeled cortex, zzso waves with different zzso zzso either bypassing some areas or zzso slowly in these areas, were zzso Moreover, spiral zzso waves could also be induced in case of the zzso altered recovery rate, zzso block release from the absolute zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso period contributes to the different propagation patterns of zzso which may help to interpret the mechanisms of zzso zzso
