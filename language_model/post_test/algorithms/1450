We evaluated the significance of zzso zzso zzso detected by computerized zzso zzso of low stage zzso germ cell tumor zzso 

A blind retrospective review of 143 zzso of low stage zzso germ cell tumor revealed pathological stage A disease on 89 zzso and pathological stage B disease on 54 zzso A zzso zzso zzso model was used to evaluate the relationships between diameter of the zzso zzso detected in these zzso and pathological zzso 

Based on this model, as the diameter of the zzso increased within a 0 to 25 zzso range, the likelihood of pathological stage B disease increased in a continuous zzso Using a 3 zzso threshold to define zzso zzso the sensitivity and negative zzso value of CT based staging was zzso 

This measurement scheme improves the accuracy of staging compared to conventional zzso
