To assess the efficacy and zzso of motion zzso driven equilibrium zzso for blood suppression in zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso 

To investigate the efficacy of zzso on blood suppression and zzso zzso ratio zzso loss on different imaging zzso seven healthy adult subjects were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso after zzso of zzso parameters in a pilot study of five zzso Imaging artifacts, zzso and blood zzso were zzso zzso the feasibility of zzso spatial resolution zzso zzso was assessed in six zzso Finally, 15 patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease were recruited to be zzso using a conventional zzso zzso double inversion recovery zzso zzso imaging sequence and a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso yielded significant blood suppression zzso enabling a zzso zzso zzso assessment of the whole heart with significantly improved zzso of the chamber zzso The zzso also allowed successful acquisition of zzso images with zzso spatial zzso In the patient study, zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in similar blood suppression in left zzso and right zzso walls but the zzso had superior zzso signal and wall zzso 

zzso allows zzso zzso imaging of the zzso
