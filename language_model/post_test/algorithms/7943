zzso metallic zzso were implanted in zzso zzso obtaining zzso metallic zzso zzso after a proper zzso zzso These zzso were then zzso by zzso with zzso zzso obtaining an zzso metallic zzso An average large zzso of zzso was measured for these materials in the zzso zzso zzso Besides, their third order zzso optical response was measured using zzso and zzso techniques at zzso zzso with 26 zzso zzso By adjusting the incident light's polarization and the angular position of the zzso the zzso could be directly related to, at least, two of the three linear independent components of its third order zzso zzso finding a large, but zzso response of around zzso zzso with respect to other zzso metallic zzso For the zzso optical zzso we were able to shift from zzso to reverse zzso zzso depending on probing the zzso zzso major or minor zzso zzso This fact could be related to local field calculations and zzso electronic zzso For the zzso optical zzso we passed from zzso to zzso when changing from zzso to zzso
