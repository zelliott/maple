We present a new method for the interactive rendering of zzso using ray casting on zzso zzso This method consists of a combination of an zzso zzso that zzso identifies possible candidate zzso data blocks for each small set of zzso zzso and an zzso ray casting strategy tailored for the resulting zzso lists of candidate zzso data zzso While zzso screen zzso is widely used in the literature, our scheme performs dynamic allocation of groups of ray casting tasks to ensure almost equal loads among the different threads running on zzso while maintaining spatial zzso We also make careful use of memory management environment commonly present in zzso zzso We test our system on a zzso zzso platform, each consisting of a zzso zzso Intel zzso zzso for a number of widely different zzso The detailed experimental results show that our system is efficient and zzso and achieves high zzso performance and excellent load zzso resulting in an overall performance that is superior to any of the previous zzso In fact, we achieve an interactive zzso rendering on a zzso screen for all the zzso tested up to the maximum size of the main memory of our zzso
