zzso zzso is a finite and dwindling zzso Debate focuses on current production and use of zzso rock rather than on the amounts of P required in the future to feed the zzso We applied a zzso soil P model to reproduce historical zzso crop P zzso as a function of P zzso from fertilizer and zzso and to estimate P requirements for crop production in zzso The key feature is the consideration of the role of residual soil P in crop zzso Model simulations closely fit historical P zzso for all zzso zzso zzso of P fertilizer and zzso for the period zzso in Europe zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso exceeded the cumulative P zzso by crops zzso zzso zzso Since the 1980s in much of Europe, P application rates have been reduced, and zzso continues to increase due to the supply of zzso P from residual soil P zzso We estimate that between 2008 and zzso a global cumulative P application of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cropland (in total zzso zzso P) is required to achieve crop production according to the various Millennium zzso Assessment scenarios zzso J, Van zzso D, Cramer W zzso zzso and Human zzso zzso zzso 2, pp zzso We estimate that average global P fertilizer use must change from the current zzso to zzso zzso per year in zzso which is up to 50% less than other estimates in the literature that ignore the role of residual soil zzso
