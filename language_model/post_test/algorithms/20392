We propose methods to construct zzso gene maps while controlling the probability of a zzso First, a single step gene ordering procedure is presented whose zzso probability is bounded above by a zzso zzso The bound for the error probability is valid under quite general zzso The ordering procedure is optimal in the sense of having zzso zzso probability of correct ordering among all procedures subject to the same bound on the error zzso Second, to reduce the number of hypotheses to be tested, a zzso ordering procedure is zzso A zzso Carlo simulation study demonstrated the integrity of the proposed error bound for the zzso procedure under a wide variety of situations, including data coming from different laboratories and marker typing zzso The zzso procedure was applied to version 2 of the public database maintained by the Cooperative Human zzso Center and maps of the 23 zzso were generated such that the probability that the order of the markers in a given zzso is incorrect is less than zzso
