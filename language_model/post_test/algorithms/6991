zzso zzso is a useful tool for the analysis of zzso Their charge depends on the pH of the buffer system zzso An equation is developed for calculation the partial charge of acids with more than one zzso constant in dependence on the pH and the zzso strength of the zzso There is no limitation to the number of zzso zzso The partial charges and from these the relative mobility according to zzso were calculated for 4 zzso They agree very well with the experimental zzso zzso
