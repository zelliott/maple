For the reconstruction of the coronary arteries from zzso zzso data, a crucial point is the selection of the optimal cardiac phase for data zzso To avoid time-consuming interactive selection of the optimal cardiac phase by visual inspection of multiple high-resolution data sets reconstructed at different cardiac zzso an automatic approach for zzso optimal reconstruction windows is zzso 

This paper presents a new approach to fully automatic selection of the optimal cardiac phase for image zzso It is based on the analysis of a zzso data set of the region of interest reconstructed at zzso resolution utilizing an image quality index, which zzso the image quality of a single three-dimensional reconstructed zzso The derived image quality index zzso the zzso information of a single zzso snapshot as a quality measure for the vessel zzso The proposed technique was applied to 16 projection data sets obtained in eight zzso 

zzso to evaluate the proposed method based on zzso image quality parameters serving as ground truth, showed a relatively high correlation zzso for high-quality zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso technique is introduced, which is able to determine the optimal cardiac phase for zzso fully zzso The proposed method was successfully applied to 16 data sets obtained in a total of 8 zzso zzso
