For many complex disorders, genetically relevant disease definition is still zzso For this reason, researchers tend to collect large numbers of items related directly or indirectly to the disease zzso Since the measured traits may not be all influenced by genetic factors, researchers are faced with the problem of choosing which traits or combinations of traits to consider in linkage zzso To combine items, one can subject the data to a principal component zzso However, when family date are collected, principal component analysis does not take family structure into zzso In order to deal with these issues, zzso & zzso (1999) introduced the principal components of zzso zzso which capture the familial information across traits by calculating linear combinations of traits that maximize zzso The calculation of the zzso is based on the zzso of the genetic and the environmental components of zzso In the genetic context, the standard zzso of the zzso components are zzso maximum likelihood zzso which require complex zzso zzso The objectives of this paper are the zzso zzso to review some standard strategies available in the literature to estimate zzso components for unbalanced data in mixed zzso zzso to propose an zzso method for a genetic random effect model to estimate the zzso zzso which can be applied to general zzso and high zzso family data within the zzso zzso zzso to zzso the connection between zzso analysis and Linear zzso zzso We use computer simulations to show that the proposed method has similar zzso properties as zzso method when the number of traits is small, and we study the efficiency of our method when the number of traits is zzso A data analysis involving schizophrenia and bipolar quantitative traits is finally presented to illustrate the zzso zzso
