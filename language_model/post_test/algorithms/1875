zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso incorporated with zzso and/or zzso recognizes and interacts with specific zzso and faithfully zzso the proper cell cycle events by targeting proteins for zzso zzso Experimental identification of zzso zzso is largely dependent on the discovery of zzso recognition zzso zzso the zzso and zzso Although a number of either stringent or loosely defined motifs proposed, these motif patterns are only of limited use due to their insufficient powers of zzso We report the development of a novel zzso software package which is useful for the prediction of zzso and zzso in zzso Using zzso identified zzso and zzso as the training data sets, a previously developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso By extensive evaluation and comparison, the zzso performance was found to be much better than the one using simple zzso With this powerful zzso we predicted zzso potential zzso in zzso proteins and zzso potential zzso in zzso proteins from zzso zzso while further statistical analysis suggested that both the zzso and zzso proteins are involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes beyond the cell zzso In addition, with the zzso information, we predicted hundreds of zzso zzso zzso with high zzso As the first zzso tool for the prediction of zzso degradation, zzso is a useful tool for information to be used in further experimental zzso The zzso is freely accessible for academic researchers at: zzso
