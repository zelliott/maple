Novel optical alignment techniques to perform precise alignment of a typical zzso zzso optical system are presented in this zzso These techniques use optical zzso matched zzso which were designed using a simple, efficient zzso zzso algorithm, known as direct zzso zzso Three alignment challenges are zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first two alignments were performed using the optical zzso matched filtering technique, and the last one was performed using a new optical zzso Experimental results of the new alignment techniques and a simple optical pattern recognition problem to demonstrate the benefits of the new alignment techniques are also zzso Two zzso zzso addressed spatial light zzso zzso zzso 128 zzso and one zzso zzso is 80 zzso were used to represent the input and filter zzso The results clearly show that the new alignment techniques allow the zzso system to be aligned to a precision of 80 zzso in the zzso direction and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
