In the present zzso we have demonstrated the simultaneous removal of sodium and zzso zzso and zzso from zzso solution using zzso zzso zzso zzso based zzso In addition, these zzso based water filter was used for multiple metals removal from sea zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was done by further acid zzso zzso was characterized by different characterization zzso Performance of zzso based water filter was analyzed for the removal of high concentration of zzso zzso and zzso and sodium as well as for desalination of sea water, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and kinetic characteristics were studied for the simultaneous removal of sodium and zzso (both zzso and zzso zzso zzso capacities of 27, 29 and 32 zzso for zzso zzso and sodium were achieved in addition to good removal efficiency for zzso zzso calcium and zzso from sea zzso
