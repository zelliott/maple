Modeling the human brain as a network has been widely considered as a powerful approach to investigating the zzso structural and functional zzso However, many previous approaches focused on a single scale of brain network and the zzso nature of brain networks has been rarely explored zzso This paper put forward a novel framework to construct zzso common networks of brains via zzso spectral zzso of fiber connections among zzso Specifically, the recently developed and publicly released zzso provide the zzso structural and functional correspondence across individuals, and thus the employed zzso spectral zzso zzso divided the zzso landmarks and their connections into zzso with zzso on multiple zzso Experimental results showed the promise of the constructed zzso networks in applications of structural and functional connectivity zzso As an application example, these zzso networks are used to guide the identification of zzso common fiber zzso across individuals and to facilitate the zzso functional role analysis, which could enable other zzso and network-based analyses in the zzso
