zzso sensing of zzso dissolved organic matter zzso from satellite zzso for zzso has been problematic due to optical complexity of zzso waters and uncertainties in zzso remote sensing zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach to combine empirical and zzso zzso to derive zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Bay) from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The approach first used a validated empirical zzso and a modified zzso zzso zzso to derive zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and particulate zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, from which zzso zzso and zzso particulate zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were derived with zzso zzso zzso Then, the modified zzso was used to estimate the total zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso was estimated as zzso - zzso - zzso - zzso where zzso is the zzso zzso of pure water (a zzso Using data collected from 71 field stations and 33 zzso zzso matchup data pairs covering a large dynamic range zzso - 8 zzso the approach showed zzso zzso uncertainties in retrieving zzso when in zzso zzso data (N zzso zzso were zzso The same approach applied to satellite zzso yielded much higher uncertainties of zzso zzso due to large errors in the zzso zzso When the zzso was derived from the zzso zzso and then used in the hybrid approach, uncertainties in the retrieved zzso reduced to zzso (N zzso zzso Application of the approach to zzso and zzso data led to a 15-year time series of monthly mean zzso zzso in Tampa Bay between 1998 and zzso This time series showed significant seasonal and annual variations regulated mainly by river zzso Testing of the approach over another zzso zzso zzso Bay, the largest zzso in the zzso demonstrated the potential zzso uncertainties for a limited zzso zzso of using this approach to establish long-term environmental data records zzso of zzso zzso in other zzso with similar optical zzso
