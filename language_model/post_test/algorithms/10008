An zzso approach to calculating bond zzso zzso sizes of zzso and sizes of giant connected components on structured random networks with zzso zzso is zzso The networks are generated using a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71, 160 zzso model of zzso embedded in zzso random zzso The resulting networks have arbitrary degree zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the bond zzso thresholds for networks of this type is examined and contrasted with some recent results in the zzso For very high levels of zzso the zzso threshold in these generalized zzso networks is increased above the value it takes in a randomly wired zzso network of the same degree zzso In zzso zzso networks, where the zzso of the degree distribution is zzso this zzso effect can lead to a zzso zzso zzso zzso
