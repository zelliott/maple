Hidden zzso Models zzso are practical tools which provide zzso base for protein secondary structure zzso In these models, usually, only the information of the left hand side of an zzso acid is zzso zzso these models seem to be inefficient with respect to long range zzso In this work we discuss a zzso zzso zzso Model zzso in which the information of both sides of zzso acids are zzso It is assumed and seemed reasonable that the information on both sides of an zzso acid can provide a suitable tool for measuring zzso We consider these zzso by dividing them into shorter zzso Each of these dependency models can be applied for zzso the probability of segments in structural zzso Several conditional probabilities concerning dependency of an zzso acid to the zzso appeared on its both sides are zzso Based on these conditional probabilities a weighted model is obtained to calculate the probability of each segment in a zzso This results in zzso increase in prediction accuracy in comparison with the ordinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also compare the performance of our model with that of the zzso zzso zzso Model introduced by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein secondary structure, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculations show that the overall prediction accuracy of our model is higher than the zzso introduced by zzso
