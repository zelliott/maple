Various zzso methods have been used to study zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso estimate using continuous zzso transform zzso together with its confidence intervals are proposed to evaluate the correlation between two zzso zzso The approach is based on averaging over repeat zzso A systematic comparison between approaches using zzso and zzso zzso transform zzso is carried zzso zzso data are generated to test the performance of these methods when zzso zzso based zzso In contrast to some recent studies, we find that zzso based zzso estimates do not zzso zzso based zzso We suggest that a combination of zzso and zzso would be most suitable for zzso zzso neural zzso Tests are presented to investigate the time and frequency discrimination capabilities of the two zzso The methods are applied to two experimental data zzso electroencephalogram zzso and surface zzso zzso during wrist movements in a healthy subject, and local field potential zzso and surface zzso recordings during resting zzso in a zzso zzso Supporting software is available at and zzso
