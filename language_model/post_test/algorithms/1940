The zzso of large volume images of zzso acquired by serial zzso electron zzso is an important step toward the zzso reconstruction of neural zzso The only cue provided by the data at hand is boundaries between otherwise indistinguishable zzso This zzso combined with the boundaries becoming very thin or faint in places, makes the large body of work on zzso zzso methods zzso On the other hand, zzso methods that exploit purely local evidence do not reach the extremely high accuracy required by the application domain that cannot tolerate the global zzso errors arising from false local zzso As a consequence, we propose a zzso merging method that arrives at its decisions in a zzso fashion, by posing and approximately solving a joint zzso zzso problem over all faces between zzso The use of zzso allows the extraction of expressive geometric zzso These are used by the zzso zzso in a zzso model that zzso knowledge about the geometry of neural surfaces by automated training on a gold zzso The scope of this improvement is demonstrated on the benchmark zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso of zzso from the inner zzso layer of rabbit zzso We provide zzso source code for zzso geometry zzso training and zzso
