For an efficient use of zzso zzso systems, an accurate sensor zzso is extremely zzso This includes the knowledge of both channel sensitivities and channel arrangement, which can zzso from original system plans, zzso because of zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a new solution to the zzso of a zzso zzso sensor array based on the signal space separation zzso zzso It has been shown that an inaccurate knowledge of sensor zzso limits the performances of the zzso method, resulting in a mismatch between the measured zzso field and its zzso zzso Given a set of known magnetic sources, we show that an objective function, which strongly depends on sensor zzso can be derived from the principal angle between the measured zzso signal and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso sensor array zzso is carried out by minimizing the objective function through a standard large-scale zzso zzso Details on the magnetic sources and zzso process are presented zzso Finally, an application to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system installed at the University of zzso is zzso
