zzso wounds may occur or persist due to zzso zzso Despite the high prevalence of zzso zzso disease, a search of the literature has yielded a paucity of data on the benefit of interventions to zzso lower zzso arteries prior to surgical closure of chronic zzso 

To investigate the correlation of simple clinical examinations and zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso disease of the lower zzso in patients with chronic wounds, and to evaluate the benefit of vascular procedures to zzso wound zzso before surgical zzso 

During a zzso period, 150 patients with chronic lower zzso wounds (no healing for more than 30 zzso were included into this prospective zzso All patients underwent zzso of foot zzso zzso zzso and measurement of zzso zzso Positive clinical findings were re-evaluated by zzso All patients with peripheral zzso vessel zzso underwent vascular interventions zzso zzso zzso with zzso open zzso or vascular bypass zzso prior to surgical wound zzso 

In all 34 patients zzso with missing foot zzso suspicious zzso signals or pathological zzso pressure zzso the clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso An zzso pathology had previously been diagnosed in merely two of those zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso were zzso in 10 cases, open zzso or vascular zzso were zzso In all 34 patients, sufficient peripheral zzso and improved wound zzso were successfully zzso For definitive wound closure, zzso tissue transplantation was performed in 15 zzso zzso was performed prior to zzso In 11 patients, regional or local zzso were zzso Six patients received split skin zzso only; two wounds healed conservatively following vascular zzso zzso closure zzso therapy was applied in 15 zzso zzso three cases of impaired wound healing and one infection zzso 

zzso zzso can be diagnosed safely by simple clinical zzso All clinically pathological results were successfully confirmed by zzso allowing for a targeted peripheral vessel reopening to improve wound zzso before zzso This straightforward zzso helped to improve the success of surgical therapy of chronic lower zzso zzso
