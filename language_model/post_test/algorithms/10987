To assess the role of three-dimensional volume rendering zzso in the zzso assessment of the zzso chain in chronic zzso zzso media zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were included in this prospective zzso zzso bone was scanned with a zzso zzso row CT and the zzso data was transferred to the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso chain according to a zzso scoring system on two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso was performed independently by two zzso The evaluation results were compared with surgical zzso 

zzso showed over zzso accuracy in the assessment of zzso absence of the zzso chain in zzso no matter how small the zzso size zzso zzso was as accurate as zzso for the assessment of zzso zzso However, zzso was found to be more accurate than zzso in the evaluation of partial erosion of zzso 

Both zzso and zzso are accurate and reliable for the assessment of the zzso chain in zzso The inclusion of zzso images in the imaging protocol improves the accuracy of zzso in detecting zzso erosion from zzso
