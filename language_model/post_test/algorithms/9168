Over the past decade numerous zzso zzso zzso criteria and zzso methods have been developed to improve the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 

Our purpose was to compare the sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy of 3 zzso methods zzso analysis, zzso rule of zzso and the zzso zzso on a series of highly zzso zzso zzso We also determined the diagnostic value of distinct zzso structures by evaluating their frequency in these zzso 

A total of 198 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso assessment was based on the presence or absence of 23 zzso zzso Two zzso dermatologists classified each zzso as benign or zzso using the pattern analysis, the zzso rule of zzso and the zzso checklist zzso After surgical zzso 102 zzso were zzso diagnosed as Clark's zzso and 96 as thin zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnoses were then compared to assess the sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy as well as positive and negative zzso values zzso and zzso zzso for zzso of the 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to determine which zzso criteria were most strongly associated with zzso 

Of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were correctly diagnosed by using pattern analysis zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnostic zzso compared with correct diagnosis of zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnostic zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diagnostic zzso with the zzso and the zzso checklist methods, zzso The zzso checklist yielded the highest number of zzso results zzso with respect to the zzso rule zzso and pattern analysis zzso zzso analysis showed that an zzso zzso network, a zzso network with sharp margins, irregular zzso brown zzso a zzso zzso distribution, homogeneous areas, and light brown zzso areas were the most sensitive and specific zzso features for zzso A backward zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the criterion with the strongest TM association was light brown zzso areas zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

The presence and value of light brown zzso areas should also be investigated in clinically zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The pattern analysis method showed the highest sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy for zzso Light brown zzso areas were both a statistically significant zzso and the most reliable predictor of TM zzso zzso zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso zzso Therefore the use of this previously underestimated zzso criterion may not only improve diagnostic performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso but also significantly decrease the rate of zzso results obtained with the zzso checklist zzso
