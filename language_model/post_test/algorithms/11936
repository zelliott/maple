A composite device was developed to provide a zzso drug release using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso agent with a short biological zzso was used as the model zzso Dynamic and equilibrium swelling of the zzso and zzso of zzso release from these zzso were determined in pH zzso and zzso buffer zzso The swelling of zzso and release of zzso from zzso disks were fast and nearly zzso whereas the swelling behavior and drug release zzso of zzso spheres were strongly zzso A swelling interface number for the spheres at pH zzso was determined to be zzso and time zzso Nevertheless, zzso diffusion might also contribute to the drug release in this zzso The composite disks consisting of zzso zzso and zzso spheres provided prolonged (over 20 zzso and more steady release profiles, differing profoundly from individual zzso Such release profiles resulted from the second phase release at pH zzso and the presence of zzso zzso The relative drug loading in the zzso could be tailored to produce release profiles varying from a distinct zzso release to a zzso zzso release with an initial zzso
