Many important complex diseases are composed of a series of zzso which makes the disease diagnosis and its genetic dissection zzso The standard procedures to determine zzso in such complex diseases are either applied for single zzso analyses or to compare findings across zzso or zzso reduction procedures, such as principal components analysis using all zzso However each method has its own problems and the challenges are even more complex for extended family data and zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a methodology to determine a scale for complex outcomes involving multiple zzso zzso in extended zzso using item response theory zzso models that take all zzso zzso into account, allowing zzso comparison among zzso An advantage of the zzso framework is that a straightforward joint zzso zzso can be estimated for zzso zzso Furthermore, our methodology allows many possible extensions such as the inclusion of zzso and multiple zzso zzso We use zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso for the zzso zzso and validate our method through simulated zzso As an application we consider the zzso syndrome as the multiple zzso disease using data from the zzso Heart Study consisting of zzso individuals in 95 zzso We adjust zzso models without zzso and include age and age squared as zzso The results showed that adjusting for zzso yields a higher joint zzso zzso than without co zzso zzso indicating that the zzso absorbed some of the error zzso
