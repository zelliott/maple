Air density must be taken into account when zzso zzso is performed with zzso zzso zzso The German zzso protocol zzso zzso states an air density correction factor for which current zzso pressure and temperature and their reference values must be zzso It also states that differences between air density and the attendant reference value, as well as changes in zzso chamber sensitivity, can be determined using a radioactive check zzso Both methods have advantages and drawbacks which the paper discusses in zzso zzso pressure at a given height above sea level can be determined by using a suitable barometer, or data downloaded from airport or weather service zzso zzso The main focus of the paper is to show how zzso data from measurement or from the zzso are correctly zzso Therefore the paper also provides all the requisite equations and zzso zzso zzso and measured zzso pressure readings are zzso and long-term experience with air density correction factors obtained using both methods is zzso
