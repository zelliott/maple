To identify novel zzso zzso associations in zzso zzso zzso by performing zzso expression profiling on cells isolated from the human zzso necrosis factor zzso transgenic mouse model zzso zzso and patients zzso 

zzso expression in zzso from zzso and zzso zzso control mice were determined by zzso deep sequencing zzso and the zzso profile was established by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was zzso for profile zzso zzso and gene zzso in patient zzso zzso zzso target genes and pathways were predicted via zzso zzso and validated using zzso coupled with reporter zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated that zzso exhibit a distinct zzso profile with 22 significantly zzso and 30 significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso previously associated with human zzso arthritis zzso pathology, as well as that of zzso and zzso zzso the latter were also found significantly zzso in patient zzso zzso suggesting for the first time their association with zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested zzso zzso as a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to enhance zzso zzso zzso and decrease the levels of its predicted target zzso repeat zzso an inhibitor of zzso 

Using zzso profiling in zzso from the zzso mouse model and zzso in zzso patient zzso the authors identified zzso and zzso as novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the authors show that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting its potential zzso involvement and future use as a therapeutic target in zzso
