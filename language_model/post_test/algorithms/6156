zzso tree reconstruction is a process in which the ancestral relationships among a group of organisms are zzso from their DNA zzso For all but trivial sized data sets, finding the optimal tree is zzso zzso Many zzso zzso exist, but the zzso zzso used in the software package zzso is the most zzso This method performs a zzso search over the space of trees, using a zzso operation to construct neighboring trees in the search zzso This study introduces a new zzso search zzso that operates over an alternative representation of trees, namely as permutations of zzso giving the order in which they are processed during zzso zzso zzso on several data sets suggest that this zzso for generating an initial tree, when followed by zzso can produce better trees for a given total amount of zzso
