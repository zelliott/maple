zzso zzso on zzso zzso such as zzso zzso of zzso or zzso or zzso bonded zzso leads to distinct types of structural zzso The first type involves the proliferation of localized defects that disrupt the zzso order without affecting the imposed shape, whereas the second type consists of elastic zzso such as wrinkles and zzso which zzso the shape and also are common in zzso zzso zzso Here, we propose a profound link between these types of patterns, zzso in a universal, zzso stress field, which is determined solely by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso principle and a few of its immediate consequences are borne out by studying a circular zzso patch bound to a zzso zzso zzso in which the two distinct patterns zzso respectively, zzso chains of zzso (called zzso and zzso zzso The simplicity of this zzso allows us to characterize the zzso and evaluate the energies of both patterns, from which we construct a phase zzso that predicts a zzso transition in confined zzso sheets at a critical value of the zzso zzso The construction of a unified theoretical framework that bridges zzso zzso defects and elastic zzso opens unique research zzso Beyond the potential use of this concept for finding zzso zzso in curved zzso the possibility of transforming defects into shape zzso that retain the zzso structure may be valuable for a broad range of material applications, such as zzso of zzso electronic zzso
