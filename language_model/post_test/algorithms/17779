A number of methods for measuring zzso in zzso bone using high-resolution X-ray zzso zzso exist, which give different answers but have not been compared in zzso In this study, we examine the zzso length zzso star volume distribution zzso and star length distribution zzso methods, their zzso zzso for three-dimensional zzso data, and how their results relate to each zzso A uniform ordered sampling scheme for determining which zzso to sample during analysis enhances the zzso of zzso and principal component direction zzso with no evident introduction of zzso This scheme also zzso the creation of a zzso rose zzso that can be used to gain additional insights from the zzso The directed zzso zzso that is frequently used for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for these calculations is prone to bias unless a previously zzso zzso is zzso This zzso ameliorates the bias present when using cubic zzso and also permits calculations on data sets in which the slice spacing is not equal to the zzso zzso Overall, the three methods for zzso of zzso give broadly similar results, but there are systematic zzso that can be traced to their differences in data and processing, and which may impact on their relative utility in zzso mechanical zzso Although discussed in the context of zzso zzso of zzso bone, the methods described here may be applied to any zzso data set from which fabric information is zzso
