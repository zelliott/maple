A new water potential, zzso zzso zzso implicit zzso is constructed using distributed zzso to describe the zzso zzso while accounting for polarization zzso In this zzso small clusters are randomly sampled from zzso simulations of bulk water using the zzso zzso and zzso J zzso zzso 2002, 23, zzso zzso The zzso moments of the central water in each cluster are obtained from zzso zzso zzso for each zzso and the moments are then averaged over all zzso Properties of bulk water calculated using zzso compare favorably with existing data from zzso simulations and experiment, with a conservative estimate of reduction in zzso time of roughly zzso The implicit zzso is also shown to work zzso with existing zzso zzso zzso for zzso
