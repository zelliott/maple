In this paper a comparison of two column zzso systems is reported: the method based on the zzso model of zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus the method developed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was done for seven different pharmaceutical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a set of 59 zzso A ranking was built based on an F value zzso or zzso value zzso versus a zzso reference zzso Both methods showed similar probabilities of ranking zzso zzso of the respective test parameters of both approaches was zzso Both methods are not perfect and do not match well, but zzso yield results which allow, with a relatively high zzso the selection of similar or dissimilar columns as compared to a reference zzso An analyst that uses either of the two methods will end up with a similar probability to choose an adequate zzso From a practical point of view, it must be noted that the zzso method is easier to zzso
