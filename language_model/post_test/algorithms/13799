zzso and van der zzso recently introduced a new model of zzso image registration which makes use of the correspondence of zzso structures zzso zzso van der zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1993; zzso zzso Using a synthetic zzso zzso an zzso was developed that zzso zzso zzso zzso to describe the relative location of each image zzso A limitation of this synthetic approach is that there will always be a single line passing through the image that cannot be zzso In this paper, an zzso which is based upon an zzso zzso geometry is zzso This zzso describes each image zzso by using a coordinate system called a reference zzso It was shown zzso that this zzso successfully registers the entire zzso It can also perform the registration almost six times faster than the original zzso
