The intensity of the laser light scattered by a suspension of biological particles undergoing zzso motion contains information about their size distribution function and optical zzso We used several methods zzso in zzso zzso including a new one, to zzso the zzso integral equation of the first kind, which represents the angular dependence of the elastic scattering of zzso The zzso were first tested on different sets of simulated zzso Experimental data were obtained using biological samples and an experimental arrangement which are briefly zzso We study the stability of the inversion procedures relative to the noise levels, and zzso the first two moments of the retrieved size distribution zzso A comparison of the results corresponding to simulated and experimental data is done, to select the best processing zzso
