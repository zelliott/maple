When a zzso beam passes through the treatment couch or an zzso device, it may traverse a large air gap (up to 15 zzso or more) prior to entering the zzso Previous studies have investigated the ability of various treatment planning systems to calculate the dose immediately beyond small air gaps, typically less than 5 zzso thick, such as those within the zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of the Eclipse zzso zzso zzso zzso and pencil beam zzso zzso zzso to calculate the dose beyond large air zzso zzso dose data in water for a 6 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso 10 zzso field size, and 100 zzso zzso were measured beyond a range of air gaps zzso zzso The thickness of the water equivalent material positioned before the air gap ranged from zzso to 4 zzso zzso was calculated with the Eclipse zzso zzso and zzso The scattered and primary dose components were calculated from the zzso The measured results indicate that as the air gap increases (from 1 to 15 zzso the dose reduces at the water surface and that beyond an air gap a secondary buildup region is required to re-establish electronic zzso The dose beyond the air gap is also reduced at depths beyond the secondary buildup zzso The zzso zzso did not predict any reduction in dose beyond the air zzso AAA predicted the secondary buildup region but did not predict the reduction in dose at depths beyond zzso The reduction in dose beyond the secondary buildup region was shown to be particularly relevant for air gaps of 5 zzso or more when there was a 2 zzso of water equivalent material positioned before the air zzso For these cases, where electronic equilibrium is established in the material positioned before the air zzso both zzso were found to overestimate the dose by zzso It was concluded that the dose to depths of up to 15 zzso beyond a large air gap is reduced due to a decrease in scattered radiation, produced in the material positioned before the air zzso reaching the point of zzso This effect is not well modeled by the Eclipse AAA and zzso zzso and may result in dose calculation errors greater than zzso Due to the contribution of other uncertainties in the radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery process, dose calculation errors of this magnitude are not consistent with the recommendation of the International Commission on zzso Units and zzso that the absorbed dose to the target volume be delivered with an uncertainty of less than zzso zzso
