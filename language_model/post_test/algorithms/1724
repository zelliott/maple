zzso monitoring of heart failure zzso patients may help in the early detection of acute zzso before the onset of symptoms, providing the opportunity for early intervention to reduce zzso hospitalizations, improve zzso and lower zzso 

MUSIC is a zzso zzso study designed to develop and validate an zzso for prediction of impending acute zzso zzso with the use of zzso signals obtained from an external device zzso to the zzso A total of zzso zzso patients zzso development, 337 zzso with ejection fraction zzso and a recent zzso admission were zzso Patients were remotely monitored for 90 days using a zzso zzso zzso for device failure and patient withdrawal, 314 patients zzso development, 200 zzso were included in the zzso Development patient data were used to develop a zzso zzso detection zzso Algorithm performance in the development cohort had zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and a false positive rate of zzso per zzso for detection of zzso zzso In the validation zzso zzso performance met the zzso end points with zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and a false positive rate of zzso per zzso The overall rate of significant adverse skin response was zzso 

Using an external zzso monitoring system, an zzso zzso prediction zzso was developed that met the zzso performance end zzso Further studies are required to determine whether the use of this system will improve patient zzso
