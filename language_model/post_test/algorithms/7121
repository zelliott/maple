zzso is a zzso zzso alignment zzso that finds protein (or zzso multiple sequence alignments with maximum expected zzso zzso greedily builds up the alignment from sequence regions with high local zzso thereby yielding an accurate global alignment that effectively captures the local similarities across zzso zzso constantly yields accurate alignment results on a wide range of reference sets that have different zzso with especially remarkable improvements over other leading zzso on sequence sets with high local zzso In this chapter, we describe the overall alignment strategy used in zzso and discuss several important considerations for effective deployment of the zzso
