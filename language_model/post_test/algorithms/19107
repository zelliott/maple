A zzso zzso utilizing a zzso wave across gap junction was constructed toward a novel zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso propagation of the chemical wave of the zzso zzso reaction was induced on gel zzso In the case of using a zzso gel as an element of the zzso the chemical wave zzso from the corner side of the triangle gel to the plane side of the other gel zzso across the gap zzso whereas it zzso from the plane side to the corner side zzso in the case of the zzso gel zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso model was done for understanding the mechanism of zzso propagation in triangle and zzso gel zzso The swelling and zzso changes of the gels followed the zzso propagation of the chemical zzso
