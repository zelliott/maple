This study deals with the zzso from zzso measured data, of the sound speed profile of a zzso two-dimensional target of arbitrary zzso embedded in an infinite zzso Green's zzso is used to obtain a domain integral representation of the zzso scattered field, and a discrete zzso of the inverse problem is obtained using a moment zzso An zzso zzso zzso minimizing the zzso between the measured and zzso scattered fields is used to reconstruct the sound speed profile in the region of zzso The zzso process is performed using a zzso zzso An experimental study with significant zzso zzso contrast targets immersed in water was zzso Images of the sound speed profile obtained by inversion of experimental data are zzso
