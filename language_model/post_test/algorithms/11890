This paper concerns an application of evolutionary feature weighting for diagnosis support in zzso The original data in the zzso task are the microscopic images of ten classes of central nervous system zzso zzso zzso These images are segmented and described by the features characterizing regions resulting from the zzso zzso The final features are in part zzso Thus, we employ an evolutionary zzso to reduce the number of irrelevant zzso using the zzso accuracy of a zzso zzso zzso as an zzso fitness zzso The novelty of our approach consists in the application of evolutionary zzso for feature zzso not only for feature zzso The weights obtained give quantitative information about the relative importance of the zzso The results of zzso experiments show a significant improvement of zzso accuracy of the zzso found feature sets with respect to the original feature zzso
