A method was developed to estimate the spread of treatment doses due to a given output zzso time zzso and action level in external zzso beam zzso The method exploits empirical or simulated data of both output stability and the zzso of the absolute output zzso and relative constancy zzso The spread of an output and the probability that an output is outside the zzso tolerance limits were estimated for different quality control procedures of the zzso The use of internationally recommended output measurement intervals of 3, 1 and zzso months together with an action level of zzso results in the zzso probability up to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while the output is kept within up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was also found that the action level has more prominent relative influence than the measurement zzso The results suggest that similar treatment quality can be achieved by doubling the output measurement time zzso and lowering the action level from zzso to zzso and the constancy check action level from zzso to zzso
