Individual zzso allowed the highest zzso rate but with some patients meeting the criteria for more than one zzso A zzso differential allocation algorithm, with selected thresholds at decision zzso yielded a zzso rate zzso that of the individual zzso but without double zzso 

The composite zzso provided an objective and standardized means of assigning patients to syndromes based on clinically measurable sensory and motor zzso The thresholds used to implement criteria and the order of decision zzso greatly influenced the outcomes and may be adjusted to suit the needs of the zzso that is, embracing liberal or stringent zzso zzso remains about the interpretation of some zzso and many patients remain zzso because of mixed clinical zzso
