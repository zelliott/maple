We present here an zzso for computing stable, zzso localized zzso virtual zzso which depend smoothly on nuclear zzso The zzso is very fast, limited only by zzso of two zzso with dimension the size of the number of virtual zzso Furthermore, we require no more than zzso (in the number of zzso zzso The basic premise behind our zzso is that one can decompose any given zzso zzso zzso space as a minimal basis space (which includes the occupied and zzso virtual zzso and a zzso zzso space (which includes everything zzso The zzso virtual space zzso easily with standard methods, while the zzso space is constructed to be atom centered and automatically zzso The zzso presented here may be zzso almost as quickly as projecting the zzso basis onto the virtual space and are almost as local zzso to zzso zzso while our zzso are zzso (rather than redundant and zzso We expect this zzso to find use in zzso zzso
