We investigated protection strategies of zzso at risk zzso in intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso These strategies apply to delivery of zzso to moving body zzso that show relative displacement of zzso in close proximity to a tumor zzso We formulated an efficient genetic zzso which makes it possible to search for global zzso in a complex landscape of multiple zzso strategies delivering a given, predetermined intensity map to a zzso The optimal strategy was investigated with respect to minimizing the dose delivered to the zzso The zzso procedure developed relies on zzso of all parameters available for control of radiation delivery in modern linear accelerators, including adaptation of leaf zzso and simultaneous modification of beam dose rate during zzso We showed that the zzso zzso lead to a significant reduction in the dose delivered to zzso in cases where zzso at risk move relative to a treatment zzso
