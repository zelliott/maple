zzso zzso an zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso in Connecticut zzso blood donors is approximately zzso however, it is not known what percentage of donors is zzso and poses a risk for zzso zzso zzso we determined the prevalence of zzso zzso in donors from a highly endemic area of CT and compared observed rates with concurrent zzso zzso zzso testing zzso 

Blood samples from zzso donors in zzso CT were collected from zzso through early October 2009 and tested by zzso for zzso G zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso zzso specificity was determined using blood donor samples collected in northwestern Vermont zzso an area zzso for zzso 

Of zzso CT donors, 25 zzso were zzso positive and three zzso were real-time zzso zzso Among the three real-time zzso donors, two were also zzso positive, while one was zzso negative and may represent a window period zzso The two zzso and real-time zzso donors appeared to subsequently clear zzso The other real-time zzso donor did not provide follow-up zzso Of zzso VT donors tested by zzso only one zzso was positive, but may have acquired infection during travel to an endemic zzso 

We zzso identified several real-time zzso blood donors, including an zzso real-time zzso zzso in an area highly endemic for zzso These results suggest the need to include zzso acid testing in planned zzso strategies for zzso
