This paper presents a new method for tumor zzso using gene expression zzso In the proposed method, we first select genes using zzso zzso zzso zzso or sparse zzso zzso and then we extract features from the selected genes by virtue of zzso or zzso At last, we apply support zzso machines zzso to zzso the tumor samples using the extracted zzso In order for a better zzso a modified zzso zzso is also zzso The experimental results on benchmark three zzso data sets validate that the proposed method is zzso Moreover, the biological meaning of the selected genes are also zzso
