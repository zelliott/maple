We investigated the effect of zzso on spinal zzso evoked zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after electrical stimulation of the motor zzso in a rabbit zzso This study was designed to characterize the relationship between zzso characteristics and corresponding changes in compound muscle action zzso zzso derived from fore and hind zzso zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso from the upper and lower zzso spinal cord, recorded by two bipolar zzso electrodes, were assessed during IV administration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso each before and after zzso blockade zzso zzso of zzso in 16 New Zealand White rabbits after zzso bipolar electrical stimulation of the motor zzso at 50 zzso 60, and 70 zzso zzso zzso at fore and hind limbs were significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso during infusion at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas neither corresponding zzso nor zzso were zzso Similar findings were obtained during variation of stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and various zzso characteristics demonstrated no apparent zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso independent from zzso zzso and zzso zzso at or zzso to the spinal zzso 

zzso combines several zzso properties suitable for total IV zzso including minimal effects on zzso zzso Recording of neural and zzso responses after electrical stimulation of the motor zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a peripheral mechanism at or zzso to the spinal zzso
