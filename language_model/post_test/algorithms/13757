Fast access of two-dimensional zzso gel quantitative databases is important for rapid searching for protein differences between sets of zzso gels from an zzso The zzso system organizes corresponding spots from the gels in the database into reference or zzso zzso These zzso zzso names index fixed regions in the paged composite gel database zzso This is adequate for an existing database, but has several zzso zzso Building the initial database requires guessing how much disk space to zzso for each corresponding spot zzso spots from different zzso If it ever runs out of zzso space during this process, it must expand the size of each corresponding set of spots copying the old database data into the new zzso on the zzso zzso When adding new gels or editing the database, if a new spot is created, the system may also go into this expansion zzso The time spent and wasted disk space can be zzso on the size of the database zzso of 100 gel zzso zzso Because each set of corresponding spots is the same size, we waste space in most spot sets since they do not require the additional space a few spot sets require which contain additional fragmented zzso We present a new low-level disk zzso structure and algorithm, paged zzso buckets zzso which zzso disk space usage while having similar retrieval speed to the original zzso
