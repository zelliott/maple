The measurement of the zzso at the exit zzso of an optical system is a reliable method to investigate its imaging zzso It is sometimes necessary to compare the measurement obtained with a zzso sensor to some known aberration function, which is for example given by a simulation or a gold standard measurement technique such as zzso For accurate measurement systems, the residual after direct zzso of the two zzso is often partly due to a mismatch between coordinate zzso We present in this paper a method that uses the zzso expansion of zzso to zzso cancel such small alignment zzso We use this zzso to zzso the accuracy of a zzso zzso zzso sensor in the measurement of known aberration zzso
