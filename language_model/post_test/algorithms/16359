Diagnosis of respiratory viruses traditionally relies on culture or zzso zzso We aimed to demonstrate capacity of the reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso mass zzso zzso platform to identify clinical relevant respiratory viruses in zzso zzso zzso samples and compare the diagnostic performance characteristics relative to conventional zzso and zzso zzso An zzso respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory zzso virus, influenza A and B, zzso types zzso zzso types zzso zzso human zzso and human zzso was evaluated using both zzso and frozen zzso zzso (N zzso zzso 95 of which were positive by clinical zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso known positive samples and identified an additional zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso that are zzso with conventional methods were also zzso zzso load was zzso and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso Time to results was 8 zzso zzso showed promise in rapid detection of respiratory viruses and merits further evaluation for use in clinical zzso
