The Earth possesses a number of regulatory feedback mechanisms involving zzso In the absence of a population of competing zzso it has proved hard to find a robust evolutionary mechanism that would generate environmental zzso It has been suggested that regulation must require zzso environmental zzso by organisms and, therefore, would be zzso zzso This need not be the case if organisms alter the environment as a selectively neutral zzso of their zzso as in the majority of zzso zzso but a question then zzso Why should the combined zzso effects of the zzso have a stabilizing, rather than zzso influence on the zzso Under certain conditions, selection acting above the level of the individual can be an effective zzso zzso Here we present an evolutionary simulation model in which environmental regulation involving zzso selection robustly emerges in a network of interconnected microbial zzso zzso structure creates conditions for a limited form of zzso selection to act on the collective zzso properties of local zzso Local communities that improve their environmental conditions achieve larger populations and are better zzso of available space, whereas local communities that degrade their environment shrink and become susceptible to zzso The spread of zzso communities alters the global environment toward the optimal conditions for growth and tends to regulate against external zzso This work suggests a mechanism for environmental regulation that is consistent with evolutionary zzso
