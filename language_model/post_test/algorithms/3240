The modeling of signal zzso pathways is a task of systems zzso However, such a task is very difficult because of the structure complexity, the strong zzso of signaling pathways and the zzso and incomplete zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is applied to estimate the unknown parameters of the signaling zzso With this method, the zzso of unknown parameters is zzso and the sensitivity equations of original model are zzso Then we append the sensitivity equations to the original model in order to form the zzso model, and we apply the zzso zzso to the zzso model in order to estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is taken as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of this method, and the simulation results are zzso
