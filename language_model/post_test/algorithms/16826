In this research, a hybrid model is developed by zzso a zzso reasoning approach and a particle swarm zzso model for medical data zzso Two data sets from zzso zzso Learning zzso zzso Liver Disorders Data Set and Breast Cancer Wisconsin zzso are employed for benchmark zzso zzso a zzso reasoning method is applied to zzso the data set thus a weight zzso for each feature is zzso A particle swarm zzso model is then applied to construct a decision-making system for diseases zzso The zzso zzso starts by zzso the data set into a relatively large number of clusters to reduce the effects of initial conditions and then reducing the number of clusters into zzso The average forecasting accuracy for breast cancer of zzso model is zzso and for liver disorders is zzso The proposed zzso particle swarm zzso model is able to produce more accurate and comprehensible results for medical experts in medical zzso
