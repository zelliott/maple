We consider previously proposed procedures for generating clustered networks and investigate how these procedures lead to differences in network properties other than zzso We interpret our findings in terms of the effect of the network structure on the disease outbreak threshold and disease zzso To generate zzso networks for comparison, we implement an zzso zzso zzso that alters the level of zzso while causing minimal impact on other zzso We show that many theoretical network models used to generate networks with a particular property often lead to significant changes in network properties other than that of zzso For high levels of zzso different procedures lead to networks that differ in degree zzso and zzso and in broader scale measures such as zzso and the distribution of shortest path zzso zzso care must be taken when investigating the implications of network properties for disease transmission or other dynamic process that the network zzso
