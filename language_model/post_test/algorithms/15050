zzso air zzso zzso have been widely used in clinical dentistry for over 30 years, yet little work has been reported on their zzso A few studies have been concerned with measurement of speed zzso rotation zzso zzso and power performance of these devices, but neither investigations of functional relationships between controlling variables nor theory dealing specifically with this class of zzso have been zzso This has hindered the development of satisfactory methods of zzso zzso and of testing dental rotary cutting zzso It was the intention of the present work to remedy that zzso 

zzso of pressure, temperature, gas flow rate and rotation rate were made with improved accuracy and precision for 14 ball bearing zzso zzso on several zzso zzso relationships between gas properties, supply pressure, flow rate, zzso design factors and free running speed were identified and equations describing these aspects of zzso of this class of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso through peripheral Mach number, was found to be a major zzso of speed zzso In addition, gas flow was found to be an important limiting factor through the effect of zzso 

Each dental zzso can be treated as a simple orifice of a characteristic zzso zzso Free running speed can be explained in terms of gas properties and pressure, with allowance for a zzso performance zzso
