We describe a useful method for the efficient zzso and relative zzso of peptides containing zzso zzso zzso This method is based on zzso of the zzso group from zzso zzso sites under alkaline conditions, followed by Michael addition reaction with zzso zzso As a result of the zzso reaction, the zzso charged zzso group is zzso with the zzso zzso to improve the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso generates a 3 Da mass difference between zzso and zzso zzso which is a useful signature for the identification of peptides containing zzso zzso sites in the zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso Moreover, the mass difference is useful for the quantitative analysis of zzso zzso in zzso In this paper, we describe the synthesis of zzso zzso and an application of our approach to model peptides and zzso
