Based on the zzso between mathematical zzso and molecular evolution and on zzso zzso model of molecular evolution, an evolutionary zzso for zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso consists of a versatile variation scheme and an innovative decision rule, the essence of which lies in a radical revision of the conventional philosophy of zzso A number of zzso of variables with better values, instead of only a single best zzso are selected as starting points for the next zzso As a result the search proceeds in parallel along a number of routes and is unlikely to get trapped in local zzso An important innovation of the zzso is introduction of a constraint to let the starting points always keep a certain distance from each other so that the search is able to cover a larger region of space zzso The main advantage of the zzso is that it has more chances to find the global optimum and as many local zzso as possible in a single zzso This has been demonstrated in preliminary zzso zzso
