There is a growing need for zzso and inexpensive methods that can effectively be used on a large scale, to detect an onset of early zzso in human knee zzso Of many possible options, zzso analysis of two-dimensional projection zzso images of zzso bone zzso texture, appears as one of the best zzso However, there are some problems associated with the characterization of the zzso and zzso of the bone zzso To resolve these problems, a modified zzso orientation transform zzso method, previously developed by the authors, has been used in this zzso The advantages of the HOT method over other techniques used to analyze bone texture, are that it zzso a two-dimensional zzso dimension in all possible directions and also provides a measure of zzso for both surfaces exhibiting strong zzso and surfaces exhibiting weak zzso In this study, the accuracy of the HOT method in measuring the bone texture zzso and zzso together with the effects of image noise, zzso exposure, zzso and projection angle on its performance were zzso zzso images of zzso surfaces and zzso images obtained for a human zzso head were zzso zzso obtained show that the HOT method can effectively be used to characterize the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
