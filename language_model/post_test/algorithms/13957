Every zzso detector employs a beat zzso to discriminate between normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso In most of these zzso zzso a set of rules is employed to distinguish between N and V beats using a common set of features extracted from the real-time zzso signal and/or correlation of zzso complexes with the dominant zzso zzso A common set of these features includes: beat area, beat zzso beat zzso beat zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods are commonly used to adapt the rules to particular zzso These zzso are zzso zzso that employ zzso zzso structures and zzso thresholds for making decisions in the feature zzso The complexity of the feature space increases as the number of features zzso For k features, a zzso space is zzso Thus, the separation between N and V space zzso becomes more difficult, especially since these zzso zzso When zzso zzso structures with zzso thresholds or zzso techniques are used to separate N and V zzso in a zzso feature space, errors are guaranteed, because these zzso are not zzso zzso As a results, these zzso have limited dynamic zzso This means that the sensitivity for a certain class of beats (N or zzso will grow only at the expense of positive zzso for that class, and vice zzso
