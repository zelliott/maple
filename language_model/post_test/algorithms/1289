zzso instruments such as plasma zzso measurement zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are being increasingly advocated to reduce the number of necessary zzso in patients having suspected pulmonary embolism zzso and a zzso lung zzso We therefore designed a decision analysis model zzso to evaluate the zzso of combining these zzso diagnostic aids with lung scan and zzso in the diagnosis of zzso and zzso to determine the optimal sequence and combination of tests taking into account the clinical probability of zzso 

We performed a zzso analysis based on literature data, including data from a management study in our zzso Six diagnostic strategies were compared with the reference, zzso lung scan followed when zzso zzso or intermediate zzso by zzso In all strategies, zzso was ruled out by a normal or zzso zzso a negative zzso zzso level below 500 zzso or a negative zzso Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed and zzso treatment was undertaken in the presence of a zzso lung zzso deep vein zzso showed by zzso or a positive zzso In case of a zzso scan zzso or intermediate zzso patients could be either treated or not treated, or undergo other tests, according to the selected zzso 

Under baseline conditions zzso of zzso zzso strategies combining zzso and US with lung zzso zzso being done only in case of an zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso 500 zzso normal zzso and zzso lung zzso were most zzso This approach yielded a zzso incremental cost reduction and a 37% to zzso decrease in the number of necessary zzso compared with the reference strategy zzso zzso zzso For patients with a low clinical probability of zzso zzso or zzso zzso withholding treatment from those with a zzso lung scan without performing an zzso proved safe and highly cost-effective zzso cost zzso provided US showed no deep vein zzso 

The zzso test and US are cost-effective in the diagnostic zzso of zzso whether performed after or before lung zzso thus allowing centers devoid of lung scanning and/or zzso facilities to screen patients with suspected zzso and avoid costly zzso In patients with a low clinical zzso a zzso lung zzso and a normal zzso treatment may be withheld without resorting to zzso
