Standard syphilis screening involves an initial screening with a zzso test and confirmation of zzso with a zzso zzso However, some laboratories have reversed the zzso There is no detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluation for the order of zzso In this study, we analyzed the health and economic outcomes of the order of testing for the 2 zzso tests used in syphilis screening under pure screening zzso 

We used a cohort decision analysis to examine the health and economic outcomes of the screening zzso for low and high prevalence zzso The zzso zzso were zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso We included the zzso zzso zzso only zzso and an on-site zzso only zzso for zzso We estimated zzso rates and the number of zzso tests required for each zzso 

For a cohort of 10,000 individuals, our results indicated that the zzso rates were substantially higher (more than 3 zzso for the zzso zzso although they treated a higher number of cases (over zzso The zzso zzso detected and treated the same number of zzso Among the zzso zzso the zzso was more cost-effective in the low prevalence setting zzso zzso zzso per adverse outcome zzso and more zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high prevalence zzso 

The difference in cost was largely due to the substantially higher number of zzso tests required for the zzso algorithm, although the number of cases detected and treated was the zzso
