Scaling behavior inherently exists in fundamental biological structures, and the measure of such an attribute can only be known at a given scale of zzso Thus, the properties of zzso and zzso zzso have become attractive for research in biology and medicine because of their potential for discovering patterns and characteristics of complex biological zzso Despite the successful applications of zzso for the life sciences, the quantitative measure of the scale zzso expressed by zzso dimensions is limited in more complex situations, such as for zzso analysis of tissue changes in zzso In this paper, we introduce the concept of fuzzy zzso and its analysis of a mouse zzso with zzso brain zzso zzso
