In zzso correction of zzso images by transmission CT zzso with an external zzso zzso source, simultaneous zzso data acquisition is difficult, when the same zzso such as zzso or zzso is used as the zzso In this case, zzso is usually acquired before administration of the zzso and zzso is acquired separately after the zzso zzso However, zzso may occur between the zzso and zzso images, and the repetition of examinations add to the mental and physical stress of the zzso In this study, to eliminate this problem, we evaluated whether zzso correction of zzso images can be achieved by acquiring zzso and zzso zzso then acquiring zzso alone, and preparing an zzso map by zzso the latter from the former using zzso liver zzso 

The zzso system used was a zzso gamma camera equipped with one cardiac fan beam zzso and two parallel beam zzso External zzso source for zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was 185 zzso First, pure zzso data were acquired for the original zzso then, zzso data were acquired for the zzso zzso and finally, pure zzso data were zzso The zzso zzso map was produced by zzso the pure zzso image from the zzso image, and zzso correction of the zzso image was done using both this zzso zzso map and zzso map from pure zzso These two zzso corrected images and zzso images were zzso Hot rods zzso a liver phantom with a zzso and 10 patients were zzso 

zzso corrected zzso values using the zzso zzso map showed an error of about zzso zzso compared with zzso values of the images corrected by original zzso map at the zzso in the liver zzso A good correlation of y zzso zzso + zzso r zzso zzso was observed also in clinical zzso 

By means of the method proposed in this study, it is possible to perform simultaneous zzso data acquisition for zzso correction using zzso external source in zzso zzso liver zzso Moreover, it is thought that this method decreases the mental and physical stress of the zzso
