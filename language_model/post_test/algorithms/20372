A set of 32 known zzso zzso representing different chemical classes has been used to evaluate the performance of two zzso of incremental construction zzso for flexible molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso tools are able to dock zzso of our test set within 2 A of their known, bound zzso using default sampling and scoring zzso Although flexible zzso with zzso or zzso is not able to reconstruct all native complexes, it does offer a significant improvement over rigid body zzso of single, zzso zzso which is still often used for zzso of large zzso zzso of sets of multiple zzso of each zzso obtained with a novel protocol for diverse zzso generation and selection, yielded results comparable to those obtained by flexible zzso Chemical scoring, which is an zzso modified force field scoring method implemented in zzso zzso zzso both interaction energy scoring by zzso and the zzso scoring function used by zzso in rigid and flexible zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that for reliable zzso of flexible zzso the selection of anchor fragments, zzso sampling and currently available scoring methods still require zzso
