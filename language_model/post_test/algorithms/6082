The neural zzso for song behavior in zzso the song control system zzso is thus far the zzso brain circuit in which to study zzso and adult zzso Not only does the volume of the key song control zzso change in size, but also the density of the connections between them changes as a function of seasonal and hormonal zzso This study explores the zzso of in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso the zzso concentrated connections of the zzso in the brain of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso on zzso was performed on a zzso MR system using zzso and zzso zzso zzso was accomplished with diffusion zzso applied in seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed us to distinguish most of the zzso matter and white zzso including the zzso zzso the avian zzso and the tracts connecting the major song control zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso also allowed us to discern a number of song control, auditory and visual zzso zzso tracking was implemented to illustrate the discrimination of all tracts running from and to zzso Because of the remarkable plasticity inherent to the zzso brain, the successful zzso of zzso in this model could represent a useful tool for the in zzso exploration of fiber zzso and zzso and the biological mechanisms involved in brain zzso
