By combining zzso broadband pulse generation with the technique of zzso spectral zzso we demonstrate a zzso scheme for highly selective detection of air molecules by backward zzso zzso zzso The experimental results allow to extrapolate the laser parameters required for standoff sensing based on the recently demonstrated backward atmospheric zzso
