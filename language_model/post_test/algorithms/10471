zzso reconstruction techniques hold great potential to mitigate the effects of data noise and/or zzso and hence can facilitate the patient dose zzso However, they are not suitable for routine clinical practice due to their long reconstruction zzso In this work, the authors accelerated the zzso by fully taking advantage of the highly parallel zzso power on single and multiple graphics processing units zzso In particular, the forward projection algorithm, which is not included in the zzso formulas, will be accelerated and zzso by using zzso zzso 

The main contribution is a novel forward projection zzso that uses zzso to handle the zzso associated with a bunch of adjacent rays zzso The proposed zzso is free of divergence and bank conflict on zzso and benefits from data locality and data zzso It achieves the efficiency particularly by zzso employing a tiled zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso thread block size, zzso maximizing data zzso on constant memory and shared memory, and zzso exploiting built-in texture memory zzso capability to increase zzso In addition, to accelerate the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on zzso the authors apply zzso fast zzso transform zzso to zzso filtering process in zzso and zzso projection bundling zzso during zzso to shorten the execution times in zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso experiments conducted on an zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the superiority of the proposed zzso in zzso time zzso The forward projection, zzso and zzso times for generating a volume image of 512 zzso 512 zzso 512 with 360 projection data of 512 zzso 512 using one zzso are about zzso zzso and zzso s (including distance zzso zzso In particular, the proposed forward projection zzso is zzso and its zzso strategy zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the use of texture memory reduces the reconstruction time from zzso to zzso zzso By applying the projection bundle technique, the zzso time is further reduced to zzso zzso When employing multiple zzso near-perfect zzso were observed as the number of zzso zzso For example, by using four zzso the time for the forward projection, zzso and zzso are further reduced to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained by zzso zzso are virtually indistinguishable with those by zzso 

The authors have proposed a highly zzso zzso forward projection algorithm, as well as the zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction zzso Our zzso unified device architecture zzso codes provide the zzso fast forward projection and zzso that outperform those using the zzso languages, cell broadband engine architecture and previous zzso zzso The reconstruction times in the zzso and the zzso zzso were considerably zzso and thus can facilitate their routine usage in a variety of applications such as image quality improvement and dose zzso
