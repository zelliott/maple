zzso zzso artifact is considered here as the sum of a number of independent zzso components having the same cycle zzso Our proposed method, called zzso source extraction zzso is able to extract these components without much destructive effect on the background electroencephalogram zzso It is shown that the proposed method zzso other methods particularly in preserving the remaining zzso zzso is zzso to remove the zzso artifact from real zzso data recorded inside the magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso visual evoked potential zzso The results are compared to the results of benchmark zzso removal zzso zzso the power spectral density of the cleaned zzso data, it is shown that zzso effectively removes the frequency components corresponding to the zzso zzso It is also shown that zzso recorded inside the scanner and processed using the proposed method are more correlated with the zzso recorded outside the zzso Moreover, there is no need for zzso zzso data in this method as the cycle frequency of the zzso is directly zzso from the contaminated zzso zzso
