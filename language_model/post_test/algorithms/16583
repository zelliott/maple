The primary aim was to compare the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso with zzso acid zzso when used for blood conservation during high-risk cardiac zzso 

Data previously reported by the Blood Conservation Using zzso in a zzso Trial zzso study investigators were zzso independently after appropriate statistical zzso The authors compared zzso with zzso for important primary and secondary outcomes and applied the zzso zzso equation to this zzso 

zzso the largest blinded zzso study on this topic to date, compared all 3 commonly used zzso head-to-head in a zzso zzso fashion during high-risk cardiac zzso Comparisons of zzso with zzso with application of the clinical value equation was not performed specifically by the zzso zzso 

One thousand five hundred fifty patients enrolled in 2 of the 3 arms of the zzso study were included in the analysis zzso zzso 770 and zzso zzso zzso zzso with data reported by the investigators in the New England Journal of zzso 

The major finding was that there were no significant differences in overall safety and clinically important efficacy between zzso and zzso 

Considering the substantial difference in costs and with the increasing volume of high-risk cardiac surgery, zzso has increased zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso should be the zzso medication of choice for high-risk cardiac zzso
