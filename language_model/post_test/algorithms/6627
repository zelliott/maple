zzso To compare the performance of three zzso zzso developed to predict whether the total lung capacity (TLC) is reduced vs normal or increased, zzso to determine if forced zzso volume at 6 s zzso can be zzso for zzso in these zzso and zzso to determine if zzso bias was present in patients referred for the measurement of zzso and TLC compared to patients referred for zzso zzso 

We analyzed the results of 219 zzso consecutive patients referred to a New Zealand zzso hospital respiratory laboratory for zzso and TLC zzso zzso results from 370 patients referred for zzso but not lung volumes were used to test for potential zzso zzso zzso results were analyzed using the lower limit of normal zzso values from the third National Health and Nutrition zzso Study reference zzso The equations of Goldman and zzso and zzso were used to zzso TLC as normal or zzso zzso operator characteristic zzso were used to produce an zzso using the zzso for zzso and zzso The performances of previous zzso and our own zzso were analyzed for predicting a reduced lung volume against the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All three zzso predicted a reduced TLC with an accuracy of approximately zzso In contrast, all zzso predicted TLC was either normal or increased with an accuracy of zzso or zzso zzso regardless of the reference set zzso The zzso based on zzso performed equally as well as the zzso zzso No zzso bias was zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso zzso can accurately predict when TLC is either normal or increased, and can also increase the a zzso probability that TLC is reduced to approximately zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso in these zzso
