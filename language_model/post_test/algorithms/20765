We compared the effect of oxygen on the zzso index zzso in six zzso sleep zzso patients with a relatively high loop gain zzso and six with a low zzso LG is a measure of zzso control zzso In the high LG group zzso zzso control zzso oxygen reduced the LG from zzso to zzso zzso and lowered the zzso by zzso zzso compared to the percent reduction in the low LG zzso In the low LG group zzso zzso control zzso oxygen had no effect on LG zzso on room air, zzso on zzso zzso and very little effect on zzso zzso reduction with zzso These data suggest that zzso instability is an important mechanism causing zzso sleep zzso in some patients zzso with a relatively high zzso since lowering LG with oxygen in these patients significantly reduces zzso
