With the initial completion of Human Genome Project, the zzso era is zzso Although the zzso map of human has been zzso the roles that each segment of sequences acts are not totally zzso On the other hand, with the rapid expansion of sequence information, the issues of data compilation and data storage are increasingly zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso database zzso is designed and implemented in National Taiwan University Hospital zzso By zzso this system, the doctors can store and manage the experimental sequence zzso The achievement of this system is that it zzso the zzso of sequence alignment and data zzso By embedding with the zzso alignment zzso zzso it automatically zzso the uploaded sequences and searches for the corresponding zzso zzso Besides, the system encodes the differences between zzso effectively zzso them and decreases the demand of storage spaces by the zzso ratio at zzso At the same time, it offers a variety of query zzso Users can quickly access the interesting data by zzso the zzso of zzso number, zzso and sequence position, zzso The electronic health record zzso in Health Information System zzso of zzso is also combined in this system and the doctors can zzso the valuable information to figure out the relation between the diseases and zzso With this system, a genetic personal zzso environment will be established in the zzso
