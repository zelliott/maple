zzso zzso zzso offers structural and functional imaging of living biological tissue with highly sensitive optical zzso contrast and excellent spatial resolution comparable to medical ultrasound zzso zzso We report the development of a fully integrated zzso and US zzso imaging system, which performs signal zzso image zzso and display for both zzso zzso and US imaging all in a truly real-time zzso The zzso zzso zzso for PA image reconstruction is zzso to reduce the zzso cost and facilitate parallel zzso on a state of the art graphics processing unit zzso zzso For the first time, zzso and US imaging of the same object can be conducted simultaneously and zzso at a real-time frame rate, presently limited by the laser repetition rate of 10 zzso zzso zzso and US imaging of human peripheral zzso in zzso were zzso demonstrating the satisfactory image quality realized with this zzso Another experiment, simultaneous zzso and US imaging of contrast agent flowing through an artificial vessel, was conducted to verify the performance of this system for imaging fast biological zzso The zzso image reconstruction software code for this zzso system is open source and available for download from zzso
