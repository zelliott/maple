zzso zzso remains a major hurdle for zzso stem cell transplantation zzso In 2004, zzso zzso proposed the zzso Web-based tool to estimate the zzso potential between zzso stem cell zzso pairs expressed as a sequence similarity matching zzso zzso is based on the structure of zzso molecules and the functional similarity of zzso zzso According to this algorithm, a high zzso score represents high zzso between zzso zzso resulting in a potentially more deleterious impact on stem cell transplant zzso We investigated the potential of zzso to predict high-risk zzso zzso mismatch combinations responsible for severe acute zzso disease zzso grades III and zzso published by zzso zzso by comparing zzso in low- and high-risk zzso zzso was calculated for zzso mismatch combinations using the zzso tool available on the Web zzso We compared ranges and means of zzso among high-risk (15 combinations observed in zzso zzso zzso versus low-risk zzso combinations zzso combinations in zzso zzso zzso scenarios were created where the zzso zzso zzso was involved in multiple zzso mismatch combinations with at least 1 high-risk and 1 low-risk mismatch zzso zzso values were then zzso The mean zzso for zzso versus low-risk combinations were zzso and zzso at A, zzso and zzso at B, zzso and zzso at C, zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso In simulation scenarios, no predictable zzso association with zzso or low-risk combinations could be zzso No zzso combinations met the statistical criteria for our zzso In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that mean zzso scores were not significantly different, and zzso zzso were overlapping among zzso and low-risk zzso combinations within zzso zzso B, C, zzso and zzso This analysis does not support selecting donors for zzso recipients based on low zzso zzso zzso
