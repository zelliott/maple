An in zzso zzso proposed to systematically characterize and compare cell invasion under different conditions is the collagen gel invasion zzso where cells, initially seeded onto the surface of a type I collagen zzso penetrate the surface and migrate within the gel over zzso Using simplifying assumptions about cell transport across the gel surface and migration within the zzso we formulate and solve a mathematical model of this zzso which predicts the resulting cell distribution based on three zzso parameters characterizing the ability of cells to penetrate the gel surface zzso migrate randomly within the zzso and return to the gel zzso An index of cell zzso is defined based on these parameters that reflects the overall ability of cells to transport across the gel surface zzso that is, invade the zzso Cell concentration profiles predicted by the model zzso well to measured profiles for zzso melanoma cells invading gels supplemented with zzso zzso proteins zzso and type IV collagen as well as zzso gels, allowing these parameters to be estimated by a zzso zzso fit of the model solution to the measured zzso Our analysis suggests that type IV collagen and zzso primarily zzso cell transport across the gel surface interface rather than migration within the zzso Further, we validate the key model assumptions and obtain independent, direct estimates of model parameters by zzso video zzso and digital image analysis of cell penetration of the gel surface and migration within the gel during the zzso
