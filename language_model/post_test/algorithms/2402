zzso zzso analysis is a commonly used method for zzso reaction rates in zzso zzso The choice of carbon labeling pattern is an important consideration when designing these zzso We present a novel zzso Carlo zzso for finding the optimal zzso input label for a particular experimental objective zzso or flux zzso Unlike previous work, this method does not require assumption of the flux distribution zzso 

Using a large zzso coli zzso model, different commercially available zzso labeling patterns were tested zzso for their ability to determine reaction zzso The choice of optimal labeled zzso was found to be dependent upon the desired experimental zzso Many commercially available labels are predicted to be outperformed by complex labeling zzso Based on zzso Carlo zzso the zzso of experimental data was found to be considerably less than anticipated, suggesting that effectiveness of zzso experiments for determining reaction zzso across a large-scale zzso network is less than previously zzso 

While zzso analysis is a useful tool in systems biology, high zzso in zzso limits the information that can be obtained from each zzso It is however possible to zzso potential limitations before an experiment is run and predict whether, and to what degree, the rate of each reaction can be zzso
