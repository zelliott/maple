We present zzso an integrated zzso pipeline to zzso refine and discover protein coding genes using zzso mass zzso zzso data from zzso To demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso we analyzed zzso data of zzso zzso zzso a model zzso to study zzso important zzso zzso Our analysis confirmed zzso of known zzso refined 49 gene models for their translation initiation site zzso and discovered 59 novel protein coding zzso zzso a novel protein which zzso the boundary of a crucial zzso zzso system related zzso was discovered, known to be highly expressed in the zzso symbiotic zzso A focused analysis on zzso zzso peptides indicated downstream zzso for gene zzso Finally, zzso analysis revealed three novel genes in recently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The discovery of large number of missing genes and correction of gene models have expanded the zzso landscape of zzso zzso and presents an unparalleled utility of zzso analyses and versatility of zzso for zzso zzso zzso including zzso
