zzso delivery follows a planned leaf zzso which is zzso before treatment zzso However, it is hard to model real-time variations, such as zzso in the planning zzso In this paper, we propose a negative feedback system of zzso delivery that incorporates real-time zzso to account for zzso zzso Specifically, we developed a feasible zzso of real-time zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso delivery is characterized by thousands of projections with a fast projection rate and zzso zzso leaf zzso The technique of zzso delivery zzso zzso the zzso dose that has been delivered up to any given projection during the delivery and zzso the future dose that will be delivered based on the estimated motion probability and future zzso zzso These two pieces of information are then used to zzso the leaf open time of the upcoming projection right before its zzso It consists of several real-time procedures, including zzso detection and zzso zzso dose zzso zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso requires that all procedures are executed in time less than the duration of a zzso We implemented and tested this technique using a zzso research zzso The zzso calculation took about 100 zzso per zzso We calculated and compared zzso delivery with two other types of delivery, zzso delivery zzso and zzso delivery zzso using simulated zzso cases, real zzso plans and the motion traces from clinical lung and prostate zzso The results showed that the proposed technique effectively compensated for motion errors of all test zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso delivery approached those of zzso for regular and irregular zzso with a zzso zzso of 3 zzso and for medium and large prostate zzso The results zzso proved that the proposed method is zzso for real-time motion compensation in zzso zzso Extension of the method to real-time zzso radiation therapy zzso that compensates for all kinds of delivery errors was zzso Further validation and clinical zzso is zzso
