In this paper, we propose a new scheme that zzso zzso and zzso information for object zzso To obtain zzso against zzso changes, zzso derivatives are zzso zzso Color zzso is an important aspect of any object recognition zzso as color changes considerably with the variation in zzso object pose, and camera zzso These color zzso derivatives are then used to obtain similarity zzso shape zzso Shape zzso is equally important as, under a change in camera viewpoint and object pose, the shape of a rigid object zzso a perspective projection on the image zzso Then, the color and shape zzso are combined in a zzso zzso context which is subsequently used as an zzso As the indexing scheme makes use of a zzso zzso context, it provides a zzso information cue robust against varying imaging zzso The matching function of the zzso context allows for fast recognition, even in the presence of object zzso and zzso From the experimental results, it is shown that the method recognizes rigid objects with high accuracy in 3-D complex scenes and is robust against changing zzso camera viewpoint, object pose, and zzso
