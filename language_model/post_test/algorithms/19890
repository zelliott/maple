We introduce an zzso for diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging data enhancement based on structural zzso smoothing in both zzso space and zzso zzso The method, called zzso does not refer to a specific model for the data, like the diffusion zzso or higher order zzso It works by embedding the measurement space into a space with defined zzso in this case the Lie group of three-dimensional zzso motion zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the values of the diffusion weighted signal are used for zzso zzso preserves the edges of the observed fine and zzso zzso It is designed to reduce noise directly in the diffusion weighted images and consequently also to reduce bias and zzso of quantities derived from the data for specific zzso We evaluate the zzso on simulated and experimental data and demonstrate that it can be used to reduce the number of applied diffusion zzso and hence acquisition time while achieving a similar quality of data, or to improve the quality of data acquired in a clinically feasible scan time zzso
