This work presents a quantitative description, by means of a mathematical model, of zzso removal during zzso zzso zzso System zzso The model includes four zzso two for the patient, and two for the zzso zzso zzso in each compartment express mass preservation, mass exchange between zzso and zzso binding zzso Model development and validation are based on in zzso data of zzso concentration acquired in eight sessions at different times during the zzso The accuracy of the model in zzso real data is high zzso in blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if three zzso representing the zzso efficacy of the system (the zzso of the blood filter and the initial and final clearance of the zzso elements in the zzso zzso are estimated on each single zzso However, model accuracy is only slightly deteriorated zzso in blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if a single set of parameters zzso the three parameters at their mean zzso is zzso These results suggest that the model may be used a zzso zzso using a single set of zzso to achieve a satisfactory prediction of the overall zzso zzso as well as a zzso for the zzso of device zzso The latter use may allow the investigation of the dependence of these parameters on the operative and clinical conditions, in the effort to arrive at a rationalization and zzso of the zzso
