zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate zzso parameters of the zzso A zzso 18 zzso association zzso We have calculated the zzso parameters zzso zzso heat capacity, and free energy of zzso of the zzso zzso All but two methods described in the literature underestimate the affinity to zzso of zzso We found that the association constant zzso zzso at 10 degrees zzso of zzso to zzso is in close agreement with the zzso of the reported zzso constant of the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso of the zzso parameters in zzso solution of water, zzso zzso and zzso leads to the conclusion that the highly specific binding of zzso to zzso is mainly zzso through hydrogen bonding and to a lesser degree through zzso zzso Furthermore, the pH dependence of the association constant was determined and analyzed according to a single zzso linkage model, resulting in a zzso value of zzso in free zzso and below zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using different single component buffers possessing different zzso of zzso allowed us to estimate that statistically half a zzso is transferred upon zzso binding from the binding interface of zzso to the buffer at pH zzso No zzso transfer was detected at pH zzso The zzso results are discussed in relation to the published X-ray and zzso structure of the free and zzso zzso zzso
