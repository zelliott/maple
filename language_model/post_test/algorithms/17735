In this paper, we propose an zzso that, using the extended Kalman zzso zzso the inverse problem of zzso the zzso distribution in electrical zzso zzso zzso The zzso estimates zzso in a wide zzso The purpose of this investigation is to provide information for setting and controlling air volume and pressure delivered to patients under artificial zzso We show that, when the standard zzso of the measurement noise level raises up to zzso of the zzso measured zzso the zzso estimates zzso to the expected zzso within zzso accuracy of the zzso zzso value, under zzso simulations, with spatial a zzso zzso A zzso identification procedure is zzso A zzso phantom with saline solution is used for experimental zzso An abrupt modification on the zzso distribution of this solution is caused by the immersion of a glass zzso Estimates of zzso contact zzso and images of the glass object are zzso
