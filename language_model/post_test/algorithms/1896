A novel zzso is presented to segment and reconstruct injected bone cement from a sparse set of X-ray images acquired at arbitrary zzso The sparse X-ray zzso active zzso zzso zzso can 1) reconstruct objects for which the background partially zzso the object in X-ray images, 2) use X-ray images acquired on a zzso zzso and 3) incorporate prior zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso X-ray images, their associated pose information, and prior CT, if zzso The zzso zzso automated reconstruction using visual zzso zzso from a sparse number of X-ray zzso It then improves the accuracy of the reconstruction by zzso a zzso active zzso zzso with mathematical zzso demonstrate improvements over a conventional silhouette based approach, and a zzso experiment demonstrates zzso ability to reconstruct high contrast bone cement that has been injected into a zzso and achieve zzso accuracy with four zzso
