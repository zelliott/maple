Previous work has shown that the zzso of anatomical structures on zzso ultrasound data sets provides an important tool for the assessment of the fetal zzso In this work, we present an zzso based on a zzso statistical shape model to segment the fetal zzso on zzso ultrasound zzso This model is adjusted using an ad hoc objective function which is in turn zzso using the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso was tested on ultrasound volumes of the fetal brain taken from 20 pregnant women, between 18 and 24 zzso zzso An zzso correlation zzso of zzso and a mean zzso zzso of zzso between zzso volumes measured using manual techniques and the volumes calculated using our zzso were zzso As far as we know, this is the first effort to automatically segment fetal zzso structures on zzso ultrasound zzso
