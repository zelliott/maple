We present an improved statistical model for analyzing zzso zzso with applications to zzso zzso We build on previous work, adopting a zzso representation of the zzso process in which the ratios of the underlying zzso zzso zzso in adjacent scales are modeled as zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our main contributions include: 1) a rigorous and robust zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso density parameters directly from the noisy observed zzso data zzso 2) extension of the method to work under a zzso hidden zzso tree model zzso which couples the mixture label assignments in consecutive zzso thus modeling zzso zzso zzso in the vicinity of image zzso 3) exploration of a zzso zzso zzso image zzso involving zzso zzso zzso instead of the conventional zzso zzso image representation involving zzso zzso zzso and 4) a novel zzso image zzso which we term zzso decomposition, that better models the image edge structure, thus yielding improved zzso Experimental results on standard images with artificially simulated zzso noise and on real zzso images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
