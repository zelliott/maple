A zzso multiple alignment strategy is presented that allows rapid alignment of a set of zzso sequences and comparison of zzso groups of zzso Examples are given demonstrating the improvement in the quality of alignments when comparing entire groups instead of single zzso The modular design of computer programs based on this zzso allows for storage of aligned sequences and successive alignment of any number of zzso
