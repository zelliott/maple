We have derived a zzso equation for computing the direction of an zzso zzso from residual zzso zzso zzso measured in two aligning media, and two simple zzso equations for computing the backbone zzso angles from two backbone zzso in consecutive zzso zzso These equations make it possible to zzso exactly and in constant time, the backbone zzso angles for a zzso from zzso in two media on any single backbone zzso zzso Building upon these exact solutions we have designed a novel zzso for determining a protein backbone zzso consisting of zzso and zzso Our zzso employs a systematic search technique to refine the zzso of both zzso and zzso and to determine their zzso using exclusively the angular restraints from zzso The zzso zzso the backbone zzso employing very sparse distance restraints between pairs of zzso and zzso refined by the systematic zzso The zzso has been demonstrated on the protein human zzso using only backbone zzso zzso plus twelve hydrogen bonds and four zzso distance zzso Further, our results show that both the global zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso can be determined with high accuracy using only two zzso per zzso The zzso requires, as its zzso backbone resonance assignments, the identification of zzso and zzso as well as sparse zzso distance and hydrogen bond zzso
