In a previous study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 275 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a lower systemic zzso supply was found in zzso with zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the lower systemic zzso supply results in increased zzso zzso we used zzso to investigate zzso zzso in eight zzso zzso with zzso and eight control zzso at rest and during moderate exercise zzso 50% of peak zzso consumption zzso The mean zzso shunt fraction in the shunt zzso was 55 zzso zzso of pulmonary blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and the rate of appearance zzso and disappearance zzso of zzso were similar in shunt and control zzso both at rest zzso 1, 201 zzso 76 zzso zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and during a similar relative zzso We found a positive correlation between zzso and systemic blood flow, zzso supply, and zzso in both groups of zzso In conclusion, shunt zzso have similar zzso zzso as do control zzso both at rest and during moderate exercise at a similar fraction of their peak zzso despite a lower systemic zzso zzso
