zzso smoothing methods are used to model zzso data, but the challenge remains to incorporate correlation into zzso zzso zzso In this article, we propose an efficient zzso procedure for zzso models for zzso zzso The proposed procedure can easily take into account correlation within subjects and deal directly with both continuous and discrete response zzso data under the framework of generalized linear zzso The proposed approach yields a more efficient zzso than the generalized zzso equation approach when the working correlation is zzso For zzso models, it is often of interest to test whether zzso functions are time varying or time zzso We propose a unified and efficient zzso hypothesis testing zzso and further demonstrate that the resulting test statistics have an zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso test is applied to test whether the model assumption is zzso The corresponding test is also useful for choosing basis functions and the number of knots for zzso zzso models in conjunction with the model selection zzso We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures with zzso Carlo simulation zzso The proposed methodology is illustrated by the analysis of an acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso data zzso
