Not all proteins form well defined three-dimensional structures in their native zzso Some zzso sequences appear to strongly zzso the zzso state, whereas some can apparently transition between zzso and ordered states under the influence of changes in the biological environment, thereby playing an important role in processes such as zzso Although important biologically, for the structural biologist zzso regions of proteins can be disastrous even preventing successful structure zzso The accurate prediction of disorder is therefore important, not least for directing the design of expression zzso so as to maximize the chances of successful structure zzso Such design criteria have become integral to the zzso strategies of laboratories within the zzso zzso In Europe zzso zzso This paper zzso the current state of the art in disorder prediction in terms of prediction reliability and considers how best to use these methods to guide construct zzso Finally, it presents a brief discussion as to how methods of prediction might be improved in the zzso
