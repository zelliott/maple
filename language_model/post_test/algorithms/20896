zzso exercise testing with a linear increase in work rate is the recommended method for clinical exercise zzso A recent protocol zzso incorporating a linear increase in speed and a zzso increase in zzso has been developed which addresses some limitations of traditional testing zzso It does not account for those with an impaired gait zzso We propose and assess a novel protocol zzso incorporating zzso increases in both speed and zzso We theoretically develop a new treadmill control protocol zzso determine oxygen zzso response zzso initial zzso rate and zzso response parameters zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso and compare the outcome measures with two previously verified zzso protocols (A and C zzso speed with linear increase in zzso zzso and outcomes were explored with a subject with incomplete spinal zzso zzso The average initial zzso rate zzso was substantially lower during protocol A zzso zzso zzso zzso and protocol B zzso zzso zzso zzso than during protocol C zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso of the zzso response during protocols A and B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of determination zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were higher than during protocol C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of determination zzso zzso The average dynamic zzso cost for protocol C zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower than that of protocol A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protocol B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were found in these parameters between protocols A and zzso The new protocol B performs better than protocol C and is comparable with protocol zzso When testing subjects with an impaired gait pattern, it may be advantageous to use the new protocol B due to the gradual increases in both speed and zzso throughout the zzso
