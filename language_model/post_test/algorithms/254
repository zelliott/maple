zzso such as zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso decoupling have been shown to yield high-resolution zzso zzso at high zzso spinning zzso zzso of zzso This is at zzso to the commonly held notion that these methods require zzso zzso not comparable to the cycle zzso of the pulse zzso Here, a theoretical argument, based on zzso zzso theory, is presented to explain this aspect together with conditions where zzso type of schemes may be successful at high zzso zzso
