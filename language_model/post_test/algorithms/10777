The task of zzso zzso is a crucial step in the analysis of zzso images which is an important application of computer vision to zzso The zzso presented in this article was composed of two steps: zzso the zzso zzso zzso the ameliorated watershed zzso In the first step, the difference between zzso was magnified in order to increase the visibility from the view of the computer vision, and then the ameliorated zzso watershed method was used to achieve the zzso of zzso images in the second zzso To test the performance of the algorithm, different samples of visual quality were tested and the result figures proved zzso
