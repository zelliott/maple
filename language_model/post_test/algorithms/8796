In this paper, a zzso goal for a zzso speech separation system is zzso Since this goal is derived by maximizing the zzso ratio zzso it is called the optimal ratio mask zzso Under the approximate zzso zzso assumption which almost always holds due to the sparse nature of speech, theoretical analysis shows that the zzso can improve the zzso about zzso zzso over the ideal ratio zzso With three kinds of real-world zzso the speech separation results of zzso gain and objective quality evaluation demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis, and imply that the zzso achieves a better separation zzso
