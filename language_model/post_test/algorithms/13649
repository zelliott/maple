Often zzso models already exist for parts of a geometry being simulated using zzso zzso import of these zzso models into zzso however, may not be possible and complex components may be difficult to define via other zzso Solutions that allow for users to work around the limited support in the zzso zzso for loading zzso zzso zzso have been presented by others, however these solutions require intermediate file format conversion using commercial zzso Here within we describe a technique that allows for zzso models to be directly loaded as geometry without the need for commercial software and intermediate file format zzso zzso of the interface was tested using a set of zzso models of various zzso for the models used in testing, no import errors were reported and all geometry was found to be navigable by zzso
