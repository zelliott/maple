Online control of movement requires complex integration of zzso central zzso and peripheral sensory feedback zzso We studied the hand zzso of human subjects pointing to visual targets that abruptly changed locations by different amounts and modeled the mechanism of rapid online correction using a dynamic model of a zzso zzso Small zzso and large detected target zzso could be attributed to different origins zzso execution errors zzso environmental changes, zzso and compensated zzso However, the behavioral findings indicate that the rapid feedback zzso is recruited regardless of the zzso or zzso awareness of target displacement and that the size of the earliest correction is always zzso to the zzso of the target displacement over the tested range of zzso The modeling findings suggest that the rapid online corrections can be accomplished by zzso a zzso appropriate error correction signal onto the outgoing zzso motor command to the original zzso Furthermore, the modeling shows that the online correction mechanism must include compensation for the dynamic mechanical properties of the limb and for sensory delays in its zzso zzso
