The structure of the zzso cellulose zzso zzso zzso in solution has been determined via zzso zzso with zzso substitution zzso computer modeling and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso This study shows direct evidence for an zzso hydrogen bond between the reducing ring zzso zzso group and the zzso ring oxygen zzso that has been previously predicted by zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, this work shows that hydrogen bonding to the zzso ring zzso oxygen is shared between water and the zzso zzso group with an average of 50% occupancy by each zzso zzso The zzso zzso angles zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso model show a fairly tight distribution of angles around approximately zzso and zzso respectively, in solution, consistent with the zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso angles for both reducing and zzso rings are broadly consistent with the zzso zzso in this study, as well as with those from previous zzso for zzso in zzso
