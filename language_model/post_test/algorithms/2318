The goals of the work reported by this article are zzso The first is to develop a dynamic zzso framework for analysis of equipment setup problems in endurance zzso The second is to illustrate the application of the approach by determining an optimal zzso zzso To achieve these goals, a mathematical model of the zzso motion for given zzso of the net joint moments and the rate of change of the zzso radius was zzso and zzso zzso was posed as an optimal control zzso The cost functional produced a zzso shape that reduced the cost of endurance cycling at 250 W and 90 zzso apparently by taking advantage of mechanical interactions that arise as a natural consequence of the zzso However, the predicted joint moments required larger peak values during zzso of significantly increased joint zzso Thus, the zzso performance predicted by the cost functional appears opposed to expectations based on muscle mechanics and illustrates the need for further analysis of endurance cycling with a zzso based cost zzso
