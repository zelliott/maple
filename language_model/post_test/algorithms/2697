This work introduces the zzso zzso zzso rule zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nearest zzso zzso since it accepts objects on the basis of their nearest neighbor distances in a reference set of objects, also called zzso For a suitable choice of the zzso set, the zzso zzso is equivalent to another nearest zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, it zzso statistical tests for zzso zzso The concept of a zzso consistent subset is introduced, which exploits only a selected subset of the training zzso It is shown that computing a minimum size zzso consistent subset is, in general, not zzso within any constant zzso A zzso approximation factor algorithm, called the zzso algorithm, for computing a minimum size zzso consistent subset is then zzso In order to efficiently manage very large data sets, a zzso of the basic rule, called Fast zzso is also zzso Experimental results show that the zzso rule zzso improves over the zzso zzso namely the condensed zzso of zzso in terms of size of the subset while guaranteeing a comparable zzso quality, that it is competitive over other zzso zzso methods and is suitable to zzso large data zzso
