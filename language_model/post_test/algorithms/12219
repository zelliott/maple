In this study to identify the origin of zzso in the atmosphere of zzso and investigate the zzso conditions for these zzso the variations of the mass concentration and size distribution of zzso have been zzso This study is focused on the local environmental impact of zzso zzso zzso All samples have been taken in the area between the plant and the city entrance at the wind zzso The result of this research shows that the zzso concentration in the ambient air in distances about zzso m from the stacks is higher than the WHO guidelines of annual average zzso zzso Also, concentration of zzso is zzso by using zzso plume model that incorporates source related factors and meteorological factors to estimate zzso concentration from continuous zzso The performance of this model has been compared with the measured zzso
