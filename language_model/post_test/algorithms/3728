In this paper, we present a novel face detection approach based on a zzso neural architecture, designed to robustly detect highly variable face patterns, rotated up to zzso degrees in image plane and turned up to zzso degrees, in complex real world zzso The proposed system automatically zzso simple zzso feature zzso from a training set of face and zzso patterns, without making any assumptions or using any zzso design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to zzso The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple zzso and zzso zzso that treat the raw input image as a zzso We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local zzso before zzso of image zzso The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false zzso demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult zzso We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of zzso of the face zzso
