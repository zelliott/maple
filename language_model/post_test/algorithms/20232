Our study used newly developed zzso DNA zzso zzso on 183 zzso zzso performing the tests on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The probe results were verified using the conventional method as a zzso 

The probe for zzso tuberculosis complex correctly identified 131 of 133 zzso tuberculosis zzso with two false zzso and no false zzso for a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso The zzso zzso probe correctly identified 27 out of 27 zzso zzso zzso with no false zzso and one false positive, for a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso One hundred zzso of the 183 zzso were screened in accordance with an algorithm, designed primarily for the rapid detection and identification of zzso zzso 

The use of the zzso considerably reduced detection time: zzso tuberculosis strains were identified within zzso zzso zzso days, while identification by conventional method required zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso testing resulted in a cost increase of zzso
