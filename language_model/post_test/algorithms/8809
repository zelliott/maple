zzso zzso Data collection Algorithm utilizing a zzso zzso in zzso supports automated zzso data collection and backbone and side chain assignment for zzso zzso zzso Given the sequence of the protein and data for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso planes, the zzso automatically directs the collection of zzso plane data from a variety of zzso experiments so as to follow an efficient zzso toward the zzso assignment of zzso zzso and zzso signals to specific atoms in the zzso structure of the zzso Data collection and assignment calculations continue until the addition of new data no longer improves the assignment zzso zzso was first implemented on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PLoS One 7 zzso zzso Because of broader interest in the approach, we present here a version of zzso for zzso zzso We have developed two zzso console programs zzso and zzso that run under zzso Versions zzso and zzso To illustrate the performance of the zzso on a zzso zzso we tested one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that had been used with the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso versions achieved the same level of assignment zzso zzso in 20 zzso As a more rigorous evaluation of the zzso version, we tested a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which yielded an automated assignment zzso of zzso in 55 zzso Both experiments were carried out on a 500 zzso zzso zzso III zzso equipped with a zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso is available at zzso in the form of pulse programs, the two zzso programs, and instructions for installation and zzso
