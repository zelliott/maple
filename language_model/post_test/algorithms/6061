zzso zzso is an eye movement measurement method used in the objective evaluation of zzso zzso zzso An important requirement of zzso is to accurately estimate zzso center and zzso zzso irrespective of drooping zzso zzso zzso reflection, and zzso Finding the accurate center of the zzso is particularly important in three-dimensional zzso since otherwise, significant errors can occur in measuring zzso eye zzso A fast zzso was proposed to accurately ascertain the zzso center, in spite of the complicating factors mentioned zzso In this study, real-time three-dimensional zzso which can measure zzso zzso and zzso eye movements and calculate the zzso zzso was implemented using the proposed zzso When the zzso radius was determined, the vertical position was measured within an error margin of less than zzso even though only zzso of the zzso was zzso The time required to measure both three-dimensional eye movements and the zzso radius was less than 16 zzso Thus, eye movements can be measured in zzso The resolutions of zzso zzso and zzso eye movement were zzso degrees, zzso degrees, and zzso degrees, respectively, with maximum ranges of zzso 35 degrees, zzso 25 degrees, and zzso 18 zzso
