In order to describe a cell at molecular level, a notion of a zzso is neither necessary nor zzso It is sufficient to consider the molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and their interactions to describe cellular zzso The downside of the resulting high resolution is that it becomes very tedious to address features on the zzso and zzso levels with a language based on molecular zzso Looking for the missing link between biological disciplines dealing with different levels of biological organization, we suggest to return to the original intent behind the term zzso To this end, we propose to investigate whether a useful notion of zzso can be constructed based on an underlying notion of function, and whether this can serve as the necessary link and zzso the various distinct gene concepts of biological zzso in a coherent theoretical zzso In reply to the zzso zzso recently put forward by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this journal, we shall discuss a general approach to assess a gene definition that should then be tested for its zzso and potential zzso zzso
