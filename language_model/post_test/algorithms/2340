With the use of zzso zzso in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of white matter in patients with closed head injury zzso and healthy controls are zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso scores are zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso 10) and healthy control subjects zzso zzso 10) underwent MRS examinations using a zzso acquisition mode pulse sequence that provided 2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso volume of interest in the left zzso white zzso zzso zzso ratios relative to zzso were obtained using a zzso zzso 

The specific feature in patients with zzso was significant decrease of zzso zzso ratio compared with normal zzso No clear correlation of other zzso ratios such as zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The level of zzso ratio was significantly correlated with zzso 

zzso of this preliminary study suggest that the reduction of zzso ratio may indicate zzso loss in patients with zzso The zzso ratio may serve as a zzso criterion to predict the zzso of patients with zzso Thus, in zzso zzso MRS may be a useful zzso in the clinical evaluation of patients with zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso of cerebral white zzso
