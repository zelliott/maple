zzso are complex, and difficult to zzso in a zzso zzso The lack of comprehensive zzso data can prevent or distort zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso a zzso method that enables in zzso zzso zzso Drawing on the principle that similar gene expression patterns are likely to be associated with similar zzso patterns, zzso supplements the missing quantitative zzso information for a given zzso zzso based on other zzso zzso zzso We applied our method to 587 human zzso zzso covering zzso samples, and confirmed that the predicted zzso profiles are highly consistent with true zzso zzso zzso offers several unique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the analysis and treatment design of complex diseases; zzso the zzso of zzso profiles beyond provided zzso and zzso the detection of zzso zzso factors that could otherwise bias biological zzso Finally, because no direct comparisons are made between gene expression values from different zzso the method can use the entire body of zzso zzso zzso This work has produced a compendium of zzso profiles for the National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso zzso which can facilitate an unbiased understanding of the zzso zzso The continued zzso of zzso data will further increase the power of zzso by increasing the variety and the quality of zzso to be zzso
