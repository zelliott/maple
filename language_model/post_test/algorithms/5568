zzso trees or zzso for short, are trees whose leaves are labeled by elements of some zzso finite set X such that more than one leaf may be labeled by the same element of zzso This class of trees includes zzso trees and tree zzso zzso arise naturally in, for example, zzso and gene evolution studies and also in the area of zzso network zzso In this paper, we introduce novel metrics which may be used to compare zzso most of which zzso well-known metrics on zzso trees and tree zzso These metrics can be used, for example, to better understand the space of zzso or to help zzso collections of zzso In addition, we describe some relationships between the zzso metrics that we present and also give some novel diameter bounds for these zzso We conclude by briefly discussing some open problems as well as pointing out how zzso metrics may be used to define metrics on the space of zzso zzso
