We present experiments and analyses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies of zebra zzso skull zzso The thin and hollow structure of these birds' skulls is quite translucent, which can allow in zzso zzso zzso imaging for brain zzso zzso However, the skull structure is also quite complex, with high zzso index changes on a zzso zzso These studies aim at exploring the geometrical and scattering properties of these skull samples with the use of several zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the study of the zzso zzso exponential zzso is used to estimate the scattering zzso of the zzso Finally, zzso imaging experiments of a fluorescent object located beneath the skull are carried zzso It reveals that zzso zzso can be collected through the skull with a strong zzso It also reveals that the spatial resolution loss is quite high and cannot be fully explained by the bulk scattering properties of the bone, but also by the presence of the high zzso index zzso of this zzso skull zzso Even if the optical properties of the skull are different during in zzso experiments, these preliminary studies are aimed at preparing and zzso zzso brain zzso monitoring experiments on zzso
