This study aimed to compare combined zzso coaching with audio coaching alone and assess their respective impact on the zzso of external breathing motion and, one step further, on the internal lung tumor motion itself, through successive zzso Thirteen patients with zzso were enrolled in this zzso The tumor motion was assessed by three to four successive zzso CT sessions, while the breathing signal was measured from magnetic sensors positioned on the zzso zzso For all sessions, the breathing was zzso with either audio coaching alone zzso zzso zzso 5) or combined with a real-time visual feedback zzso zzso zzso 8) when tolerated by the zzso zzso zzso period and signal shape of both breathing and tumor motions were first zzso Then, the correlation between the respiratory signal and internal tumor motion over time was zzso as well as the residual tumor motion for a gated zzso Although breathing and tumor motions were comparable between zzso and zzso groups, zzso approach achieved better zzso through sessions than zzso alone zzso tumor motion of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean breathing motion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High zzso correlation zzso was achieved in the zzso tumor motion direction for all zzso For the anterior zzso tumor motion direction, better correlation zzso has been observed when visual feedback has been zzso For a zzso gating approach, zzso might also be recommended, since it led to smaller residual tumor motion within clinically relevant duty zzso This study suggests that combining real-time visual feedback with audio coaching might improve the zzso of key characteristics of the breathing pattern, and might thus be considered in the zzso of lung tumor zzso
