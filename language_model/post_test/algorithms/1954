zzso zzso of bone zzso plays a significant role in understanding bone mechanics and response to disease or zzso zzso peripheral quantitative zzso zzso zzso allows for the zzso of zzso and cortical structure in zzso with the capability of generating images at multiple zzso sizes zzso 82, and zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of zzso size on structural measures of zzso and cortical bone and to determine accuracy in reference to zzso zzso zzso the gold standard for bone zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from human zzso specimens were zzso at each zzso zzso size and subsequently zzso using zzso zzso Bone density and zzso assessment was performed in both the zzso and cortical zzso including cortical zzso zzso Two distinct analysis techniques were applied to the zzso zzso zzso the standard clinical indirect analysis and a direct analysis requiring no density or structural model zzso Analysis parameters were adjusted to enable zzso and structure extraction at each zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso measures, the zzso zzso data displayed the strongest correlations and smallest errors compared to zzso zzso zzso The direct analysis technique applied to the zzso data yielded an additional improvement in zzso especially for measures of zzso zzso The zzso data performed poorly, with all zzso measures either having moderate or zzso correlations with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measures showed strong correlations to zzso zzso data across all zzso zzso zzso thickness was strongly correlated with zzso zzso values across all zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of cortical zzso parameters was highly dependent on zzso size; again, the zzso data was most strongly zzso zzso of cortical density and pore diameter at all zzso zzso sizes had either weak or zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the effect of zzso size on the accuracy of zzso zzso of zzso and cortical zzso and presents parameters for zzso analysis at zzso zzso For all parameters measured, correlations were strongest at zzso zzso correlations for zzso measures indicate that a better understanding of pore structure and resolution dependence is zzso
