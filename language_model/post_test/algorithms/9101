zzso gene zzso networks obtained from experimental expression data coupled with efficient zzso procedures are increasingly used to identify potentially relevant biological information zzso zzso for a particular zzso However, zzso networks built from experimental expression data are in general large highly connected networks with an elevated number of zzso interactions zzso and zzso In order to zzso relevant information, the network must be properly filtered and its complexity zzso Given the complexity and the zzso nature of the information contained in the network, this requires the development and application of efficient feature selection zzso to be able to exploit the zzso characteristics of the network to identify relevant zzso and zzso This paper proposes an efficient zzso filtering designed to analyze the zzso properties of a zzso network in order to identify potential relevant genes for a given zzso The zzso has been tested on three zzso for three well known and studied zzso acute zzso zzso breast cancer, and diffuse large zzso zzso zzso have been validated resorting to zzso data automatically zzso using the zzso literature mining zzso
