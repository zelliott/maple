Analysis of strain and the study of zzso moments of a zzso object is of utmost importance in zzso testing and zzso In digital holographic zzso zzso this information is zzso respectively, by the first and zzso derivatives of the interference zzso This paper introduces zzso instantaneous moments based approach for the simultaneous measurement of zzso strain and zzso zzso of a zzso object in zzso zzso and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method in accurately providing the direct zzso of the zzso zzso corresponding to the interference phase and its derivatives in a zzso efficient zzso
