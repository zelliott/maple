zzso based on zzso have been useful in deciphering the dynamics of protein zzso events in living cells at zzso resolutions and in time scales of zzso These new systems allow observations of dynamic processes which were not possible previously using more traditional zzso and cell biological zzso The image data sets obtained from these sensors require careful processing in order to represent the actual protein zzso zzso Here, we will cover the basic approaches useful for processing the raw image data sets into zzso zzso zzso capable of depicting relative differences in the protein zzso states within a single zzso We will discuss in detail the approaches for genetically zzso zzso zzso systems based on zzso as well as those that are based on zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the same analysis can be zzso for zzso systems using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso useful for detection of zzso protein zzso zzso
