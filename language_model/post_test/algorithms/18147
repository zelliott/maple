zzso articulated shape and motion, especially human body motion, from video is a challenging problem with a wide range of applications in medical study, sport analysis and animation, zzso Previous work on articulated motion recovery generally requires prior knowledge of the zzso chain and usually does not concern the recovery of the articulated zzso The zzso of some articulated part, zzso human body motion with zzso facial motion, is completely zzso We propose a zzso approach to recover the shape, motion and zzso chain of an articulated object with zzso parts altogether directly from video sequences under a unified zzso The proposed approach is based on our modeling of the articulated zzso motion as a set of zzso motion zzso A motion zzso is the linear zzso of the zzso of an zzso It can model a rigid or zzso zzso The intersection of two motion zzso of linked parts models the motion of an articulated joint or zzso Our approach consists of zzso for motion zzso zzso chain building, and shape zzso It handles zzso and can be zzso We test our approach through synthetic and real experiments and demonstrate how to recover articulated structure with zzso parts via a zzso camera without prior knowledge of its zzso zzso
