The paper proposes the zzso of cardiac zzso in accordance with a generalized scheme of transition from regular conditions to random changes, which makes it possible to conclude that the occurrence of more menacing zzso in patients with zzso zzso may suggest that there is a risk for random disorders, as well as to recommend to change pacing parameters and even to replace the zzso At present the authors are conducting zzso studies of the proposed approach in the zzso zzso The zzso of search for the facts of complication of the dynamic behavior of the system is based on the odd set theory which is presently most promising for designing zzso monitoring zzso The new approach suggests that there are changes in the dynamics of zzso and hence it will be of practical value in treating all zzso zzso
