The inaccuracy of copy number variation zzso detection on single zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been brought to zzso Such high error rates will undoubtedly have ramifications on downstream association zzso We examined this effect for a wide range of scenarios and found a noticeable decrease in power for error rates typical of zzso calling zzso We compared power using zzso calls to the log relative ratio and found the latter to be superior when error rates are moderate to large or when the zzso size is zzso It is our recommendation that zzso researchers use intensity zzso as an alternative to zzso calls in these zzso
