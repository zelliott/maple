When zzso zzso features from zzso data, current methods rarely concern themselves with the data zzso In this paper, we present an assumption that is consistent with the viewpoint of discrimination, that is, a person's overall zzso data should be regarded as one class in the input space, and his different zzso data can form different zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso we propose a novel zzso feature extraction and recognition approach based on zzso zzso analysis zzso Specifically, one person's different zzso are treated as different zzso of one class, and a transformed space is zzso where the difference among zzso belonging to different persons is zzso and the difference within each zzso is zzso Then, the obtained zzso features are used for zzso Two solutions are presented to overcome the zzso problem encountered in zzso which are using zzso zzso and employing the generalized singular value decomposition zzso technique, zzso Further, we provide zzso extensions of SDA based zzso feature zzso that is, the feature fusion based on zzso and zzso In zzso we first apply zzso zzso on each single modal before performing zzso While in zzso we directly perform zzso SDA to fuse zzso data by applying zzso to avoid the singular zzso For simplicity two typical types of zzso data are considered in this paper, zzso zzso data and face zzso Compared with several representative zzso zzso recognition methods, experimental results show that our approaches outperform related zzso recognition methods and zzso achieves the best recognition zzso
