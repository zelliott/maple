An zzso zzso method has been developed to predict beta zzso in zzso The approach predicts the zzso of zzso and zzso bridges through a novel zzso mathematical framework originally established for chemical process synthesis zzso Two types of superstructure are introduced, both of which zzso from the principle that zzso interactions drive the formation of a zzso The mathematical zzso of the problem results in a set of zzso linear programming zzso problems that can be solved to global zzso to identify the optimal zzso These zzso models can also predict a ranked ordered list of the best, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The approach is shown to perform very well for several benchmark zzso systems, as well as zzso exhibiting challenging zzso zzso zzso folds zzso to zzso zzso zzso
