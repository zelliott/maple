zzso of zzso gene by zzso zzso is a frequent event in oral zzso zzso To investigate the zzso value of zzso zzso on zzso potential in oral zzso zzso we carried out the prospective cohort zzso 

One hundred one patients with zzso confirmed mild or moderate oral zzso zzso were included in the present cohort zzso zzso zzso status of the oral zzso zzso zzso from 93 cases was obtained by zzso zzso zzso of the oral zzso zzso zzso was examined in 78 cases zzso during a zzso months follow-up zzso The association between zzso zzso and progression of oral zzso zzso was zzso 

Of the 93 enrolled cases, 15 cases were lost during the follow-up because of changes of contact information, with a compliance of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in oral zzso zzso zzso from 32 zzso of 78 enrolled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso were observed in 22 patients zzso during the zzso Rate of progression to oral cancer in patients with the zzso oral zzso zzso was significantly higher than that with the zzso oral zzso zzso zzso versus zzso adjusted odds ratio, zzso P zzso zzso especially for patients at the baseline age of zzso or zzso 60 years zzso odds ratio, zzso P zzso zzso and patients with moderate oral zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso P zzso zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity of prediction of zzso transformation of oral zzso zzso by zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was correlated with zzso transformation of oral zzso zzso and is a potential zzso for prediction of prognosis of mild or moderate oral zzso zzso
