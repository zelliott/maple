The study objective was to compare the accuracy of a deterministic record linkage zzso and two public domain software applications for record linkage (The zzso King and zzso zzso The three zzso were used to zzso an administrative database containing personal identifiers for over 500,000 zzso zzso a random sample of linked records was submitted to four research staff for blinded clerical zzso Using zzso decisions as the zzso zzso sensitivity and positive zzso values zzso were zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso in the mid 90s could be obtained from both The zzso King and zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a basic deterministic zzso were 79 and 98 per cent zzso Thus the full feature set of The zzso King makes it an attractive option for zzso zzso zzso Plus is a good choice for zzso users as long as necessary programming resources are available for processing record pairs identified by zzso zzso
