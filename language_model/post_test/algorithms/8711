zzso is a member of a family of zzso factors sharing two regions of zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso domain and a more divergent zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso proteins suggests that, while the zzso is required and sufficient for low affinity DNA zzso the zzso domain is necessary for high affinity binding and accurate recognition of natural zzso response zzso zzso is zzso in solution but associates as a zzso on its DNA response element, exhibiting zzso zzso interactions requiring the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso structures in zzso suggests that zzso domain proteins interact with their DNA recognition sites differently than classic zzso zzso with both the zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso on zzso elements is zzso primarily by a zzso and zzso zzso region unrelated to other known zzso zzso
