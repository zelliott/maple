To evaluate a fully automated zzso for the establishment of tight zzso control in critically ill patients and to compare the results with different routine zzso management protocols of three intensive care units zzso across Europe zzso Prague, and zzso 

Sixty patients undergoing cardiac surgery (age 67 zzso 9 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso with zzso blood zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in three different zzso (20 per zzso Patients were zzso to either blood zzso management (target range zzso zzso zzso zzso by the fully automated model zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, 10 per zzso or implemented routine zzso management protocols zzso zzso 30, 10 per zzso In all patients, zzso zzso was measured hourly to describe the zzso profile until the end of the zzso stay but for a maximum period of 48 zzso 

Compared with routine zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time within the target zzso range zzso median zzso 52 zzso zzso 19 zzso over zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control with zzso treatment was confirmed in patients remaining in the zzso for 48 h zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso 21 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 65 zzso zzso 25 zzso P zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso routine protocol zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed with routine protocol zzso No zzso event occurred with zzso 

The data suggest that the zzso zzso is safe and effective in controlling zzso in critically ill zzso zzso
