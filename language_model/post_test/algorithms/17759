Several existence zzso were established for a zzso zzso zzso boundary value problem with second zzso by using zzso fixed point zzso equivalent norm and technique on system of integral zzso The main conditions of our results are zzso In other words, the existence of the solution can be determined by considering the zzso of the zzso term on a bounded zzso This class of problems usually describes the equilibrium state of an elastic beam which is simply supported at both zzso
