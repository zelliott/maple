In recent years cardiac zzso and zzso often have been measured using automated sampling systems that record samples periodically, with a fixed zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sampling systems envision variable zzso zzso and new information about such systems has emerged in the last few zzso The author summarizes these zzso On the whole, they show that the fan zzso is an effective basis for zzso sampling of cardiac zzso that it works well on zzso zzso and action zzso and that zzso sampling systems based on the fan can be constructed to run in real zzso
