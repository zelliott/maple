zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso of promoter region zzso islands is widely recognized as a tumor zzso zzso mechanism in zzso However, the molecular pathways underlying zzso DNA zzso remain zzso Recently we showed that, on a zzso level, zzso island zzso differ in their intrinsic zzso to zzso zzso and that this zzso can be predicted based on underlying sequence zzso These data suggest that there are zzso features that contribute to the protection from or zzso to zzso zzso Here we use motif zzso coupled with zzso techniques to identify DNA sequence motifs that selectively define zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso common to 28 zzso or 47 zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were determined using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The five most zzso motifs derived from zzso sequences were found to be associated with zzso islands in general and were zzso distributed throughout the zzso In contrast, the eight most zzso motifs derived from the zzso zzso islands were randomly distributed throughout the zzso Interestingly, this latter group tended to associate with zzso and other repetitive zzso Used together, the frequency of occurrence of these motifs successfully zzso zzso and zzso zzso island groups with an accuracy of zzso after zzso zzso The motifs identified here are candidate zzso or zzso DNA zzso
