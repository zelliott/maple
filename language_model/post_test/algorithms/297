zzso claims are increasingly examined beyond administrative functions as outcomes measures in zzso zzso Few studies have described the performance of billing claims as surrogate measures of clinical events among kidney transplant zzso 

We investigated the sensitivity of Medicare billing claims for clinically verified cardiovascular diagnoses (five zzso and procedures (four zzso in a novel database linking Medicare claims to electronic medical records of one transplant zzso zzso events identified in medical records for zzso zzso transplant recipients in 1991 through 2002 served as reference zzso 

Within a zzso period spanning zzso d of clinically recorded dates, zzso sensitivity of single claims was higher for case definitions incorporating Medicare Parts A and B for diagnoses and procedures zzso compared with either Part A zzso or Part B zzso zzso Perfect capture of the four procedures was possible within zzso d or with short claims window expansion, but sensitivity for the diagnoses zzso lower with all study zzso zzso with window up to zzso zzso zzso for additional zzso diagnosis claims did not appreciably reduce zzso zzso patterns were similar in the early compared with late periods of the zzso 

Combined use of Medicare Parts A and B billing claims composes a sensitive measure of cardiovascular events after kidney zzso Further research is needed to define zzso that maximize specificity as well as sensitivity of claims from Medicare and other insurers as research measures in this zzso
