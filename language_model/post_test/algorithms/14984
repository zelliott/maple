A new zzso Carlo zzso for zzso zzso dose calculation in radiation therapy is zzso which is based on the previously developed zzso zzso Carlo zzso for electron zzso The main result is that this new version of zzso (now called zzso is more efficient than zzso zzso dose calculation by a factor of zzso zzso a standard treatment plan for photons can be calculated by zzso Carlo in about 20 zzso on a zzso personal zzso The improvement is caused mainly by the fast electron transport zzso and ray tracing technique, and an initial ray tracing method to calculate the number of electrons created in each zzso by the primary zzso zzso The model was tested in comparison to calculations by zzso using several zzso zzso In most cases a good coincidence has been found between both zzso Only within lung substitute dose differences have been zzso
