zzso zzso zzso is a method for zzso zzso of cerebral zzso zzso Principal component analysis zzso and independent component analysis zzso can be used for zzso a set of signals to underlying zzso Our objective is to determine whether zzso or zzso is more efficient in identifying and removing scalp blood flow interference from zzso zzso zzso Concentration changes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are measured on the forehead with zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are used separately to identify and remove signal contribution from zzso zzso and the resulting estimates of cerebral responses are compared to the expected cerebral zzso Both methods were able to reduce zzso contribution to the signals, but zzso typically performs equal to or better than zzso The improvement in zzso signal quality achieved with both methods is comparable to increasing the zzso separation from 3 to 5 zzso Especially zzso appears to be well suited for use in zzso applications where the cerebral zzso is zzso such as monitoring of global cerebral zzso and zzso Performance differences between zzso and zzso could be attributed primarily to different criteria for identifying the surface zzso
