zzso zzso zzso is increasing progressively pushing the demand of automatic extraction and zzso of severity of zzso Blood vessel extraction from the zzso image is a vital and challenging zzso zzso this paper presents a new, zzso simple, and automatic method to extract the retinal blood zzso The proposed method comprises several basic image processing techniques, namely edge enhancement by standard template, noise zzso zzso zzso operation, and object zzso The proposed method has been tested on a set of retinal zzso The retinal images were collected from the zzso database and we have employed robust performance analysis to evaluate the zzso The results obtained from this study reveal that the proposed method offers an average accuracy of about zzso sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and zzso value of zzso which is superior to various well-known zzso
