The process of zzso bone zzso can be simulated with a zzso finite element zzso The basic zzso rules attempt to obtain a constant value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting zzso The precise solution is dependent on the zzso initial conditions, and the parameters of the zzso zzso While there are several investigations on developing zzso leading to the bone density distribution in the zzso zzso these zzso often require a large number of zzso The aim of this study was to develop a more efficient zzso bone zzso algorithm, and to identify how the bone density distribution of the zzso zzso was affected by parameters that govern the zzso zzso The forces at different zzso of the gait cycle were applied as boundary zzso The bone density zzso from these forces were averaged to estimate the density distribution in the zzso zzso The effect of varying the initial bone density, spatial influence function, zzso order of the zzso algorithm, and the influence range on the zzso solution were zzso The proposed procedure was shown to zzso in a fewer number of zzso and requiring less zzso time, while still generating a realistic bone density zzso It was also shown that varying the identified parameters within reasonable upper and lower bounds had very little impact on the qualitative form of the zzso zzso In contrast, the convergence rate was affected to a greater degree by variation of these zzso In all cases, the solutions obtained are comparable with the actual density in the zzso zzso as measured by zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso
