We have compared a novel zzso matching technique, zzso for detecting remote zzso to three existing sequence based methods, including local zzso acid sequence similarity by zzso hidden zzso models zzso of sequences of protein families using zzso zzso based on sequence motifs identified using zzso zzso compares predicted secondary structures to a library of structural families of zzso using zzso zzso 45 proteins from nine structural families in the database zzso were used in a zzso test of the fold assignment accuracy of each zzso Local sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein family is measured by the highest segment pair zzso zzso Each of the zzso approaches zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso yielded zzso score for the query zzso In order to make a fair comparison among these methods, the scores for each method were converted to zzso in a uniform way by comparing the raw scores of a query protein with the corresponding scores for a set of unrelated zzso zzso were analyzed as a function of the maximum zzso sequence identity zzso of the query sequence to sequences used in training the zzso For zzso above zzso the zzso increase zzso with zzso for the zzso methods but remain roughly constant for zzso Below zzso average zzso are close to zero for the zzso methods, whereas the zzso method yielded average zzso of zzso and zzso using observed and predicted secondary structures, zzso This demonstrates the advantage of the zzso method for detecting remote zzso
