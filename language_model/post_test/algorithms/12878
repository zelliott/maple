We present a new method to broaden the amplification range in optical zzso amplification toward the bandwidth needed for single cycle zzso zzso zzso pumping of independent stages is used to zzso amplify the long and short wavelength parts of the zzso seed zzso The concept is tested in two related zzso With zzso pumping zzso with a nearly zzso spanning spectrum and an zzso energy of 3 zzso are generated at low repetition zzso The spectral phase varies slowly and continuously in the overlap region as shown with 100 zzso repetition zzso This should allow the zzso to the zzso limit of below 5 zzso in the high energy zzso
