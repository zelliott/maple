To test the assumption that the various types of zzso in the human zzso appear to be randomly distributed and to zzso the way in which they are zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and the interactive evaluation technique were zzso 

zzso human zzso without zzso signs of zzso change were dissected out, fixed in zzso zzso and embedded in zzso The zzso zzso sections were stained in an zzso and zzso solution, which makes it possible to distinguish between seven different zzso populations in the zzso The gravity centers, size and form factors of these zzso were determined zzso under a light zzso The data obtained were used to calculate the spatial distribution of the zzso by interactive and structure zzso zzso 

Visual point field analysis revealed an irregular arrangement of the different types of zzso Point process analysis detected a significant hard core process of type 1 and a cluster process of type 6 zzso With nearest neighborhood analysis, significant differences were found between certain populations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the results of zzso cluster analysis with the zzso results of visual point field analysis showed clear zzso 

By means of structure zzso methods, the arrangement of different populations of zzso can be zzso Some zzso zzso are zzso only by using one of these zzso The question of random or zzso distribution of the zzso in the human zzso can now be answered zzso arrangement of the different populations of zzso is zzso
