zzso dose and average linear energy transfer zzso were assessed by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso detectors for different panels zzso the Russian zzso of the International Space Station in the zzso between March and November 2002 zzso zzso A technique is presented to correct the measured absorbed dose values for zzso efficiency in the radiation climate zzso the zzso Average LET is determined from the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso glow curve and used as a zzso in the zzso efficiency zzso Depending on the shielding distribution, the zzso absorbed dose varies between 154 zzso 5 zzso zzso in panel zzso zzso zzso block zzso and 191 zzso 3 zzso zzso in panel zzso 110 zzso block central zzso zzso The experimental data are compared with the model calculations by using detailed shielding zzso and orbit parameters as zzso
