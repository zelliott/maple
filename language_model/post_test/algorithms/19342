In this paper, we present theoretical developments and experimental results for the problem of zzso the zzso map inside a volume using electrical zzso zzso zzso when the boundary locations of any internal zzso are zzso We describe boundary element method zzso zzso of advanced zzso models for the forward problem of zzso We then use them in the inverse problem with known internal boundaries and derive the associated zzso We report on the results of two zzso phantom studies, one using a homogeneous zzso tank, and one using a zzso tank with zzso zzso zzso We test both the accuracy of our zzso forward model, including the zzso models, as well as our inverse solution, against the measured zzso zzso show good agreement between measured values and both zzso tank zzso and zzso zzso for instance, in a phantom experiment, we reconstructed the zzso of three zzso objects inside a zzso tank with an error less than zzso of their true zzso
