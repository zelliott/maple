zzso zzso memory allows integration of heart rate monitoring into the zzso Two main methods can be zzso zzso Heart rate monitoring in zzso zzso Heart rate monitoring in the time domain zzso rate zzso zzso 1 is useful in zzso and diagnostic zzso when short specific events must be detected zzso zzso For the analysis of a rate zzso zzso this method is less appropriate as it does not give any information about the dynamics of rate changes or its time zzso For this purpose zzso 2 will give more information about the functioning of the zzso as it does not only store the heart rate but also the timing of the heart rate so that changes in heart rate can be correlated to the activity of the zzso An zzso was developed to store the average heart rate over zzso minute periods in a zzso On interrogation of the zzso the information will always reveal the heart rate over the 24 hours prior to zzso This monitor can also be temporarily programmed to store the average heart rate in 20 second intervals to monitor the response to an exercise test for a period of 1 zzso The time needed for a standard follow-up procedure of a rate zzso zzso can be dramatically reduced to a value close to the follow-up time of a standard zzso zzso
