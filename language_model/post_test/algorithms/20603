Some investigators have indicated that mathematical theories and zzso models of bone adaptation may not zzso and that the density solutions from such simulations are dependent on the initial density zzso In this study, two-dimensional finite element models were used to investigate the effect of initial density distribution on the final density distribution produced using a zzso bone zzso zzso The first model was a generic long bone, and the second was a zzso zzso For each model, we conducted zzso zzso linear zzso bone zzso zzso Five initial density conditions were used with the generic long bone and three with the zzso zzso zzso simulations were performed, and the largest average zzso density differences at the end of the simulations were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the generic long bone and zzso zzso models, zzso zzso illustrate that, for a given set of loads and a given finite element model, the zzso bone adaptation zzso can yield a unique density zzso In conjunction with previous studies, this finding suggests that uniqueness of the density solution is dependent on both the mathematical theory and the zzso zzso
