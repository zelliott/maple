zzso fiber orientation is a topic that has recently received much attention in connection with cardiac pumping zzso The twisting motion of the cardiac base to zzso can be a direct result of this geometric orientation of these zzso One important question that has not been addressed yet is whether there is any relationship between the zzso energy expenditure and the geometric orientation of zzso zzso In the present work, we study the effect of zzso fiber orientation on pumping zzso We particularly compare the effect of fiber geometry on ejection zzso and on the energy required for contraction in both zzso and zzso shell zzso The zzso models we used signify the importance of twisting motion in minimizing the energy required to generate certain ejection zzso Indeed, we zzso that if the angle of zzso fibers is appropriate for the shape and the size of the zzso twisting scheme can tremendously reduce the energy requirement for zzso
