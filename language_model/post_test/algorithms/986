zzso remote sensing data is an increasingly popular source of evaluation information for vehicle zzso zzso zzso This article conducts one such remote sensing data evaluation for the Atlanta, Georgia, zzso zzso The reference method involves comparing emissions differences in zzso and zzso fleet vehicles with those predicted by a regulatory computer zzso Assuming that zzso emissions differences represent observed effectiveness and zzso emissions differences represent effectiveness goals, the Atlanta enhanced zzso program appears to be achieving zzso of its targeted emissions zzso The method compares favorably with other remote sensing evaluation methods in its ability to be applied over time and its relatively small sample size zzso The chief limitation to the approach is its reliance on a representative zzso fleet, which may differ in characteristics for which controls are difficult to zzso Such potential zzso factors include discrepancies in maintenance trends, socioeconomic conditions, and vehicle zzso
