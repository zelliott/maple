zzso zzso strain maps of the zzso provide a zzso zzso of zzso deformation and zzso We combine two zzso techniques, displacement zzso with zzso echoes zzso and strain zzso zzso to fully formulate a zzso strain map in a single slice of zzso The method zzso zzso zzso zzso displacement zzso in two adjacent slices in conjunction with a single zzso zzso strain measure to calculate the zzso strain zzso Six volunteers were zzso and the technique demonstrated zzso strain measures in all volunteers that are consistent with those reported in the literature from zzso zzso The mean peak strain zzso standard zzso zzso for six healthy volunteers for the first, second, and third principal strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results show that this technique is capable of reliably zzso zzso cardiac zzso
