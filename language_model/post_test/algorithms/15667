The zzso program is a short automated zzso strategy which zzso the zzso grid of 59 points into four zzso Each point is tested only once, but each patient's response is used to modify that particular point and the surrounding ones from the remaining zzso This study compared the results of the zzso program with the Standard zzso zzso 

Eleven participating institutions provided data from zzso patients (406 zzso The main group consisted of zzso zzso and 55 glaucoma zzso Other groups included 31 eyes with neurological disorders, 20 with zzso zzso and 16 normal zzso Mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All subjects had previous zzso experience and visual acuity better than zzso zzso included zzso zzso and zzso testing, in interchangeable order, with the zzso zzso zzso 

The correlation zzso for mean zzso zzso was zzso Standard error zzso for MD, square root of loss zzso zzso and individual thresholds were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean sensitivity values were similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean duration for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso took zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a net reduction of zzso The sensitivity of zzso versus zzso zzso was: glaucoma zzso glaucoma suspects zzso neurological disorders zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso program gave very similar results to zzso zzso in only zzso of the time required by the standard zzso
