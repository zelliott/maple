The zzso modeling of protein zzso on zzso zzso zzso with zzso carrying both zzso and zzso groups was zzso The developed mixed mode zzso was fitted with protein zzso data obtained for five different proteins on four different mixed mode zzso by zzso zzso plate high zzso batch experiments on a robotic zzso The developed mixed mode zzso was capable of describing the zzso zzso of all five proteins zzso widely different molecular masses and zzso points) on the four mixed mode zzso and over a wide range of salt zzso and solution zzso and provided a unique set of physically meaningful parameters for each zzso zzso The model could capture the typically observed minimum in mixed mode protein zzso and predict the precise salt concentration at which this minimum zzso The possibility of predicting the salt concentration at which minimum protein binding occurs presents new opportunities for designing better zzso strategies in mixed mode protein zzso zzso interactions were shown to have important consequences on mixed mode protein zzso when they zzso Finally, the mixed mode zzso also gave very good fit with literature data of zzso zzso on a different mixed mode zzso not examined in this zzso zzso the mixed mode zzso zzso presented in this study can be used with any mixed mode zzso having the zzso and zzso functional zzso It also provides the basis for detailed modeling and zzso of mixed mode zzso separation of zzso
