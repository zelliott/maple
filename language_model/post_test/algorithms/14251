zzso induction zzso zzso of biological tissue is used for the reconstruction of the complex zzso distribution zzso inside the object under zzso It is based on the zzso of an alternating magnetic field caused by the object and can be used in all applications of electrical zzso zzso zzso such as functional lung monitoring and assessment of tissue zzso In contrast to zzso zzso does not require zzso and magnetic fields can also penetrate zzso barriers such as the zzso As in zzso the reconstruction of absolute zzso values is very difficult because of the zzso sensitivity to zzso errors and zzso To overcome this problem, image reconstruction in zzso is often done zzso zzso this concept has been adopted for zzso Two different methods for differential imaging are zzso The first one is zzso for example when the zzso change between inspiration and expiration in the lung regions is being zzso The second one is zzso which is of high interest in zzso zzso like the brain, where a zzso method cannot be zzso An equation for zzso zzso was derived taking into consideration the frequency dependence of the sensitivity zzso This formula is valid if we can assume that only small zzso changes zzso In this way, the zzso inverse problem of zzso can be zzso by a linear one zzso only on the zzso similar to in zzso Keeping this limitation in mind, the zzso changes between one or more reference zzso and several measurement zzso were zzso yielding zzso zzso zzso Due to the differential character of the method, these zzso do not provide absolute zzso but preserve the shape of the zzso The zzso of the method was tested with artificial data generated with a zzso zzso within a conducting cylinder as well as for real measurement zzso The measurement data were obtained from a potato immersed in zzso The resulting zzso were compared with reference zzso and the preservation of the shape of the zzso was zzso
