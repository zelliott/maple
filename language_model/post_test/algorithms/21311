zzso specific volume and zzso properties of the extended state of proteins are estimated from zzso schemes using revised zzso acid and zzso zzso These calculated properties are compared with the experimental data of the native state in order to assess the contribution from zzso zzso of this treatment show that, in the case of partial specific volumes, there is close agreement between the two data sets for a number of zzso The implication is that subtle zzso contributions in volume occur during the folding zzso In the case of zzso however, a substantial difference is observed which is believed to arise because of the zzso interior created in the native protein as a result of the folding zzso Using suitable measures of protein zzso and estimates of the fraction of buried zzso zzso a zzso model of protein zzso is proposed and tested for several zzso zzso obtained from this model show good agreement with the experimental data for the native state of a number of zzso
