The Sixth Community Wide zzso on the Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso held in December 2004 focused on the prediction of the structures of 90 protein zzso from 64 zzso zzso of these were classified as zzso zzso defined as being similar in fold to proteins of known structure at the time of submission of the zzso Only the zzso predictions and those longer than 20 zzso acids for each domain were zzso resulting in zzso predictions from 165 zzso The assessment was accomplished by the use of six structure alignment programs and three scoring measures based on these zzso The use of a variety of measures resulted in scoring insensitive to the peculiarities of any one alignment zzso The top-ranked methods in the prediction of structures that were clearly zzso to proteins in the zzso Data Bank primarily used servers and other programs based on achieving a consensus of many remote zzso detection and fold recognition zzso The top-ranked methods in prediction of structures less clearly related or unrelated to proteins of known structures used zzso building methods in addition to the fold recognition zzso zzso
