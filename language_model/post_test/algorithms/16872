zzso prediction of zzso can improve the functional zzso and application of genes within zzso in zzso Here, we review several features: zzso zzso distance, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters and zzso zzso gene order zzso zzso zzso zzso clusters of zzso groups, zzso gene length ratio, zzso zzso profiles, zzso zzso zzso and zzso STRING database scores, as well as some other features, which have been applied in recent zzso prediction methods in zzso in the zzso Based on a comparison of the prediction performances of these features, we conclude that other, as yet undiscovered features, or feature selection with a receiver operating characteristic analysis before zzso processing can improve zzso prediction in zzso
