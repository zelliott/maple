We derive a general zzso expression for the zzso efficiency when a partially zzso partially polarized beam is coupled into a zzso optical zzso We adopt the zzso model for incident electromagnetic beams and use our general result to discuss the effects of the partial zzso and partial polarization on the zzso efficiency of an optical beam focused onto a zzso zzso fiber with a zzso Our results should be useful for any application requiring zzso of partially coherent beams into optical zzso
