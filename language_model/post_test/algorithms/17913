zzso zzso zzso with deceptively bland zzso cannot be easily zzso We aimed to design a new zzso that could differentiate between these zzso based on a scoring zzso We proposed a new scoring system that enables to zzso diagnose zzso zzso zzso zzso In this system, each zzso was given individual scores from 0 to 3 for zzso and cellular zzso from 0 to 2 for cellular zzso and an additional score for zzso zzso These scores were combined to form a summed score allowing the tumors to be ranked as zzso zzso zzso zzso 2-4 zzso low zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso transitional cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso high-grade zzso In addition to the scoring system, ancillary studies of zzso and zzso indexes with zzso expression pattern analyses were compared together with clinical zzso The zzso index was strongly correlated with disease zzso Four of the 22 zzso patients zzso had late zzso two of these four zzso had progression to zzso zzso The zzso index for zzso patients was strongly associated with recurrence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The proposed scoring system could enhance the zzso to distinguish zzso zzso zzso
