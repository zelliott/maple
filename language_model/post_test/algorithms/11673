zzso inherent in the duration of surgical procedures zzso surgical zzso Modeling the duration and zzso of surgeries might improve time zzso zzso time estimates are important zzso to improve zzso reduce costs, and identify surgeries that might be considered zzso zzso with multiple procedures are difficult to model because they are difficult to segment into zzso groups and because they are performed less frequently than zzso zzso 

The authors zzso zzso zzso surgeries each with exactly two zzso and zzso surgical cases with only one zzso from a large teaching hospital to determine if the distribution of zzso surgery times fit more closely a zzso or a normal zzso The authors tested model goodness of fit to their data using zzso tests, studied factors affecting the zzso of time estimates, and examined the impact of coding permutations zzso zzso on zzso 

The zzso tests indicated that the zzso model is statistically superior to the normal model for modeling zzso zzso zzso of component codes did not appear to differ significantly with respect to total procedure time and surgical zzso To improve individual models for zzso zzso zzso permutations may be reduced and estimates may be based on the longest component procedure and type of zzso 

The authors recommend use of the zzso model for zzso surgical times for surgeries with two component zzso Their results help zzso the use of log zzso to zzso surgical procedure times prior to hypothesis testing using linear statistical zzso zzso surgeries may be modeled using the longest zzso most zzso component procedure and type of zzso
