zzso zzso a simple mechanical maneuver at the onset of zzso reduces zzso size after zzso After its first description in 2003 by zzso et zzso numerous experimental studies have investigated this protective zzso Whereas the underlying mechanisms and signal zzso are not yet understood in detail, zzso size reduction by zzso zzso was confirmed in all species tested so far, including zzso We have now reviewed the literature with focus on experimental models and protocols to better understand the zzso of protection by zzso zzso or lack of zzso Only studies with zzso size as unequivocal zzso were zzso In all species and models, the duration of index zzso and the protective protocol zzso impact on the outcome of zzso zzso and zzso age, and zzso temperature zzso
