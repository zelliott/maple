We tested a zzso visual interpretation zzso that combines cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso data from zzso and zzso imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance can assess both zzso zzso and zzso with independent techniques in a single zzso 

We zzso enrolled 100 consecutive patients with suspected zzso scheduled for X-ray coronary zzso Patients had comprehensive clinical zzso including Rose angina zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calculation of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance included zzso zzso and rest zzso and delayed zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defects in the absence of zzso by zzso were considered zzso All patients underwent X-ray zzso within 24 h of zzso 

zzso patients had complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was found in 37 patients zzso The combination of zzso and zzso had a sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso diagnosis, compared with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso The combination had higher specificity and accuracy zzso zzso zzso zzso to incorporating the exceptionally high specificity zzso of zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the combination provided better performance than zzso zzso or zzso zzso The accuracy was high in zzso and zzso disease and independent of zzso zzso zzso analysis including standard clinical parameters demonstrated the combination was the strongest independent zzso zzso 

A combined zzso and zzso zzso examination with a visual interpretation zzso can accurately diagnose zzso in the clinical zzso The combination is superior to zzso zzso
