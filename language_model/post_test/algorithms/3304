A new data acquisition system has been zzso This system measures the external magnetic fields due to induced currents in the body at a relatively low operation frequency of 50 zzso zzso Data is obtained by scanning a zzso area on the body zzso For each zzso position, a single sample zzso of the field distribution is used for image zzso The zzso zzso Algorithm is used to solve the inverse problem related to the field zzso zzso images of zzso blocks and an zzso zzso are zzso The system sensitivity is measured as zzso zzso using saline solution zzso and as 155 zzso using zzso The signal to noise ratio in the zzso is calculated to be zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso is explored using saline solutions in the biological zzso zzso The zzso is measured to be zzso of the full zzso The zzso is found to be zzso when zzso zzso are zzso The spatial resolution in the zzso images is measured as zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show that it is possible to distinguish two bars separated zzso zzso from each zzso
