zzso comparative zzso zzso is a fast and cost-effective method for zzso zzso and comparing the zzso sequence of unknown bacterial zzso This method, as with all zzso applications, requires adequate coverage of zzso targeting the regions of zzso An unbiased zzso of zzso across the entire length of the zzso is the most flexible design zzso However, such a zzso zzso requires that the zzso sequence is known in zzso For the accurate analysis of zzso bacteria, an array must query a fully representative set of sequences from the zzso zzso Prior zzso have included only a single strain per array or the zzso sequences of gene zzso These zzso omit potentially important genes and sequence zzso from the zzso 

This paper presents a new probe selection zzso zzso that can tile multiple whole zzso using a minimal number of zzso Unlike zzso built on clustered gene families, zzso uses an zzso zzso approach that does not rely on zzso gene zzso or zzso Instead, zzso are evenly tiled across all sequences of the zzso at a consistent level of zzso To minimize the required number of zzso zzso zzso across multiple strains in the zzso are selected first, and additional zzso are used only where necessary to span zzso regions of the zzso The viability of the zzso is demonstrated by array designs for seven different bacterial zzso and, in particular, the design of a zzso probe array that fully tiles the zzso of 20 different zzso zzso strains with overlapping zzso at greater than twofold zzso 

zzso is an zzso probe selection zzso for zzso multiple zzso sequences using a minimal number of zzso It is capable of fully zzso all zzso of a species on a single zzso zzso These unique zzso zzso zzso provide maximum flexibility for the analysis of both known and zzso zzso
