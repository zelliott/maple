zzso reaction monitoring zzso is becoming the tool of choice for targeted quantitative zzso The fundamental principle of zzso zzso is that, for a given protein of interest, there is a set of peptides that are unique to that zzso The characteristic retention time zzso and intact zzso zzso of these so-called zzso peptides are then programmed into the mass zzso along with the zzso of high-intensity product zzso for targeted zzso The particular combination of zzso zzso zzso and product zzso for a given zzso is referred to as a zzso zzso of the most appropriate set of transitions for a given set of proteins is crucial to any zzso zzso We previously developed the zzso zzso zzso which suggested the optimal transitions for a given human protein by mining spectral evidence from a small in-house zzso In this article we present a completely new zzso of zzso which offers substantial improvements over the zzso The new version, zzso zzso uses zzso from the zzso zzso database, which zzso increases the coverage and quality of zzso Transition lists can now be generated for multiple proteins zzso edited within the web zzso and exported for laboratory zzso
