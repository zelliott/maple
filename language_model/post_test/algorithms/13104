The zzso zzso is an important technique to evaluate human zzso motor functions, which are critical for doctors to understand the pathology of zzso diseases like slow transit zzso zzso and zzso inertia zzso However, in the obtained pressure signals, several patterns of zzso motor activities as well as noises mixed together, which made it difficult to observe the information people really zzso In this article, a new method was proposed to extract patterns of zzso zzso from the mixed signals, so that researchers could study them zzso zzso pressure recordings from 26 volunteers were obtained by the zzso zzso zzso Then independent component analysis zzso was introduced, which successfully separated zzso zzso patterns and noises into four independent zzso And according to the rhythm of zzso examined by zzso subjects' zzso zzso could be divided into three zzso regular rhythm (12 zzso slow rhythm (8 subjects) and zzso (6 zzso which exactly zzso with their original zzso
