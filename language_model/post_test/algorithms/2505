Continuous zzso distribution models can be applied to a variety of biological zzso with both charged and neutral zzso zzso In particular, zzso models have been used to describe the complex material zzso of zzso such as zzso cartilage and their engineered tissue zzso The choice of material parameters is more difficult than in classical zzso models and the impact that changes to these parameters can have on the predictions of such models are poorly zzso The objective of this study is to demonstrate the apparent zzso of this class of materials over a range of material zzso We further introduce a zzso approach to overcome certain zzso aspects related to the choice of zzso parameters and outline the integration method used in our zzso zzso material codes for the commercial zzso software packages zzso and zzso Marc are provided for use by other zzso zzso of our code against similar zzso in zzso is also zzso
