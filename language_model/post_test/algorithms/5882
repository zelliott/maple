A new approach to support zzso machine zzso zzso is proposed wherein each of two data sets are zzso to one of two distinct planes that are not parallel to each zzso Each plane is generated such that it is closest to one of the two data sets and as far as possible from the other data zzso Each of the two zzso zzso planes is obtained by a single zzso command as the zzso corresponding to a smallest zzso of a generalized zzso zzso zzso by proximity to two distinct zzso surfaces generated by a zzso kernel also leads to two simple generalized zzso zzso The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by tests on simple examples as well as on a number of public data zzso These examples show the advantages of the proposed approach in both zzso time and test set zzso
