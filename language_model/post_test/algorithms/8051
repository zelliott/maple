It has been proved to be a very useful method to distinguish similar samples by two-dimensional correlation zzso when they are hardly distinguished by the conventional one-dimensional zzso To acquire the quantitative description of the differences between samples, the similarity of the series dynamic zzso which reflects the similarity of the samples themselves if obtained under the same zzso condition, is evaluated by the symmetry of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso the zzso distance and correlation zzso between the upper left and lower right triangular parts of a zzso zzso map, are introduced for the quantitative measure of the zzso which in turn characterizes the similarity of the responses of samples to a given zzso The above method is used to discriminate one zzso of zzso from the others to ensure the medicinal efficacy and safety of the zzso zzso tests show that the zzso between samples from different zzso are significantly larger than the zzso within the same zzso while the zzso zzso are smaller than the zzso The excellent result of the identification for all samples carried out by a zzso based on the distances indicates that this method provides an efficient technique for the quantitative evaluation of similarity between zzso
