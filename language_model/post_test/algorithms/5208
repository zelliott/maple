Respiratory motion is a major concern in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso It causes artifacts such as zzso streaks, and bands, in particular when using zzso scanners mounted on the zzso of linear zzso In this paper, we compare two approaches for zzso zzso reconstruction of the zzso The first one is zzso it is zzso adapted from the method of zzso Davis, and zzso zzso The second one is zzso the system of linear equations is generated using a new zzso for the projection of zzso volumes and solved using the zzso zzso Reconstruction zzso zzso For both methods, we propose to estimate the motion on patient data using a previously acquired zzso CT zzso The methods were tested on two digital and one mechanical zzso zzso and on a patient zzso Our results indicate that the two methods correct most motion zzso However, the zzso method does not fully correct streaks and bands even if the motion is perfectly estimated due to the underlying zzso In contrast, the zzso method allows us full correction of zzso zzso
