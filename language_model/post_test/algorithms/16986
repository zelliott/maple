A program is described that searches zzso structural databases, given a zzso zzso in order to retrieve all structures that contain any combination of a zzso minimum number of matching zzso zzso consist of three-dimensional coordinates of atoms and/or zzso Numerous query constraints are described which allow the investigator to define the chemical nature of the desired structures as well as the environment within which these structures must zzso They include: zzso zzso zzso isolated atom zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso Definition of zzso with occupancy zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso Active site volume accessibility of atoms linking query zzso zzso zzso atom type, and zzso structure constraints for atoms linking zzso zzso zzso Automatic error boundary zzso zzso zzso To illustrate the capabilities of this program, queries based on the crystal structure of a zzso complex were tested against a subset of the Cambridge zzso zzso Several compounds were returned which satisfied various aspects of the zzso including fitting within the active zzso Combination of segments of compounds which satisfy partial queries should provide a method for generating unique compounds with affinity for sites of known three-dimensional zzso
