A zzso strain index zzso based on heart rate zzso and zzso temperature zzso was recently suggested to evaluate zzso stress in zzso The purpose of this study was to adjust zzso for rats and to evaluate this index at different levels of heat zzso and zzso The corrections of zzso and zzso to modify the index for rats are as zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso + 5 zzso - zzso zzso - zzso where zzso and zzso zzso are simultaneous zzso taken at any time during the exposure and zzso and zzso 0 are the initial zzso The adjusted zzso was applied to five groups zzso zzso zzso per zzso of zzso rats zzso and 2, 5, 10, and 30 zzso exposed for 70 zzso to a hot climate zzso degrees C, zzso relative humidity zzso A separate database representing two groups of zzso or trained rats was also used and involved 20 zzso of zzso exercise zzso consumption approximately 50 zzso zzso zzso at three different zzso zzso (24 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso (35 degrees C, zzso zzso and zzso (40 degrees C, zzso zzso In zzso rats also performed moderate exercise zzso consumption approximately 60 zzso zzso zzso The adjusted zzso differentiated among zzso levels and significantly zzso among all zzso during zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this index was able to assess the individual roles played by heat zzso and exercise zzso
