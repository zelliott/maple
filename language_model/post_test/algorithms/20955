Although many quality measures have been created, there is no consensus regarding which are the most zzso We sought to develop a simple, explicit strategy for zzso breast cancer quality measures based on their potential to highlight areas where quality improvement efforts could most impact a zzso 

Using performance data for zzso breast cancer patients treated at 10 National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions, we assessed zzso relative to 30 reliable, valid breast cancer zzso treatment zzso We identified 4 attributes that indicated there was room for improvement and characterized the extent of burden imposed by failing to follow each zzso number of zzso patients, zzso across all institutions, highest zzso at any 1 institution, and magnitude of benefit associated with zzso zzso For each measure, we used data from the zzso analyses to derive the first 3 attributes and surveyed expert breast cancer physicians to estimate the zzso A simple zzso incorporated these attributes and produced a final score for each zzso these scores were used to rank the zzso 

We successfully zzso quality measures using zzso objective methods and actual performance zzso The number of zzso patients had the greatest influence on the zzso The highest-ranking measures recommended chemotherapy and hormone therapy for zzso positive tumors and radiation therapy after zzso zzso 

This simple, explicit approach is a significant departure from methods used zzso and effectively identifies breast cancer quality measures that have broad clinical zzso zzso zzso quality measures could increase the efficiency and efficacy of quality improvement efforts and substantially improve zzso
