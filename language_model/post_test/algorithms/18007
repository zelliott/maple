A quantitative zzso relationship zzso study has been carried out for a training set of 29 zzso to correlate and predict the zzso radical scavenging activity zzso values obtained from published zzso zzso zzso and multiple linear zzso were employed to select the zzso and to generate the best prediction model that relates the structural features to the zzso activities using zzso three-dimensional zzso Dragon zzso zzso Milan, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the models was estimated by zzso with the zzso zzso The result showed that a significant improvement of the statistical zzso was obtained by deleting zzso Based on the data for the compounds used in this study, our results suggest a zzso model of zzso that is based on the following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso satisfactory relationships between zzso and the zzso zzso were found, demonstrating that the energy of the highest occupied molecular zzso total energy, and energy of heat of formation contributed more significantly than all other zzso
