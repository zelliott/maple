Current understanding of the effects of damage on neural networks is zzso even though such understanding could lead to important insights concerning neurological and psychiatric zzso zzso by this consideration, we present a simple zzso framework for zzso the functional damage resulting from focal structural zzso to a neural network zzso The effects of focal zzso of varying area, shape, and number on the retrieval capacities of a zzso organized zzso memory are zzso leading to specific zzso laws that may be further examined zzso It is predicted that multiple focal zzso will impair performance more than a single zzso of the same size, that slit like zzso are more damaging than zzso zzso and that the same fraction of damage zzso to the total network zzso will result in significantly less performance decrease in larger zzso Our study is clinically motivated by the observation that in zzso zzso the size of metabolically impaired tissue zzso with the level of cognitive impairment more than the size of structural zzso Our results account for the zzso effect of the number of zzso rather than their overall size or structural damage, and for the zzso interaction between Alzheimer's disease and zzso zzso
