We have investigated a fully automatic setup error zzso method that zzso zzso zzso reconstructed zzso from a three-dimensional planning zzso zzso image onto two-dimensional zzso that are acquired in a treatment zzso We have chosen a zzso zzso zzso image registration method, hoping for zzso to intensity differences between the zzso and the zzso The zzso zzso is fully automatic since it is based on the image intensity values without zzso Using 10 repeated scans of an zzso chest phantom in one position and two single scans in two different positions, we evaluated the performance of the proposed method and a zzso method against the setup error determined by zzso zzso zzso The mean differences between the proposed method and the zzso zzso method were smaller than 1 zzso for zzso parameters and zzso degree for zzso zzso The standard zzso of estimates from the proposed method due to detector noise were smaller than zzso zzso and zzso degree for the zzso parameters and zzso zzso zzso
