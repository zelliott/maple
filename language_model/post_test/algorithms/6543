Given the positions of zzso genes along zzso sequence and probability values for protein alignments between zzso zzso identifies chains of gene pairs sharing zzso order between zzso regions, by identifying paths through a directed zzso graph zzso These chains of zzso gene pairs can represent zzso duplicated regions and genes within a single zzso or zzso regions between related zzso zzso mining of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso illustrates the use of zzso
