To examine the mechanisms of cell locomotion within a three-dimensional zzso cell mass, we have undertaken a systematic 3-D analysis of individual cell movements in the zzso zzso the first 3-D structure to form during development of the zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to examine two strains whose motion represents zzso on the spectrum of zzso behaviors that we have observed in zzso In zzso zzso cell motion is slow and zzso are a combination of random and zzso compared to zzso in which motion is fivefold faster and most zzso are zzso Although zzso or zzso motion was correlated with the zzso wave patterns present in each strain, we also found small but significant zzso of cells that moved differently from the majority, demonstrating that zzso waves are at best insufficient to explain all zzso behavior in zzso In examining zzso in these zzso we noted that zzso mounds tended to culminate directly to a zzso body, whereas zzso mounds first formed a migratory zzso By altering zzso conditions we could interchange these behaviors and then found that zzso motions also changed zzso This demonstrates a correlation between zzso motion and subsequent development, but it is not zzso zzso mounds composed of only zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso motion, suggesting that a zzso zzso zzso zzso but many of these mounds still culminated directly, demonstrating that zzso motion does not always lead to zzso zzso Our observations provide a detailed analysis of cell motion for two distinct modes of mound and zzso formation in zzso
