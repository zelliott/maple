This paper describes an extension of the so-called zzso zzso which is a widely used zzso method for solving dynamic models of cardiac cell zzso The proposed method applies a local zzso of zzso terms in combination with the zzso solution of linear ordinary differential equations to obtain a zzso accurate zzso zzso We compare the error and zzso load of the zzso scheme to the original zzso method and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso results indicate that the new method zzso the original zzso scheme for all the test zzso The comparison with the zzso solver reveals that the new method is more efficient for stiff zzso
