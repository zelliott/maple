zzso is one of the most fundamental problems in wireless sensor networks, since the locations of the sensor zzso are critical to both network operations and most application level zzso A zzso zzso scheme for wireless sensor networks is presented in this zzso First, we develop a standardized zzso approach for the local coordinate system formation wherein a zzso factor is introduced to regulate the number of master and slave zzso and the degree of connectivity among master zzso Second, using homogeneous zzso we derive a transformation zzso between two Cartesian coordinate systems to efficiently merge them into a global coordinate system and effectively overcome the flip ambiguity zzso The zzso operates zzso without a zzso zzso and does not require that the location of the sensors be known a zzso A set of zzso guidelines for the proposed zzso is derived based on a probability model and the energy requirements are also zzso A simulation analysis on a specific zzso example is conducted to validate the mathematical zzso zzso We also compare the performance of the proposed zzso under a variety zzso factor, zzso density and zzso communication radius zzso zzso show that our zzso zzso existing mechanisms in terms of accuracy and convergence zzso
