In recent years, improving water use efficiency has been one of the most important challenges for the agricultural zzso However, such improvements have led to the installation of zzso irrigation systems which generally require more energy to operate, especially in plantations on zzso and mountainous zzso Thus, the reduction of energy use in these systems has also become a major zzso zzso network zzso has been proposed as one of the most effective energy saving zzso Typically, however, the potential benefits of this management strategy have been evaluated by means of theoretical approaches in networks that were originally designed to supply water on demand and not after water application in real irrigation districts designed following zzso zzso In this work, this measure is applied to an irrigation district devoted to olive grove production in a mountainous area that was designed according to this management zzso With this aim, the zzso zzso and Energy Based zzso zzso algorithm, which was developed in a previous work, has been modified in order to take into account the specific characteristics of the irrigation district and its actual management, as well as to analyze sensitivity to several irrigation water depths in terms of both energy demand and zzso An economic analysis of the potential benefits of this management strategy is also carried zzso The results show that this measure has lead to a nearly zzso reduction in energy consumption, while increasing farmers' profits by zzso compared to traditional on-demand zzso
