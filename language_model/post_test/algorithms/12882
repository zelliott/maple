zzso resonance energy transfer zzso is an important method in studying zzso zzso But zzso zzso rapidly is difficult to do because of zzso between free zzso free zzso and zzso fluorescent signals when only zzso or zzso property of a zzso sample is zzso If zzso is studied with zzso zzso zzso zzso because the zzso intensity zzso of zzso zzso and zzso emissions occupy different regions within the zzso zzso zzso can be easily separated out by linear zzso In this paper, we report a novel high-speed zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso which simultaneously measures three projections of zzso from a zzso sample, which are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that these three zzso projections can be measured and zzso in approximately 1 zzso to provide rapid quantitative zzso in the presence of free donors and zzso The system can be zzso to enable real-time zzso reaction zzso
