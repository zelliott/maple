The performance of all four GOLD scoring functions has been evaluated for pose prediction and virtual screening under the standardized conditions of the comparative zzso and scoring experiment reported in this zzso Excellent pose prediction and good virtual screening performance was demonstrated using unmodified protein models and default zzso zzso The best performing scoring function for both pose prediction and virtual screening was demonstrated to be the recently introduced scoring function zzso We conclude that existing zzso programs already perform close to zzso in the zzso pose prediction experiments currently carried out and that more stringent pose prediction tests should be used in the zzso These should employ zzso zzso zzso of virtual screening performance remains problematic and much remains to be done to improve the usefulness of zzso available active and decoy sets for virtual zzso Finally we suggest that, for certain zzso function combinations, good enrichment may sometimes be a consequence of zzso property recognition rather than a zzso of the correct zzso zzso
