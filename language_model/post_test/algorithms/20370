zzso zzso such as zzso are routinely used for sequence zzso These zzso typically use areas of matching words to seed alignments which are then used to assess the degree of sequence zzso In this paper, we show that by formally separating the zzso and zzso process, and using information about word zzso to generate alignments and similarity scores, we can create a new zzso zzso which is both fast and zzso The formal split between word searching and alignment allows users to select an appropriate alignment method without affecting the underlying similarity zzso The zzso has been used to develop software for identifying entries in DNA sequence databases which are contaminated with zzso zzso 

We present three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which together allow zzso zzso to be found and assessed extremely zzso zzso is a word search zzso which uses probabilities to modify the significance attached to different words; zzso and zzso are alignment zzso An initial zzso has been shown to be approximately an order of magnitude faster than zzso The formal split between word searching and alignment not only offers considerable gains in performance, but also allows alignment generation to be viewed as a user interface problem, allowing the most useful output method to be selected without affecting the underlying similarity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of an artificial test set allows the optimal score threshold for identifying zzso contamination to be zzso zzso zzso were also used to determine the optimum word size zzso for finding zzso zzso An analysis of the entire expressed sequence tag zzso subset of zzso found a contamination rate of zzso A more detailed analysis of the 50 zzso zzso in zzso (an zzso subset of zzso finds an error rate of zzso principally due to two large-scale zzso
