Since the pioneering works of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Purcell zzso zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso zzso Gill D zzso Rev zzso zzso zzso trains of zzso have featured amongst the main tools of quantum zzso Echo trains find widespread use in nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and imaging zzso thanks to their ability to free the evolution of a zzso from several sources of zzso Spin echoes have also been researched in dynamic decoupling scenarios, for zzso the lifetimes of quantum states or zzso Inspired by this search we introduce a family of zzso zzso which can still detect zzso interactions like the chemical zzso This is achieved thanks to the presence of weak environmental fluctuations of common occurrence in zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both intuitive and rigorous zzso of the resulting zzso zzso zzso sequences are zzso zzso of these novel experiments are given for a variety of zzso scenarios including zzso of shift effects under zzso overwhelming individual chemical zzso and zzso zzso of chemically exchanging zzso
