zzso in judgments is a fundamental aspect of decision making, and tasks that collect confidence judgments are an zzso of zzso decision zzso We present a model for confidence judgments in recognition memory tasks that uses a zzso diffusion decision process with separate zzso of evidence for the different confidence zzso The zzso that first reaches its decision boundary determines which choice is zzso Five zzso for accumulating evidence were zzso and one of them produced proportions of responses for each of the choices and full response time zzso for each choice that closely matched empirical zzso With this algorithm, an increase in the evidence in one zzso is accompanied by a decrease in the others so that the total amount of evidence in the system is zzso Application of the model to the data from an earlier experiment zzso zzso & zzso 1994) uncovered a relationship between the shapes of zzso receiver operating characteristics and the behavior of response time zzso Both are explained in the model by the behavior of the decision zzso For zzso we also applied the decision model to a zzso motion discrimination task and found it accounted for data better than a competing class of zzso The confidence model presents a coherent account of confidence judgments and response time that cannot be explained with currently popular signal detection theory analyses or zzso models of zzso
