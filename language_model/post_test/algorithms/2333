In this paper the authors zzso evaluate the combined effect of both flow and diffusion in zzso free zzso zzso zzso A partition analysis zzso is used to derive a fourth order approximation (in zzso of the signal in an echo zzso zzso The authors also introduce a novel very fast simulation technique, based on a circular zzso which accurately accounts for both flow and zzso A zzso zzso sequence was implemented to obtain experimental data from a phantom containing three different zzso Excellent agreement between the theory and the experimental data was zzso Then by using the simulation zzso and experimental zzso of in zzso brain motion, the authors estimated the artifacts to be expected in zzso diffusion imaging of the brain and found them to be comparable with those of zzso zzso spin zzso Finally, the authors point out the zzso between the flow sensitivity of zzso and zzso zzso commonly used in fast zzso
