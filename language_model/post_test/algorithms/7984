We describe a combination of zzso and zzso methodology to accurately measure the electric force acting on a charged zzso which is trapped in an optical zzso This zzso apparatus allows measuring of the zzso potential with zzso accuracy and high zzso zzso The combination with zzso techniques in principle provides a mean to observe zzso or zzso zzso with single zzso zzso We show that it is possible to accurately profile the position and frequency dependent zzso and zzso flow inside a zzso structure of dimensions typically used in zzso applications without the need of fluorescent zzso We found good agreement to the theory of zzso flow when zzso effects for rapidly alternating electric fields are zzso
