The efficacy of conventional secondary bone zzso is limited in instances of a bilateral zzso zzso with a wide zzso gap and zzso of the zzso The purpose of this study is to suggest a systematic zzso to guide zzso treatment of a bilateral zzso zzso according to the position of the zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso 

A total of 51 patients with bilateral zzso zzso were investigated between January 2000 and February zzso The average age was zzso years, and the mean follow-up period was 47 zzso Conventional zzso bone zzso zzso was performed for patients with both a narrow zzso gap and acceptable position of the zzso Patients with both a wide zzso gap and acceptable zzso position were initially managed by zzso distraction zzso zzso repositioning was indicated in patients with both zzso and/or vertically zzso positioning of the zzso The extent of bone zzso following bone zzso was evaluated using the zzso zzso 

Of 102 zzso 98 zzso zzso showed satisfactory zzso take zzso zzso Only four zzso zzso exhibited a poor outcome, with more than 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso The average hospital stay was zzso days and no serious complications were zzso Our approach resulted in satisfactory surgical zzso This suggests the feasibility of a zzso approach for the correction of a bilateral zzso zzso Our zzso should be helpful for systematic and coordinated team approaches to rectify bilateral zzso zzso
