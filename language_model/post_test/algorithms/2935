Independent component analysis (or blind source zzso is assumed to be an essential component of sensory processing in the brain and could provide a less redundant representation about the external zzso Another powerful processing strategy is the zzso of internal representations according to the information bottleneck zzso This method would allow zzso zzso those components from zzso sensory input zzso that are related to other information sources, such as internal predictions or zzso zzso However, there exists a lack of models that could explain how zzso zzso could learn to execute either of these two processing zzso We show in this article how zzso zzso zzso with zzso could in principle learn in an zzso manner to carry out both information bottleneck zzso and the extraction of independent zzso We derive suitable learning rules, which extend the well-known zzso rule, from abstract information zzso zzso These rules will simultaneously keep the firing rate of the zzso within a biologically realistic zzso
