A quantity termed the zzso has been used to describe the results of electrical zzso zzso studies, with the implication of a clear distinction between ineffective and effective shock zzso Although several definitions of the threshold have been suggested, and various methods have been used to zzso it, no comparison of the zzso of the various methods could be found in the zzso This article, after presenting a method of applying basic probability theory to an assumed distribution relating probability of successful zzso to current zzso uses the method to examine several popular zzso for zzso zzso The results show that where a sharp transition exists from ineffective to effective current zzso most zzso yield fairly good zzso Where that transition is gradual (as it appears to be in all of the published reports zzso the zzso are shown to be zzso
