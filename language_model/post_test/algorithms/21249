The standard medical management for patients in zzso from massive pulmonary embolism zzso is systemic zzso but the utility of this treatment relative to zzso intervention zzso is zzso We evaluated the effectiveness of zzso as part of a treatment zzso for life-threatening zzso 

A retrospective review was performed on 70 consecutive patients with suspected acute zzso over a 10-year period (from 1997 to 2006) who had been referred for pulmonary zzso and/or zzso The criteria for study inclusion were patients who received zzso due to zzso confirmed massive zzso and zzso shock zzso index, zzso or zzso zzso zzso involved zzso zzso and fragmentation with or without zzso zzso 

Twelve patients were treated with zzso There were seven men and five women zzso age, 56 years; age range, 21 to 80 zzso Seven patients zzso were referred for zzso after failing systemic infusion with 100 zzso of tissue zzso zzso and five patients zzso had zzso to systemic zzso zzso fragmentation and zzso were performed in all patients zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was performed in eight patients zzso Technical success was achieved in 12 of 12 cases zzso There were no major procedural complications zzso zzso zzso improvement zzso index, zzso zzso was observed in 10 of 12 cases zzso The remaining two patients zzso died secondary to cardiac arrest within 24 zzso Ten of 12 patients zzso survived and remained stable until hospital discharge zzso zzso 20 zzso range, 3 to 51 zzso 

In the setting of zzso shock from massive zzso zzso is potentially a zzso treatment for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate systemic zzso
