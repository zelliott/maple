The expanding protein sequence and structure databases await methods allowing rapid similarity zzso Geometric zzso angle between two sequential zzso bond planes zzso and radius of zzso zzso as they appear in zzso fragments in zzso zzso proposed for use in evaluating structural similarity in proteins zzso The zzso zzso function expressing the radius of zzso dependence on the zzso in model zzso is altered in real proteins in a form characteristic for a particular zzso This can be used as a criterion for judging zzso 

A structural comparison of proteins representing a wide spectrum of structures was assessed versus sequence similarity analysis based on the genetic zzso zzso The term zzso zzso analogous to zzso zzso was introduced for the zzso zzso
