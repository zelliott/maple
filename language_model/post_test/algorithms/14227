The management of suspected zzso pneumonia zzso is traditionally based on either a clinical or a zzso zzso zzso examination of specimens may provide a valuable help to both zzso 

The objective was to test an zzso for the management of suspected pneumonia based on severity criteria and Gram zzso of zzso including early treatment of patients with a positive Gram stain of a protected zzso zzso zzso and awaiting culture results in patients with either Gram zzso of zzso zzso and protected zzso both being negative, or only positive zzso zzso zzso except in the presence of the severity zzso 

zzso study including 76 first episodes of suspected pneumonia in 4 zzso We assessed the rates of correctly diagnosed episodes and of those treated zzso zzso ultimately confirmed zzso or appropriately not receiving such therapy zzso zzso based on protected zzso culture zzso 

When zzso to, the zzso allowed early appropriate management in zzso of patients, including zzso of those with confirmed pneumonia, and zzso of those without confirmed zzso The rate of appropriately managed episodes using this zzso was significantly higher than that using a strategy based on the modified clinical pulmonary infection score zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso regimen was adequate in zzso of confirmed zzso 

A strategy based on severity criteria and Gram stain examination of respiratory tract specimens allows correct identification and appropriate management of more than zzso of mechanically zzso patients who need or do not need therapy for suspected zzso
