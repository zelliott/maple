The zzso behavior of two model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been investigated by a comparative 10 zzso molecular dynamics zzso The detailed zzso of the two zzso was described using three force fields especially developed for modeling of carbohydrates in explicit zzso To validate the theoretical results the two compounds were zzso and subjected to 500 zzso zzso zzso including zzso field zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In short, the older zzso force field exhibited a more structured zzso interaction leading to better agreement with the zzso properties of the two compounds, whereas especially the zzso linkage and the primary zzso groups were zzso zzso In contrast, the new generation of the zzso force field zzso and the most recent version of the zzso force field zzso exhibited less structured zzso interactions with the result that the zzso properties of the two zzso were underestimated, whereas the simulations of the zzso linkage and the primary zzso groups were significantly improved and in excellent agreement with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The difference between the two classes of force field (more structured and less structured zzso zzso was zzso by calculation of the zzso zzso as calculated by zzso pair zzso At one extreme, the zzso O zzso leader O pair distribution function yielded a peak density of zzso times the bulk density in the first zzso shell when using the older zzso force field, whereas the maximum density observed in the zzso force field was calculated to be zzso at the other zzso
