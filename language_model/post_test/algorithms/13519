zzso rays zzso zzso are present all year round at Lady Elliot Island zzso in the southern Great zzso zzso Australia, with zzso in abundance during autumn and zzso Drivers influencing these fluctuations in abundance of zzso zzso at the site remain zzso Based on daily count, zzso weather and zzso data collected over a three-year period, this study examined the link between the relative number of zzso of manta rays at zzso the zzso environment, and the habitat use of individuals around the zzso reef using zzso additive zzso The response variable in each of the three zzso additive models was number of zzso zzso trip at zzso of zzso cleaning or zzso zzso zzso We used a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lunar predictor zzso zzso for zzso cleaning and zzso zzso zzso explained zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso observed in the respective models and highlighted five zzso zzso day of year, wind speed, zzso concentration and fraction of moon zzso as common influences to the three zzso There were more manta rays at zzso in autumn and winter, slower wind speeds, higher zzso and around the new and full zzso The winter peak in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso in cleaning and zzso activity around the zzso reef, which suggests that enhanced food availability may be a principal driver for this seasonal zzso A spatial analysis of zzso observations highlighted several sites around the zzso reef as zzso areas where cleaning and zzso activities commonly occur, while the southern end of the reef is primarily a zzso zzso The use of extensive citizen science zzso such as those collected by dive operators in this study, is encouraged as they can provide valuable insights into a zzso zzso
