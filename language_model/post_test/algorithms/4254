zzso effects are an important component in the population dynamics of numerous zzso zzso for these zzso effects in population viability analyses generally requires estimates of zzso population growth rates, but such data are unavailable for most species and particularly difficult to obtain for large zzso Here, we present a zzso modeling framework that allows zzso the expected zzso growth rates under a zzso zzso effect before the zzso effect occurs or can be zzso The approach relies on representing the mechanisms causing the zzso effect in a zzso model, which can be zzso and validated from data on the mechanisms rather than data on population zzso We illustrate the approach using polar bears zzso zzso and estimate their expected zzso growth by linking a mating dynamics model to a zzso projection zzso The zzso zzso defined as the population density below which growth becomes negative, is shown to depend on zzso sex ratio, and the life history parameters determining reproduction and zzso The zzso threshold is thus both zzso and zzso zzso analyses of the zzso threshold show that different combinations of the parameters determining reproduction and survival can lead to differing zzso zzso even if these differing combinations imply the same zzso population growth zzso The approach further shows how zzso can induce long transient zzso even in populations that eventually grow to carrying zzso zzso the models to the zzso zzso polar bear population of zzso zzso Sound, Canada, shows that a zzso zzso effect is a plausible mechanism for slow recovery of this zzso Our approach is zzso to any mating system and life cycle, and could aid proactive management and conservation strategies, for example, by providing a zzso estimates of minimum conservation targets for rare species or minimum zzso targets for zzso and invasive zzso
