Among the six zzso systems identified in zzso bacteria, the type III zzso system zzso plays important roles in the disease development of zzso zzso has attracted a great deal of research zzso However, the zzso mechanism has not been fully understood zzso zzso the identification of zzso zzso zzso is an important and challenging zzso This paper adopts machine learning methods to identify type III zzso zzso zzso We extract features from zzso acid sequences and conduct feature reduction based on zzso semantic information by using zzso zzso allocation zzso The experimental results on zzso zzso data set demonstrate the good performance of the new zzso
