zzso an zzso separation procedure for an unknown mixture is a challenging zzso An important example is the separation and zzso of a new drug and its zzso One approach to start method development is the screening of the mixture on dissimilar zzso systems, zzso systems with large selectivity zzso After zzso the most suited system is retained for further method zzso In a step prior to such strategy dissimilar zzso systems need to be zzso In this paper the performance of different zzso selection approaches, described in the literature, was visually evaluated and zzso Additionally, zzso projection approach zzso was tested as another potential selection zzso All techniques, including the zzso method, were able to select (a set zzso dissimilar zzso systems and many similarities between the selections were zzso However, the zzso and Stone zzso performed best in selecting the most dissimilar systems in the earliest steps of the selection zzso The generalized zzso correlation method zzso and the zzso zzso zzso trees zzso were also performing zzso zzso and weighted pair group method using zzso averages zzso are less zzso
