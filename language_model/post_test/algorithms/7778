zzso theory provides many metrics of complex network organization that can be applied to analysis of brain networks derived from zzso zzso Here we investigated the zzso reliability of graph metrics of functional networks derived from zzso zzso data recorded in two sessions from 16 healthy volunteers who were studied at rest and during performance of the zzso working memory task in each zzso For each zzso data at each session, we used a zzso filter to estimate the mutual information zzso between each pair of zzso sensors in each of the classical frequency intervals from gamma to low delta in the overall range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso the zzso zzso and 8 global network metrics were zzso the zzso zzso path zzso zzso efficiency, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of each graph metric was assessed using the zzso correlation zzso Good reliability was demonstrated for most metrics applied to the zzso data zzso zzso zzso was greater for metrics in lower frequency zzso Higher frequency zzso and zzso networks were less reliable at a global level but demonstrated high reliability of zzso metrics in frontal and zzso zzso Performance of the zzso task was associated with greater reliability than zzso on resting state zzso Task practice was also associated with greater zzso zzso these results suggest that graph metrics are sufficiently reliable to be considered for future zzso studies of functional brain network zzso
