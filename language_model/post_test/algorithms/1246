zzso wall motions are not easily studied and are frequently deduced from zzso and zzso zzso This study aimed to establish a method of wall movement analysis based on an automatic technique of image zzso zzso of rat zzso were fixed in an organ bath under zzso zzso A real-time zzso zzso was used to find the contours of the zzso using video zzso After the zzso a mapping of zzso wall movements was performed based on diameter zzso In the 260 experiments without zzso zzso wall activity was always zzso zzso activity was found in zzso of the experiments and periodic wall motion in zzso with zzso activity found more frequently zzso than zzso activity zzso These zzso activities, related to zzso slow waves, had their zzso decreased by zzso and were modified by zzso Analysis of a zzso wave after zzso stimulation showed that it is characterized by an increase of the diameter of the zzso followed by a zzso Moreover, this methodology allows analysis of the initiation of a zzso zzso
