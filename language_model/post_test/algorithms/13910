For treatment of lung cancer, dose zzso corrections and subsequent prescription zzso remain zzso Previous zzso studies based on slab geometry with a single beam geometry do not represent the clinical zzso A circumscribed tumor within lung poses a more complex zzso Energy choice also remains zzso 

An zzso phantom was modified by replacing lung zzso zzso and zzso zzso diameters by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The phantom was scanned on a CT zzso Gross, clinical, and planning target volumes zzso zzso zzso including tumor and regional zzso zzso including tumor only) were designated zzso zzso planning was performed with large fields zzso covering zzso and boost fields zzso for each zzso for 6 and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso calculation zzso were zzso Film was placed between phantom slices at the zzso zzso The phantom was zzso with monitor units corresponding to homogeneous calculations, based on a homogeneous zzso Measured and calculated doses were compared by zzso and dose volume zzso zzso chambers and zzso were also used for some test zzso 

The measured minimum dose covering zzso was within zzso of the homogeneous prescription dose of 70 zzso for 6 zzso zzso while a lower dose zzso of prescription zzso was measured for 18 zzso The zzso zzso the minimum dose to zzso by zzso If the monitor units had been reduced according to simplistic zzso calculations, the small zzso would have only been covered by 58 zzso for 18 zzso zzso Based on this, a zzso may opt to actually increase the prescribed dose, thereby offsetting decreased monitor zzso None of the zzso predicted the diffuse zzso associated with 18 zzso photons in zzso 

Before adjusting dose prescriptions based on zzso corrections, realistic phantom studies must be zzso The accuracy and effect of the corrections must then be zzso The deficient coverage of zzso by the 18 zzso beam compares unfavorably with the slight increase zzso in hot spots associated with 6 zzso Our studies support strong caution before reducing dose prescriptions based on simple zzso
