zzso determination of zzso can be provided by monitoring ultraviolet zzso of zzso in spent zzso This not only overcomes dependency on zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso it zzso zzso associated with zzso the zzso distribution volume and its high measurement frequency tightly reflects the course of the zzso Our study compared the zzso zzso and zzso with the commonly used zzso zzso A first study of 16 patients compared ultraviolet zzso against blood zzso obtained by using the zzso zzso of serial blood zzso A second study included 18 patients and compared the ultraviolet and blood values under routine zzso Both studies showed mean zzso zzso and zzso values statistically indistinguishable from their zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring of ultraviolet zzso of spent zzso is zzso in routine zzso allowing continuous measure of removed zzso from spent zzso without disturbing the patient or treatment zzso
