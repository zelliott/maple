We examined whether zzso decisions for zzso zzso using probabilities derived from zzso models along with zzso decision rules, could be more cost-effective than the actual decisions of ten zzso We zzso calculated the probability of a positive throat culture zzso for each of 310 patients using four different models based on zzso analysis zzso a branching zzso zzso and zzso zzso (3 and zzso zzso zzso were based on these probabilities and zzso zzso We calculated direct medical and indirect costs per correct action taken zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two zzso projected decisions were more cost-effective than the zzso Model 1 primarily would have reduced treatment costs zzso no diseased patient zzso model 4 primarily would have reduced throat culture costs (with zzso projected zzso While using statistical decision rules may be cost-effective in this setting, their adoption should be consistent with physician and patient zzso
