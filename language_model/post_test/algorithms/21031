This paper introduces and evaluates a zzso Fisher scoring zzso zzso The zzso provides zzso zzso in zzso models of projection data with zzso zzso zzso is achieved by penalized likelihood with a general zzso zzso Local convergence of the zzso zzso is proven under conditions that do not require iteration dependent zzso We show that, when the zzso zzso it zzso to the zzso maximum penalized likelihood zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that, with suitable choice of relaxation zzso and restriction of the zzso to respect zzso constraints, the zzso zzso provides convergence to the constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso often attains a maximum penalized likelihood faster than other zzso zzso which are designed for zzso constrained penalized zzso
