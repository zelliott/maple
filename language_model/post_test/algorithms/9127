zzso zzso imaging has been widely applied to analyze zzso patterns of cellular dynamics in the brain and spinal zzso However, it is difficult to integrate spatial information obtained from imaging data in specific regions of interest across multiple samples, due to large zzso in the size, shape and internal structure of zzso To solve this problem, we attempted to zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso images focusing on the zzso structure in the gray zzso We employed three zzso methods, the zzso transformation zzso the zzso transformation zzso and the combination of these two methods zzso The zzso is a novel zzso transformation method developed in this study to adjust an individual image onto the template image in the polar coordinate zzso We next compared the accuracy of these three zzso zzso We evaluated two zzso zzso the spatial distribution of zzso that are not zzso to any layer and the error ratio by the zzso cross validation zzso In this study, we used zzso marker zzso zzso images of zzso zzso cervical spinal zzso slices (21 images obtained from 4 zzso to create the standard zzso and also to serve for benchmark zzso We found that the zzso outperformed other two methods, though the accuracy of each method varied depending on the zzso This novel image zzso technique would be zzso to optical recording such as zzso dye imaging, and will enable statistical evaluations of neural zzso across multiple zzso
