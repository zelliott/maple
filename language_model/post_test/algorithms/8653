We simultaneously recorded zzso sound and air flow from nine normal subjects zzso males and two zzso Sound was picked up at the zzso zzso notch with an zzso sensitive microphone held in a small zzso zzso zzso was measured at the mouth using a zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso Both sound and flow were directly digitized at a sampling rate of zzso zzso and then divided in zzso zzso For each sound block the frequency spectrum was zzso using the fast zzso zzso In order to evaluate instantaneous zzso from zzso sounds we investigated eight methods divided in two groups of zzso In the first group zzso reference zzso zzso we assumed that a relationship existed between sound and flow and was thus reflected by the variations of certain zzso We chose to use simple straightforward zzso already known and zzso We tested four different zzso During a zzso phase, we built for each zzso P a reference curve representing the variations of P versus flow and being specific to each zzso Then, an unknown flow was evaluated in calculating P on a zzso block, and the reference curve gave the corresponding zzso In the second group, we made a zzso zzso analysis of sound zzso for revealing the frequency zzso induced by the zzso We tested two kinds of zzso as well as two ways of zzso a flow to a given zzso This led us to four other methods for calculating the zzso All the eight methods but one gave a mean uncertainty in the measure of flow of about zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
