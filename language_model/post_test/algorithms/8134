The zzso formation is believed to play a central role in memory functions related to the representation of zzso Events are usually considered as temporally bounded zzso in contrast to the continuous nature of sensory signal flow they originate zzso Events are then organized and stored according to behavioral relevance and are used to facilitate prediction of similar zzso In this paper we are interested in the kind of representation of sensory signals that allows for detecting and/or predicting zzso Based on new results on the identification problem of linear hidden zzso we propose a zzso network with biologically sound zzso tuning that can represent zzso relationships and define zzso Interestingly, the wiring zzso of our architecture not only resembles the gross anatomy of the zzso formation (including the zzso zzso but it also features similar spatial distribution functions of activity zzso and zzso zzso zzso as found in the different parts of the zzso zzso We shortly discuss how our model zzso to different theories on the role of the zzso formation in forming episodic memories or supporting spatial zzso We speculate that our approach may constitute a step toward a unified theory about the functional role of the zzso and the structure of memory zzso
