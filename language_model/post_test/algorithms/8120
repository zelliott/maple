The issue of how children learn the meaning of words is fundamental to zzso zzso The recent attempts to develop or evolve efficient communication protocols among interacting robots or virtual agents have brought that issue to a central place in more applied research fields, such as zzso linguistics and neural networks, as zzso An attractive approach to learning an zzso mapping is the so-called zzso zzso This learning scenario is based on the intuitive notion that a zzso can determine the meaning of a word by finding something in common across all observed uses of that zzso Here we show how the deterministic zzso Modeling Fields zzso categorization mechanism can be used by the zzso as an efficient zzso to zzso the correct zzso zzso To achieve that we first reduce the original zzso learning problem to a batch learning problem where the zzso to the zzso mechanism are all possible zzso associations that could be zzso from the zzso learning zzso Since many of those associations are zzso they are considered as clutter or noise and discarded automatically by a clutter detector model included in our zzso zzso With these two key zzso learning and clutter zzso zzso mechanism was capable to zzso perfectly the correct zzso zzso
