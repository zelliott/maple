Gene expression signatures have the ability to serve in both zzso and zzso capacities in patient zzso The use of zzso as the starting material and the zzso of this zzso however, dictate that zzso must be zzso or stored in a solution that can maintain the integrity of the zzso We compared pairs of zzso and zzso zzso tissue from 30 such paired zzso zzso breast tumors and 21 such paired zzso B colon zzso We assessed the correlation of gene expression profiles and prediction of recurrence based on two zzso zzso zzso stored in zzso zzso generated expression profiles with excellent correlation zzso zzso correlation zzso of zzso and zzso for the breast and colon tumor pairs, zzso compared to those produced by zzso that were zzso The correlation in the prediction of recurrence was zzso and zzso for the breast and colon tumor pairs, respectively, between these two types of tissue handling zzso This novel finding demonstrates that zzso signatures can be obtained from zzso zzso zzso an important step in bringing gene expression signatures to the zzso
