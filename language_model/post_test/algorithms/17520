A new method for the accurate determination of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The method is based on a modified zzso experiment, where a zzso zzso sequence precedes the zzso pulse zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is based on simultaneous zzso of zzso chemical shift and zzso evolution zzso The time zzso for the zzso zzso zzso evolution can be suitably scaled with respect to the corresponding zzso for the chemical shift zzso Typically a zzso factor of 2 to 3 is employed for the measurement of zzso zzso constants, while zzso by a factor of 10 to 15 is applied when small long-range zzso are zzso The same pulse scheme with zzso evolution period zzso for zzso or long-range zzso allows the determination of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso in the F1 dimension yield the appropriately multiplied zzso zzso
