zzso zzso zzso zzso is a long-established technique for studying protein secondary structures in zzso zzso analyses of CD data rely on the availability of reference zzso comprised of zzso CD zzso of proteins whose crystal structures have been zzso This article reports on the creation of a new reference zzso which effectively covers both secondary structure and fold space, and uses the higher information content available in zzso radiation circular zzso zzso zzso to more accurately predict secondary structure than has been possible with existing reference zzso It also examines the effects of wavelength range, structural zzso and different means of zzso secondary structures on the accuracy of the zzso In addition, it describes a novel use of zzso cluster analyses to identify protein zzso based on spectral properties zzso The databases are shown to be zzso in both conventional CD and zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso by combining new zzso and zzso methods, a database has been produced that should have wide zzso as a tool for structural molecular zzso
