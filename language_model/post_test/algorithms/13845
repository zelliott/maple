The authors developed and tested automated and zzso zzso tracking and zzso techniques for determining the central axis of the zzso 

A zzso gastrointestinal tract phantom was used to test the accuracy of an automated zzso for central axis determination and zzso zzso Variations in zzso features between straight and unraveled formats were compared in a canine zzso segment in zzso and a human colon in zzso by using spiral zzso zzso Three readers each performed three zzso zzso 

zzso of the automated zzso was confirmed by the high degree of correlation in the zzso feature zzso zzso error, zzso zzso For the canine colon segment, accuracy of the zzso zzso was confirmed by comparison with the automated zzso For the human zzso readings were zzso with zzso zzso zzso standard zzso mean variation in zzso 

An automated zzso for central axis deterioration and unraveling the colon has been validated in a gastrointestinal tract zzso A zzso zzso has been shown to be zzso and zzso
