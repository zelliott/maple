To calculate smooth zzso zzso profiles for the correction of zzso by means of zzso laser zzso zzso and to zzso the typical topographical changes, especially in the transition zone, in terms of zzso distance and instantaneous radius of zzso 

zzso were determined to yield a smooth transition surrounding a zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso depth in the transition zone were zzso zzso optical zones of zzso diameter with 1 or zzso transition zones were zzso The variation in zzso and instantaneous power along one zzso was subsequently zzso The power profile of a zzso zzso zzso correction on a zzso surface zzso zzso was presented as an example for both zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso for zzso the transition zone is necessarily zzso than the original zzso The more abrupt the transition, the more pronounced the zzso A central zzso of zzso D entailed a zzso zzso of zzso D or zzso D in transition zones of 2 and 1 zzso zzso zzso In the transition zone, the mean rate of change of zzso power was 15 and 45 zzso zzso 

Making the central cornea steeper by means of zzso zzso implies that the periphery should be flattened zzso zzso The amount of zzso is directly zzso to the degree of zzso and is relatively larger if the transition is more zzso
