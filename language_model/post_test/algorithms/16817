A method for measuring and correcting the row displacement errors in lattice images acquired using scanning based methods is zzso This type of distortion is apparent in zzso images acquired using zzso techniques such as scanning transmission electron zzso zzso and translates to vertical streaks zzso every feature in zzso zzso This paper presents a method to measure and correct the distortion based on the phase analysis of the streaks in zzso zzso The zzso and the precision of the method is demonstrated using a model image and two experimental zzso images of zzso zzso thin film and a 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is implemented in a freely available Digital zzso zzso
