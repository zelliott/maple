The pattern of variation in heart rate on a zzso basis contains information concerning sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso contributions to zzso nervous system zzso zzso of heart rate zzso In the present study, heart period zzso zzso time series data were collected at rest and during 3 different treadmill exercise protocols from 6 zzso zzso zzso and spectral power were determined in 3 frequency zzso very low zzso zzso or zzso zzso low zzso zzso or zzso zzso and high zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of sympathetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity were zzso Power in all bands fell progressively with increasing exercise intensity from rest to zzso At the zzso zzso and zzso power continued to fall but zzso power zzso zzso rose from rest to walk, then fell with increasing effort and was lowest at the zzso zzso fell from rest to walk, then rose and was highest at the zzso zzso zzso power exceeded combined zzso and zzso power at all zzso with the ratio zzso to zzso power being lowest at the walk and highest at the zzso zzso indicators showed considerable zzso variation, and varied less consistently than raw power with increasing physical zzso In the horses zzso the relationship between power and zzso changed at exercise zzso associated with heart rates above approximately zzso zzso At this level, zzso and other zzso mechanisms may become more important than zzso zzso in influencing heart rate and heart rate zzso zzso zzso at intense effort may be influenced by zzso zzso zzso of locomotion and work of zzso zzso analysis in the frequency domain would appear to be of potential value as a zzso means of assessing zzso zzso of heart rate at low exercise zzso zzso The technique may be a sensitive method for assessing exercise response to experimental zzso and disease zzso
