The International zzso Foundation zzso and the International Federation of Clinical zzso and Laboratory Medicine zzso recommend that a marker of bone formation zzso zzso type I N zzso zzso and a marker of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso are used as reference zzso for bone turnover markers in clinical zzso 

Bone turnover markers zzso predict fracture risk, and zzso changes in specific markers account for a substantial proportion of fracture risk zzso The aims of this report were to determine their clinical potential in the prediction of fracture risk and for monitoring the treatment of osteoporosis and to set an appropriate research zzso 

Evidence from prospective studies was gathered through literature review of the zzso database between the years 2000 and 2010 and the systematic review of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality up to zzso 

High levels of zzso may predict fracture risk independently from bone mineral density in zzso zzso They have been used for this purpose in clinical practice for many years, but there is still a need for stronger evidence on which to base zzso zzso provide zzso information on the response to osteoporosis treatment, and as a result, they are widely used for monitoring treatment in the zzso However, their clinical value for monitoring is limited by inadequate appreciation of the sources of zzso by limited data for comparison of treatments using the same zzso and by inadequate quality zzso zzso recommend one bone formation marker zzso and one bone zzso marker zzso to be used as reference markers and measured by zzso zzso in zzso and intervention studies in order to compare the performance of alternatives and to enlarge the international experience of the application of markers to clinical zzso 

zzso hold promise in fracture risk prediction and for monitoring zzso zzso over their clinical use can be in part resolved by adopting international reference zzso
