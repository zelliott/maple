zzso geometry zzso have long been associated with zzso outcomes but there is little published evidence to support zzso We studied serial wound zzso of 338 zzso leg zzso zzso that had been followed during a controlled, zzso zzso pivotal trial of two topical wound treatments, to determine whether the relationship between wound surface area and wound perimeter zzso zzso as well as the qualitative assessment of wound shape, could be correlated to zzso zzso zzso that zzso to a more convex wound shape, and maintained a linear relationship between their wound margin size and wound surface area size, had faster healing rates and were more likely to completely heal by 12 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso that initially presented with isolated areas of zzso within the wound margins, large zzso or were segmented into multiple zzso typically had a poorer linear correlation between their margins and their surface zzso Only 18 out of zzso zzso zzso with a linear zzso eventually reached full wound closure, zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the remaining wounds with an zzso or zzso zzso exact zzso We believe our results show that the zzso relationship between one-dimensional perimeter and area zzso accurately zzso to the healing progress of the zzso zzso that do not correlate to this linear relationship zzso zzso or multiple islands of zzso may be zzso different than wounds that have good linear zzso which we concluded through the analysis of wound zzso zzso
