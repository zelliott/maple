One of the main goals of zzso field zzso is to increase the spatial resolution reached in structural and functional zzso Here, the possibility to obtain in zzso images of the human brain with zzso volumes below zzso is shown at zzso To zzso zzso and suppress ringing artifacts, an zzso zzso zzso sequence is used, which acquires more averages in the center than in the outer regions of zzso The weighting function is adjusted to avoid losses in spatial resolution and scan duration compared to a conventional experiment with an equal number of scans and otherwise identical zzso zzso resolution and zzso of the weighted sequence are compared to conventionally acquired images by means of phantom and in zzso zzso and show improved image quality with unchanged spatial resolution and an zzso increase of up to zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso resolution images with a zzso volume of zzso zzso from the human brain have sufficient zzso and show fine zzso detail, demonstrating the potential of the zzso The combination of zzso imaging and highly sensitive array coils at zzso fields thus makes it possible to obtain images with zzso spatial resolutions within acceptable scan zzso
