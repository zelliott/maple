A recent clinical trial revealed that highly zzso zzso acid zzso an zzso zzso fatty acid, reduces the zzso of cardiovascular zzso However, the detailed mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso is still poorly zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso vascular index zzso a new index of zzso zzso that is less influenced by blood pressure zzso as well as on serum zzso zzso zzso zzso an oxidized LDL zzso in the zzso zzso zzso obese Japanese subjects with zzso syndromes were randomly divided into two groups zzso the zzso group zzso g administered daily for 3 zzso and the control zzso zzso were taken to assess the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and pulse wave zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced the levels of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased the levels of zzso relative to the control group for 3 months zzso zzso zzso linear zzso analysis revealed that the only significant zzso for a decrease in zzso by zzso is a reduction in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso reduction of zzso was only significantly correlated with a decrease in total cholesterol and an increase in zzso zzso This study is the first demonstration that zzso improves zzso zzso and is less influenced by zzso possibly through the suppression of zzso thereby leading to a reduction in the frequency of cardiovascular disease development in zzso zzso
