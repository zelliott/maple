We developed a new zzso that estimates locations and sizes of anomalies in zzso conducting medium based on electrical zzso zzso zzso zzso When only the boundary current and zzso zzso are available, it is not practically feasible to reconstruct accurate high-resolution zzso zzso or zzso images of a zzso In this paper, we focus our attention on the zzso of locations and sizes of anomalies with different zzso values compared with the background zzso We showed the performance of the zzso from experimental results using a zzso zzso system and saline zzso With about zzso measurement error in boundary zzso data, we found that the minimal size zzso of the zzso anomaly is about zzso of the size zzso of the zzso Potential applications include the monitoring of zzso related zzso events and bubble detection in zzso zzso Since this new zzso requires neither any forward solver nor time-consuming zzso process, it is fast enough for various real-time applications in medicine and zzso zzso
