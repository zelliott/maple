To assess zzso and zzso reliability of an zzso German version of the zzso Assessment zzso zzso in geriatric patients with zzso zzso and high zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso cohort study with double zzso assessment by a medical and zzso zzso 

Random sample of frail, cognitively impaired elderly with acute disease requiring hospital zzso 

A total of 39 frail elderly, mean age 83 zzso 7 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso female, with cognitive zzso a high prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a significant risk of zzso Of these, 13 revealed delirium, which was superimposed on zzso in zzso 

A translated and zzso version of the zzso was validated against a zzso and geriatric consensus reference standard based on zzso Additional measures included the Short Portable Mental zzso zzso the zzso State zzso and the zzso Index for cognitive impairment severity, the zzso zzso on zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis and the zzso Index, illness severity zzso Illness zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso was correctly detected by zzso zzso in 10 out of 13 delirious patients resulting in a high sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for both zzso zzso ratio revealed an almost zzso risk of zzso with positive zzso zzso zzso reliability was excellent with a Cohen's k of zzso zzso zzso for the algorithm, single zzso k values varied between zzso and zzso 

The German zzso is a reliable and valid measure of delirium, even in frail, acutely diseased elderly with zzso zzso
