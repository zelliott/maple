zzso zzso wound complications remain zzso The prevailing approach for deep zzso wound infection of zzso and zzso coverage without zzso closure makes subsequent zzso zzso 

An analysis of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a single institution between 1986 and 2001 was zzso Prospective data collection and chart review were used to compare different treatment strategies for zzso zzso 

Of zzso patients, 122 had zzso wound complications zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class 1), 45 zzso superficial infections zzso zzso class zzso and 62 zzso deep zzso wound infections zzso zzso class zzso zzso patients with deep zzso infection were treated by zzso zzso and delayed primary zzso There were initial treatment failures in 6 patients zzso and ultimate failures in 2 patients zzso both of whom zzso One of these patients had previously received external beam radiation after a radical mastectomy for breast zzso Median length of stay was 32 days and median time to wound healing was 85 zzso Twenty-five patients were managed by muscle zzso coverage without zzso zzso There were 6 initial treatment failures zzso but no ultimate failures or deaths zzso zzso zzso Median length of stay was 31 days and median infection time was 161 zzso 

In patients with zzso deep zzso wound infection without previous chest radiation, zzso zzso and delayed skin closure is zzso It offers a shorter healing time and probably makes late cardiac zzso zzso We propose an zzso for the management of zzso zzso
