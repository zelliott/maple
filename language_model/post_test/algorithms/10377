A structural similarity tool was developed and aimed to search for environmentally persistent zzso The basis for the tool was a selection of so-called anchor molecules and a zzso chemical map of zzso The map was constructed using principal component analysis covering zzso drugs described by 67 diverse calculated chemical zzso The anchor molecules zzso zzso and zzso were selected to represent drugs of known environmental zzso In addition 12 chemicals listed by the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants were used representing typical environmental zzso Chemical similarity was zzso by measuring relative zzso distances in the zzso chemical map, and more than 100 nearest neighbors zzso were found within a relative distance of less than zzso from each drug zzso The developed chemical similarity approach not only identified persistent or zzso drugs but also a large number of potentially persistent drugs lacking environmental fate zzso
