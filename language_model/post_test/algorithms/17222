The importance of applying zzso zzso fusion in the abdominal and zzso areas has been recognized in recent studies aiming at zzso therapy of zzso According to our earlier results zzso and liver volume determination with different zzso methods is inaccurate with zzso zzso We therefore applied a zzso registration procedure to the zzso of zzso and liver volumes and zzso activity ratios in three male volunteers administered zzso zzso and zzso zzso The objectives of the study were to investigate if the zzso of zzso in the zzso and liver can be measured more accurately when the anatomical borders of these zzso are transferred from zzso to zzso and to test a zzso registration method for improving three-dimensional zzso for zzso treatment zzso A good correlation was found between zzso activity ratios calculated from zzso average activity per zzso values and from total zzso counts derived from registered data but not from projection zzso The average registration residual with this zzso fusion method is approximately 1-2 zzso in the abdominal zzso Combining anatomical images with zzso is therefore important for improving quantitative zzso also in the zzso
