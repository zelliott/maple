zzso zzso is often used in zzso to zzso the surprise, or significance, associated with a given zzso An zzso is provided that zzso the exact zzso associated with any observed sample, against a zzso zzso distribution, using the zzso zzso The efficient branch and bound code, far exceeding the full zzso implemented by commercial packages, is especially useful with small sample, sparse data and rare events, common scenarios in zzso where approximations are often inaccurate and zzso This code base can also be adapted to zzso exact zzso of other statistics in diverse sampling zzso
