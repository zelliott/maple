We used acoustic zzso to study the impulse response of the zzso potential in the barn zzso nucleus zzso zzso evoked a complex zzso neural response with a component that reflected the best frequency measured with tonal zzso The envelope of this component was obtained from the zzso signal created using the zzso zzso The time courses of the envelope and carrier zzso were characterized by fitting them with zzso The envelope was better fitted with a zzso than with the envelope of a zzso zzso The carrier was better fitted with a frequency glide than with a constant instantaneous zzso The change of the instantaneous frequency with time was better fitted with a linear fit than with a zzso zzso zzso glides had not been observed in the bird's auditory system zzso The glides were similar to those observed in the zzso auditory zzso Response zzso group zzso frequency, and phase depended in a systematic way on click zzso In most cases, response zzso decreased zzso as stimulus level zzso while group zzso phase, and frequency increased zzso as level zzso Thus the impulse response of the zzso potential in the nucleus zzso of barn zzso reflects many characteristics also observed in responses of the zzso membrane and auditory nerve in zzso
