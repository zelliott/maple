The output image of a digital camera is subject to a severe degradation due to noise in the image zzso This paper proposes a novel technique to combine zzso and zzso procedures systematically into a single operation by exploiting their obvious zzso We first design a filter as if we are zzso zzso a zzso value from a noisy zzso zzso zzso With additional constraints, we show that the same filter zzso are appropriate for color filter array zzso zzso given noisy sensor zzso The proposed technique can combine many existing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso In this paper, a total least squares zzso method is used to demonstrate the zzso The zzso is tested on color images with zzso noise and on raw sensor data from a real zzso digital camera that we zzso The experimental results confirm that the proposed method suppresses noise zzso image sensor noise zzso while effectively zzso the missing zzso zzso demonstrating a significant improvement in image quality when compared to treating zzso and zzso problems zzso
