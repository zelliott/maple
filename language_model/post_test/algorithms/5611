The zzso between neural spike trains and zzso potential recordings, called zzso zzso is of key importance in many zzso zzso In this work, aside from questions of zzso performance, we demonstrate that theoretical zzso zzso for a broad class of zzso models depends on the expected rate of zzso This rate dependence confounds the phase zzso of spike events to zzso zzso with overall zzso activity and is demonstrated zzso for a large class of zzso models, and in zzso Finally, the relationship between the zzso zzso and the intensity field zzso is detailed zzso This latter quantity is independent of zzso firing rate and, under commonly found conditions, is zzso to the probability that a zzso spikes at a specific phase of field zzso zzso intensity field zzso is a zzso measure and a candidate on which to base the appropriate statistical zzso of spike field zzso
