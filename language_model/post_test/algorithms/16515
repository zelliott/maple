The presence of uncontrolled mechanical zzso is typically the main zzso factor of a zzso zzso We present a method that instead of trying to zzso zzso it takes advantage of their presence to produce the different zzso The method is based on spatial and time domain processing techniques to zzso first the different unknown zzso and then reconstruct the phase from these zzso zzso In order to compensate the camera movement, it is needed to perform an zzso registration process between the different zzso zzso and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique without the use of any zzso zzso
