The assessment of tissue zzso by dynamic zzso zzso imaging involves a zzso zzso For analysis of zzso imaging data, we implemented a zzso approach to select appropriate zzso parameters for zzso using the standard and generalized singular value decomposition zzso zzso Carlo simulation experiments were carried out to study the performance and to compare with other existing methods used for zzso analysis of zzso imaging zzso The present approach is found to be robust and reliable at the levels of noise commonly encountered in zzso imaging, and for different models of the underlying tissue zzso The advantages of the present method, as compared with previous methods, include its efficiency of computation, ability to achieve adequate zzso to reproduce less noisy solutions, and that it does not require prior knowledge of the noise zzso The proposed method is applied on actual patient study cases with brain tumors and zzso stroke, to illustrate its zzso as a clinical tool for diagnosis and assessment of treatment zzso
