The emerging field of zzso zzso is rapidly evolving with many new system designs and reconstruction zzso being zzso Many systems use water as a zzso medium between the scanned object and the ultrasound zzso Prior to a zzso the water is heated to body temperature to enable small animal zzso During the zzso the water heating system of some systems is switched off to minimize the risk of bubble formation, which leads to a gradual decrease in water temperature and hence the speed of zzso In this work, we use a commercially available scanner that follows this zzso and show that a failure to model zzso temperature decreases as small as zzso leads to image artifacts that may be difficult to distinguish from true structures, particularly in complex zzso We then improve image quality by continuously monitoring the water temperature during the scan and applying variable speed of sound corrections in the image reconstruction zzso While upgrading to an air zzso heating pump and keeping it running during the scan could also solve the changing temperature problem, we show that a software correction for the temperature changes provides a cost-effective alternative to a hardware zzso The efficacy of the software corrections was shown to be consistent across objects of widely varying appearances, namely physical zzso ex zzso zzso and in zzso mouse zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of modeling zzso variations in the speed of sound during zzso scans, as opposed to spatial variations as focused on by previous zzso Since air bubbles pose a common problem in zzso and zzso imaging systems, our results will be useful to future small animal imaging studies that use scanners with similarly limited heating zzso
