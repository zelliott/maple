Current zzso secondary structure prediction approaches predict prevalent zzso such as the zzso and kissing zzso The number of possible structures increases drastically when more complex zzso are considered, thus leading to zzso zzso On the other hand, the enormous population of possible structures means not all of them appear in real zzso zzso zzso it is of interest to understand how many of them really exist and the reasons for their preferred existence over the others, as any new findings revealed by this study might enhance the capability of future structure prediction zzso for more accurate prediction of complex zzso 

A novel zzso was devised to estimate the exact number of structural possibilities for a zzso constructed with a specified number of base pair zzso Then, zzso zzso was applied to zzso zzso zzso structures from data in the zzso zzso zzso By showing the vast possibilities and the real population, it is clear that most of these plausible complex zzso are not zzso Moreover, from these classified motifs that exist in nature, some features were identified for further zzso It was found that some features are related to zzso zzso Other features are still left open to discover underlying zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso suggest that complex zzso are usually some well-known motifs that are themselves complex or the interaction results of some special zzso zzso can be proposed to predict the essential parts of these complex zzso even if the required zzso parameters are currently zzso
