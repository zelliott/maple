To zzso evaluate regional zzso in the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of cortical gray and white matter and zzso structures that are known to be involved in mild cognitive impairment zzso 

zzso resonance zzso imaging was performed in 13 patients with zzso zzso men, four zzso mean age, 74 years zzso 6 zzso zzso and 13 healthy elderly control subjects zzso men, six zzso mean age, 75 years zzso zzso This study was approved by the institutional review board and was zzso zzso Each subject gave informed zzso zzso was measured from manually drawn regions of interest zzso of the zzso zzso zzso amygdala, corpus zzso and anterior and zzso zzso zzso and from automatically defined zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by using template zzso zzso were outlined on zzso images then mapped onto zzso maps by using zzso transformation zzso A zzso region competition zzso zzso was used for zzso of gray and white zzso The group difference in zzso values was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation of zzso values with age and memory test zzso 

Higher zzso were found in zzso zzso lobe gray matter, and corpus zzso of patients with zzso compared with that of control subjects zzso zzso zzso By pooling all subjects together, an elevated zzso zzso was significantly correlated with worse memory performance scores in zzso and 30-minute delayed zzso recall tasks zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from gray and white matter of different brain regions can be analyzed by applying an automated zzso method in conjunction with a zzso region competition zzso zzso
