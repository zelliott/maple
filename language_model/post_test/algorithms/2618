This study investigates the use of zzso Carlo simulation for the determination of release properties from cubic zzso zzso Specifically, the study has focused on factors including zzso surface area and zzso The release platform was formed by simulating zzso with different ratios of drug and zzso which undergo drug release in a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Upon completion of each simulation the zzso zzso was examined and zzso and zzso of the medium zzso The zzso of the medium was evaluated directly by a blind random walk zzso These parameters as well as the release profile were then studied with respect to common mathematical models describing drug diffusion (the zzso power and zzso zzso It was found that, depending on their zzso the zzso systems were either homogeneous or zzso in zzso Furthermore, it was found that the physical parameters could be successfully fitted to the a and b zzso of the zzso zzso This approach allows the prediction of drug release from an zzso zzso system with the knowledge of a few physical zzso
