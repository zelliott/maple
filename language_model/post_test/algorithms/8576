We report the zzso of left zzso zzso pressure zzso by a left zzso zzso zzso curve obtained from zzso zzso gated zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using quantitative gated zzso zzso zzso was calculated based on the following zzso zzso volumes, zzso and acceleration of zzso contraction, zzso valve area and density of zzso The first three parameters can be derived from zzso gated zzso In 16 patients, the zzso zzso curve was obtained from zzso gated zzso by using zzso zzso was estimated by the zzso zzso The values of estimated peak zzso were compared with those measured from a pressure zzso There was a correlation between the values of peak zzso estimated by the zzso zzso curve and those measured by pressure zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso relationship could be estimated by the zzso zzso zzso
