A scheme capable of acquiring zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sample is zzso zzso the preparation of nuclear spins in a polarized state far from zzso zzso can increase the zzso signal by several orders of zzso It presents opportunities to apply zzso zzso to dilute samples that would otherwise yield insufficient zzso However, conventional zzso zzso zzso which is commonly applied for the determination of molecular structure, relies on the recovery of the initial polarization after each zzso For this reason, it cannot be applied directly to a sample that has been zzso zzso With appropriately modified pulse schemes, two-dimensional zzso zzso an however be acquired zzso by utilizing a small portion of the zzso signal in every zzso while keeping the remaining polarization for future zzso We present zzso zzso zzso of single zzso samples using this technique, and discuss different options for distributing the polarization among different zzso This robust method takes full advantage of zzso zzso to resolve overlapping chemical shifts, and may prove particularly useful for the structural zzso of compounds in zzso zzso
