A sequential zzso based on statistical design and zzso zzso method was employed to zzso the media constituents for the improvement of zzso acid production from oil palm empty fruit zzso zzso through solid state zzso using zzso zzso zzso The results obtained from the zzso design indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and minerals zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the major factors for further zzso Based on the zzso method, the selected medium constituents and zzso concentration were zzso by the central composite design zzso under the response surface methodology zzso The statistical analysis showed that the optimum media containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of minerals and zzso zzso of zzso gave the maximum production of zzso acid zzso zzso of dry zzso The analysis showed that zzso zzso and mineral solution zzso were more significant compared to zzso concentration zzso for the zzso acid zzso
