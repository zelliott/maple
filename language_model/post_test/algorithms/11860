We developed a zzso zzso method to extract the fetal zzso zzso from the composite abdominal zzso This is based on the detection of the zzso obtained from the composite abdominal zzso using the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso locations of the abdominal signal are used to discriminate between maternal and fetal zzso zzso Two different approaches have been zzso In the first approach, at least one zzso signal is used as the a prior to perform the zzso whereas in the second approach no zzso signal is zzso A reconstruction method is zzso to obtain the fetal zzso signal from the detected fetal zzso zzso The proposed technique is different from the classical zzso methods, in that we exploit the most distinct features of the zzso leading to more zzso with respect to signal zzso zzso of experiments with both synthetic and real zzso data have been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed zzso
