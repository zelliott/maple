We investigate the statistical properties of the zzso zzso which characterizes uniquely zzso zzso of resonance zzso of open chaotic zzso zzso to the regime of zzso overlapping zzso we apply the random zzso theory to the effective zzso zzso and derive zzso the probability distribution of the zzso zzso for two statistical ensembles describing the systems zzso under time zzso For those with rigid zzso we consider a zzso characterized by a zzso spectrum without spectral zzso Then, in the more realistic case of a zzso described by the zzso zzso ensemble, we reveal and discuss the role of spectral zzso
