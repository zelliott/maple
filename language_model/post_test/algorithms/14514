Five soil size zzso zzso corresponding to coarse zzso zzso medium zzso zzso fine zzso zzso sand, zzso zzso zzso and clay zzso zzso were artificially contaminated with zzso and zzso treated using a laboratory scale apparatus to investigate the effect of soil texture on contaminant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso process was simulated using zzso as the carrier gas at a flow rate of zzso L zzso different temperatures zzso zzso and different treatment times zzso zzso The amount of contaminant zzso on the soil and the residual amount after zzso treatment was determined by gas zzso zzso showed that zzso phenomena and zzso efficiency were affected by the soil texture and that temperature and time of treatment were key factors in remedial zzso A temperature of 175 zzso is sufficient to remedy diesel zzso sandy and zzso soils, whereas a higher temperature zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso zzso of diesel zzso soil was shown to be governed by zzso zzso zzso are of practical interest and may be used in zzso and designing zzso systems for preliminary cost and optimal condition zzso
