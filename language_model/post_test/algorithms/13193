An appropriate structural zzso identifies similarities and differences between zzso proteins that are not evident from sequence alignments zzso We have coupled our zzso zzso zzso tool with a sequence zzso and seed extension zzso zzso to create a robust technique for zzso structures and aligning sequences of zzso proteins zzso zzso overcomes errors in the initial sequence alignment that would normally zzso into a standard zzso zzso zzso can generate a corrected sequence alignment from the improved structural zzso obtained by zzso zzso robust performance and its superiority over standard zzso are demonstrated over a range of zzso zzso Its better overlay results in corrected sequence alignments with good agreement to zzso Finally, zzso is compared to established structural alignment zzso zzso zzso matching, zzso extension, and zzso Most methods are comparable at placing zzso pairs within 2 zzso but zzso places many more zzso pairs within 1 zzso providing a clear zzso Such high accuracy is essential in drug design, where small distances can have a large impact on zzso zzso This level of accuracy is also needed to correct sequence alignments in an automated fashion, especially for zzso zzso zzso can align zzso with zzso identity and large zzso differences, cases where both zzso and zzso methods may zzso The zzso pipeline overcomes the dependency of structural zzso on initial sequence pairing and removes the need to determine the best zzso method, substitution zzso and gap parameters for each unique pair of zzso
