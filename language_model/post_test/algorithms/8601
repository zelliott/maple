To investigate the dependence of zzso thresholds on the zzso method used in the diagnosis of neurological dysfunction caused by exposure to zzso zzso To compare thresholds obtained with zzso zzso zzso versus intermittent zzso stimulation using zzso responses, and zzso zzso and zzso responses using intermittent staircase zzso 

zzso thresholds were measured on 12 healthy men by three different zzso zzso All zzso were performed with the same zzso in which the zzso stimulus was applied by a probe 6 zzso in diameter that zzso through a hole of 10 zzso diameter in a zzso controlling both the contact force and the push zzso Four stimulus zzso zzso zzso 63 and 125 zzso were used to obtain responses from zzso and zzso zzso 

There was a 3 to 6 zzso variation in threshold due to the zzso method: thresholds were lower with intermittent stimulation and thresholds obtained with the zzso procedure were lower than those obtained with the zzso zzso Alternative explanations of the findings were zzso 

The dependence of zzso measurement method on zzso thresholds was partly due to influencing responses via zzso zzso It was suggested that the zzso measurement method had a sufficiently large effect on zzso thresholds for it to be taken into account when methods for the diagnosis of neurological disorders are zzso
