A linear zzso model of the zzso motor plant for horizontal zzso eye movements is presented consisting of a linear zzso motor plant and a zzso zzso controller based on zzso zzso The zzso motor plant consists of the zzso and two zzso zzso All parameters and initial conditions are estimated or measured from zzso zzso The neural zzso are described by zzso zzso with a post zzso rebound burst and based on a zzso zzso Model parameters are estimated using the system identification zzso The zzso and dynamic behaviors of the model are in excellent agreement with the experimental zzso
