zzso zzso play an important role in both zzso and zzso zzso In pancreatic zzso cells zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and fluid zzso In this paper we study the typical experimental traces of zzso responses in pancreatic zzso cells obtained in response to the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether they are zzso or deterministic in nature, we analyze the traces with methods of zzso time series zzso In particular, by performing surrogate data tests and employing a determinism test for short time series, we show that the responses of pancreatic zzso cells to zzso are zzso with only faintly expressed deterministic zzso Presented results thus corroborate the notion that mathematical models should take zzso explicitly into account when describing zzso and zzso zzso and that indeed further efforts should be directed toward this zzso
