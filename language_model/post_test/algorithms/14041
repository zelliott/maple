The design and development of the neural network zzso controller performance for the activated sludge process in sequencing batch reactor zzso is presented in this zzso Here we give a comparative study of various neural network zzso controllers such as the direct inverse control, internal model control zzso and hybrid zzso control strategies to maintain the dissolved oxygen zzso level of an activated sludge system by manipulating the air flow zzso The zzso inverse zzso controller with the zzso scheme represents the zzso which relies solely upon the simple zzso inverse zzso In the zzso both the forward and inverse models are used directly as elements within the feedback zzso The hybrid zzso control consists of a basic zzso controller in parallel with a zzso integral zzso zzso Various simulation tests involving multiple zzso changes, disturbances rejection and noise effects were performed to review the performances of these various zzso From the results it can be seen that hybrid controller gives the best results in tracking zzso changes under disturbances and noise zzso
