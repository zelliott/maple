zzso zzso zzso schemes such as learning zzso zzso zzso and extensions zzso offer efficient and intuitive zzso based on the representation of classes by zzso The original methods, however, rely on the zzso distance corresponding to the assumption that the data can be represented by zzso zzso For this reason, extensions of the methods to more general metric structures have been proposed, such as relevance adaptation in generalized zzso zzso and zzso learning in zzso In these approaches, metric parameters are learned based on the given zzso task such that a zzso distance measure is zzso In this letter, we consider full zzso adaptation in advanced zzso zzso In particular, we introduce zzso learning to a recent statistical zzso of zzso robust soft zzso and we compare the results on several artificial and real-life data sets to zzso learning in zzso a derivation of zzso learning based on a zzso cost zzso In all cases, zzso adaptation allows a significant improvement of the zzso zzso Interestingly, however, the zzso behavior of the models with respect to zzso locations and extracted zzso dimensions shows several characteristic differences depending on the data zzso
