zzso waves, widely used as a zzso diagnostic zzso were recently shown to stimulate zzso zzso zzso meaningful zzso as is required in order to form a unified zzso requires the dynamic generation of simultaneous stimulation zzso In this paper, we examine the general feasibility and properties of an acoustic retinal zzso a new vision restoration strategy that will combine zzso zzso and zzso field zzso technology towards zzso artificial stimulation of surviving zzso in a zzso zzso We explain the conceptual framework for such a device, study its feasibility in an in zzso zzso retinal stimulation study and discuss the associated design considerations and zzso Finally, we simulate and zzso validate a new holographic zzso angular zzso efficient generation of uniform and accurate continuous ultrasound zzso This method provides a powerful, flexible solution to the problem of projecting complex acoustic images onto structures like the zzso
