We study the zzso of statistical moments of zzso intervals based on observation of spike counts in many independent short time zzso This scenario zzso to the situation in which a target zzso zzso It receives information from many zzso and has to respond within a short time zzso The precision of the zzso procedures is zzso As the model for zzso activity, two examples of stationary point processes are zzso renewal process and doubly zzso zzso zzso Both moment and maximum likelihood zzso are zzso Not only the mean but also the zzso of variation is zzso In accordance with our expectations, zzso studies confirm that the zzso of mean zzso zzso is more reliable than the zzso of zzso of zzso The error of zzso increases with increasing mean zzso zzso which is equivalent to decreasing the size of window (less events are observed in a zzso and with decreasing the number of zzso zzso number of zzso
