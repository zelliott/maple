zzso zzso zzso based on changes in cerebral blood volume zzso can probe directly zzso and zzso during brain zzso or zzso challenges, and can provide important insights into the mechanism of blood zzso zzso zzso signal zzso At present, the most widely used zzso zzso technique in humans is called zzso zzso zzso and this article provides a technical review of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between blood and tissue to distinguish between these two compartments within a zzso and employs a zzso inversion recovery sequence to yield an MR signal zzso to 1 - zzso As such, zzso will result in a zzso signal decrease and zzso will have the reverse zzso The zzso technique can be performed zzso with a zzso resolution comparable with several other zzso methods, such as zzso or zzso spin labeling zzso and is particularly powerful when conducted in conjunction with these complementary zzso The pulse sequence and imaging parameters of zzso can be zzso such that the signal change is predominantly of zzso origin, but careful considerations should be taken to minimize other contributions, such as those from the zzso effect, cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso fluid zzso The sensitivity of the zzso technique is the primary disadvantage when compared with zzso but this technique is increasingly demonstrating its utility in zzso and clinical zzso
