Three readers manually adjudicated zzso placed by an automated algorithm, using grouped zzso and zzso zzso methods in zzso zzso zzso recorded in 38 subjects in a crossover design thorough zzso study at zzso and 6 time points zzso with zzso or zzso

Mean zzso was 4 milliseconds longer, and zzso zzso 1 zzso lower with zzso Otherwise, both methods were comparable and detected the zzso zzso
