Assessing changes in upper zzso limb volume during zzso therapy is important for determining treatment efficacy and documenting zzso Although arm volumes may be determined by tape measure, the suitability of circumference zzso to estimate hand volumes is questionable because of the zzso in zzso of hand zzso Our aim was to develop an alternative measurement procedure and zzso for routine use to estimate hand zzso A zzso was used to measure hand zzso and depth in 33 subjects zzso zzso and volumes zzso were calculated using an elliptical zzso zzso Using zzso analysis and limits of agreement zzso zzso was compared to volumes determined by water displacement zzso to volumes calculated from zzso determined zzso zzso and to a zzso model zzso VW and zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar zzso zzso 98 zzso 362 zzso zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, VC zzso zzso 138 zzso and VT zzso zzso 122 zzso significantly overestimated volume zzso These results indicate that the elliptical zzso can be a useful alternative to water displacement when hand volumes are needed and the water displacement method is zzso zzso to zzso too time consuming or not zzso
