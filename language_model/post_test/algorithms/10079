In various kinds of cultured cells, it has been reported that the membrane potential exhibits fluctuations with long-term zzso although the underlying mechanism remains to be zzso A cardiac muscle cell culture serves as an excellent experimental system to investigate this phenomenon because zzso of zzso can be determined over an extended time period in a zzso manner through zzso of zzso although the properties of zzso fluctuations of cardiac muscle cells at the zzso level remains to be fully zzso In this article, we report on our investigation of spontaneous zzso of cultured rat cardiac muscle cells at the zzso zzso It was found that single cells exhibit several typical zzso patterns of zzso and spontaneous transitions among zzso zzso fluctuation analysis on the time series of zzso intervals revealed the presence of zzso noise at sufficiently large zzso Furthermore, zzso was also found in the time series of zzso zzso These experimental trends were successfully explained using a simple mathematical model, incorporating correlated noise into zzso zzso From these findings, it was established that singular fluctuations accompanying zzso noise and zzso are intrinsic properties of single cardiac muscle zzso
