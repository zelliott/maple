zzso bone zzso rates for rib samples from three archaeological populations and a modern autopsy sample were determined using an zzso developed by Frost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When plotted against the relative antiquities for population samples, zzso zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso net bone formation zzso and mean annual bone formation rate zzso exhibit a zzso trend of increased cortical bone zzso activity levels over zzso Two intensive zzso zzso zzso and Gibson, are similar for all bone zzso parameters and have the lowest zzso activity levels among the zzso The more recent zzso sample, which is reported to practice agricultural zzso is consistently intermediate between these and a modern autopsy zzso Although there appear to be differences in bone formation rates among the populations it is concluded that these differences cannot be attributed to differences in bone zzso rates among the zzso but rather are reflecting different effective ages of adult zzso for their zzso These findings suggest that the earlier zzso particularly Windsor and Gibson, appear to have reached skeletal maturity at an older age than observed for zzso
