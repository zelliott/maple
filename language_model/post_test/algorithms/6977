zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso drug used worldwide for the treatment of iron overloading zzso zzso and zzso zzso were carried out to investigate the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso under different zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso solution leads predominantly to the formation of the zzso species at a pH range of zzso The experimental results indicate that zzso has high affinity for zzso with stability zzso log beta 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso and log beta 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso by competition reactions in zzso indicate displacement of zzso in a concentration dependent manner by zzso Similarly, the presence of different buffers at various pH values resulted in the formation of different zzso zzso complexes with zzso and of mixed complexes with buffer zzso The strong interaction of zzso with zzso may have implications on the therapeutic and zzso properties of this zzso zzso In particular, zzso may be used in the treatment of copper overloading conditions, such as Wilson's disease or other conditions where copper toxicity is zzso
