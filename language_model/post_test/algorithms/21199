In single particle analysis, two-dimensional zzso alignment is a fundamental step intended to put into register various particle projections of biological zzso collected at the electron zzso The efficiency and quality of three-dimensional zzso structure reconstruction largely depends on the zzso speed and alignment accuracy of this crucial zzso In order to improve the performance of zzso we introduce a new method that takes advantage of the highly accurate zzso scheme based on the zzso method, a version of the zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso for the refinement of the orientation zzso Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by using less than half of the sample points and taking twice the zzso our new zzso alignment method achieves dramatically better alignment accuracy than that based on zzso zzso We also apply our method to image to volume zzso the key step in the single particle zzso structure refinement zzso We find that in this case the accuracy of the method not only zzso the accuracy of the commonly used zzso zzso but results are achieved in much shorter time, making zzso alignment a perfect candidate for efficient structure determination in single particle zzso
