zzso the second most common cause of zzso worldwide, is an zzso disease characterized by progressive loss of retinal zzso cell zzso zzso zzso factors are thought to play a central role in zzso loss, but the specific mechanism underlying this disease remains zzso Our goal was to characterize the zzso environment in the zzso nerve head zzso region where zzso damage zzso human zzso Post zzso human eyes were zzso fixed at either 5 or 50 zzso pressure and processed zzso to acquire serial sections through the zzso zzso models of the zzso region were reconstructed from these sections and embedded in a generic zzso shell to create a model of an entire zzso We used finite element simulations to zzso the effects of an acute change in zzso pressure from 5 to 50 zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains varied substantially within the zzso with the zzso neural tissue and the zzso zzso showing the greatest zzso The mode of strain having the largest magnitude was third principal strain zzso reaching zzso in both the zzso zzso and the zzso neural zzso zzso strains were also zzso The distribution of strains in all zzso zzso was remarkably similar between zzso zzso variations in zzso geometry zzso have only modest effects on zzso zzso and may not explain zzso zzso to elevated zzso zzso zzso with previous results using generic zzso models, the zzso of the zzso interface and the anterior surface of the zzso zzso can differ zzso suggesting that currently available optical imaging methods do not provide information of the acute zzso within zzso zzso zzso strains within zzso zzso are potentially biologically significant and support the hypothesis that zzso factors contribute to the initial insult that leads to zzso loss in zzso
