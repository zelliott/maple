Recent imaging studies suggest that object knowledge is stored in the brain as a distributed network of many cortical zzso zzso by these zzso we study a zzso zzso memory network, whose functional goal is to store patterns with different coding zzso that vary in the number of zzso in which they are zzso We show that in order to accomplish this task, synaptic zzso should be zzso into zzso projections and zzso projections, with the latter undergoing additional zzso zzso zzso This segregation makes sense zzso if the zzso projections represent zzso synaptic connections on zzso zzso It is then straightforward to show that memories zzso in more zzso are more resilient to focal zzso zzso Further zzso segregation of zzso connections on the zzso tree improves this zzso allowing memory retrieval from input to just one of the zzso in which it is zzso
