zzso department of a zzso university hospital in zzso Madrid, zzso 

A total of 178 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AK participated in the zzso 

An independent blinded comparison was performed between zzso results and zzso findings, the gold standard for the diagnosis of zzso All the patients underwent both diagnostic zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso were zzso The zzso between zzso results and zzso findings was zzso The sensitivity of zzso for the diagnosis of AK was zzso with a specificity of zzso a positive likelihood ratio of zzso and a negative likelihood ratio of zzso A diagnostic zzso that combined zzso openings and zzso zzso demonstrated a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for the diagnosis of AK were high, as was the zzso between zzso results and zzso zzso As a real-time zzso diagnostic imaging technique for zzso zzso may be incorporated in the management of patients with these zzso
