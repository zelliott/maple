This study explores changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in intact and zzso male zzso either previously zzso by short day treatment zzso zzso or maintained in a state of sexual zzso by long day treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of intact mink significantly increases plasma zzso level and pulse frequency, following transfer from zzso zzso stimulating zzso This zzso control mimics two important zzso of the annual zzso zzso seasonal maximum zzso activity and sexual zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso is investigated 48 hours after zzso When mink zzso during long day treatment are compared against control intact zzso no change in their low zzso zzso parameters are zzso This result indicates that zzso steroids on long days are not suppressing zzso zzso which is controlled by zzso zzso zzso When mink are zzso at the onset of short day induced zzso growth, mean plasma zzso level and zzso of zzso zzso are increased over that found in zzso intact zzso This result indicates that, during the phase of resumption of zzso activity on short days, zzso steroid feedback partially controls the zzso zzso
