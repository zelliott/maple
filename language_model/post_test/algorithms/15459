zzso muscle zzso is a major systemic impairment in chronic zzso Yet its zzso have been hard to identify because a clear research definition has not been agreed zzso The reduction in muscle fiber zzso area zzso is a widely acknowledged marker of muscle zzso but no reference values for the muscle fiber zzso at the age of the onset of chronic disease have ever been zzso Thus, we aimed to systematically review the studies providing data on fiber zzso and fiber type proportion in the zzso zzso of the zzso of healthy subjects (age zzso zzso and then to pool and analyze the data from the selected studies to determine reference values for fiber zzso We followed the guidelines of the zzso Reporting Items for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identified 19 studies, including 423 subjects that matched the inclusion zzso On the basis of fiber type and zzso the mean fiber zzso and the lower limits of normal zzso were zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso zzso - zzso zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso zzso + 139 zzso and zzso zzso - zzso zzso respectively, for zzso There was no significant zzso among zzso of fiber type and zzso The pooled type I fiber proportion was zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, fiber zzso was significantly correlated with zzso peak zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and type I fiber proportion was correlated with age zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso peak zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our zzso of a homogeneous set of studies is the first to provide valuable zzso for fiber zzso according to fiber type and zzso This analysis will be improved by prospective assessment in zzso healthy zzso
