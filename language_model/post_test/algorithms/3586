The purpose of this study was to investigate the difference between a 6 zzso linear accelerator zzso energy spectrum outside the field edge near a phantom surface, and the corresponding spectrum on the central zzso The zzso Carlo code zzso was used to calculate the zzso on the central axis and at 1, 2, 5 and 10 zzso from the edge of a 4 zzso 4 zzso 10 zzso 10 zzso and 15 zzso 15 zzso zzso Compared to the spectrum on the central zzso the zzso outside the field edge showed two distinct zzso a broad peak below about zzso zzso and a lower zzso less rapidly changing region at higher energies from zzso to 6 zzso The lower energy peak was due to scattered zzso and the higher energy component was due mainly to primary photons transmitted through the jaws of the secondary zzso The potential impact of these spectral differences on critical organ zzso zzso was determined by calculating the ratio of the sensitivity of a zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso dosimeter zzso outside the field edge to their respective sensitivity at the zzso position on the central zzso The lower energy peak combined with the zzso energy sensitivity of each detector produced up to a two-thirds overestimate of zzso dose outside the field by the zzso whereas the response ratio of the zzso was about zzso These results indicated that a similar evaluation was required for profile zzso of a dynamic wedged field and zzso in an intensity modulated beam with either type of zzso
