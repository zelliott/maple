The zzso zzso Health zzso zzso was developed to measure perceived physical and mental zzso Some studies of the zzso properties, using classical test theory, of the zzso provide support for its use in patients with stroke, but it has not been scrutinized using recommended modern test theory approaches such as the zzso measurement model among stroke zzso 

This study sought to explore the measurement properties of the zzso physical and mental health scales among people with stroke using the zzso measurement zzso 

A zzso design was used in this zzso 

All patients discharged from a dedicated stroke unit in southern Sweden during 6 months were asked to participate 6 months zzso Of 120 stroke survivors, 89 zzso agreed to zzso zzso analysis was used to assess the measurement properties of the zzso physical and mental component summary scores zzso and zzso zzso 

For the zzso we identified problems with zzso overall and zzso fit, representing local response dependency, and zzso For the zzso there were problems related to targeting (the persons felt better than the scale could zzso and response categories that did not function as zzso However, zzso items displayed reasonable model fit without indications of zzso but with signs of local response zzso 

The measurement properties of the zzso in stroke appear reasonable unless milder mental health problems are of interest, whereas those of the zzso are less zzso Given the zzso between zzso and zzso that is inherent with the standard zzso scoring algorithm, such data should be interpreted with zzso
