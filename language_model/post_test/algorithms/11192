Recent advances in zzso technologies for biological data acquisition have spurred a broad interest in the construction of mathematical models for biological zzso The development of such mathematical models relies on the zzso of unknown parameters of the system using the zzso profiles of different zzso in the zzso One of the main challenges in the zzso zzso of biological phenomena is the fact that the number of unknown parameters is much more than the number of zzso in the zzso Moreover, the available zzso zzso are corrupted by zzso In this paper, a new zzso zzso zzso is developed based on the zzso zzso framework for zzso systems, namely the zzso Kalman filter zzso A new zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is developed in which the zzso zzso is applied zzso to the available noisy time profiles of the zzso The proposed zzso zzso is applied to noisy zzso data zzso produced from a generic zzso zzso as well as real zzso profile for the zzso system of zzso zzso The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
