To compare signal identification zzso for recording visual evoked zzso zzso 

zzso were recorded both in the presence and absence of a zzso Four zzso were designed to estimate the probability that a recording contains a stimulus evoked zzso and to assign weights for use in a weighted average to isolate a final zzso zzso were compared on their ability to identify trials containing zzso the zzso zzso ratios of the final zzso and the number of trials required to isolate a zzso that was significantly different from background zzso 

All the zzso isolated zzso that did not differ significantly in timing or zzso from those extracted using traditional ensemble zzso All the studied zzso were capable of identifying and assigning a significantly greater weight to trials containing visually evoked signals compared with trials containing only noise zzso zzso zzso zzso The best performing zzso produced a zzso increase in the zzso of the extracted zzso 

The present investigation provides empirical confirmation that zzso signal identification zzso can improve the detection of zzso signal embedded in zzso When combined with weighted averaging they can reduce the number of trials required for zzso
