zzso disorder zzso is one of the leading causes of disability zzso Patients are further disadvantaged by delays in accurate diagnosis ranging between 5 and 10 zzso We applied zzso process zzso zzso to structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso data to evaluate the feasibility of using pattern recognition techniques for the diagnostic zzso of patients with zzso 

zzso were applied to gray zzso and white matter zzso zzso data derived from two independent samples of patients with BD zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso Within each cohort patients were matched on age, sex and zzso to an equal number of healthy zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy of the zzso for zzso was zzso in cohort 1 and zzso in cohort 2; the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso were respectively zzso and zzso in cohort 1 and zzso and zzso in cohort zzso The diagnostic accuracy of the zzso for zzso was zzso in cohort 1 and zzso in cohort 2; the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso were both zzso in cohort 1 and zzso and zzso respectively in cohort zzso In both samples, zzso and zzso clusters discriminating between patients and controls were localized within cortical and zzso structures implicated in zzso 

Our results demonstrate the zzso value of zzso data in discriminating patients with BD from healthy zzso The overlap between zzso networks and regions implicated in the zzso of BD supports the biological zzso of the zzso
