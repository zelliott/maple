It is generally well accepted that transmission zzso zzso zzso correction can supply more accurate absolute zzso however, whether it provides additional benefits in routine clinical diagnosis based on qualitative interpretation of zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso images is still the subject of zzso The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the two major classes of method for determining the zzso map, zzso uniform versus zzso using clinical studies based on qualitative assessment as well as absolute and relative quantitative volume of zzso zzso We investigated the effect of six different methods for determining the zzso zzso zzso The first method, referred to as the uniform zzso method zzso zzso the outline of the head by an zzso assuming a constant linear zzso factor zzso zzso for soft zzso The second, referred to as the automated zzso detection method zzso estimates the outline of the head from the zzso zzso zzso of the skull is accounted for by assuming a constant uniform skull thickness zzso zzso within the estimated shape and the correct zzso value zzso zzso is zzso The usual measured transmission method using zzso zzso sources was used without zzso and with zzso of the zzso data zzso These techniques were finally compared with the segmented magnetic resonance imaging method zzso and an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso method zzso based on the digital zzso head zzso Several image quality parameters were zzso including absolute and relative zzso indexes, and the correlation between them was zzso The qualitative evaluation showed no significant differences between the different zzso correction techniques as assessed by expert physicians, with the exception of zzso which generated zzso in the upper edges of the zzso The mean squared error between the different zzso maps was also larger when using this latter method zzso to the fact that the current zzso of the method significantly overestimated the head contours on the external zzso zzso between the mean regional cerebral zzso metabolism zzso values obtained with the various zzso correction methods and those obtained with the gold standard zzso was good, except in the case of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso methods showed the best correlation zzso and the zzso lines agreed well with the line of zzso Relative differences in mean zzso values were in general less than zzso Nevertheless, zzso results showed statistically significant differences between the different methods for some regions of the zzso It is concluded that the zzso map influences both absolute and relative zzso in cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso correction results in a reduced radiation dose and makes a dramatic difference in acquisition time, allowing increased patient zzso
