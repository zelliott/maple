The trend of surgical zzso is to follow the evolution of zzso which is now moving towards zzso zzso zzso The main drawback of this approach is the limited zzso of the surgical zzso Promising solutions to improve the zzso zzso are based on zzso zzso However, since both robot arms are completely inserted into the patient's body, issues related to possible unwanted zzso with structures adjacent to the target organ may zzso 

This paper presents a simulator based on zzso data for the positioning and zzso evaluation of zzso surgical robots in the zzso planning of zzso zzso zzso 

The simulator, designed for the zzso planning of robotic zzso interventions, was tested by five expert surgeons who evaluated its main zzso and provided an overall rating for the zzso 

The proposed system demonstrated good performance and zzso and was designed to integrate both present and future zzso surgical zzso
