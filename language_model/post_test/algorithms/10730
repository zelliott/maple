A new method for the assessment of the zzso zzso wave zzso from the zzso is zzso This methodology is suitable for signals registered from zzso systems, where the reduced number of leads is insufficient to exploit the spatial information of the zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso activity were exploited using principal component zzso The main features of zzso and zzso activity were zzso and several basis signals for each zzso were zzso zzso the estimated zzso are reconstructed exclusively from the basis signals that formed the zzso zzso Its main advantage with respect to zzso template zzso techniques was its zzso to variations in the zzso zzso which thus zzso zzso zzso The proposed approach was first validated using a database of simulated recordings with known zzso activity zzso The estimated zzso was compared with the original zzso obtaining correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso The suitability of this methodology for real recordings was also zzso though its application to a set of zzso zzso zzso In all cases, it was possible to detect the main frequency peak, which was between zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the patients under zzso
