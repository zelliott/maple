zzso zzso zzso are particularly difficult to study by X-ray zzso but are quite well suited to analysis by electron zzso Most of our information about zzso zzso zzso has come from the electron microscope but has been limited to about 25 A zzso With the use of zzso electron zzso one can obtain structural data to near atomic resolution on two-dimensional zzso but the problem is to extract the information from the zzso In this paper we present methods to extract signal from zzso electron zzso of zzso zzso zzso We apply these methods to extract 10 A data from the bacterial zzso zzso
