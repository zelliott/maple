We investigate the effect of zzso on the zzso dynamics of short, flexible zzso chains zzso through a small hole in a zzso We find that zzso interactions between zzso beads play an important role in determining the zzso time zzso as a zzso moves through the hole it sets up a flow field which transfers momentum to neighboring zzso thus helping them to move in the same zzso zzso times are calculated by using the zzso zzso to solve the equations of motion of a zzso which moves in a fluid described by the zzso rotation algorithm, a zzso zzso zzso
