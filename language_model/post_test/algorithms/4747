We used the electroencephalogram zzso to investigate whether positive and negative performance zzso exert different long-lasting zzso of electrical activity in a reasoning zzso Nine college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits, and revised them on the basis of an zzso performance zzso The zzso properties of the transition period between feedback and zzso presentation were investigated with zzso fluctuation analysis zzso zzso showed zzso zzso dynamics of zzso activity in both feedback conditions for time scales larger than 150 zzso Furthermore, zzso revealed that negative feedback elicits significantly higher zzso zzso than positive zzso This effect covers a wide network zzso zzso and left frontal zzso We thus showed that specific task demands can modify the zzso zzso dynamics of the ongoing brain zzso zzso neural zzso of these long-lasting zzso zzso are zzso
