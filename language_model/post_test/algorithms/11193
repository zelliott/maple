This study is concerned with zzso radiation from an arbitrary zzso zzso source with a special focus on zzso zzso zzso As a model equation accounting for zzso zzso and zzso the zzso equation is zzso The zzso patterns are calculated in the zzso approximation by the method of successive zzso A zzso integral for calculation of the acoustic field is reduced to a three-dimensional one by employing an approximate zzso description of the primary field with the use of a zzso beam zzso This integral is subsequently reduced in the zzso approximation to a one-dimensional form which has previously been published in literature and which represents a means for fast calculations of secondary acoustic zzso The three-dimensional integral is calculated zzso and the zzso results predict zzso zzso of the zzso field in the vicinity of the source which is an effect that cannot be correctly zzso in the zzso zzso
