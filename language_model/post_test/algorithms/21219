Image zzso plays an important role in image zzso According to several authors, zzso zzso when the zzso goal is zzso For this reason, a unique method that can be applied to all possible cases does not yet zzso In this paper, we have carried out a comparison between two current zzso techniques, namely the mean shift method, for which we propose a new algorithm, and the so-called spectral zzso In this investigation the important information to be extracted from an image is the number of blood vessels zzso present in the zzso The results obtained by both strategies were compared with the results provided by manual zzso We have found that using the mean shift zzso an error less than zzso for false zzso zzso and zzso for false zzso zzso was observed, while for the spectral method more than zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso were zzso We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both zzso
