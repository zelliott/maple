zzso zzso onset is faster in zzso beats than in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate a criterion to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso based on the analysis of the initial zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso 

Far field zzso zzso were obtained from 68 VT and 38 zzso episodes in 16 zzso The first zzso peak was zzso three consecutive time epochs were defined within the preceding 80 zzso window and the zzso changes with respect to a zzso template were zzso during each time period and combined into a single zzso for rhythm zzso 

The zzso was tested in an independent validation group of zzso VT and 97 zzso spontaneous episodes obtained from 22 patients with a dual chamber zzso The area under the zzso characteristics zzso curve indicated that the zzso zzso with this method was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the control and validation groups zzso A specificity of zzso was obtained at zzso sensitivity in the validation zzso 

The analysis of zzso changes during the initial zzso zzso process is feasible using the far field stored zzso of an zzso system and yields a high sensitivity and specificity for zzso zzso
