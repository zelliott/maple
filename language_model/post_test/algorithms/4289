zzso reactions are naturally zzso and precision zzso of these zzso made possible by zzso methods, promise to provide fundamentally new constraints on the possible mechanisms underlying these zzso We review some aspects of statistical zzso a new field with the goal of zzso zzso information from statistical measures of fluctuations in chemical zzso We focus on a widespread and important statistical measure known as the randomness zzso This zzso is remarkably simple in that it is the squared zzso of variation of the cycle completion times, although it places significant limits on the minimal complexity of possible zzso zzso Recently, a general expression has been introduced for the zzso dependence of the randomness zzso that is for rate fluctuations what the zzso expression is for the mean rate of product zzso We discuss the information provided by the new kinetic parameters introduced by this expression and demonstrate that this expression can simplify the vast majority of published zzso
