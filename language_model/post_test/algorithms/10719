The aim of this paper is to verify if zzso zzso concept is still zzso That is because the zzso of this concept has been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Perez zzso experimental approximation to the law of zzso study of the dynamics of the zzso humor zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, 27, 3, zzso Abstract in zzso abstracts 1995, zzso 6, zzso 3, zzso 

The authors sustained that zzso equation has never been zzso On 42 normal eyes and 54 zzso eyes zzso they determined zzso flow by zzso zzso by zzso and considered a value of zzso as normal zzso veins zzso The results they obtained showed that in zzso of the cases the zzso values were with over zzso higher then the calculated values using zzso zzso So, they concluded that zzso equation could be zzso 

There are two zzso pathways for the zzso humor, zzso and zzso Obviously, the zzso zzso zzso summed with the zzso zzso zzso must be equal with the zzso flow zzso and the total zzso facility zzso must be the sum of the zzso zzso facility zzso and zzso facility zzso Thereby zzso equation can be zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso * zzso and zzso zzso zzso * zzso zzso zzso zzso * zzso With the zzso data we verified the previous zzso 

There is correspondence between clinical and zzso deducted zzso 

zzso zzso zzso concept is still zzso zzso With proper modifications zzso equation is still zzso
