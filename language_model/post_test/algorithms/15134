At present, every manufacturer of intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso equipment uses zzso zzso zzso however, each company's intensity zzso methods and dose calculation zzso zzso This study used four typical radiation treatment planning systems zzso employed domestically for prostate zzso plans to carry out 15 case studies by one planner based on the dose limits at this zzso The results were used to compare the differences, if any, in zzso treatment zzso With prostate zzso plans, an overlap area exists between the zzso and the zzso For this reason, while observing dose limits of zzso zzso zzso the dose tolerated by the zzso securing uniformity and concentration of dose is essential to create the most appropriate treatment plan for the zzso and other zzso Although each zzso uses different planning methods, it was generally possible to observe this zzso dose limits by adjusting the zzso zzso When identical beam data is used, it is possible to create similar treatment zzso
