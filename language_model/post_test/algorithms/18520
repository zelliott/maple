zzso zzso is frequent in pediatric hospital zzso Between zzso and 50% of zzso cases caused by zzso and zzso are of zzso zzso 

To determine the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in our environment, the zzso of zzso infection with these zzso and to identify the G zzso of the zzso zzso 

We performed a prospective study of all children under 2 years of age admitted to a zzso unit over a zzso period who were zzso for the presence of zzso and periodic study of feces to detect the presence of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso also underwent bacteria stool culture, zzso detection by zzso zzso detection by zzso chain reaction, and analysis of zzso G zzso by zzso with zzso zzso 

Of 666 children admitted without zzso 60 presented zzso zzso (9 % of patients admitted and zzso per 100 days of hospital zzso 34 presented zzso (5 % of zzso and two presented zzso zzso % of zzso Of the zzso patients without zzso who were zzso viral elimination was detected in 27: zzso in 23 patients and zzso in zzso zzso infection was detected on admission in 13 patients (4 zzso and after 72 hours in 14 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences in the distribution of zzso G zzso were observed between zzso and zzso zzso 

These data confirm the importance of viral zzso in zzso zzso and allow us to evaluate zzso zzso elimination of zzso as one of the factors in the transmission of this zzso
