Small zzso affect protein and zzso acid processes because of favorable or zzso chemical interactions of the zzso with the zzso surface exposed or buried in the zzso Large zzso also exclude volume and affect processes where zzso zzso and/or shape zzso Here, we develop an analysis to separate and interpret or predict excluded volume and chemical effects of a flexible zzso zzso on a zzso We report a study of the zzso effects of the full series from zzso to zzso zzso on zzso hairpin and zzso duplex formation by zzso DNA zzso We find that chemical effects of zzso on these processes increase in proportion to the product of the amount of DNA surface exposed on melting and the amount of zzso surface that is accessible to this DNA, and these effects are completely described by two interaction terms that zzso the interactions between this DNA surface and zzso end and interior zzso We find that excluded volume effects, once separated from these chemical effects, are zzso described by the zzso theory of zzso which predicts the excluded volume between a flexible zzso and a rigid zzso From this analysis, we show that at constant concentration of zzso zzso increasing zzso size increases the excluded volume effect but decreases the chemical interaction effect, because in a large zzso zzso a smaller fraction of the zzso are accessible to the zzso Volume exclusion by zzso has a much larger effect on zzso duplex formation than on zzso hairpin zzso
