The usefulness of image fusion based on the maximum mutual information zzso was investigated for the assessment of oral and maxillofacial surgery treatment zzso 

zzso was performed using image fusion of 25 zzso images of a human skull under the assumption of different spatial conditions and 41 patients' image zzso Errors were measured using distances between titanium markers on the zzso The degree of shared image information was defined as zzso mutual information zzso value to assess zzso of image zzso 

The mean error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was not affected by zzso change zzso zzso zzso zzso shifts showed significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso values but shared information was not significantly affected by the degree of surgical changes in patients' CT zzso zzso zzso 

For the evaluation of surgical treatment results, image fusion is an accurate and reliable method that is not affected by spatial or surgical zzso
