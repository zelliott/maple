A cellular zzso is used to develop a model describing the proliferation dynamics of populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso are carried out on two-dimensional networks of zzso sites that are zzso zzso The discrete model incorporates all the essential features of the cell locomotion and division zzso including the complicated dynamic phenomena occurring when cells zzso In addition, model parameters can be evaluated by using data from long-term tracking and analysis of cell zzso zzso results are analyzed to determine how the competing processes of contact zzso and cell migration affect the proliferation zzso The relation between cell density and contact zzso is zzso by following the zzso evolution of the zzso speed of zzso Our results show that the seeding cell density, the zzso speed of zzso and the spatial distribution of the seed cells are crucial parameters in determining the zzso evolution of cell proliferation zzso The model successfully predicts the effect of cell zzso on the growth of isolated zzso of zzso and simulation results agree very well with experimental zzso Model predictions also agree well with zzso measured proliferation rates of bovine pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso cultured in the presence of a growth factor zzso that zzso cell zzso
