The zzso clinical visual acuity measuring system is being developed for both routine and research zzso This study aimed to validate its performance in zzso children and both normal and diseased adults against the gold standard zzso chart and the zzso zzso acuity measurement zzso 

Timed test and zzso fully zzso five letters per line zzso visual acuity zzso were taken for 70 adults and 59 zzso children using the zzso chart and the zzso visual acuity measurement zzso 39 of the adults also underwent zzso acuity testing using the zzso testing zzso The tested adults included zzso as well as subjects with a range of zzso zzso The methods of zzso and Altman were employed with zzso zzso zzso expressed as zzso confidence limits for zzso 

No significant bias was observed between the gold standard zzso acuity zzso and those taken with either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively found for zzso zzso in the zzso children and adult groups compared with zzso zzso for the zzso chart in both zzso The zzso of the zzso system was slightly greater at zzso zzso Median testing times for zzso and zzso were 95 and 85 s and 66 and 56 s respectively in the zzso and adult groups and 120 s for the zzso zzso on zzso 

zzso zzso agree well with and are similarly reliable to the gold standard zzso chart with comparable test zzso zzso zzso zzso took approximately twice as zzso
