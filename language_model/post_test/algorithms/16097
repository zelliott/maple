Toward the goal of detecting zzso birth by characterizing events in the zzso zzso zzso we propose a method of detection and zzso of events in this zzso zzso zzso is considered as a zzso signal and our approach consists of assuming zzso zzso and using a dynamic change detector with no a zzso knowledge of the parameters of the hypotheses on the process state to be zzso The detection approach is based on the dynamic cumulative sum zzso of the local generalized likelihood ratios associated with a zzso decomposition using zzso zzso This combination of zzso and zzso decomposition was shown to be very efficient for detection of both frequency and energy zzso An zzso zzso based on the comparison between zzso zzso zzso from selected scales of the decomposition was implemented after zzso Finally a class labeling based on neural networks was zzso This zzso of zzso gives satisfactory results on zzso zzso in most cases more than zzso of the events are correctly detected and classified whatever the term of zzso
