We propose a novel scheme for zzso image zzso The proposed scheme employs a product zzso consisting of zzso parity check zzso codes and zzso codes in order to deal effectively with bit zzso The efficiency of the proposed scheme is based on the exploitation of zzso symbols in zzso graph decoding of zzso codes and a novel product code zzso technique based on error zzso Experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed system in comparison to recent state-of-the-art techniques for image zzso
