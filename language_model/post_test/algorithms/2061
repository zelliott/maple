This study was designed to determine the value of automatic corrected zzso measurement in zzso tapes in patients after zzso zzso as a marker of life-threatening zzso zzso We compared the corrected zzso zzso automatically measured in 24-hour zzso recordings, in two groups of patients after zzso zzso group I was composed of 14 patients admitted zzso to our hospital for documented sustained zzso zzso or zzso cardiac zzso Group II consisted of 28 patients with previous zzso zzso with characteristics similar to those of group I, but without zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The global mean 24-hour corrected zzso zzso was longer in group I zzso zzso 20 zzso than in those patients after zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients of group I zzso of zzso exhibited more zzso of corrected zzso longer than 500 zzso compared with patients of group II zzso of zzso p zzso zzso A zzso rhythm of corrected zzso zzso was observed in group I, having a significantly higher zzso from 11 PM to 11 AM zzso zzso zzso We conclude that automatic corrected zzso measurement on zzso zzso is now available and zzso Our results suggest that this is a marker for risk assessment of life-threatening zzso zzso zzso trials are needed to confirm these results and to determine the zzso value of this technique for risk zzso
