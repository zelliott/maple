In this study, zzso cultures of a zzso zzso strain zzso expressing a single chain zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter were performed in a pilot 50 L zzso Due to the very high cell density achieved within the first 75 zzso typically between 140 and 160 zzso of dry cell weight zzso most of the zzso is produced under hard oxygen transfer zzso To improve zzso zzso a direct zzso dissolved oxygen zzso feeding controller that zzso zzso feeding under the constraint of available oxygen transfer capacity was developed and applied to this zzso The developed zzso controller enabled to maximize zzso feeding through the regulation of DO concentration between 3 and 5 % of zzso thereby improving process zzso zzso convergence dynamics are characterized by a fast response upon large zzso to zzso followed by a slower but very robust convergence in the vicinity of the boundary with almost zzso zzso Such control performance enabled operating closer to the 0 % boundary for longer periods of time when compared to a traditional zzso algorithm, which tends to destabilize with increasing cell zzso
