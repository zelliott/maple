This article presents a zzso method for zzso and reconstruction of zzso three-dimensional zzso ultrasound zzso The method incorporates a number of interesting features within the zzso zzso First, zzso is carried out using region competition, requiring multiple distinct and competing regions to be zzso within the zzso This region competition uses a simple zzso based similarity measure to compare zzso within each zzso In addition, zzso and surface reconstruction is performed within the zzso domain to take advantage of the additional spatial information zzso This means that the method must zzso the surface where there are gaps in the data, a feature common to zzso zzso ultrasound zzso Finally, although the zzso method is restricted to a zzso grid, no assumption is made that the data being segmented will conform to this grid and may be segmented in its zzso zzso The volume reconstruction method is demonstrated in zzso for the volume measurement of zzso zzso The zzso reconstructions produce a lower error zzso than the current clinical measurement based on a mean diameter estimated from two-dimensional zzso zzso However, both the clinical measurement and the zzso method appear to underestimate the true zzso zzso
