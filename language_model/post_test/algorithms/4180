In external beam radiation therapy, it is important to calculate the output of the linear zzso The head scatter factor, S zzso is one of the important factors for calculation of Monitor zzso which changes with the size of the zzso zzso In irregular fields shaped by zzso zzso zzso it is difficult to calculate S h zzso S h comprises zzso from the upper and lower secondary zzso and scatter from the zzso zzso We measured the effect of zzso on a monitor chamber zzso zzso and we modeled the scatter from a zzso filter using a zzso zzso The modeled parameters used in this method are derived from zzso of square field sizes on the central zzso Furthermore, we divided an zzso irregular field in the shape of fans and integrated the scatter from a zzso filter by a method similar to zzso sector zzso We were able to calculate S h with zzso error in comparison with zzso even with a field setting with an error of zzso by the conventional zzso This method requires no special measuring tools or zzso
