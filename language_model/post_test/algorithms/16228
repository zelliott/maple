A zzso zzso is a simplified description of the zzso of a protein using a graph where zzso are zzso and zzso and edges zzso to zzso relations and parallel or zzso bonds between zzso We present a matching zzso between two zzso zzso where the likelihood of a match is measured according to previously known matches between complete zzso zzso This totally new zzso training is recorded on transition zzso that count the likelihood that a given zzso feature, or combination zzso is replaced by another feature on zzso The new zzso zzso existing ones on a benchmark zzso Some biologically significant examples are discussed as zzso The method can be used whenever zzso of edge relationship matches are known, as it is the case for several zzso zzso
