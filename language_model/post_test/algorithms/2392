In order to zzso the conditions for evaluation of zzso focusing zzso patterns by digital image processing, the sources of error in determination of the zzso values were analyzed together with the influence of a varying zzso The effects of band zzso in the zzso of the individual lanes, were zzso In order to minimize the effect of these zzso optimal conditions for handling zzso patterns by digital image processing were zzso The systematic part of the global deformation on the gels was investigated and an zzso was developed by which it was possible to correct for a part of the individual zzso The effects of various corrections for lane zzso were illustrated by zzso using different types of zzso zzso Finally the background disturbances were zzso and described by a mathematical zzso
