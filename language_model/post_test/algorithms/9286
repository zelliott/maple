Numerous functional zzso approaches have been developed to study the model zzso zzso zzso zzso with the aim of systematically understanding the biology of the zzso Some of these techniques are based on zzso growth differences under different conditions, such as those generated by gene zzso chemicals or zzso Manual inspection of the zzso colonies that are grown under different conditions is often used as a method to detect such growth zzso 

Here, we developed a computerized image analysis system called Growth zzso zzso to automatically acquire quantitative and comparative information for zzso colony zzso zzso offers great convenience and accuracy over the currently used manual growth measurement zzso It zzso true zzso colonies in a digital image and provides an accurate coordinate oriented map of the colony zzso Some zzso calculations are also zzso Using zzso we successfully detected a genetic linkage between the molecular activity of the zzso zzso compound zzso and gene expression zzso among other cellular zzso A novel association for the zzso zzso gene with DNA damage repair was also identified by zzso and confirmed by a zzso repair zzso The results demonstrate the usefulness of zzso for zzso functional zzso zzso 

zzso offers significant improvement over the manual inspection method to detect relative zzso colony size zzso The speed and accuracy associated with zzso makes it an ideal choice for large-scale functional zzso zzso
