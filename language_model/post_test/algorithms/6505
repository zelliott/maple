The advent of dynamic zzso modeling and treatment techniques requires an infrastructure to weigh the merits of various interventions zzso zzso zzso zzso The creation of treatment planning models that account for motion and deformation can allow the relative worth of such techniques to be zzso In order to develop a treatment planning model of a moving and zzso organ such as the zzso registration tools that account for deformation are zzso We tested the accuracy of a mutual information based image registration tool using zzso zzso driven by the selection of control points and zzso alignment according to a zzso zzso Eleven patients each had sequential CT scans at zzso normal inhale and exhale zzso The exhale right lung was segmented from CT and served as the reference zzso For each patient, thirty control points were used to align the inhale CT right lung to the exhale CT right zzso zzso accuracy (the standard zzso of the difference in the actual and predicted inhale zzso was determined from locations of vascular and zzso zzso and found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso about the zzso zzso and IS zzso The alignment accuracy was significantly different from the amount of measured movement during breathing only in the zzso and IS zzso The accuracy of alignment including zzso zzso was more accurate than using zzso transformations and the same iteration and scoring zzso This technique shows promise for the future development of dynamic models of the lung for use in zzso zzso treatment zzso
