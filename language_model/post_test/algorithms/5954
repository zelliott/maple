To acquire high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso images, we developed a new blinking artifact reduced pulse zzso sequence with a surface zzso specialized for microscopic imaging zzso zzso in zzso 

To reduce eye movement, we zzso that the subjects' eyes were kept open and fixated to the target in the zzso MR zzso To reduce motion artifacts from zzso we inserted rest periods for blinking zzso s within every 5 zzso during MR scanning zzso fast spin zzso repetition time, 5 zzso echo time, 100 zzso echo train, zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso field of view, 5 zzso zzso thickness zzso 30 zzso Three scans zzso s zzso 3) were performed for each normal subject, and they were added together after automatic adjustment for location to reduce quality loss caused by head zzso 

zzso MR images were acquired with a high resolution and a high zzso zzso Motion artifacts were reduced with zzso as compared with those with random zzso zzso structures such as the iris and zzso muscles were clearly zzso Because the whole eye can be covered with a zzso thickness by this method, three-dimensional maps can easily be generated from the obtained zzso 

The application of zzso with a surface zzso of the human eye might become a useful and widely adopted procedure for MR zzso
