The zzso effects on the secondary structure forming tendencies of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso are studied using zzso Carlo simulated zzso zzso We consider three zzso functions zzso of distance zzso constant zzso function zzso zzso 2; strong zzso zzso and zzso functions varying from zzso zzso 2 to zzso zzso 47 zzso and to zzso zzso 78 zzso zzso with zzso zzso 2 suggest that this zzso exhibits a significant propensity for zzso zzso in accordance with a zzso structure of the relevant segment in native zzso The tendency for zzso zzso becomes almost comparable with that of zzso in the simulation with zzso zzso 47, and there appears no appreciable zzso propensity for this zzso Finally, the results with zzso zzso 78 generate low-energy zzso with conspicuous zzso These findings suggest the possibility that the change in zzso interactions can be the key factor for the zzso transitions of peptides between zzso and zzso that have recently been observed in zzso These changes in zzso interactions can arise from those in various environmental factors such as zzso of the rest of the protein zzso and zzso zzso
