This research investigates the use of charge coupled device zzso as zzso linear image sensors in an optical zzso zzso system used for zzso zzso The measurement system, consisting of four zzso linear image sensors are configured around an zzso shaped flow pipe for a four projections system is zzso The four linear image sensors provide zzso zzso imaging with a zzso size of 14 zzso zzso 14 zzso hence zzso a high-resolution zzso Image reconstruction for a zzso optical zzso system is also discussed, where a simple optical model is used to relate zzso due to variations in optical density, zzso within the measurement zzso zzso in zzso form this represents the forward problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In practice, zzso zzso are used to estimate the optical density distribution by solving the inverse problem zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion of the sensitivity zzso zzso is not possible and two approximations are considered and zzso transpose and the zzso inverse sensitivity zzso
