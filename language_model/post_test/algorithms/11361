Multiple sequence alignments zzso are widely used approaches in zzso to carry out other tasks such as structure predictions, biological function analyses or zzso zzso However, current tools usually provide partially optimal zzso as each one is focused on specific biological zzso Thus, the same set of sequences can produce different zzso above all when sequences are less zzso zzso researchers and biologists do not agree about which is the most suitable way to evaluate zzso Recent evaluations tend to use more complex scores including further biological zzso Among them, zzso structures are increasingly being used to evaluate zzso Because structures are more zzso in proteins than zzso scores with structural information are better suited to evaluate more distant relationships between zzso 

The proposed zzso algorithm, based on the zzso sorting genetic algorithm, aims to jointly zzso three zzso zzso score, zzso percentage and totally zzso zzso It was significantly assessed on the zzso benchmark according to the zzso test zzso zzso zzso This zzso also zzso other zzso such as zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso Algorithm zzso zzso zzso Hidden zzso Model Training zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Algorithm zzso zzso zzso Band zzso zzso Algorithm zzso and zzso zzso zzso Algorithm zzso according to the zzso zzso test zzso zzso zzso whereas it shows results not significantly different to zzso zzso zzso zzso with the advantage of being able to use less zzso zzso information is included within the objective function to evaluate more accurately the obtained zzso
