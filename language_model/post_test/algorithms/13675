We have developed a new zzso binding zzso method to measure the concentration of zzso drugs in the brain ex zzso This new method zzso the concepts of standard competition and zzso binding zzso and uses a transformed version of the zzso equation zzso zzso zzso zzso to calculate the drug zzso After testing the zzso of this method, we demonstrated its utility by measuring the brain concentration of zzso a newly developed zzso zzso zzso and its elimination rate after a single subcutaneous zzso Our results indicate that zzso reaches brain zzso that are known to occupy and zzso the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Furthermore, using this method, we estimated the zzso of zzso in the rat brain to be zzso zzso It is important to note that the method described here to measure zzso in brain should be zzso to other drugs acting at any zzso that can be reliably measured with a zzso zzso
