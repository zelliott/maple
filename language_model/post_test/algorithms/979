zzso proteins with functions based on the 3-D structure requires high-speed techniques to make a systematic survey of protein zzso zzso regulates many biological systems by binding numerous proteins in different biological zzso Despite the great diversity in the composition of zzso zzso and bond angles and lengths of zzso sites, our structural analysis of 11 zzso sites in different classes of proteins has shown that common local structural parameters can be used to identify and design zzso zzso Natural zzso sites in both zzso proteins and zzso proteins can be described with the smallest zzso from the geometry of an ideal zzso zzso Further, two different zzso sites in zzso and zzso can also be identified using an zzso zzso Using the established method, we have designed de zzso zzso sites into the scaffold of zzso proteins zzso and zzso Our results suggest that it is possible to identify zzso and zzso sites in proteins and design de zzso zzso zzso
