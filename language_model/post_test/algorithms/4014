zzso zzso of location and extent of zzso sources from zzso remain zzso In the present study, a new source imaging method, zzso variation and zzso based sparse source imaging zzso is proposed to better estimate cortical source locations and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso method with the enforcement of transform zzso in both variation and zzso zzso The performance of the proposed method is assessed by both simulated and experimental zzso data, obtained from a language task and a motor zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso demonstrates significantly improved capability in reconstructing multiple extended cortical sources with less spatial zzso and less zzso zzso With the use of transform zzso zzso overcomes the zzso problem in classic zzso zzso With the use of two zzso zzso further indicates significantly better performance in zzso zzso source locations and zzso than other zzso methods with single zzso The present experimental results indicate that zzso can successfully estimate neural sources (and their spatial zzso located in close areas while responsible for different functions, zzso zzso cortical sources for auditory and language processing, and sources on the zzso and zzso of the central zzso zzso all other methods investigated in the present study fail to recover these zzso zzso zzso of cortical source locations and zzso from zzso is of significance for applications in zzso and zzso
