zzso of structural and molecular shape changes undergone by a protein during an unfolding process are zzso The zzso based on a zzso shape map method, provides a zzso description of a three-dimensional zzso zzso Local properties of the backbone are used to derive a global characterization of its zzso A zzso shape map of backbone crossings is associated with a given zzso zzso The map is built by zzso each point on the sphere according to the crossing pattern obtained when the backbone is observed along a direction defined by the center of the sphere and the chosen zzso The surface of the sphere can be divided in zzso zzso All the points within a given class zzso to directions from which the backbone has the same zzso zzso Automatic zzso and display of these zzso classes is discussed, as is the zzso of the technique on a computer graphics zzso The zzso manipulation zzso the analysis of these maps when following a change in the zzso of the zzso The procedure is illustrated with the results of a molecular dynamics computer simulation of the unfolding of the zzso T4 zzso protein (in the form of its zzso zzso The method gives a novel description of the differential structural stability for the characteristic secondary structural elements zzso and zzso present in the zzso zzso of the persistence of structural elements over the simulation time is performed in an unbiased zzso
