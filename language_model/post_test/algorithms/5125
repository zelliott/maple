The interaction of zzso zzso with zzso networks of opposite charge in an zzso environment is analyzed theoretically by applying a recent theory of zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009, zzso zzso The theory takes into account attractive and repulsive zzso interactions between the zzso the deformation of the zzso network, the mixing of zzso zzso zzso and simple zzso with water, and the zzso free energy at the zzso zzso The theory is used to calculate binding zzso swelling zzso zzso zzso numbers, compositions of zzso phase structure under various zzso zzso controlling the gel volume transition and conditions for zzso phase coexistence are investigated in detail, as well as the influence of zzso In particular, the interplay between zzso and elastic interactions is zzso zzso from theory are compared with experimental data reported in the zzso The agreement is found to be zzso or zzso The theory explains both the discrete volume transition observed in systems where the zzso is in excess over the zzso and the zzso phase coexistence in systems where the zzso is in zzso
