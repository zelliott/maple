An external ultrasound system was developed for the heating of zzso implanted zzso in small zzso This small animal zzso ultrasound system zzso was designed to be compatible with a zzso zzso animal zzso zzso zzso scanner to facilitate studies of zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso of energy deposition, a specific goal for the new device to avoid regional and/or systemic heating of small animals, was demonstrated using zzso following zzso zzso heating of a layered gel zzso The in zzso heating capabilities of the zzso were tested using zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso grown in the lateral zzso zzso of zzso zzso nude zzso zzso temperatures were recorded during heating trials with deep and superficial zzso zzso The experimental data showed that the zzso could produce zzso in 8 zzso 2 zzso diameter zzso in small animals to a target temperature of zzso degrees C and maintain it within a narrow temperature range zzso zzso degrees zzso for up to 4 h without raising the core temperature of the zzso PET imaging studies, data to be published zzso were conducted before and during zzso zzso Both devices performed as expected and there was no significant decrease in image zzso In this paper, the new zzso is described and data from phantom and in zzso experiments zzso
