People often coordinate their actions with sequences that exhibit zzso zzso and unfold at multiple zzso We compared zzso and zzso accounts of zzso coordination by examining zzso coordination of rhythmic musical sequences with a metronome that gradually changed rate at the end of a musical phrase zzso 1) or at the beginning of a phrase zzso zzso The rhythms contained events that occurred at the same periodic rate as the metronome and at half the zzso Rate change consisted of a linear increase or decrease in intervals between metronome zzso Musicians coordinated their performances better with a metronome that decreased than increased in tempo (as predicted by an zzso zzso at both beginnings and ends of musical zzso Model performance was tested with an zzso period or zzso zzso set to the same period as the metronome zzso zzso or half the metronome period zzso zzso Only the zzso model was able to predict zzso coordination at both zzso These findings suggest that coordination is based on internal neural zzso that zzso to external zzso
