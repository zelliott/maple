We examined the measurement error in zzso and zzso zzso concentration resulting from the zzso delivery system when small volumes of zzso zzso are inspired to different lung zzso A laser zzso that illuminated approximately zzso of the breathing path cross section recorded low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative deposition values for shallow zzso inhalation when the inhalation path of a zzso zzso was straight and zzso We attributed these results to incomplete mixing of the zzso zzso zzso over the breathing path cross section, on the basis of simultaneous recordings of the zzso with a zzso sampling from either the center or the edge of the breathing zzso zzso a 90 degrees bend into the zzso zzso path increased the zzso measurement of zzso zzso zzso to 57 zzso and yielded positive deposition zzso zzso which is predominantly affected by zzso zzso zzso was not significantly altered by the 90 degrees zzso We conclude that zzso zzso systems should ensure adequate mixing of the zzso zzso to avoid error in measurement of zzso zzso
