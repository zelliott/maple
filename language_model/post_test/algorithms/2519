Trends in zzso diagnoses differ across Australia and are primarily driven by men who have sex with men zzso We use national population surveillance data to estimate the zzso of zzso infections among zzso by jurisdiction and zzso the proportion of zzso zzso 

Annual surveillance data for AIDS diagnoses, zzso diagnoses and recently acquired zzso infections were obtained from 1980 to zzso A modified statistical zzso method was used to reconstruct zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso zzso among zzso peaked for all zzso in the early 1980s and then declined into the early 1990s, after which zzso zzso Trends then differ between zzso In New South Wales zzso and South Australia, estimated zzso zzso peaked at 371 and 50 cases respectively in 2003, and has since decreased to 258 and 24 cases respectively in zzso zzso infections in zzso zzso have more than doubled over the past decade, from 84 cases in 2000 to 192 cases in zzso Victoria and Western Australia have seen a rise in zzso zzso from 2000 to 2006 (to a peak of 250 and 38 incident cases respectively), followed by a plateau to zzso zzso zzso in the Northern zzso zzso and Australian Capital zzso have increased since zzso however, case numbers remain small zzso per zzso The estimated proportion of zzso infections not yet diagnosed to 2009 ranges from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with an average of zzso across zzso 

zzso diagnosis trends among zzso in Australia reflect changes in estimated zzso to 2009, and reveal the largest increase in the past 10 years in zzso
