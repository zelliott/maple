The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of zzso correction of zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging for the detection of zzso zzso 

A head-to-head comparison between resting zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso was zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were compared with the zzso images that served as the reference for zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso with chronic coronary artery disease and left zzso dysfunction were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were displayed in polar maps zzso zzso and the segments were zzso to peak activity by use of the zzso software zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity greater than 50% were considered zzso A similar zzso value to assess viability was used for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Regional zzso function was determined from the gated zzso zzso images and scored as zzso zzso or zzso Of all zzso zzso zzso were viable on zzso zzso Of these, zzso zzso were classified as viable with zzso zzso zzso Thus 55 zzso were underestimated with zzso zzso zzso zzso these segments were mainly located in the inferior and zzso zzso zzso correction changed the zzso of 39 zzso of the underestimated segments to zzso By use of zzso zzso the agreement between zzso zzso and zzso imaging improved from zzso to zzso Similar observations were made when the analysis was restricted to the dysfunctional zzso 

The addition of zzso correction to zzso zzso zzso significantly improved detection of zzso viability in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, although minimal zzso of viability remained as compared with zzso zzso zzso
