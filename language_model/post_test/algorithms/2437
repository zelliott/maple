Recently, structural variation in the zzso has been implicated in many complex zzso Using zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso researchers are able to investigate the impact not only of zzso variation, but also of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso The most common zzso approach involves zzso at the level of the individual zzso the underlying number of copies present at each zzso Once this is completed, tests are performed to determine the association between copy number state and zzso An alternative approach is to carry out association testing first, between zzso and raw zzso from the zzso array at the level of the individual marker, and then zzso neighboring test results to identify zzso associated with the zzso Here, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches using both simulations and real data from a zzso study of the zzso agent zzso Our results indicate that pooled zzso testing is capable of offering a dramatic increase in power zzso zzso over zzso testing, particularly for small zzso However, zzso testing is superior when zzso are large and zzso understanding these tradeoffs is an important consideration in conducting association studies of structural zzso
