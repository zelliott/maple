The relationships between individual performance and zzso exchange and removal abilities were studies in 12 male zzso all subjected to three zzso on a rowing zzso An incremental exercise carried out to determine the zzso oxygen zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso power zzso a zzso all-out test where the mean work rate zzso represented the individual performance, and a zzso zzso zzso exercise designed to assess the zzso zzso during the following 90 zzso passive recovery were zzso The zzso recovery zzso were fitted to the zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso The zzso zzso gamma 1 and gamma 2 zzso the zzso exchange and removal abilities, zzso The mean value of zzso sustained by the zzso was 376 zzso zzso (106 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with gamma 2 zzso zzso zzso gamma 1 and gamma 2 explained zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was also correlated with gamma 2 zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a better performance on the rowing zzso is associated with improved zzso exchange and removal zzso Furthermore, the ability to row at high relative work rates was correlated with an increased zzso removal zzso zzso adaptations could explain the high gamma 1 and gamma 2 displayed by the present zzso
