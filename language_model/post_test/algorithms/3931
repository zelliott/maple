zzso information is zzso in the response of zzso zzso How might this information be zzso by downstream zzso Here we analyzed the responses of simultaneously recorded barrel zzso zzso to zzso zzso of varying zzso preceded by three adapting stimuli of 0, 6 and 12 zzso in zzso Using the framework of signal detection theory, we zzso the performance of a linear decoder which sums the responses of zzso after applying an optimum set of zzso zzso weights were found by the zzso solution that zzso the average zzso ratio based on Fisher linear zzso zzso This provided a biologically plausible decoder that took into account the zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso The optimal decoder achieved consistent improvement in discrimination performance over simple zzso zzso zzso responses by trial zzso revealed that, unlike zzso the performance of the optimal decoder was minimally affected by noise zzso In the zzso state, noise correlation enhanced the performance of the optimal decoder for some zzso Under adaptation, however, noise correlation always zzso the performance of the optimal zzso Nonetheless, sensory adaptation improved the performance of the optimal decoder mainly by increasing signal correlation more than noise zzso zzso induced little systematic change in the relative direction of signal and zzso Thus, a decoder which was zzso under the zzso state generalized well across states of zzso
