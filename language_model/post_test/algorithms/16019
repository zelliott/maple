zzso anatomical zzso systems enable interactive investigation of digital body zzso Here we present a three-dimensional zzso of the human heart, based on image data provided in the Visible Human zzso This heart zzso consists of multiple kinds of cardiac zzso and offers unlimited possibilities for its visual zzso A zzso dimension is added to the underlying heart model by simulation of cardiac zzso zzso For this purpose a second generation cellular zzso zzso is adapted to the zzso zzso of cardiac zzso The presented system is shown as a successful method for the zzso investigation of cardiac zzso
