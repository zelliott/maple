Shared anatomical and zzso features of primary, secondary, zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas are used to formulate a novel extended hypothesis of zzso circuit zzso A simplified zzso based model of zzso and zzso projecting zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their differential connections with superficial, middle, and deep zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the model are activated and zzso according to zzso based zzso Features incorporated into the models include differential time courses of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso differential zzso zzso of zzso cells versus zzso and different zzso zzso and projection zzso Observation of the zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso circuits operate to organize stored memories into natural zzso zzso whereas diffuse zzso circuits give rise to efficient storage of zzso input into zzso sequence zzso zzso of these operations shows their relationships with well-studied zzso for related functions, including categorization via zzso zzso and sequential storage via zzso or zzso Analysis demonstrates that the derived zzso zzso exhibit desirable efficiency, zzso and space and time cost zzso zzso of the hypotheses for central issues of zzso reaction times and memory capacity are zzso It is zzso that the derived functions are fundamental building blocks zzso throughout the zzso which, through zzso gives rise to powerful zzso zzso and cognitive zzso
