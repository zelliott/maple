The modified Shepard zzso zzso method is applied to zzso to investigate its performance for a system for which zzso zzso takes place through a direct as well as an indirect zzso dynamic zzso zzso The input data were obtained from an available accurate potential energy surface zzso zzso by using the zzso reducing procedure zzso zzso probabilities obtained from classical trajectory calculations with the zzso are in very good agreement with the results for the zzso Thus, this study confirms the zzso method as a promising tool to tackle low energy zzso dynamics of zzso zzso usually dominated by zzso
