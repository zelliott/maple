In this article, we categorize presently available experimental and theoretical knowledge of various zzso and zzso features of zzso zzso as collected in the zzso database of known 544 zzso acid zzso zzso Previously reported 402 zzso were zzso into six groups using zzso zzso technique and 142 were left zzso However, due to the increasing diversity of the database these zzso are zzso therefore crisp zzso method may not provide optimal zzso Moreover, in various large-scale zzso analyses of whole zzso the proper selection of zzso acid zzso representing their biological significance is crucial for efficient and zzso zzso of the short functional sequence zzso In most cases, researchers perform exhaustive manual selection of the most zzso zzso These two facts motivated us to zzso the widely used AA zzso The main goal of this article is zzso First, we present a novel method of zzso the zzso data using consensus fuzzy zzso where the recently proposed fuzzy zzso techniques are zzso Second, we prepare three high quality zzso of all available zzso zzso of the consensus fuzzy zzso method is demonstrated zzso visually and statistically by comparing it with the previously proposed zzso clustered zzso The processed zzso database, supplementary material and the software are available at zzso zzso
