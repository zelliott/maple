A new, fast screening zzso based on auditory zzso response zzso recorded at a high click repetition rate is zzso Response detection is carried out in the frequency domain by a statistical test procedure which includes the fundamental frequency and the zzso below 800 zzso First, the method was tested in 25 young zzso zzso were recorded in the repetition rate range zzso to zzso With a mean response detection time of 31 zzso a click repetition rate of zzso was found to be the optimum rate among the adult zzso The method was then tested using a group of 114 zzso in whom the repetition rate range zzso to zzso was zzso At the repetition rate zzso which was found to be the optimum rate in zzso the mean detection time was zzso zzso In addition to the fast zzso zzso the proposed screening zzso also allows simultaneous hearing screening of both ears using a zzso data zzso
