We have recently demonstrated mutually zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Our previous studies indicate a broad zzso specificity for this transport zzso including some zzso zzso Present studies were carried out to determine whether zzso zzso a classical zzso zzso could be transported by zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso in artificial zzso We also investigated whether zzso C4 zzso an zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso acid, would inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso was compared in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso as well as control zzso in the presence or absence of zzso Increased zzso zzso was observed upon addition of zzso to zzso but not control zzso zzso was linear with respect to the amount of zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso was consistent with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to temperature in a manner consistent with a zzso transport process with zzso energy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso was consistent with a single compartment model with an apparent rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated a zzso behavior with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a competitive inhibitor of zzso transport zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is present in many zzso it may play an important role in determining zzso zzso in zzso Increased zzso would tend to increase cellular zzso zzso
