This brief proposes a simple control approach for a class of uncertain zzso systems with unknown time delays in zzso zzso That is, the dynamic surface control technique, which can solve the zzso of zzso problem in the zzso design zzso is extended to zzso systems with unknown time zzso The unknown zzso effects are removed by using appropriate zzso zzso and the uncertain zzso terms generated by this procedure as well as model uncertainties are zzso by the function approximation technique using neural zzso In addition, the bounds of external disturbances are estimated by the zzso zzso From the zzso stability zzso we prove that all signals in the zzso system are zzso zzso zzso Finally, we present simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
