zzso zzso of flow was investigated in an zzso rotary blood pump zzso with a zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso flows were studied using in zzso mock zzso and acute (N zzso 3) and chronic (N zzso 6) zzso zzso Using the zzso and zzso mock zzso an average flow zzso zzso was derived from root mean square zzso pump zzso speed and zzso input zzso These zzso were programmed into the zzso controller for subsequent validation in zzso In the acute experiments, zzso return and systemic vascular resistance were adjusted through pharmacological intervention and zzso to produce an average range of pump flows from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Over this range the zzso zzso error was 88 zzso 12 zzso with a linear correlation slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the chronic experiments, animals were monitored daily for up to three months and an average range of flows from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso A linear correlation between the estimated and measured pump flows yielded a slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso error was 120 zzso 11 zzso Using this zzso it is possible to effectively estimate flow in a rotary blood pump without zzso additional invasive zzso
