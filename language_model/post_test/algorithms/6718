Recent work on zzso zzso of disease mapping models discusses the advantages of the fully zzso zzso approach over its empirical zzso zzso counterpart, suggesting that FB zzso standard zzso of zzso relative risks are more reflective of the uncertainty associated with the relative risk zzso than counterparts based on zzso zzso since the latter fail to account for the zzso in the zzso of the zzso In this article, an zzso zzso methodology for relative risk zzso with accurate zzso zzso confidence intervals is developed, zzso and contrasted with the zzso zzso We zzso the close connection between the zzso zzso methodology and zzso zzso present a comparison between FB zzso via hybrid zzso chain zzso Carlo and zzso zzso via penalized zzso and illustrate the ability of zzso zzso procedures to adjust for the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the important roles that FB and zzso methods play in risk zzso map zzso and real-life zzso The work is motivated by a recent analysis of zzso infant mortality rates in the province of British Columbia in zzso
