The increasing cost of drug development is partially due to our failure to identify zzso compounds at an early enough stage of zzso The application of higher zzso screening methods have resulted in the generation of very large zzso from cells in zzso or from in zzso experiments following the treatment with drugs or known zzso In recent years the development of systems biology, databases and zzso software has enabled the analysis of the zzso data in the context of the whole zzso One of the latest technology zzso to be applied alongside the existing in zzso and zzso models for zzso distribution, zzso zzso and zzso zzso involves the integration of complex zzso zzso termed zzso The goal is to provide a more complete understanding of the effects a zzso might have on the entire biological zzso However, due to the sheer complexity of this data it may be necessary to apply one or more different types of zzso approaches that have as yet not been fully zzso in this zzso The present review describes the data generated currently and introduces zzso approaches as a component of zzso These methods include network zzso and manually curated databases of interactions that have been separately classified under systems biology zzso The integration of these disparate tools will result in zzso and it is important to understand exactly what data resources and technologies are available and zzso Examples of networks derived with important drug zzso and drug zzso zzso are provided to demonstrate the network zzso
