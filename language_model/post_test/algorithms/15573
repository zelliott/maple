Henderson has already shown that electron zzso should be superior to X-ray and zzso zzso for determining protein structure with minimum radiation zzso Since the contrast for a zzso embedded in zzso ice is very low, it is conceivable that dark field imaging would be superior to bright field phase contrast zzso A detailed analysis of contrast and zzso for both imaging modes is zzso zzso dark field scanning transmission zzso gives improved contrast and equivalent zzso to phase contrast zzso when the zzso is the same thickness as a zzso ice embedding zzso For a constant embedding medium thickness of 200 A the contrast is equivalent to phase contrast zzso but the zzso is 5 times zzso Even with an efficient detector that only excludes scattering less than 5 zzso there is insufficient signal at a dose of 5 zzso to produce an image with more than 1 zzso zzso For larger molecules zzso A thick which zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso the weak phase object approximation used to zzso a phase contrast image no longer applies at 100 zzso This limit could be extended to about 200 A (about 3 zzso if a 400 zzso microscope were zzso
