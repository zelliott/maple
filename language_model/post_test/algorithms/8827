zzso of population structure and individual ancestry is important both for population zzso and for association zzso With next generation sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible genetic variations in the zzso zzso methods for zzso analysis rely on known zzso However, individual zzso cannot be zzso from zzso sequencing data without introducing zzso This article presents a new method for zzso an zzso ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into zzso This is achieved by working directly with zzso zzso that contain all relevant information of the zzso zzso Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very zzso zzso At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to zzso called from the same data can introduce severe zzso The presented method is implemented in the zzso software available at zzso
