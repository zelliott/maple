We study zzso zzso of zzso In this zzso process, two zzso bond and, as a consequence, two zzso rings may merge into a compound ring or a single ring may split into two zzso zzso This zzso process exhibits a zzso transition with a zzso phase in which all rings have microscopic length and a zzso phase where zzso rings account for a finite fraction of the entire zzso Interestingly, while the total mass of the giant rings is a deterministic zzso their total number and their sizes are zzso zzso The size distribution of the zzso rings is universal, although the span of this distribution increases with zzso Moreover, the average number of giant rings scales zzso with system zzso We introduce a zzso zzso for efficient simulation of the ring formation process and we present zzso zzso of the theoretical zzso
