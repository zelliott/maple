zzso synchronization of a neural network at various developing stages is studied by computer simulations using a zzso neural network model in which the zzso activity is simulated by a one-dimensional zzso Two types of zzso plasticity rules are investigated and their differences are zzso For both models, our simulations show a zzso increase in the zzso firing frequency of the network with the zzso time of the neural zzso This result is consistent with recent experimental zzso To investigate how to control the synchronization behavior of a neural network after learning, we compare the occurrence of synchronization for four networks with different designed patterns under the influence of an external zzso The effect of such a signal on the network activity highly depends on the number of connections between zzso We discuss the synaptic plasticity and enhancement effects for a random network after learning at various developing zzso
