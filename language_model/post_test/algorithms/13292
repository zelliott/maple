zzso how best to predict energy needs in zzso muscular zzso zzso is fundamental to weight management in clinical practice; however there is a large gap in the literature regarding information on the most appropriate zzso We aimed to ascertain the most valid zzso equation that can be used to predict zzso in steroid treated ambulatory boys with zzso 

zzso was measured in 9 boys with zzso using indirect zzso after an overnight zzso zzso was predicted using five different zzso based on zzso weight, or body composition zzso 

Mean measured zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The inclusion of fat free mass in the prediction equation provided no benefit over body zzso The exclusion of zzso when compared with weight alone, improved zzso performance, as seen with the zzso zzso in which a minimal bias and root means squared error is zzso 

The most accurate and precise equation was the zzso weight equation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which can easily be calculated in a clinical setting and provides a solid foundation from which clinicians can establish energy requirements to support nutritional management in boys with zzso
