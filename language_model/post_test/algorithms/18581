A detailed knowledge of a zzso functional site is an absolute prerequisite for understanding its mode of action at the molecular zzso However, the rapid pace at which sequence and structural information is being accumulated for proteins greatly exceeds our ability to determine their zzso roles zzso As a result, zzso methods are required which allow for the efficient processing of the evolutionary information contained in this wealth of data, in particular that related to the nature and location of functionally important sites and zzso The method presented here, referred to as zzso functional group zzso analysis, relies on a simplified representation of the chemical groups found in zzso acid zzso to identify functional sites from a single protein structure and a number of its sequence zzso We show that zzso analysis can fully or partially predict the location of functional sites in approximately zzso of the 470 cases tested and that, unlike other methods available, it is able to tolerate wide variations in sequence zzso In addition, we discuss its potential in a structural zzso context, where automation, zzso and efficiency are critical, and an increasing number of protein structures are determined with no prior knowledge of zzso This is exemplified by our analysis of the hypothetical protein zzso whose structure was recently solved by members of the North East zzso zzso zzso Although the proposed active site for this protein needs to be validated zzso this example illustrates the scope of zzso analysis as a general tool for the identification of zzso likely to play an important role in a zzso zzso zzso Thus, our method offers a convenient solution to rapidly and automatically process the vast amounts of data that are beginning to emerge from structural zzso zzso
