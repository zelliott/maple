Many zzso factors bind to sites that are long and loosely related to each zzso De zzso identification of such motifs is zzso zzso In this article, we propose a novel zzso zzso over the space of all zzso zzso strings to identify the most zzso highly zzso zzso 

We present an zzso of this algorithm, named zzso zzso zzso Algorithm for zzso zzso and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying zzso and highly zzso zzso We compare zzso performance against ten motif zzso on 42 zzso defined zzso from zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso These motif zzso cover a wide range of both zzso and statistical approaches, including programs specifically designed for zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso is freely available on the Web at zzso
