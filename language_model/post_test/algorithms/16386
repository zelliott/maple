Recent statistical analyses suggest that sequencing of pooled samples provides a cost effective approach to determine zzso population genetic zzso Here we introduce zzso a zzso specifically designed for the population genetic analysis of sequence data from pooled zzso zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso and zzso D that account for the bias introduced by pooling and sequencing zzso as well as divergence between zzso zzso of zzso analyses can be zzso displayed in a sliding window zzso zzso is written in zzso and R and it builds on commonly used data zzso Its source code can be downloaded from zzso Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mapping zzso sequencing zzso and read coverage on the accuracy of population genetic zzso estimates from pooled zzso
