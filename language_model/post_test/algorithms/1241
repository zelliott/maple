zzso For scientific and clinical requirements the present objective is a robust automatic online zzso to detect rapid eye movement zzso sleep from single channel sleep zzso data without using zzso or zzso zzso zzso For data zzso 20 seconds time periods of the continuous zzso activity are digitally filtered in 7 frequency zzso Then the zzso values of these filtered signals are calculated along segments of zzso zzso The resulting zzso of zzso values is representing information on the power of the signal localized in time and frequency and serves as input to an artificial neural zzso A pooled set of zzso data together with the corresponding manual evaluation of the recordings was used in the training zzso zzso zzso more than zzso of the time periods not belonging to the training set could be correctly labeled into zzso and zzso zzso In comparison to an older zzso based on zzso values calculated along segments of 20 seconds, the error rate could be reduced by zzso
