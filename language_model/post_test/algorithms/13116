zzso single zzso zzso zzso in coding regions can lead to zzso acid changes that might alter the zzso function and account for zzso to disease and altered zzso zzso Many zzso have been found in genes zzso human phase II zzso zzso however, there is little known about the relationship between the zzso and zzso of zzso in these zzso We have identified zzso validated zzso in 104 human phase II zzso genes from the zzso zzso database and the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in phase II zzso genes were predicted to have functional impacts on protein zzso zzso largely agree with the available experimental zzso zzso of deleterious zzso were correctly predicted as zzso This study also identified many zzso acids that are likely to be functionally critical, but have not yet been studied zzso There was significant zzso between the predicted results of Panther and zzso and between zzso zzso predictions and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso are thought to be the zzso basis for the zzso of phase II zzso activity and to be associated with disease zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the molecular evolutionary patterns of phase II zzso were characterized with regards to the predicted deleterious zzso
