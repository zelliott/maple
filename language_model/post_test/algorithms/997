zzso zzso is one of the successful methods, in which mathematical theories are combined with engineering zzso Volume CT will replace the zzso CT that has been widely zzso In this paper two new cone zzso zzso which are zzso and regular triangular pyramid lines, have been proposed and their complete conditions for exact reconstruction have been zzso After having studied zzso cone zzso orbit which is one of the important orbits in volume CT, we have given a better proof about the complete condition in zzso and zzso cone zzso orbit and have obtained some proper zzso Finally, we extend the above results to zzso zzso zzso These results will be useful for the design of direct volume zzso
