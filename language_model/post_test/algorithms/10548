zzso fluid responsiveness remains a difficult question in zzso unstable zzso The author's objective was to test whether zzso assessment by zzso zzso of zzso zzso time index zzso variation after a low volume of fluid infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso can predict fluid zzso 

Thirty-nine critically ill zzso and zzso patients with acute circulatory failure were zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso before fluid infusion zzso after 100 zzso zzso starch infusion over 1 zzso and after an additional infusion of 400 zzso zzso starch over 14 zzso The authors measured the variation of zzso after 100 zzso fluid zzso zzso for each zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were generated for zzso zzso When available, receiver operating characteristic zzso also were generated for pulse pressure variation and central zzso zzso 

After 500 zzso volume expansion, zzso increased zzso zzso in 21 patients zzso defined as zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso of zzso 100 was zzso zzso zzso zzso In 29 patients, pulse pressure variation and central zzso pressure also were zzso In this zzso of patients, the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso for zzso 100, pulse pressure variation, and central zzso pressure were zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with low volume mechanical ventilation and acute circulatory failure, zzso 100 accurately predicts fluid zzso
