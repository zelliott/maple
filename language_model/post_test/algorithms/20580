The accuracy of the zzso Carlo zzso for fast electron dose zzso zzso is demonstrated by comparing calculations with zzso performed by a working group of the National Cancer Institute zzso of the zzso For both energies investigated, 9 and 20 zzso the zzso in water are taken to determine the energy zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso For the majority of the experiments a good agreement is found between zzso and zzso zzso However, in some cases zzso have been observed, which could be explained by the incompletely known geometry on the one hand and by inconsistent data on the other zzso As a reference, dose zzso calculated by the zzso zzso zzso are also zzso It is shown that, especially near low- or zzso zzso large dose zzso and zzso are calculated by using a zzso approach, whereas zzso is able to reproduce the correct doses for these cases zzso
