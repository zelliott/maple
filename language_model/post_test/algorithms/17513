zzso zzso dysfunction zzso is characterized by inappropriate zzso of the vocal zzso particularly during zzso resulting in obstruction and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the vocal cords with zzso is the zzso zzso for diagnosing zzso However, it is an invasive technique that may induce airway zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the forced zzso technique zzso is useful to estimate the degree of closure of a zzso orifice under conditions mimicking those found in zzso The zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to an airway model simultaneously with constant levels of flow in the normal breathing range zzso zzso zzso curves, zzso resistance zzso and zzso resistance zzso were measured in zzso with different areas zzso zzso and shapes and in an orifice with variable zzso Their zzso relationship followed a zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso by flow zzso were related to changes in the area of the vocal zzso model zzso from maximum zzso zzso to different degrees of closure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso could be a useful tool for zzso assessing zzso closure in zzso diagnosis, obviating the need for other invasive zzso
