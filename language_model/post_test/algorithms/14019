An effective analysis of clinical trials data involves analyzing different types of data such as zzso and high zzso time series zzso The current time series analysis methods generally assume that the series at hand have sufficient length to apply statistical techniques to zzso Other ideal case assumptions are that data are collected in equal length zzso and while comparing time series, the lengths are usually expected to be equal to each zzso However, these assumptions are not valid for many real data sets, especially for the clinical trials data zzso An addition, the data sources are different from each other, the data are heterogeneous, and the sensitivity of the experiments varies by the zzso zzso for mining time series data need to be revisited, keeping the wide range of requirements in zzso In this paper, we propose a novel approach for information mining that involves two major steps: applying a data mining zzso over homogeneous zzso of data, and identifying common or distinct patterns over the information gathered in the first zzso Our approach is implemented specifically for zzso and high zzso time series clinical trials zzso Using this zzso we propose a new way of utilizing frequent zzso mining, as well as zzso and zzso techniques with novel distance metrics for measuring similarity between time series zzso By zzso the data, we find groups of zzso zzso in zzso that are most strongly zzso Most of these relationships already known are verified by the clinical panels, and, in addition, we identify novel groups that need further biomedical zzso A slight modification to our zzso results an effective zzso of high zzso time series data, which is then used for zzso zzso Using zzso clinical trials data sets, we are able to identify a small set of zzso that effectively models the state of normal zzso
