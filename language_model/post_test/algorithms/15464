A zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most widely used zzso statistical techniques for analyzing zzso gene expression zzso When applying the HC zzso to the gene expression data to cluster individuals, most of the HC zzso generate clusters based on the highly zzso expressed zzso genes that have very similar expression zzso These highly DE genes may sometimes be irrelevant in biological zzso The serious problem is that those irrelevant genes with high expressions potentially zzso out the low expressed genes that have important biological zzso To overcome the problem, zzso and zzso proposed the complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso However, it is not robust against outlying expression and often produces misleading results if there exist some zzso in the gene expression zzso Thus, we propose the robust zzso zzso method to zzso the zzso with respect to zzso by maximizing the zzso function for sequential extraction of a zzso with proper groups of zzso Note that the proposed method reduces to the zzso with the tuning zzso zzso A value of zzso plays a key role in the performance of the zzso method, which controls the zzso between the zzso and efficiency of the zzso Using simulation and real gene expression analysis, the zzso method shows robust properties to gene expression zzso with respect to data zzso overcomes the problem of the zzso and predicts critically important genes from breast cancer zzso
