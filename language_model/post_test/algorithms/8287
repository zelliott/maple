We compared the modes of interaction between zzso zzso and those observed within zzso proteins and found surprisingly few zzso Over zzso of zzso zzso zzso could be reconstructed within 1 A zzso using solely zzso interactions occurring in zzso zzso Interestingly, more than zzso of interacting fragments used in reconstructing a zzso binding site were obtained from zzso proteins of an entirely different structural zzso with an average sequence identity below zzso Nevertheless, geometric properties perfectly match the interaction patterns observed within zzso zzso We show the usefulness of our approach by redesigning the interaction scaffold of nine zzso complexes, for which five of the peptides can be modeled within 1 A zzso of the original zzso zzso These data suggest that the wealth of structural data on zzso proteins could be harvested to model zzso interactions and, more importantly, that sequence zzso is no zzso
