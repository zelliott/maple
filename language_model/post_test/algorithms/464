A zzso method is implemented for computing blood flow through a branching zzso zzso zzso The simulations follow the motion of individual red blood cells as they enter the network from an zzso entrance point with a specified tube zzso while simultaneously updating the zzso zzso zzso zzso law is used to describe flow in the zzso segments with an effective zzso that depends on the number of cells residing inside each zzso The relative apparent zzso is available from previous zzso studies of individual red blood cell zzso zzso are performed for a zzso zzso network consisting of zzso zzso The results reveal that the probability of directional cell motion at a zzso zzso zzso may have an important effect on the statistical measures of the cell residence time and scattering of the tube zzso across the zzso Blood cells act as regulators of the flow rate through the network branches by increasing the effective zzso when the flow rate is high and decreasing the effective zzso when the flow rate is zzso zzso with simulations based on conventional models of blood flow regarded as a zzso indicates that the latter zzso the zzso of the zzso across the vascular zzso
