To determine whether institution of a standardized zzso of zzso sedation impacted the zzso of zzso zzso in critically ill pediatric zzso 

zzso zzso study with historical zzso 

zzso intensive care unit zzso in a zzso care zzso children's zzso 

All mechanically zzso children admitted to the zzso during a zzso zzso 

After examining the data pertaining to zzso zzso the Penn State Children's Hospital zzso Algorithm zzso was instituted as an absolute requirement for all mechanically zzso zzso zzso orders for the goal sedation level and the appropriate medications to achieve that goal were obligatory for every zzso zzso Data were then collected for 5 zzso after institution of the zzso 

Before zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rates ranged between zzso and zzso per 100 zzso patient zzso In the 4 zzso after mandatory use of the zzso for management of all zzso patients, zzso zzso rates were between 0 and zzso per 100 zzso patient days, demonstrating a significant decrease zzso Throughout the entire study period, no changes were made in the model of patient care that would alter the rate of zzso zzso Despite a higher percentage of zzso patients that were zzso length of stay in the zzso did not increase, suggesting that zzso did not led to increased zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso resulted in a decreased number of zzso zzso without increasing the length of zzso zzso Implementation of the zzso is needed in other zzso to validate these zzso
