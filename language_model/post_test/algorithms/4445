In this contribution, we present an zzso for protein backbone reconstruction that comprises very high zzso efficiency with high zzso Reconstruction of the main chain atomic coordinates from the alpha carbon trace is a common task in protein zzso including de zzso structure zzso comparative zzso and processing experimental zzso The method employed in this work follows the main idea of some earlier approaches to the zzso The details and careful design of the present approach are new and lead to the zzso that zzso all commonly used earlier zzso zzso zzso Building from zzso program has been extensively tested both on native structures as well as on zzso decoy models and compared with the different available existing zzso zzso results provide a comprehensive benchmark of existing tools and evaluate their zzso to a large scale modeling using a reduced representation of protein zzso zzso The zzso package is available for downloading from our zzso at zzso This zzso also provides a user manual that describes zzso functions in zzso
