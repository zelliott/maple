The zzso zzso of sleep zzso zzso may have clinical significance in zzso studies and can be zzso with a number of zzso In this paper, real and simulated sleep zzso were regarded as zzso signals modeled by six parameters that define the instantaneous envelope zzso and instantaneous frequency zzso zzso for a sleep zzso These parameters were estimated using four different methods, namely the zzso transform zzso complex zzso zzso matching pursuit zzso and zzso transform zzso The average error in zzso these parameters was lowest for zzso higher but still less than zzso for CD and zzso and highest zzso than zzso for zzso The signal distortion induced by the use of a given method was greatest in the case of zzso and zzso These two techniques would zzso the removal of about zzso from the zzso data, which is an important limitation for the case of zzso with duration less than zzso Although the CD method may lead to a higher error than zzso and zzso it requires a removal of only about zzso of zzso An application of this sleep zzso zzso via the CD method is proposed, in search of efficient zzso zzso in zzso zzso results indicate that the proposed zzso may be promising, since it can zzso specific differences in zzso and IF characteristics between sleep zzso from zzso subjects and those from aged zzso
