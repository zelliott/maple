In recent years, fiber Bragg grating zzso for the well-known advantages over other fiber zzso sensors, has attracted more attention in zzso inspection for structure health monitoring zzso zzso shift of zzso to zzso wave is caused by the zzso index profile changing along the zzso which can be attributed to zzso zzso caused by zzso and geometric effects of zzso zzso Response of zzso to the above two effects was analyzed zzso by the zzso transmission zzso model, showing high computing zzso Based on this model, zzso response of zzso under changing zzso zzso was simulated and zzso In experiment, the system was able to detect a zzso zzso wave ranging from 15 to zzso zzso These results would provide a zzso for an zzso acoustic detection system design in a specific zzso zzso
