One of the major challenges facing researchers studying complex biological systems is integration of data from zzso zzso zzso data include DNA variations, zzso profiles, and zzso zzso of an appropriate approach for a zzso task is problem dependent, primarily dictated by the information contained in the zzso In situations where modeling of multiple raw zzso jointly might be extremely challenging due to their vast differences, rankings from each zzso would provide a zzso based on which results could be zzso zzso of zzso targets predicted from different zzso zzso is such a zzso zzso of results from multiple zzso studies based on different platforms is another example that will be zzso zzso the problem of zzso ranked lists as minimizing an objective zzso we explore the usage of a cross zzso zzso Carlo method for solving such a zzso zzso Instead of placing a discrete uniform distribution on all the potential solutions, an zzso importance sampling technique is zzso zzso slowly tighten the zzso to place most zzso mass on the optimal solution and its zzso zzso simulation studies were performed to assess the performance of the zzso With satisfactory simulation results, the method was applied to the zzso and zzso problems to illustrate its zzso
