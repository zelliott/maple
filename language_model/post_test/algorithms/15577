A method for achieving zzso focus is zzso Within an initial high bandwidth pulse, successively higher zzso are focused to successively closer focal zones along a transmitted beam zzso During the receive operation, a time varying zzso filter initially passes the higher zzso that are focused closer in and successively passes lower center zzso as time zzso and the focal zone moves zzso The zzso focused receive zzso are digitally sampled and processed by a matched digital filter to minimize phase zzso In this way, an improved resolution image is obtained with no loss of frame zzso The method is evaluated using comprehensive simulations that account for realistic levels of phase aberration and tissue zzso The method is relatively robust with respect to these zzso When the appropriate conditions apply, the new method can achieve an improvement in mean lateral resolution similar to that found in a multiple transmit zone zzso but without the frame rate zzso A discussion of zzso considerations and limitations is zzso
