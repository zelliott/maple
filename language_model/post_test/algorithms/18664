The present study characterizes the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in isolated ring preparations of rat tail zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were apparently zzso zzso zzso but became zzso in the presence of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the first phase of contraction to zzso remained nearly unaffected in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the second phase was zzso shifted to the right zzso zzso In the presence of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were antagonized in a competitive manner by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were also antagonized by 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinities obtained under these experimental conditions correlated highly with affinities at native and cloned zzso zzso of zzso rings with zzso (3 zzso followed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were competitively antagonized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso affinities obtained under these experimental conditions correlated highly with affinities at native and cloned zzso It is concluded that the contraction to zzso in rat tail artery is zzso by both zzso and zzso each component of contraction being zzso by use of selective zzso blockade and zzso zzso zzso
