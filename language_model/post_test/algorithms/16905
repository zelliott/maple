This study aims to evaluate the fundamental performance of four leading advanced resolution recovery zzso 

To evaluate the performance of the resolution recovery algorithm, we carried out the computer simulation with the zzso digital zzso These zzso were used to investigate the basic properties of those zzso The software of four packages zzso were also tested, specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The performance was evaluated in the zzso systems zzso reconstruction conditions using the full zzso at half zzso am zzso aspect ratio zzso and artifacts of zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso of the advance method indicated a zzso with zzso zzso zzso As zzso increased, zzso was composed with over zzso Each advances of zzso indicated only zzso of improvement as compared with reference zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso increased zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso remained in zzso in the zzso As for the zzso of the zzso part, an artifact was caused by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This artifact did not occur in zzso 

An zzso needs more than 150 to obtain an accurate compensation zzso As for the advance method, the major compensation effect was not demonstrated very much as compared with the zzso The zzso zzso and zzso overestimated values due to a zzso zzso in the artifacts of the zzso zzso
