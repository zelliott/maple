We revisit the zzso of making a direct comparison between measured zzso zzso and zzso vertical transition energies within zzso zzso to zzso an zzso level of zzso This is illustrated on the zzso zzso spectrum of zzso for which the usual experimental values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cannot be compared directly to the results of electronic structure calculations for two very different zzso After validation of our level of theory against experimental data, a new experimental reference of zzso zzso is suggested for zzso the zzso state, and the often-cited average transition energy zzso zzso is confirmed as a safer estimate for the zzso zzso
