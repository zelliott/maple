In the zzso era, zzso studies are being performed that seek to explain complex biological systems by zzso diverse resources from fields such as zzso zzso or zzso New information management systems are now needed for the collection, validation and analysis of the vast amount of zzso data zzso Multiple alignments of complete sequences provide an ideal environment for the integration of this information in the context of the protein zzso 

zzso is a multiple zzso information management program that combines the advantages of both zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis zzso zzso and functional information is retrieved automatically from the public zzso In the multiple zzso zzso regions are identified and the retrieved data is evaluated and zzso from known to unknown sequences with these reliable zzso In a large-scale zzso the specificity of the zzso sequence features is estimated to be zzso zzso very few false positive predictions are zzso zzso is then used to zzso zzso in a test set of 100 proteins that are known to be involved in human genetic zzso The number of sequence features associated with these proteins was increased by zzso compared to the features available in the public zzso An zzso format output file allows automatic parsing of the zzso results, while a zzso display using the zzso program allows manual zzso 

zzso is a new information management system that incorporates detailed analyses of protein families at the zzso functional and evolutionary zzso zzso thus provides a unique environment that zzso knowledge extraction and the presentation of the most pertinent information to the zzso A web server and the source code are available at zzso
