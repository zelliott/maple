zzso are very good at recognizing objects independent of viewing angle or retinal position, and they outperform existing computer vision systems by zzso But zzso object recognition is only one prerequisite for successful interaction with the zzso An animal also needs to assess an zzso position and relative zzso zzso We propose here a model that is able to extract object identity, position, and rotation zzso We demonstrate the model behavior on complex three-dimensional objects under translation and rotation in depth on a homogeneous zzso A similar model has previously been shown to extract zzso spatial codes from zzso zzso The framework for mathematical analysis of this earlier application carries over to the scenario of zzso object zzso Thus, the simulation results can be explained zzso even for the complex zzso data we zzso
