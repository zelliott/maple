zzso of a set of genes is often accomplished through comparison to a library of zzso gene sets such as biological processes or zzso zzso However, this approach might fail if the employed libraries are not up to date with the latest research, don't capture relevant biological themes or are curated at a different level of zzso than is required to appropriately analyze the input gene zzso At the same time, the vast biomedical literature offers an zzso zzso of the latest research findings that can be tapped to provide zzso zzso for any input gene zzso 

Our proposed method relies on a zzso text corpus and extracts zzso between documents in an zzso manner using a topic model zzso We automatically determine the number of topics zzso the corpus and calculate a gene zzso score for each topic allowing us to eliminate zzso zzso As a result we obtain a set of literature topics in which each topic is associated with a subset of the input genes providing directly zzso zzso and corresponding documents for literature zzso 

We validate our method based on zzso gene sets from the zzso zzso zzso collection and the genetic association database zzso and show that the approach is able to detect topics consistent with the zzso zzso Furthermore, we discuss the results on three different types of zzso derived gene sets, zzso zzso expressed genes from a cardiac zzso experiment in mice, zzso altered transcript abundance in human pancreatic beta cells, and zzso genes implicated by zzso studies to be associated with zzso levels in a healthy zzso In all three cases, we are able to replicate findings from the original papers in a quick and zzso zzso 

Our approach provides a novel way of automatically generating meaningful zzso for gene sets that are directly tied to relevant articles in the zzso zzso a general topic model method, the approach introduced here establishes a zzso for the interpretation of gene sets generated from diverse experimental scenarios that can complement the classical approach of comparison to reference gene zzso
