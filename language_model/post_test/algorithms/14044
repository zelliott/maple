Parallel Cascade Identification zzso has been successfully applied to build dynamic zzso systems that address diverse challenges in the field of zzso zzso may be used to identify either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso models have typically zzso it has been suggested that zzso zzso systems could also be used to form zzso zzso and indeed they were successfully applied in one zzso This paper reports on the first systematic comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Motivation for using the zzso structure is zzso The construction of zzso parallel cascade models is also briefly zzso In order to compare the accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso are applied to zzso the model architecture on a number of equivalent zzso and zzso biological training zzso Through evaluation of both model structures on independent test zzso we establish that zzso zzso is capable of building zzso of equal accuracy to those resulting from zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we discuss and illustrate the benefits of the zzso approach, including significant reduction in training and testing times, and the ability to adjust automatically the weighting of individual zzso according to information zzso
