A simple, zzso daily temperature and zzso generator zzso was developed to generate zzso for the study of the effects of climate change on models driven by daily weather information when climate data are available as monthly zzso The model uses as input only 11 sets of monthly normal statistics from individual weather zzso It needs no zzso and was zzso and validated for use in Canada and the zzso United zzso Monthly zzso needed are: mean and standard zzso of daily minimum and maximum temperature, first and second order zzso terms for daily zzso of minimum and maximum temperatures from their daily means, correlation of zzso of daily minimum and maximum temperatures, total zzso and the zzso zzso of total zzso The statistical properties and zzso of daily temperature and zzso data produced by this generator compared quite favorably with observations from zzso stations throughout North America zzso of zzso The zzso generates realistic seasonal patterns, zzso and extremes of temperature, zzso zzso periods and hot zzso However, it predicts less accurately the daily probability of zzso extreme zzso events and the duration of extreme zzso
