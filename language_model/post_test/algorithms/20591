zzso left zzso mass and increased wall thickness have important zzso implications in clinical zzso However, these parameters have been incompletely characterized by one- and two-dimensional zzso Therefore this study was performed to validate in zzso measurement of left zzso mass and zzso wall thickness with a zzso zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso for mass zzso were also compared with a standard method for the determination of left zzso mass, the Penn zzso Fourteen zzso left zzso were scanned in a water bath by a zzso three-dimensional reconstruction zzso There was an excellent correlation and high agreement for determination of three-dimensional left zzso mass zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso and wall thickness zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso compared with zzso zzso Left zzso mass by a simulated Penn convention revealed a lower correlation and larger error compared with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso Therefore determination of left zzso mass by three-dimensional reconstruction was validated in zzso and was superior to one-dimensional zzso zzso
