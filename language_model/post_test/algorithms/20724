The order in which the projections are applied in the zzso reconstruction technique zzso has a great effect on speed of zzso zzso and the amount of zzso artifacts in the reconstructed zzso In this paper, a new projection ordering scheme for ART is zzso the zzso scheme zzso It zzso zzso the angular distance of a newly selected projection with respect to an extended sequence of previously applied zzso This sequence of influential projections may incorporate the complete set of all previously applied projections or any limited time zzso subset zzso The selection zzso results in uniform sampling of the projection access space, minimizing correlation in the projection zzso This produces more accurate images with less zzso artifacts than previously suggested projection ordering zzso
