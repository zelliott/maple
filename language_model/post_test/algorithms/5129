The benefits, harms and feasibility of intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients remain zzso Several single center studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefit of intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients with variable zzso 

We conducted a pilot zzso trial to assess the zzso safety and clinical outcomes of zzso zzso management zzso before the initiation of a large zzso zzso 

Within 48 hours of admission to the intensive care unit, we zzso mechanically zzso patients to either the zzso group (target serum zzso concentration zzso zzso or the zzso group (target serum zzso concentration zzso zzso To assess feasibility we measured the time to reach target zzso range, time in target range, morning zzso zzso average daily zzso zzso and number of zzso To assess safety, we measured the number of zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso and other serious adverse events such as cardiac arrests and zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled (35 in the high group and 33 in the low zzso During the first week, the median proportions of time spent in the target range were zzso and zzso for the high and low groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso Morning zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One zzso and 8 zzso episodes of zzso zzso zzso occurred in the high and low groups, reflecting zzso and zzso zzso events per zzso zzso 

This pilot trial of intensive insulin therapy identified numerous challenges that helped in the preparation of an international zzso zzso trial of intensive insulin therapy to evaluate benefits and zzso
