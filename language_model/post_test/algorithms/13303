Recent studies have shown that transient parts of a speech signal contribute most to speech zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the influence of enhancing the zzso of the envelope of the speech signal on speech zzso in noisy conditions using an eight channel cochlear implant zzso simulation was zzso The enhanced envelope zzso strategy emphasizes the zzso of the speech envelope by zzso an additional peak signal at the zzso in each frequency zzso A sentence recognition task in stationary speech shaped noise showed a significant speech reception threshold zzso improvement of zzso zzso for the zzso in comparison to the reference continuous zzso sampling strategy and of zzso zzso when an ideal Wiener filter was used for the onset extraction on the noisy zzso In a competitive zzso condition, a significant zzso improvement of zzso zzso was zzso A benefit was obtained in all experiments with the peak signal derived from the clean zzso Although the zzso strategy is not effective in many real-life situations, the results suggest that there is potential for speech zzso improvement when an enhancement of the zzso of the speech envelope is included in the signal processing of auditory zzso
