Gene expression profiling studies initially enabled diffuse large zzso zzso to be divided into zzso center and activated zzso zzso which define zzso and low-risk patient groups when treated with zzso Attempts to reproduce the zzso zzso zzso have, however, provided inconsistent zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether modified zzso zzso of cell of origin focusing on activated zzso markers could be used to predict the outcome of zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined zzso from 88 samples of diffuse large zzso zzso patients treated zzso with zzso When the modified zzso using zzso and zzso zzso as activated zzso markers was applied to distinguish the patients between the activated zzso and other diffuse large zzso zzso zzso a significantly worse outcome was seen for the patients with the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso survival 63 vs zzso zzso overall survival 69 vs zzso zzso Similarly, according to the zzso algorithm, the group 2 patients representing zzso zzso center patients showed an inferior outcome in comparison to the group 1 patients zzso survival 59 vs zzso zzso overall survival 67 vs zzso zzso In contrast, when the zzso of the same cohort was performed according to the Hans algorithm, no significant difference in survival was observed between the zzso center and zzso center zzso In conclusion, the data suggest that both the modified activated zzso and zzso zzso define the zzso center zzso as an adverse risk factor in zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso
