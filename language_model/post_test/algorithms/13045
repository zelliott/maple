To evaluate which way of topical drug application would result in a better deposition pattern after zzso 

We compared the deposition pattern of a zzso steroid after application with a zzso pump spray or inhalation using the zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved via zzso using zzso zzso zzso All patients had a well healed zzso system with an zzso wide open access after zzso We looked for the deposition with zzso directly after application and after washing out using a zzso zzso Analysis was performed blinded by two independent experienced zzso surgeons via representative single zzso 

Data of 11 patients revealed, that deposition after zzso pump spray application was superior than after inhalation for all zzso By far most part of the drug was deposited in the anterior zzso zzso followed by the head of the middle zzso zzso Small amounts reached the zzso zzso the anterior wall of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the entrance to the frontal zzso The frontal zzso itself was not reached in any zzso zzso out led to a decrease of deposition intensity, in some cases to a better distribution into the zzso and zzso zzso and frontal zzso 

zzso deposition of topical zzso steroids after zzso is zzso We need better methods and devices to zzso efficacy of topical zzso
