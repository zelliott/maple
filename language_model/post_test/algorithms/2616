zzso rise is the basis of some methods that are widely applied for the determination of contact angles as well as zzso of small zzso The equivalent zzso radius zzso in the Classical Washburn equation is assumed to be zzso But it seems that zzso is not always constant when the type of liquids is zzso The new equation with the pressure zzso and the zzso effects are theoretically derived based on the Washburn zzso so contact angles of small particles can be measured zzso independently of zzso The result shows the zzso of the proposed method, and therefore, it becomes possible to accurately measure the zzso of small zzso
