Full brain network models comprise a large-scale connectivity (the zzso and neural mass models as the network's zzso zzso mass models absorb implicitly a variety of properties in their constant parameters to achieve a reduction in zzso In situations, where the local network connectivity zzso major changes, such as in development or zzso it becomes crucial to model local connectivity zzso This leads naturally to a description of neural fields on folded cortical sheets with local and global zzso The zzso approximation of neural fields in biologically realistic situations as addressed in zzso Brain simulations (see zzso zzso zzso is challenging and requires a thorough evaluation if the zzso Brain approach is to be adapted for systematic studies of disease and zzso Here we analyze the sampling problem of neural fields for arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit results for one, two and three dimensions relevant to realistically folded cortical zzso We characterize zzso the error due to sampling of spatial distribution zzso zzso useful sampling zzso ranges in the context of zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso guidelines for choosing the right spatial distribution function for given anatomical and geometrical zzso
