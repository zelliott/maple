zzso receptors zzso are involved in cell communication processes and with zzso such senses as vision, zzso taste, and zzso They constitute a prominent zzso of drug targets, but an zzso structure is available for only one zzso bovine zzso making it difficult to use zzso methods to design zzso zzso We have developed the zzso first principles zzso method for predicting the three-dimensional structure of zzso In this article we validate the zzso procedure by comparing its predictions with the high-resolution crystal structure of bovine zzso The crystal structure of bovine zzso has the second zzso zzso loop closed over the zzso regions by making a zzso linkage between zzso and zzso but we speculate that opening this loop may play a role in the zzso process of the zzso through the zzso linkage with zzso zzso zzso we predicted two structures for bovine zzso from the primary sequence (with no input from the crystal zzso with the zzso loop closed as in the crystal structure, and the other with the zzso loop zzso The zzso structure of bovine zzso with the closed zzso loop deviates from the crystal by zzso A coordinate root zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso The predicted three-dimensional structures for other zzso can be validated only by predicting binding sites and energies for various zzso For such predictions we developed the zzso first principles zzso zzso We validate zzso by predicting the binding site of zzso in the crystal structure of bovine zzso zzso the whole protein without using any prior knowledge of the binding site, we find that the best scoring zzso in zzso is zzso A zzso from the crystal structure for the zzso zzso This predicted zzso has the zzso O only zzso A from the N of zzso Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final zzso only zzso A zzso from the crystal zzso We also used zzso to predict the binding site of zzso in the zzso structure of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso the whole protein structure leads to a structure in which the zzso O is only zzso A from the N of zzso Making this Schiff base bond and minimizing leads to a final zzso only zzso A zzso from the crystal zzso The good agreement of the zzso zzso protein structures and zzso binding site with experiment zzso the use of the zzso and zzso first zzso zzso Since these methods are generic and zzso to any zzso they should be useful in predicting the structures of other zzso and the binding site of zzso to these zzso
