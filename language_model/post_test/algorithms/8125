zzso memories are zzso devices designed to store a set of patterns as stable zzso such that the stored patterns can be reliably retrieved with the initial zzso containing sufficient information about the zzso This paper presents a new design procedure for zzso zzso memories based on zzso cellular neural networks with time delays characterized by input and output zzso obtained using two-dimensional zzso cloning zzso The design procedure enables zzso or zzso memories to be zzso by solving a set of linear zzso with few design parameters and retrieval zzso feeding from external zzso instead of initial zzso The designed zzso memories are robust in terms of design zzso zzso In addition, the hosting cellular neural networks are guaranteed to be globally zzso zzso zzso and experimental results of illustrative examples and zzso Carlo tests demonstrate the zzso and superiority of the zzso
