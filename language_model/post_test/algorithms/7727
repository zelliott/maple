zzso is a prevailing symptom in most lung zzso While cough sounds themselves can be very instrumental in the diagnosis of certain diseases, their intensity and frequency also zzso the intensity of the particular zzso There is an imperative need for a robust system for identifying and analyzing cough zzso In implementing such systems, researchers are confronted with technical challenges such as the choice of sensors and methods of signal zzso the real time analysis of the acquired signals, and the accurate identification of cough events, distinguishing them from similar sounds such as speech, laughing, throat clearing and zzso Previous approaches have employed external environmental sensing methods to achieve more accurate zzso at the expense of mobility, zzso and real-time cough zzso Alternative approaches have proposed zzso cough sensing methods, which, while mobile, can often face challenges in terms of zzso and zzso In this paper, we explore the strengths and shortcomings of the various techniques that have been proposed for automatic detection and analysis of cough zzso We also suggest the next steps in zzso the state of the zzso
