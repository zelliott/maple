The large gap between the number of protein sequences in databases and the number of functionally characterized proteins calls for the development of a fast zzso tool for the prediction of zzso and zzso zzso generally zzso to protein zzso The information on zzso may reveal the molecular function of novel zzso in addition to providing insight on the biological pathways in which they zzso The bulk of past work has been focused on protein zzso zzso Furthermore, no specific tool has been dedicated to prediction at the zzso level, despite its high zzso In order to design a suitable zzso system, the extraction of subtle sequence signals that can discriminate among proteins with different zzso zzso is the zzso 

New kernel functions used in a support zzso machine zzso learning model are introduced for the measurement of sequence zzso The zzso zzso are first mapped by a zzso of zzso pairs of zzso which are measured by zzso zzso The zzso measuring the similarity for zzso are then defined on the mapped zzso By combining these new zzso methods, a zzso zzso system for the prediction of protein zzso zzso is established for the first zzso The performance of the system is evaluated with a set of proteins collected in the Nuclear zzso Database zzso The overall accuracy of prediction for 6 zzso is about 50% zzso random prediction zzso for single zzso proteins in the zzso zzso and zzso for an independent set of zzso zzso This integrated system can be zzso at zzso 

The integrated system benefits from the combination of predictions from several zzso based on selected zzso zzso Finally, the zzso power of the system is expected to improve as more proteins with known zzso zzso become zzso
