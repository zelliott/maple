zzso zzso has been widely applied in medical image zzso This technique relies on image registration to transfer zzso labels from zzso zzso to a novel target image and applies label fusion to reduce errors produced by zzso label zzso To improve the performance of zzso label transfer against registration zzso our first contribution is to propose a label transfer scheme that generates multiple warped versions of each zzso to one target image through registration paths obtained by zzso zzso registrations and zzso zzso The problem of decreasing quality of warped zzso caused by zzso errors in zzso multiple registrations is properly addressed by an zzso selection method that is guided by zzso zzso To improve the performance of label fusion against registration zzso our second contribution is to integrate the zzso correspondence model employed by the zzso mean approach with the joint label fusion technique, both of which have shown excellent performance for label zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso show the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
