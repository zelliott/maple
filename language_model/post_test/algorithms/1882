zzso zzso zzso zzso data is a difficult problem due to its small world and zzso zzso zzso zzso methods could not perform zzso This paper proposes an improved zzso based approach through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso algorithm, which can find the optimum threshold automatically when calculating the lowest similarity between zzso We also take bridging zzso into account to improve the zzso zzso The experiments on Munich Information Center for zzso zzso zzso zzso data sets show that the zzso has better performance than functional flow method in terms of accuracy and number of matched zzso
