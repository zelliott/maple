The reference air zzso rate of an zzso high dose rate zzso source is determined based broadly on the International Atomic Energy Agency zzso zzso zzso code of zzso Since the primary standards zzso laboratory at the Australian zzso Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency zzso does not maintain a standard at zzso quality, the air zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso Farmer type zzso chamber is calculated using zzso determined at 300 zzso and zzso zzso The methodology proposed by zzso and Rogers zzso at 250 zzso and zzso qualities is zzso The zzso of this approach is tested by performing zzso Carlo simulations to determine the zzso air zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Very good agreement is obtained between values using these two zzso The reference air zzso rate is measured using the Farmer chamber in an in air zzso In addition the necessary correction factors are applied to the measured zzso The reference air zzso rate determined in this way is compared to the value stated by the vendor of the zzso source on the source zzso zzso zzso are with one exception less than zzso It is concluded that because of the agreement between the values from the methodology used in this study and the source zzso certificate values this methodology can be used zzso
