The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in many biological zzso Recent studies show that zzso clusters of basic zzso from a number of peripheral proteins can zzso zzso zzso in zzso Specifically, experiments suggest that the basic zzso domain of the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso or a zzso corresponding to this domain, zzso sequesters several zzso and that this zzso is due to zzso zzso zzso Here, we use the finite difference zzso method to test this hypothesis by calculating the zzso free energy of lateral zzso of zzso by zzso basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso based on zzso In agreement with experiments, we find that the zzso free energy becomes more favorable zzso 1), zzso and zzso zzso several zzso zzso the linear charge density of the basic zzso increases; zzso the zzso percent zzso zzso zzso in the membrane zzso and zzso the zzso strength of the solution zzso In addition, the zzso zzso free energy is in excess of the zzso penalty associated with zzso zzso Our calculations, thus, provide a structural and quantitative description of the observed interaction of zzso with zzso basic zzso
