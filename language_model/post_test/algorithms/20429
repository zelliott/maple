zzso locomotion was simulated to generate a pattern of zzso muscles for walking using electrical stimulation in persons with spinal zzso injury zzso or zzso The simulation presented in this study starts from a model of the body determined with zzso zzso individualized with respect to the zzso masses, inertia, muscle and joint zzso The trajectory used for simulation was recorded from an zzso subject while walking with zzso zzso A discrete mathematical model and dynamic programming were used to determine the optimal zzso A cost function was selected as the sum of the squares of the tracking errors from the desired zzso and the weighted sum of the squares of zzso and zzso zzso of the muscle groups acting around the hip and knee zzso The aim of the simulation was to study plausible zzso keeping in mind the limitations imposed by the spinal zzso injury or stroke zzso zzso decreased range of movements in some zzso limited strength of paralyzed, zzso activated zzso If the muscles were capable of generating the movements required and the trajectory was zzso then the simulation provided two kinds of information: 1) timing of the onset and offset of muscle zzso with respect to the various gait events and 2) patterns of zzso with respect to the maximum zzso These results are important for zzso a zzso zzso
