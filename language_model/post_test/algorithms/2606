zzso nutrition is an important aspect of the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer zzso In our unit, method of feeding is based on an arbitrary predicted duration of overall treatment zzso days indicates zzso zzso zzso days zzso zzso tube zzso is zzso This paper provides a zzso to assist in choosing the feeding method early on to avoid the need for later zzso zzso in those who were initially fed orally or via zzso zzso 

59 patients undergoing zzso of head and neck zzso were included, grouped according to their zzso stage and zzso They were assessed zzso and zzso for 5 years and their diet consistency score, method of supplementary feeding and weight were zzso 

Mean zzso zzso feeding duration was 771 days (N zzso zzso these patients mostly had zzso zzso involving the zzso Mean zzso duration was zzso days (N zzso zzso 15 later had zzso zzso at mean 47 days zzso resulting in a total mean supplementary feeding duration of zzso zzso These patients tended to have higher stage zzso and poorer zzso diet consistency zzso 43 patients required zzso zzso This significantly increased feeding duration versus surgery alone, and therefore increases the likelihood of requiring zzso zzso 

Based on our findings, we have constructed an zzso to assist in determining which patients with zzso head and neck cancer should have zzso zzso tube zzso
