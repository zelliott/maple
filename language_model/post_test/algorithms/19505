zzso zzso affect gene expression by zzso the complex network of regulatory zzso We propose a zzso method, called zzso which directly aims to identify the mechanism by which genetic changes zzso the regulatory zzso zzso automatically zzso a set of zzso genes zzso whose regulation can involve both sequence variations and expression of zzso By exploiting the zzso of genetic regulatory systems, zzso reveals regulatory relationships that are zzso when genes are considered in isolation, allowing the recovery of intricate zzso zzso By incorporating both expression and zzso of regulators, zzso captures cases where the effect of sequence variation on its targets is zzso We applied zzso to a data set from the progeny generated by a cross between laboratory zzso zzso and wild zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced previously zzso hypotheses regarding genetic zzso in the zzso regulatory network, including zzso regulation, signal zzso and zzso zzso In particular, we find a large number of zzso that have both zzso characteristics and are regulated by zzso modification zzso Indeed, a large fraction of the zzso in the expression can be explained by a small number of markers associated with zzso zzso Additional analysis reveals positive selection for sequence evolution of elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest that a significant part of individual expression variation in zzso arises from evolution of a small number of zzso structure zzso
