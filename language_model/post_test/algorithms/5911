Cuts on zzso zzso are a central task in the set of physical operations needed in many surgical simulation zzso Our zzso surgical simulator structures are zzso zzso zzso driven by zzso on the touched zzso as opposed to zzso This approach allows for realistic simulation of both deformation and zzso response at real-time zzso The integration of zzso into our system increases its efficiency, and allows for complex interaction on larger zzso than would normally be permitted with available zzso We present an extension of our novel zzso for cuts in zzso zzso in the context of condensed zzso We show results from our surgical simulation system with real-time zzso zzso
