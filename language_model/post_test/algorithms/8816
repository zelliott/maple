zzso zzso assessment in research and clinical studies is limited by the patient burden of multiple zzso and the time needed to manually score zzso The objective of our study was to investigate the accuracy of an automated zzso zzso which is based on a single bipolar zzso zzso 

Three zzso each manually scored the zzso zzso records from 44 patients referred for sleep zzso zzso zzso records were scored by zzso and zzso zzso criteria zzso 1) and 23 zzso were scored by American Academy of Sleep Medicine zzso 2007 criteria zzso zzso Majority agreement was present in zzso of epochs and was used for comparison to automated scoring from a single zzso lead derived from the left and right zzso 

The zzso zzso for zzso manual scoring ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso for the auto zzso vs manual scoring by zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and was zzso zzso 1, zzso and group 2, zzso for majority agreement for all zzso The mean positive percent agreement across subjects and stages was zzso approximately zzso for stages wake zzso stage 2 sleep zzso zzso and stage 3 sleep zzso zzso the percentage slightly decreased to zzso for rapid eye movement zzso sleep and dropped to zzso for stage 1 sleep zzso zzso in agreement were observed based on zzso zzso sleep zzso zzso severity, medications, and signal zzso 

Our study demonstrated that automated scoring of sleep obtained from a single-channel of forehead zzso results in agreement to majority manual scoring are similar to results obtained from studies of manual zzso zzso The benefit in assessing zzso accuracy with consensus agreement across multiple zzso is most apparent in patients with zzso zzso assessing zzso accuracy limited disagreements in patients on medications and in those with compromised signal zzso
