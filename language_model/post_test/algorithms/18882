zzso of randomly zzso zzso zzso particles and internally structured zzso collectively zzso as zzso charged zzso on charged surfaces is important in many technological and natural zzso In this paper, we will focus on zzso the charge regulation of both the zzso and the surface and zzso the surface zzso between the particle functional groups and the surface sites and will theoretically study the zzso using the extended surface zzso zzso The model explicitly considers the zzso potential of a zzso with an average zzso structure and charge both in bulk solution and on the surface to obtain the equilibrium zzso The chemical zzso of the particle is described by a distribution of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the chemical potential of the zzso zzso reveals that the pH and salt dependence of the zzso can be largely explained by the balance between an energy gain resulting from the particle and surface charge regulation and the surface zzso and an energy loss from the zzso zzso zzso zzso close to the zzso This conclusion is also supported by the strong impacts that the chemical zzso of the particle functional groups, the magnitude of the surface zzso the number of the functional groups, and the size of the particle have on the zzso
