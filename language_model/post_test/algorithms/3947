To assess correlation between zzso dynamic zzso ultrasound zzso blood flow zzso and zzso zzso blood flow zzso five groups of six rabbits underwent unilateral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Five US zzso per zzso (three zzso zzso were obtained zzso and immediately and 4 and zzso zzso using linear zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso linear zzso method fit the rise phase of mean zzso intensity over a zzso period for each time zzso Slope of fit and zzso US zzso intensity ratios were zzso Means of zzso zzso and combined zzso US ratios as a function of zzso degree were compared with zzso zzso ratios using zzso correlation zzso zzso There was high correlation between the two sets of ratios zzso zzso except for the zzso US ratio in the immediate zzso period zzso zzso These results hold promise for future clinical zzso
