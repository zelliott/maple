Hollow metallic fibers zzso are in general zzso primarily zzso to the fact that the guided zzso zzso light sustains a relatively high propagation zzso In this paper, we propose a type of practical zzso metallic fiber zzso with zzso corrugated inner surface for zzso infrared zzso zzso zzso results show that the loss of the fundamental TM mode can be easily reduced by zzso times compared to a zzso without surface zzso In contrast to the traditional zzso with a zzso zzso it is shown that the loss of the fundamental TM mode in the proposed zzso is relatively insensitive to the zzso layer thickness or zzso the operating zzso
