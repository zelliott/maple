zzso for three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a uniform cylinder and zzso with zzso requires correction for scatter and zzso Thus the accuracy of the zzso is dependent on the scatter correction method, and on the zzso of the scatter correction for different regions of the zzso A method has been developed which provides a zzso which does not require correction for scatter or zzso making it generally zzso and independent of the scatter zzso The method has been previously described for measurement of the absolute sensitivity of zzso zzso This approach has been extended to give a zzso of the PET camera zzso zzso in units of zzso The reconstructed images are multiplied by this factor to give accurate activity zzso after zzso and scatter zzso The method has been used with a fully zzso filtered zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso scatter correction on data from an zzso zzso Using this method zzso PET images have been zzso to within zzso zzso but this is highly dependent on the accuracy of the scatter zzso The method described here is practical and provides a means of zzso a zzso PET system without the need for correction for scatter or zzso of the zzso zzso
