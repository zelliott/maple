zzso the zzso of zzso data without losing its essential information is an important task in information zzso When class labels of training data are available, Fisher zzso analysis zzso has been widely zzso However, the zzso of zzso is guaranteed only in a very restricted ideal circumstance, and it is often observed that zzso does not provide a good zzso surface for many real zzso This letter treats the problem of supervised zzso reduction from the viewpoint of information theory and proposes a framework of zzso reduction based on zzso zzso zzso The proposed linear zzso technique is validated both theoretically and zzso Then, through kernel Fisher zzso analysis zzso the multiple kernel learning problem is treated in the proposed zzso and a novel algorithm, which zzso zzso the parameters of the zzso function and kernel combination zzso is zzso The zzso is zzso shown to be comparable to or zzso zzso for large-scale benchmark data sets, and comparable to other multiple kernel learning techniques on the zzso protein function zzso zzso
