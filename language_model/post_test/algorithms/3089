Airborne particles entering the respiratory tract may interact with the zzso plasma membrane zzso of zzso cells and enter zzso zzso in the entering mechanisms of fine (between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso zzso particles may be associated with different effects on the zzso zzso we studied zzso changes in zzso surface area in relation to applied and zzso particle size, surface and zzso 

Human pulmonary zzso cells zzso cell line) were incubated with various zzso of different sized fluorescent polystyrene spheres without surface charge zzso circle fine - zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso by zzso exposure for 24 zzso zzso surface area of zzso cells was estimated by zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso particles were zzso and zzso by zzso laser scanning zzso 

zzso exposure induced an increase in zzso surface area compared to negative control zzso zzso zzso at the same surface area concentration of fine and zzso particles a finding not observed at low particle zzso zzso particle entering was less pronounced than fine particle entering into zzso cells, however, at the same particle surface area dose, the number of zzso zzso particles was higher than that of fine zzso The number of zzso particles showed a stronger increase for fine than for zzso particles at rising particle zzso 

This study demonstrates a zzso enlargement of the zzso surface area of a pulmonary zzso cell line, depending on particle surface area zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells does not seem to be responsible for this zzso We propose that direct interactions between particle surface area and cell membrane cause the enlargement of the zzso
