zzso parameters for assessment of depth of zzso are typically based on different signal processing methods, such as spectral and complexity zzso In the present study, the parameters investigated zzso zzso approximate zzso and zzso zzso do not correlate zzso to depth of zzso To obtain this zzso parameters are combined based on fuzzy zzso zzso each zzso only operates in a specific zzso zzso zzso seems to be a suitable approach, as the indicator designed separates zzso from zzso as well as the best single zzso does and zzso to the depth of zzso
