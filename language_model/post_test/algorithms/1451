The zzso analysis zzso methodology enables isolation of the overall elimination and distribution effects in zzso and zzso analysis which focuses on drug elimination zzso and does not require a specific structured modeling of drug distribution zzso A computer zzso enables a curve fitting and a kinetic zzso by integration of the zzso type zzso equation in the zzso The approach is demonstrated in an analysis of the zzso disposition zzso of zzso zzso in 10 healthy, adult human subjects who each received 10, 100, and 500 zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso The zzso is analyzed according to a zzso type zzso elimination function, considering simultaneous fitting to the data from all three doses in each zzso The simultaneous fittings produced estimates of the zzso parameters zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A linear clearance zzso is defined as the zzso clearance value approached when the drug level decreases toward zzso The degree of zzso reached from various zzso was zzso in terms of a clearance ratio which is defined as the ratio between the linear clearance and the clearance estimated for the maximum drug concentration encountered at the given dose zzso The subjects showed very little zzso at the 10 zzso dosing with a mean clearance ratio of zzso zzso zzso A statistically significant increase in the degree of zzso was observed in the zzso elimination zzso as the dosing level was increased to 100 and 500 zzso reaching clearance ratios of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zero value for the global elimination rate zzso in all 30 zzso indicates that zzso elimination is entirely accounted for by zzso zzso
