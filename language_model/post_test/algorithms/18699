The zzso of the cell's large-scale organization is a primary challenge for zzso biology, and understanding the structure of protein interaction networks offers an important starting point for such zzso We compare four available databases that approximate the protein interaction network of the zzso zzso zzso aiming to uncover the network's generic large-scale properties and the impact of the zzso function and cellular zzso on the network zzso We show how each database supports a zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicating that these features represent a robust and generic property of the protein interactions zzso We also find strong correlations between the network's structure and the functional role and zzso zzso of its protein constituents, concluding that most functional and/or zzso classes appear as relatively zzso zzso of the full protein interaction zzso The uncovered systematic differences between the four protein interaction databases reflect their relative coverage for different functional and zzso classes and provide a guide for their utility in various zzso zzso
