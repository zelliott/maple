In this paper we use the zzso angular spring based zzso zzso model to simulate the plastic mesh in a zzso zzso surgery zzso We propose a physically based method to systematically derive the optimal parameters of the zzso zzso zzso While the traditional zzso zzso model lacks resistance against bending, the zzso zzso model with zzso parameters can provide correct zzso resistance as well as stretching zzso The simulated mesh is demonstrated to be much more zzso
