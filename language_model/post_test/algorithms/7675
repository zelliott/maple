We propose a new approach for statistical shape analysis of zzso anatomical objects based on features extracted from zzso Like prior work on zzso zzso the approach involves zzso a template to target shapes in a way that preserves the branching structure of the skeleton and provides zzso zzso However, unlike zzso zzso which zzso the skeleton surfaces zzso our representation is zzso and the skeleton is zzso Similar to prior constrained modeling methods developed zzso objects or zzso zzso objects, we impose symmetry constraints on zzso of boundary points in a way that guarantees the preservation of the zzso zzso under zzso Once zzso the problem of zzso a template to a target shape is formulated as a zzso constrained zzso programming zzso The new technique is evaluated in terms of its ability to capture the shape of the corpus zzso tract extracted from zzso zzso
