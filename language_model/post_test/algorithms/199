In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse zzso correlation analysis zzso zzso Suppose that two sets of zzso are available on the same set of zzso zzso zzso is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each zzso It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of zzso zzso data, when two sets of zzso are available on the same set of zzso In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that is, it does not make use of outcome zzso that may be available for each observation zzso survival time or cancer zzso We propose an extension to sparse zzso which we call sparse supervised zzso which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the zzso zzso It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two zzso on the same set of zzso for instance, zzso gene zzso and DNA copy number zzso may all be zzso We develop sparse multiple zzso in order to extend the sparse zzso methodology to the case of more than two data zzso We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large zzso zzso data zzso
