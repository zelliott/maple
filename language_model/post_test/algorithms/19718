Gene expression profiling by zzso technology is usually difficult to interpret into a simpler zzso One approach to resolve the complexity of gene expression profiles is the application of artificial neural networks zzso A potential difficulty in this strategy, however, is that the zzso nature of ANN makes it essentially a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a fuzzy logic approach is useful because it can complement ANN by explicitly specifying membership function during zzso We employed a hybrid approach of neural network and fuzzy logic to further analyze a published zzso study of gene responses to eight bacteria in human zzso The original analysis by zzso zzso found common gene responses to all bacteria but did not address individual zzso Our method allowed exploration of the gene response of the host to individual zzso We implemented a zzso zzso neural network containing the principle of zzso zzso zzso zzso The weights of the trained neural network were fed into a fuzzy logic zzso zzso A new zzso called the impact rating zzso was also introduced to explore the degree of importance of each zzso To assess the reliability of the zzso value, a zzso zzso method was applied to the zzso and a confidence level for each zzso was zzso Our approach has successfully uncovered the unique features of host response to individual zzso Further, application of gene zzso zzso zzso to the genes of high zzso values in each response has suggested new biological pathways for individual zzso zzso
