In zzso therapy, complex density zzso within the beam path constitute a challenge to dose calculation zzso This might question the reliability of dose zzso predicted by treatment planning systems based on zzso dose zzso For cases in which substantial dose errors are expected, resorting to zzso Carlo dose calculations might be essential to ensure a successful treatment outcome and therefore the benefit is worth a presumably long zzso zzso The aim of this study was to define an indicator for the accuracy of dose delivery based on zzso dose calculations in treatment planning systems for small zzso therapy fields to identify those patients for which zzso Carlo dose calculation is zzso 

Fourteen patients treated at our facility with small passively scattered zzso beams zzso diameters below zzso were zzso Plans were generated in the zzso treatment planning system in combination with a pencil beam zzso developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital and compared to zzso Carlo dose zzso zzso in the dose to the 50% of the gross tumor volume zzso zzso were assessed in a zzso zzso A simple and fast methodology was developed to zzso the zzso of the tissue traversed by a single small zzso beam using a zzso index zzso concept presented by zzso et zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso zzso for scanned zzso zzso Finally, the potential correlation between the error made by the pencil beam based treatment planning zzso for each field and the level of tissue zzso traversed by the zzso beam given by the zzso was zzso 

zzso up to zzso were found in zzso for single fields, although dose differences were within clinical tolerance levels zzso when combining all of the fields involved in the zzso The discrepancies found for each field exhibited a strong correlation to their associated zzso zzso zzso zzso the higher the level of tissue zzso for a particular field, the larger the error by the zzso zzso With the established correlation a threshold for zzso can be set by choosing a tolerance level of zzso accepted in zzso 

The zzso is a good indicator for the accuracy of zzso field delivery in terms of zzso prescription dose coverage when small fields are zzso Each zzso was obtained from the CT image in less than 3 zzso on a computer with 2 zzso CPU allowing zzso of this methodology in clinical zzso For zzso exceeding the zzso either a change in beam direction (if zzso or a zzso of the dose with zzso Carlo would be highly zzso
