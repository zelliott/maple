We propose a method based on the zzso technique for removing zzso patterns that plague coherent zzso The proposed method is designed for images whose gray levels vary continuously in zzso The image model is based on a lattice of zzso corresponding to zzso of zzso in which the gray level of each zzso is produced by linear zzso A constraint on zzso gray levels is introduced to zzso the zzso
