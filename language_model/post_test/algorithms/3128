Different techniques have been introduced for full automatic processing of zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso We tried to evaluate the accuracy of one of these commercial automatic processing zzso The study was performed in 300 patients during 18 zzso Two zzso acquisitions in zzso and prone positions and one acquisition at rest , were performed for every zzso All images were processed both automatically and zzso and the results were compared to each zzso The automatic method matched the interactive method in zzso for left zzso isolation, in zzso for excluding zzso activity and in zzso for zzso of a single projected zzso The automatic method was also successful in complete processing of zzso sets of stress zzso and zzso sets of stress zzso images as compared to the interactive zzso In conclusion, the fully automated processing method matches the interactive method in complete processing of zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso more than zzso and is of equal accuracy to the interactive method in zzso and zzso zzso
