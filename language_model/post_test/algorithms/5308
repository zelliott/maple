zzso of discrete chaotic signals in presence of noise is zzso The existing methods are based on chaotic zzso which is susceptible to noise, precision limitations, and requires more zzso Furthermore, most of these methods fail for zzso more than two discrete chaotic zzso We propose novel methods to multiplex multiple discrete chaotic signals based on the principle of symbolic sequence zzso in presence of noise and finite precision zzso of finding the initial condition of an arbitrarily long symbolic sequence of a chaotic zzso Our methods work for single precision and as less as 35 zzso For two signals, our method is robust up to 50% noise zzso
