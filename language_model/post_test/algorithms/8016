The fuzzy zzso zzso maps zzso is a fuzzy neural network that associates data of zzso related zzso and zzso In the network, each input or output dimension is represented by a feature map that is zzso into fuzzy or crisp zzso These fuzzy sets are then zzso to form zzso and consequences, which are subsequently associated to form zzso zzso The zzso memory is zzso through an zzso batch mode learning process consisting of three consecutive zzso The initial zzso membership function zzso phase takes inspiration from the organization of sensory maps in our brains by allocating membership functions based on uniform information zzso Next, supervised zzso learning encodes synaptic weights between input and output zzso Finally, a supervised error reduction phase zzso the network, which allows for the discovery of the varying levels of influence of each input dimension across an output feature space in the zzso zzso In the series of experiments, we show that each phase in the learning process contributes significantly to the final accuracy of zzso Further experiments using both toy problems and real-world data demonstrate significant superiority in terms of accuracy of zzso zzso when zzso against other prominent zzso and exhibit the network's suitability to perform analysis and prediction on real-world applications, such as traffic density prediction as shown in this zzso
