The most recent works demonstrate that the zzso overlap function, which describes the overlap between the laser beam and the receiver field of view, can be determined zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso channels using zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso channels cannot be used to determine the zzso overlap for the infrared channel zzso zzso because of their low zzso In addition, many zzso zzso systems only provide zzso signals with reasonable zzso ratio at zzso In view of this fact, this work presents a modification of that method, based on the comparison of attenuated zzso profiles derived from zzso and zzso to retrieve the overlap function for the zzso infrared zzso zzso to the zzso overlap method, the approach presented here allows to derive the overlap correction without an explicit knowledge of all system zzso The application of the proposed methodology will improve the potential of zzso zzso to investigate the zzso zzso properties in the planetary boundary layer, extending the information of zzso zzso zzso profiles to the ground and allowing the retrieval of zzso properties practically close to the zzso
