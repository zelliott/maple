zzso rates for zzso infants vary significantly among different zzso intensive care units zzso zzso models and computer simulation are used to predict the performance of an zzso for identifying individual zzso within a network that have greater than zzso of the expected zzso mortality zzso The zzso maintains high sensitivity and specificity with as few as three moderately zzso risk categories when applied to large health care zzso the model parameters were based on preliminary data from a real zzso zzso The performance of the zzso depends on the number of admissions at the individual zzso A zzso with a zzso risk zzso of the network average would be correctly identified as an zzso 50% of the time if it had 35 admissions, 59% of the time if it had 70 admissions, and zzso of the time if it had 280 zzso A zzso with average risk would be incorrectly identified as an zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the time if it had 35, 70, or 280 admissions, zzso zzso zzso adjustment did not improve these zzso It is concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso in determining which facilities have zzso mortality will be less in typical zzso networks than in large health care networks that treat adult zzso It is unlikely that zzso adjustments will overcome the problem of the small numbers of admissions at individual zzso
