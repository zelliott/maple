Two zzso methods were developed for the determination of some zzso drugs in the presence of either their degradation products or zzso zzso The zzso method determined zzso of each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate zzso and zzso nitrate zzso with the degradation products of each zzso zzso of MN with zzso zzso and of zzso with zzso zzso zzso were also successfully separated and determined by this zzso For zzso and zzso a mixture of zzso zzso zzso was used as a developing system and the spots were scanned at 243 zzso and 220 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso For MN and zzso a mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a developing system and the spots were scanned at 225 zzso for both zzso The zzso method determined zzso of zzso or zzso with their degradation products which were separated and zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out using zzso buffer pH zzso zzso zzso as a mobile phase at a flow rate of zzso zzso and zzso detection at 220 zzso for zzso For zzso a mixture of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso pH 10 zzso zzso was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of zzso zzso and zzso detection at 225 zzso The methods were also used to separate zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in a laboratory prepared mixture and in pharmaceutical zzso The methods were sensitive, precise and zzso for determination of the drugs in pharmaceutical dosage zzso
