The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of thick maximum intensity projections zzso from zzso zzso zzso data sets mimicking projection images from zzso zzso for evaluation of left zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso images were reconstructed in zzso steps of the zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in fixed 30 degrees right anterior zzso zzso degrees left anterior zzso zzso and in adapted zzso planes were zzso zzso parameters were calculated using the zzso method zzso zzso assessment with zzso software served as reference zzso 

Use of thick zzso reconstructions had a high zzso reliability zzso compared with the zzso zzso Smaller measurement errors were found for thick zzso reconstructions in adapted zzso zzso A significant projection error zzso P zzso zzso of thick zzso reconstructions was found using fixed 30 degrees zzso degrees zzso compared with adapted zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reconstructions with adapted zzso planes allow an accurate assessment of zzso parameters compared with the established zzso zzso
