A number of zzso resonant modes in click evoked zzso emissions zzso was zzso The zzso modes were identified by means of an zzso approximation method based on the matching pursuit zzso zzso The signals were zzso into basic zzso coming from a very large and redundant dictionary of zzso zzso The study was performed on zzso evoked zzso emissions zzso from left and right ears of 108 zzso The correspondence between zzso found by the procedure and resonant modes was shown (both for simulated noisy data and for zzso zzso The decomposition of zzso made distinction between short and long-lasting components zzso The number of main resonant modes was studied by means of different criteria and they all led to similar results, indicating that the main features of the signal are explained on average by 10 zzso The same number of resonant modes for the right ear accounted for more energy than for the left zzso
