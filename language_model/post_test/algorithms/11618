A three zzso zzso sensing system for measuring foot movements during gait is proposed and zzso It can form the basis for an automated tuning system for a zzso zzso zzso zzso The foot orientation and position during the swing phase of gait can be reconstructed on the basis of three-dimensional measurement of acceleration and angular zzso using initial and final conditions during zzso The foot movements during gait of one stroke person using the implanted zzso zzso were evaluated for several combinations of stimulation parameters for both zzso The reconstructed foot movements during gait in this person indicated that the channel stimulating the deep zzso nerve contributes mainly to zzso and provides some reduction of inversion seen without zzso while the channel zzso the superficial zzso nerve mainly provides additional reduction of zzso This agrees with anatomical knowledge about the function of the muscles activated by both branches of the zzso zzso The zzso sensor method is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of foot movements during gait supported by the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it is expected to be zzso for the automated balancing of the two stimulation channels to ensure optimal support of zzso
