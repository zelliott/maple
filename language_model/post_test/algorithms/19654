In zzso sensitivity zzso are promising tools to predict the individual outcome of different chemotherapy zzso However, a direct association between in zzso and in zzso zzso has to be shown by clinical zzso This zzso phase II trial was aimed to investigate the efficacy of a zzso zzso chemotherapy in zzso melanoma patients, and to prove an association between in zzso sensitivity and therapy zzso 

The primary study end point was objective zzso secondary end points were safety, overall survival, and zzso zzso zzso tumor cells obtained from zzso zzso were tested for zzso to seven single drugs and five drug combinations using an zzso zzso viability zzso 

Out of 82 recruited patients zzso 57 received zzso chemotherapy and 53 were zzso for all study end points zzso zzso The drug combinations used were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The per protocol population could be divided into 22 zzso zzso and 31 zzso zzso patients by an arbitrary zzso zzso zzso response was zzso in zzso patients compared with zzso in zzso patients zzso progression arrest zzso zzso zzso disease) was zzso versus zzso zzso zzso patients showed an increased overall survival of zzso months compared with zzso months in zzso patients zzso 

In zzso zzso testing may be worthy of further exploration to see if it could be a useful tool to predict the outcome of melanoma patients treated with a zzso zzso zzso these preliminary results will be evaluated by a planned phase III trial using a randomized, zzso controlled zzso
