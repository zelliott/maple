A real-time fetal zzso monitoring system using abdominal recording is zzso The system is based on an zzso AT compatible personal zzso The computer lacks the performance required for real-time zzso zzso a new design of a fast hardware zzso board was developed to enhance the computer zzso The technique is based on a zzso zzso An averaged maternal zzso zzso is derived using the zzso function for the zzso zzso With this procedure a template signal corresponding to one complete maternal zzso is zzso The averaged maternal zzso is then zzso from the abdominal zzso Thus, it is possible to detect all the fetal zzso complexes in spite of their coincidence with the maternal zzso An average fetal zzso is then extracted to improve the zzso ratio, making it possible to recognize fetal P and T zzso
