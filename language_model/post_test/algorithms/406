zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso in the western zzso Its early detection has been found to improve the prognosis of the patient, providing a wide window of opportunity for successful therapeutic zzso However, current diagnostic techniques all have some limitations; there is a need to develop a better technique for routine screening zzso We present a new methodology based on magnetic resonance zzso of zzso extracts for the zzso detection of zzso zzso Five hundred zzso human subjects zzso with no zzso zzso and 111 with zzso cancer, who were scheduled for zzso or zzso were recruited to donate a single sample of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso experiments were performed on the zzso of zzso zzso of the stool zzso Using a statistical zzso strategy, several zzso zzso were zzso zzso the zzso feature selection and zzso development stages of the zzso zzso Strategy led to approximately zzso average balanced sensitivity and specificity for both training and monitoring sets, improving to approximately zzso when only crisp results, zzso class assignment probabilities zzso or zzso are zzso These results indicate that zzso magnetic resonance zzso of human zzso zzso combined with appropriate data analysis methodology, has the potential to detect zzso zzso accurately and zzso and could be a useful addition to the current screening zzso
