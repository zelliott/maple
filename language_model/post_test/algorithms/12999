When primates maintain their gaze directed toward a visual target zzso zzso their eyes display a combination of miniature fast and slow zzso An involvement of the zzso in visual fixation is indicated by the severe gaze zzso observed in patients suffering from zzso zzso Recent studies in zzso primates have identified a zzso structure, the zzso zzso region zzso as a major zzso output nucleus with projections toward zzso regions in the brain zzso zzso zzso of the FOR leads to zzso visually guided zzso and to an offset in gaze direction when the animal zzso a visual zzso However, the nature of this fixation offset is not fully zzso In the present work, we analyze the zzso effects on zzso A novel technique is adopted to describe the generation of zzso when a target is being fixated zzso zzso We show that the offset is the result of a combination of impaired zzso accuracy and an altered zzso of the zzso target zzso Because they are independent, we propose that these two zzso are zzso by the different projections of the FOR to the brain zzso in particular to the deep superior zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that the zzso zzso through the activity in the zzso regulates both the zzso of zzso zzso and the position toward which the eyes must be directed, suggesting an involvement in the acquisition of visual information from the zzso
