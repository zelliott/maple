A new intrinsic geometry based on a spectral analysis is used to motivate methods for aligning protein zzso The geometry is induced by the fact that a distance zzso can be scaled so that its zzso are zzso We provide a zzso rigorous development of the intrinsic geometry underlying our spectral approach and use it to motivate two alignment zzso The first uses zzso alone and dynamic programming to quickly zzso a fold zzso Family identification results are reported for the zzso and zzso data zzso The second zzso extends our spectral method by zzso between our intrinsic geometry and the zzso geometry of a fold to make high-quality zzso zzso and comparisons are reported for several difficult fold zzso The second zzso ability to correctly identify fold families in the zzso and zzso data sets is also zzso
