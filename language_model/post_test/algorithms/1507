The purpose of this study was to determine zzso the zzso factors that affect the closing zzso of the disc of zzso zzso zzso prosthetic zzso zzso The motion of the zzso disk was zzso by Newton's second law written in the form of a second order differential equation which expressed the instantaneous angle of the disc with respect to the valve ring as a function of the instantaneous pressure drop across the zzso zzso delta zzso and the angle of the pressure zzso zzso acting upon the disc during zzso The disc closes in response to the negative pressure drop created by the crossover of left zzso and left zzso zzso zzso The rate of closure depends on the rate of development of the pressure drop across the zzso d delta zzso which is largely dependent upon the rate of change of left zzso pressure during zzso contraction, zzso zzso The closure rate is also strongly dependent on the initial angle of the pressure drop zzso with respect to the zzso The disc was predicted to reach its highest zzso at the moment of impact, based on the zzso zzso zzso suggests that a high zzso zzso during valve closure or distorted zzso zzso causing the angle between the fully open disc and the pressure drop zzso to shift, will cause the valve to have a high zzso at the moment of impact and may produce high impact zzso
