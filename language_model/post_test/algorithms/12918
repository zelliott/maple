We demonstrate imaging through a zzso layer by using digital phase zzso of the second harmonic field radiated from a beacon zzso We show that the zzso focus can be displaced from its initial position by illuminating the same region of the zzso layer with an angular zzso An image is obtained by scanning the zzso focus through the zzso layer in a region around the zzso We obtain a clear image of the target by measuring the light transmitted through it when scanning the focused zzso
