With the advent of zzso profiling methods, interest in reverse engineering the structure and dynamics of zzso networks is zzso Recently an zzso for reverse engineering of zzso networks was developed by zzso and zzso It is a zzso approach using time discrete zzso zzso One of its key steps includes the choice of a term order, a zzso imposed by the use of zzso zzso The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets to be used with this zzso and to characterize optimal data zzso We found minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be reverse engineered zzso Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which we characterized using a geometric property called zzso zzso Moreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets, provided a zzso condition is zzso In addition, we present a zzso of their zzso that does not depend on the choice of a term zzso For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the correct model, provided the data set used is zzso We analyzed the zzso behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of variables zzso zzso interacting zzso Unfortunately, this formula zzso to zero as fast as , where and zzso zzso even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders are zzso the reverse engineering problem remains zzso unless prodigious amounts of data are zzso Such large data sets are zzso impossible to generate with today's zzso
