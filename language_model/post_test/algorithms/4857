A new zzso zzso sequence is introduced for measuring zzso transport across the plasma membrane of living zzso A zzso zzso and a variable mixing time precedes a standard zzso block for diffusion zzso of the zzso zzso The filter is a zzso block zzso for selectively removing the zzso of the zzso zzso With increasing mixing time the zzso and zzso components approach their equilibrium fractional zzso The rate of exchange can be measured using only a few minutes of instrument zzso Water exchange over the plasma membrane of starved zzso cells is studied in the temperature range zzso to zzso degrees zzso
