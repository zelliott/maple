Clinical trials in children are being encouraged by regulatory authorities in light of the immense zzso and zzso use of drugs in the zzso zzso The use of in zzso techniques for zzso prediction will aid in the development of zzso clinical trials by guiding dosing regimens, ensuring efficient blood sampling times, zzso therapeutic effect and potentially reducing the number of children required for the zzso The goal of this study was to extend an existing zzso based zzso zzso model for adults to reflect the age-related zzso changes in children from birth to 18 years of age and, in conjunction with a previously developed zzso clearance model, to evaluate the accuracy of the zzso zzso model to predict zzso plasma zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso organ zzso blood flows, zzso space and vascular space were taken from the zzso zzso parameters that were used in the zzso model were checked against literature values to ensure zzso These included cardiac zzso portal vein flow, zzso water, total body water, zzso and zzso Five model compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were then examined by gathering the plasma zzso profiles, volumes of distribution and elimination zzso from different ages of children and zzso First, the adult data were used to ensure accurate prediction of zzso zzso The model was then scaled to the specific age of children in the study, including the zzso of zzso and the generated plasma concentration profiles, volumes of distribution and elimination zzso were compared with literature zzso 

zzso zzso produced highly zzso cardiac zzso portal vein flow, zzso water, total body water, zzso and protein values that well represented literature zzso The zzso profiles in children for the five compounds were well predicted and the trends associated with age were zzso Thus, young zzso had plasma zzso greater than the adults and older children had zzso less than the zzso zzso percent, zzso and zzso of the predicted plasma zzso volumes of distribution and elimination zzso respectively, were within 50% of the study reported zzso There was no zzso bias for term zzso to 18 years of age when examining volumes of distribution and elimination zzso 

This study suggests that the developed zzso zzso model can be used to scale zzso from zzso The accurate prediction of zzso parameters in children will aid in the development of dosing regimens and sampling times, thus increasing the efficiency of zzso clinical zzso
