The zzso equivalent zzso zzso is well recognized as an in zzso model of wound zzso To zzso the zzso zzso zzso electric fields that cause zzso effects in this model, determination of zzso is a zzso This article outlines a zzso technique to establish zzso of zzso at 100 zzso zzso is zzso from human zzso zzso and collagen type I extracted from rat zzso Over 8-10 days, zzso contract translucent collagen zzso into opaque circular zzso structures that are approximately 10 zzso in diameter and 1 zzso zzso To determine zzso zzso samples are cut from each zzso zzso and zzso of each sample is measured by zzso Over 17 experiments, zzso of multiple samples is found to be related zzso to cell density in zzso with zzso zzso zzso corresponding to 0 zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with a physical model of zzso consisting of pores within a framework of type I zzso the cells and medium are within the zzso The model is most compatible with a relative pore area of zzso and a cell volume of zzso zzso zzso (the latter in agreement with published zzso zzso From these results, zzso is much more porous than zzso Although zzso has been recognized as a reasonable model of chronic wound healing, this zzso is zzso
