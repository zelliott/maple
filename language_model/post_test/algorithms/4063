A novel technique for real-time electroencephalogram zzso zzso is proposed in this zzso This technique makes use of the zzso between the different frequency zzso present in zzso segments of one zzso It uses discrete zzso transform zzso and dynamic reference lists to zzso and send the zzso zzso zzso Set zzso in zzso trees zzso is also used as source zzso Experimental results showed that the proposed method can not only compress zzso channels in one dimension zzso zzso but also detect zzso zzso A zzso performance assessment was performed to evaluate the performance of both the zzso and detection capabilities of the proposed zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso can positively detect seizure sections in the recordings at zzso down to 2 bits per zzso
