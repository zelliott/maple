Two zzso complexes bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared and zzso The crystal structures of both complexes were solved by X-ray zzso methods and found to match closely those of the corresponding zzso zzso The behavior in zzso solution of zzso and zzso was analyzed zzso The zzso zzso profiles resemble closely those of the related zzso and zzso zzso compounds, zzso It is observed that replacement of zzso with zzso a less basic zzso produces a significant decrease of the zzso exchange rates in the case of the zzso zzso The main zzso features of these zzso zzso complexes were determined and compared to those of zzso and zzso Moreover, some preliminary data were obtained on their biological zzso zzso both complexes exhibit higher zzso toward serum zzso than toward calf zzso zzso zzso is negligible in line with zzso A more extensive characterization of the pharmacological properties in zzso is presently in zzso
