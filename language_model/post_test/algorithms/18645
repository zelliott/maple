zzso zzso is a novel basis for generating tissue zzso However, it suffers from sensitivity to B1 zzso First, zzso with a zzso varying B1 causes zzso artifacts and second, spin zzso with an zzso B1 results in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we overcome the former complication with a specially designed zzso pulse sequence and we successfully obtain zzso images with a surface zzso In this pulse zzso the zzso pulse was divided into segments of equal duration and alternating zzso This zzso zzso pulse sequence was analyzed and the effect of an zzso B1 field was simulated using the Bloch zzso zzso MR images of a phantom and a human knee joint in zzso were obtained on a clinical scanner with a surface zzso to demonstrate the utility of the pulse zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence resulted in substantially reduced image artifacts compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
