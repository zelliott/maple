This paper presents a study of zzso zzso methods for rendering zzso volume zzso zzso zzso is necessary for rendering shaded zzso and zzso highlights, which provide important cues for shape and zzso zzso zzso has been widely studied and deployed for zzso volume data to achieve local zzso effects, but has been, otherwise, for zzso zzso As a result, most of the zzso volume zzso made so far were zzso In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of zzso zzso methods for zzso zzso with respect to their cost and zzso Through a number of zzso we discuss the effects of mesh quality and zzso function complexity in the accuracy of the zzso and their impact in zzso volume zzso Based on our study, we also propose two zzso improvements to the zzso reconstruction zzso The first zzso improves the rendering quality with a hybrid zzso that combines the results of the multiple reconstruction methods, based on the properties of a given zzso The second zzso improves the efficiency of its zzso zzso by restricting the zzso of the zzso on a zzso local zzso
