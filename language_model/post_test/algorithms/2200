In Part I, a systematic approach to closing loop design for use in continuous arch wires is zzso The design process uses zzso zzso to derive equations for zzso ratio zzso in terms of loop zzso The equations are used to zzso designs by zzso zzso to produce tooth movement via zzso Further refinements are performed with finite element simulations of zzso In Part II, predicted results are verified zzso The result of this process is a new design, the Opus loop, which is capable of delivering a zzso target zzso within the range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso without adding residual moments via twist or zzso zzso zzso zzso anywhere in the arch wire or loop before zzso The resulting precise force systems delivered with zzso zzso can move groups of teeth more accurately to achieve predetermined zzso treatment goals for zzso and/or zzso In Part II the experimental results show that the zzso must be bent accurately to achieve their design zzso The negative impact on zzso of various zzso changes to the loop design are zzso Experimental data are presented illustrating the improved performance of the new design over standard available zzso Suggested applications of the design for varying zzso requirements are zzso along with a case report in which rigorous zzso requirements were zzso
