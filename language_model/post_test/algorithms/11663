zzso zzso zzso associated with chronic liver disease zzso from zzso zzso and early zzso to a progressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within early zzso represents the transition from early to progressed zzso and, therefore, is useful in molecular genetic analysis of zzso progression during zzso zzso We compared expression profiles among 7 early components and 7 progressed components of zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso liver zzso with zzso zzso Of the approximately zzso genes that were zzso a set of 95 genes provided a molecular signature that distinguished between early zzso components and their zzso liver zzso and a set of 92 genes distinguished between progressed and early zzso zzso Of these zzso the most abundantly zzso gene in early zzso components zzso zzso was zzso protein 70 zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso confirmed this zzso Further zzso examination of zzso revealed its significant zzso in early zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and in progressed zzso compared with early zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, molecular signatures were clearly different in zzso liver tissue as compared with the early and progressed components of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could be a sensitive marker for the differential diagnosis of early zzso from zzso zzso or zzso liver, a difficult distinction for zzso due to very well differentiated zzso with little zzso in early zzso
