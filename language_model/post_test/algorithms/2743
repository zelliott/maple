zzso is the occurrence of zzso that are identical by state but not by zzso It arises through a number of means including zzso and reverse evolution, and horizontal gene zzso When using molecular markers that are based on sequences possessing a finite number of character states, such as zzso or zzso this is an unavoidable zzso Here we discuss the extent of zzso and its impact on zzso drawn from zzso and zzso in zzso studies of zzso To further explore this problem, we developed a computer simulation model combining the processes of zzso and zzso Our results show that while the extent of zzso is not zzso its effect on the proportion of zzso clustered zzso zzso is likely to be relatively low for zzso For zzso zzso occurs at a low rate provided the number of zzso used is high and the zzso rate is relatively zzso However, deep zzso zzso using zzso or zzso with a small number of zzso are likely to be zzso
