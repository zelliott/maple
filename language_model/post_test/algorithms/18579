The three-dimensional quantitative zzso relationship zzso technique of comparative molecular field analysis zzso has demonstrated the ability to provide accurate predictions for diverse chemical compounds when trained with molecules of diverse chemical zzso Although zzso the derivation and zzso of models of this type are quite zzso and person power zzso It is this intensity that zzso limits the widespread zzso of these models as zzso zzso In this study, two newer zzso techniques were evaluated as possible alternatives to zzso based zzso models for the purpose of rapidly identifying zzso zzso zzso from diverse collections of zzso The first of these is zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular fingerprints as zzso in conjunction with partial least squares zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso technique demonstrated the ability to rapidly develop zzso models independent of the intense user input zzso geometry zzso zzso analysis, and molecular zzso were not zzso Second, a newly developed zzso paradigm that zzso zzso Design Limited zzso zzso keys zzso as zzso in combination with an evolutionary algorithm, Fast Random zzso of zzso zzso was zzso By utilizing the zzso algorithm, a simple zzso zzso model was derived that was comparable in statistical zzso and zzso ability to both zzso and zzso derived zzso A comparison of the utility of these three approaches as zzso tools for the rapid identification of zzso zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso as assessed by model zzso ability will be zzso
