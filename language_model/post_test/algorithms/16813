In quantitative investigations of mechanical and chemical surface parameters using atomic force zzso zzso techniques the determination of the probe radius and shape is zzso To the most favorable methods of the zzso characterization belongs the blind tip reconstruction method zzso The zzso similar to many other inverse problems is sensitive to noise and needs the so-called zzso zzso In this article we describe and investigate two the most popular zzso schemes, which were proposed in zzso et zzso (1997) zzso and zzso et zzso zzso zzso We have shown that the procedure described in zzso et zzso zzso zzso enables very effective probe shape reconstruction if we know the statistics of noise present in the zzso zzso The increase of effectiveness with relation to the procedure described in zzso (1997) zzso is so significant that makes it possible to reconstruct zzso with much larger zzso We have also noticed the fact, that zzso reconstructed by means of the procedure presented in zzso et zzso zzso zzso have flat zzso for zzso images with low signal to noise ratio zzso We propose zzso which can improve the probe zzso zzso It uses the zzso image to estimate the initial shape of the reconstructed zzso This shape may be further improved by the zzso zzso We have shown that it is possible only for the procedure described in zzso et zzso zzso zzso
