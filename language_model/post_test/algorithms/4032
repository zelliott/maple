A small fraction of cells in many bacterial zzso called zzso are much less sensitive to zzso treatment than the zzso zzso are in a dormant zzso state, even while remaining genetically identical to the actively growing zzso zzso and antitoxin zzso in bacteria are believed to be one possible cause of zzso A zzso zzso zzso is one of many zzso zzso toxin and antitoxin zzso in zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso was the first validated zzso zzso Here, we present a zzso model that can generate zzso of the zzso system, via the zzso zzso of free zzso to the cellular growth zzso The actively growing state and the dormant state each zzso to a stable state of this zzso zzso enable transitions from one to the zzso This model is fully in agreement with experimental data obtained with synthetic promoter zzso
