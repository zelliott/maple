The mass balance equation of a zzso system using a zzso moving phase has been compiled for mass flow of the mobile phase instead of traditional zzso flow allowing solution of the equation in an zzso zzso The relation obtained zzso retention volume measured under ambient conditions with the partition zzso of the zzso Compared to the relation in the ideal zzso system the equation derived contains an additional correction term accounting for the zzso of the moving zzso When the retention volume is measured under the mean column pressure and column temperature the correction term is reduced to unit and the relation is simplified to those known for the ideal zzso This volume according to International Union of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is called the corrected retention zzso
