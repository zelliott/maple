zzso have been developed for the calculation of zzso transfer electron zzso resonance zzso zzso of a zzso zzso assuming zzso zzso zzso a model that is frequently used to describe the global zzso dynamics of large integral membrane zzso One zzso explicitly includes terms describing zzso zzso effects, whereas the second more rapid zzso treats these effects approximately using modified electron zzso and zzso relaxation zzso zzso are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso to the rate of zzso zzso diffusion and the orientation of the zzso probe with respect to the diffusion zzso zzso obtained by using the zzso zzso which are based on the zzso zzso are in close agreement with those obtained by using an zzso expansion zzso The effects of various approximations used in the simulation zzso are considered in zzso zzso the zzso zzso to model zzso zzso diffusion results in over an order of magnitude reduction in zzso time while allowing treatment of zzso A- and zzso The zzso presented here are used to perform zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso of the zzso exchange protein of the human zzso zzso band 3, which has been affinity zzso with a recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that all copies of band 3 present in intact zzso undergo zzso diffusion about the membrane normal axis at a rate consistent with a band 3 zzso
