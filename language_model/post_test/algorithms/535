A discrete model provides a useful framework for zzso to understand the interactions between growing zzso and other biological zzso A cellular zzso zzso model with domain growth, cell zzso and cell zzso based on cellular exclusion zzso is developed zzso Average zzso can be defined from the CA model and a zzso representation can be zzso The domain growth mechanism in the CA model gives rise to a zzso equation in the corresponding zzso model, with a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso models derived from conservation laws do not include this zzso zzso The new zzso term arises because of the zzso inherited from the CA mechanism for domain zzso We extend the models to multiple species and investigate the influence of the flux terms arising from the exclusion zzso The averaged CA agent zzso are well zzso by the solution of zzso zzso zzso provided that the relative size of the proliferation processes to the diffusion processes is sufficiently zzso This dual approach provides an understanding of the microscopic and zzso scales in a zzso zzso
