Although zzso association studies have led to the identifications of hundreds of genes underlying dozens of traits in recent years, most published studies have primarily used single zzso zzso zzso more information may be zzso when multiple markers are jointly zzso zzso many methods have been proposed in the literature for association analysis between traits and multiple zzso Among these methods, simulation and real data analyses have shown that it is often more effective to reduce the zzso of the markers in a region through principal components analysis of all the markers first, and then to perform association analysis between traits and those principal components that account for most of the genetic variations in the zzso However, one major limitation of this approach is that the principal components are derived purely from marker zzso without consideration of their relevance to zzso Furthermore, these components are constructed as linear combinations of all the markers even when only a limited number are potentially relevant to zzso In this zzso we propose the use of sparse partial zzso zzso to derive the components that are linear combinations of only relevant zzso This approach is able to use information from both traits and marker zzso zzso simulations and real data analyses on a Crohn's disease data set suggest the superiority of this approach over existing zzso
