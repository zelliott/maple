zzso zzso coupled with database search software allows the identification of a large number of peptides in a single zzso However, some existing search zzso such as zzso use score functions that are designed primarily to identify the best zzso for a given zzso zzso when comparing identifications across zzso the zzso score function zzso fails to discriminate accurately between correct and incorrect zzso zzso Several machine learning methods have been proposed to address the resulting zzso task of distinguishing between correct and incorrect zzso matches zzso A recent example is zzso which uses zzso learning and a decoy database search strategy to learn to distinguish between correct and incorrect zzso identified by a database search zzso The current work describes three improvements to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is replaced with a clear objective function, with intuitive reasons behind its zzso zzso zzso zzso models are used instead of linear models, leading to improved accuracy over the original zzso zzso A method, zzso for directly zzso the number of identified zzso at a specified zzso value is proposed, which achieves further zzso
