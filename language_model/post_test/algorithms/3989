It is known that the number of transplanted cells has a significant impact on the outcome after zzso We identify issues that cannot be addressed by conventional analysis of clinical trials and ask whether it is possible to develop a refined analysis to conclude about the outcome of individual patients given clinical trial zzso To accomplish this, we propose an interdisciplinary approach based on mathematical zzso We devise and zzso a mathematical model of short-term zzso and simulate treatment of large patient groups with random zzso zzso Relating model simulations to clinical data allows zzso the effect of transplant size on zzso time in the terms of patient populations and individual zzso The model confirms the existence of lower bounds on cell dose necessary for secure and efficient zzso but suggests that for some patient zzso higher thresholds might be zzso zzso demonstrate that relative time gain because of increased cell dose is an zzso zzso zzso in other words that slowly zzso patients profit more from transplant zzso than average zzso We propose a simple mathematical formula to approximate the effect of changes of transplant size on zzso zzso
