The purpose of this study was to develop a preliminary decision zzso predicting functional performance outcomes to aid in the decision of when to undergo total knee zzso zzso One hundred and zzso patients undergoing primary unilateral zzso were evaluated before and 6 months after zzso A zzso tree analysis using a zzso zzso function was performed with the Timed Up and Go zzso time, zzso Walk zzso distance, and zzso zzso Test zzso time as measured 6 months after zzso as the primary zzso zzso measures of functional performance, joint performance, zzso zzso and zzso status were evaluated as zzso of the primary outcomes 6 months after zzso zzso taking zzso s on the zzso and aged 72 years or older before surgery had the poorest performance on the zzso 6 months after zzso zzso walking zzso meters on the zzso before surgery had the poorest performance on the zzso test 6 months after zzso zzso taking zzso s to complete the zzso and scoring zzso on the zzso mental component score before surgery had the poorest performance on the zzso 6 months after zzso Poorer performance preoperatively on the zzso zzso and zzso was related to poorer performance in the same measure after zzso Age and decreased mental health were secondary zzso of poorer performance at 6 months on the zzso and zzso zzso These measures may help further develop models predicting thresholds for poor outcomes after zzso
