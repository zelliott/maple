The purpose of this study was to compare the Precision Imaging zzso technique zzso Medical Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with conventional zzso of liver zzso in terms of zzso zzso margin zzso overall image quality, and zzso zzso 

zzso focal liver zzso in 60 patients (age range, zzso years; mean age, 43 zzso were zzso zzso Each zzso was examined with Precision Imaging and conventional zzso All images were reviewed and graded on a 3-point scale by 2 readers for zzso zzso margin zzso and overall image zzso zzso acoustic enhancement was also analyzed in zzso zzso A zzso signed rank test was used for statistical comparisons of the techniques for all zzso 

zzso analysis showed that for margin zzso zzso zzso and overall image quality, Precision Imaging was superior to conventional zzso zzso zzso In addition, according to zzso types and dimensions, Precision Imaging was significantly superior to conventional zzso for all zzso For zzso enhancement, there was no significant difference between Precision Imaging and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso of focal liver zzso Precision Imaging provides better zzso zzso better margin zzso and better overall image quality than conventional zzso With respect to zzso enhancement of zzso zzso Precision Imaging is not significantly different from conventional zzso Precision Imaging may be used as a complementary method in the zzso evaluation of focal liver zzso
