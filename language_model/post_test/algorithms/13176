zzso chaos expansions represent a powerful tool to simulate zzso models of zzso zzso Yet, zzso the zzso zzso for complex systems might require a significant and zzso manipulation of the model, or the zzso of large numbers of simulation runs, rendering the approach too time consuming and zzso for applications with more than a handful of random zzso We introduce a zzso zzso technique for computing the zzso of zzso chaos zzso The approach exploits a zzso technique with a particular choice of weighting zzso which allows to take into account the specific features of zzso chaos zzso The method, completely based on convex zzso can be applied to problems with a large number of random variables and uses a modest number of zzso Carlo simulations, while avoiding model zzso Additional information on the zzso process, when available, can be also incorporated in the approach by means of convex zzso We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in three applications in diverse fields, including the analysis of a zzso electric circuit, a chaotic model of organizational behavior, and finally a chemical zzso
