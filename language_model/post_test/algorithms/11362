zzso automatically encodes gene regulatory networks derived from several zzso tools in systems biology zzso zzso Providing a zzso user zzso the networks can be zzso via the simple object access protocol zzso application programming interface of zzso Central zzso and minimum information required in the zzso of models zzso Additionally, we provide an zzso which processes the output of supported zzso zzso and automatically passes all required parameters to zzso zzso zzso closes a gap in the processing pipeline between the zzso of gene regulatory networks and their subsequent analysis, zzso and zzso 

zzso is freely available under the zzso Public zzso version 3 and can be downloaded from zzso 

General information on zzso examples and tutorials are available at the zzso web zzso
