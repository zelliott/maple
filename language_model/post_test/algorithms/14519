The zzso performance of a zzso zzso produced from a combined zzso and zzso technique was examined for the removal of zzso from contaminated zzso The effect of physical and chemical parameters such as initial zzso contact time, initial zzso concentration and temperature were zzso The results indicated that the equilibrium zzso data followed both the zzso and zzso zzso with a maximum zzso zzso capacity of zzso at zzso In addition, the kinetic studies have shown that the zzso zzso data followed a zzso order model and that the zzso diffusion process played a significant role in determining the zzso The zzso analysis also established that the zzso process was zzso and zzso The initial and final zzso loaded zzso samples were characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analysis revealed that structural changes to the zzso had taken zzso
