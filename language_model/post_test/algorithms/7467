We propose a novel global zzso approach to zzso a given zzso prostate zzso magnetic resonance zzso image, which zzso the inherent zzso symmetry of the prostate shape and simultaneously performs a sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a global zzso zzso zzso We show that the proposed challenging zzso zzso problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex zzso With this regard, we introduce a novel coupled continuous zzso model, which is dual to the studied convex relaxed zzso zzso and leads to an efficient zzso zzso zzso based on the modern convex zzso zzso Moreover, the new continuous zzso based zzso was implemented on zzso to achieve a substantial improvement in zzso Experimental results using public and in-house zzso demonstrate great advantages of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and zzso
