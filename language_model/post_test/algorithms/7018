We describe a method for generating a molecular surface using a zzso patch zzso Unlike previous methods, this zzso generates a zzso patch surface which is smooth and G continuous and zzso in zzso zzso to our approach is the creation of a net of approximately zzso zzso from which we generate the control points used as the basis for describing the zzso We present in detail the method used for generating the triangular net and accompanying control points, along with examples of the resulting zzso
