Controlled cortical impact zzso injury, a model of zzso brain injury in humans, is being used with increasing frequency in mice to investigate post-traumatic cell damage and death and to evaluate treatment zzso Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial zzso it is important to zzso a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury zzso Adult male zzso mice were zzso and subjected to sham injury zzso zzso zzso or zzso injury at either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depth of impact at a zzso of 5 zzso At 2 days, zzso mice exhibited significant memory zzso zzso zzso and motor function zzso zzso zzso deficits compared to zzso zzso zzso mice subjected to an impact of zzso zzso were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cortical zzso increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell loss was observed in the zzso and zzso regions in both groups, and in the zzso and zzso zzso cell layers in the zzso zzso zzso Regional patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the zzso zzso zzso Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso specific changes in the zzso Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and zzso cell zzso
