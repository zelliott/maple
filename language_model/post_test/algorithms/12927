A zzso optical zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso has been developed based on a zzso zzso scanner by using a zzso scan strategy for a better scan zzso A compact zzso zzso was zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso with quartered zzso in combination with a resonant fiber zzso A zzso weight was attached to the fiber zzso to reduce the resonance frequency down to 63 zzso well in the desirable range for zzso zzso The zzso scanner was driven at zzso zzso that were well out of the resonance peak but within a range of partial zzso This driving strategy has been found to minimize the phase difference between the two scan axes for a better scan stability against environmental zzso as well as for a driving zzso By driving the two axes at slightly different zzso a zzso zzso pattern has been obtained for a zzso area zzso zzso zzso images have been successfully acquired in an acquisition time of zzso seconds for a zzso volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They were reconstructed without any scan zzso by zzso the scan timing from the image zzso In addition, it has been found that the zzso scan strategy provides a means to compensate the relative zzso motion of a sample for a correct zzso zzso
