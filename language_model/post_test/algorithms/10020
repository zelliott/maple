We study the existence and stability of localized modes in the two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso equation with a zzso zzso zzso Using the corresponding zzso zzso we trace the zzso evolution of the trapped stationary zzso starting from the linear limit, and thus derive a complete zzso zzso for families of the stationary zzso This provides the picture of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the fundamental zzso zzso In a broad zzso region, the predictions based on the zzso decomposition are found to be in good agreement with full zzso solutions of the zzso zzso zzso properties of the stationary states coincide with those suggested by the corresponding discrete model in the zzso zzso The dynamics of unstable modes is explored by means of direct zzso Finally, in addition to the full analysis for the case of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso for the case of zzso is briefly considered zzso
