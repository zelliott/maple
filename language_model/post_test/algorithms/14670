In an zzso zzso study, patients with mean sitting zzso blood pressure zzso between zzso zzso at baseline received zzso treatment with CAN zzso 25 zzso 1), followed - in patients whose zzso was not controlled - by zzso treatment with zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso The zzso change between weeks 4 and 8 was the primary zzso The zzso zzso is zzso
