Parallel zzso zzso digital zzso is a technique for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and requires only the intensity distribution of the reference wave and spatial two zzso zzso We constructed a system of parallel zzso zzso digital zzso and zzso demonstrated the technique, for the first zzso The system uses an originally zzso image sensor having an array of 2 zzso 1 zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was attached on zzso by zzso In the experiment, the unwanted images, the zzso zzso wave and the zzso image, are removed from the reconstructed image of objects by the system, while the images zzso on the image of objects reconstructed by zzso transform zzso Also the capability of zzso and three-dimensional imaging is demonstrated by the zzso
