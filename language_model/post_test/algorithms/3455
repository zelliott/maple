zzso stem zzso cells have attracted much attention as a possible source of functional cells for zzso zzso zzso use of zzso cells requires control over the types and zzso of cells generated during their in zzso zzso Due to the complexity of factors that impact upon zzso cell zzso novel approaches for the zzso of zzso development are zzso This motivates our use of zzso and composite design methods to make empirical investigations more efficient, and to reveal unexpected interactions missed by conventional zzso zzso zzso experiments would benefit from the high content evaluation of a large number of test conditions, zzso the development of a quantitative screening technology zzso capable of reporting the absolute number and frequency of target zzso We have developed and validated such a technology for zzso cell differentiation analysis using automated zzso zzso employing zzso differentiation as a model zzso To test this platform, a zzso zzso experiment was carried out to identify major and interactive effects of zzso insulin, zzso acid zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso on zzso zzso zzso was found to have zzso effects on zzso formation, while low zzso proved zzso zzso was demonstrated to be a powerful tool to study factors zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and should be zzso to the analysis of a range of zzso zzso zzso
