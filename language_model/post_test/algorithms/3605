The zzso method of zzso and zzso (1999) and the maximum likelihood method developed from the work of Nielsen and Yang zzso are two widely used methods for detecting positive selection in zzso protein coding zzso Both methods consider an excess of zzso zzso zzso as evidence for positive zzso Previously published simulation studies comparing the performance of the two methods show contradictory zzso Here we conduct a more thorough simulation study to cover and extend the zzso space used in previous zzso We also zzso an zzso data set that was previously proposed to cause problems when analyzed using the maximum likelihood zzso Our new simulations and a zzso of the zzso data demonstrate that the maximum likelihood method has good power and accuracy in detecting positive selection over a wide range of zzso zzso Previous studies reporting poor performance of the method appear to be due to zzso problems in the zzso zzso and did not reflect the true performance of the zzso The zzso method has a very low rate of false zzso but very little power for detecting positive selection or identifying positively selected zzso
