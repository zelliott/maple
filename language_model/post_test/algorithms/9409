Large continuous flow zzso are often under the influence of noise in the feed zzso Prior removal of noise is done by filters based either on specific zzso or on artificial zzso Neither method is zzso zzso filters combine both methods and thereby capitalize on their strengths while minimizing their zzso In this study, a number of hybrid models have been compared for their ability to recover nearly zzso stable zzso of continuous flow zzso zzso cultures from zzso behavior caused by noise in the feed zzso Each hybrid filter had a different neural network in conjunction with an extended Kalman filter zzso The choice of the best zzso depended on the performance zzso All hybrid filters were superior to both the zzso and purely neural zzso Along with previous studies of zzso zzso the present results establish the suitability of hybrid neural filters for zzso zzso
