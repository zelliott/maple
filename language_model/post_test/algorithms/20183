A framework and an zzso are presented in order to remove stationary noise from zzso This zzso is called zzso stationary noise zzso It can be interpreted both as a restoration method in a zzso framework and as a zzso decomposition zzso In numerous zzso applications, the white noise assumption zzso For example, structured patterns such as stripes appear in the zzso The model described here addresses these zzso zzso are presented with images acquired using different zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and an emerging zzso zzso technique called selective plane zzso zzso
