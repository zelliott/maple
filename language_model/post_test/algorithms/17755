A new hybrid event based control architecture for zzso systems controlled through the Internet is proposed in this zzso Different from the traditional event based control method, the new framework does not require every part of the system to be strictly event zzso Instead, it allows time referenced control components to be integrated into this zzso which makes it more convenient to develop Internet based control zzso Since there are two reference zzso time and event, in this architecture, how to coordinate these components with different references to keep the stability of the whole system is discussed in detail in this zzso To verify this new idea, an experiment was conducted to control the end zzso of a zzso robot tracking a continuous state trajectory given zzso by the remote zzso Experimental results confirmed the stability of such systems being controlled through the Internet in zzso
