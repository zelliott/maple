The brain appears to adhere to two fundamental principles of functional zzso functional integration and functional zzso where the integration within and among zzso areas is zzso by effective zzso In this paper, we review two different approaches to zzso effective connectivity from zzso data, structural equation models zzso and dynamic zzso models zzso In common to both approaches are model comparison zzso in which zzso can be made about effective connectivity per zzso and about how that connectivity can be changed by zzso or cognitive zzso zzso the two approaches, however, are two very different zzso zzso In zzso a distinction is made between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Experimental zzso cause changes in effective connectivity expressed at the level of zzso which in turn cause changes in the observed zzso In zzso changes in effective connectivity lead directly to changes in the zzso structure of the observed zzso Because changes in effective connectivity in the brain occur at a zzso level zzso is the preferred model for zzso zzso This review focuses on the underlying assumptions and limitations of each model and demonstrates their application to data from a study of attention to visual zzso
