DNA zzso are an experimental technology which consists in zzso of thousands of discrete DNA sequences that are printed on glass microscope zzso Image analysis is an important aspect of zzso zzso The aim of this step is to reduce an image of spots into a table with a measure of the intensity for each zzso zzso accurate and automatic analysis of DNA spot images is essential in order to use this technology in laboratory zzso 

We present an automatic zzso set of zzso for a fast and accurate spot data extraction from DNA zzso using zzso operators which are robust to both intensity variation and zzso The approach can be zzso as zzso Initially, a zzso zzso yields the automatic zzso of the zzso image into spot zzso which are later individually zzso Then the analysis of the spot zzso images is achieved in five zzso First, a zzso the spot size distribution law is zzso Second, the background noise extraction is performed using a zzso filtering by zzso Third, an zzso grid provides the first approach to the spot zzso Fourth, the spot zzso or spot boundaries definition is carried out using the watershed zzso And zzso the outline of detected spots allows the signal zzso or spot zzso zzso in this respect, a noise model has been zzso The performance of the zzso has been compared with two zzso zzso and zzso showing its zzso and zzso
