In this paper, we present the application of a zzso inverse method for determining material parameters of biological zzso The approach is based on the successive response surface method, and is illustrated by fitting zzso parameters to two zzso zzso zzso zzso one for zzso zzso and zzso wall, the other for zzso valve zzso zzso test data for the zzso zzso consisted of two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso test data for the zzso valve was obtained from a dynamic inflation zzso In each case, a zzso simulation of the experiment was performed and predictions were compared to the real zzso For the zzso test zzso the experimental targets were force at a measured zzso For the inflation test, the experimental targets were the three-dimensional coordinates of material markers at a given zzso For both sets of zzso predictions with zzso parameters showed excellent agreement with the data, and we found that the method was able to consistently identify model zzso We believe the method will find wide application in biomedical material characterization and in diagnostic zzso
