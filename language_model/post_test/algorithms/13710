Partner studies are useful for zzso the transmission probabilities of infectious zzso However, it is often not known which partner was the source of the infection (the index zzso The objective of this paper is to develop statistical methods for analyzing partner studies when it is uncertain which partners acquired the infection from sources outside the zzso The approach involves simultaneously zzso the probability of acquisition of infection from outside the partnership, and the probability of transmission within the partnership as a function of zzso An zzso zzso is zzso Efficiency and simulation results are given in some special situations involving zzso transmission zzso In zzso partner studies, the methods depend zzso on the availability of a zzso that provides information about which partner was the likely source of zzso
