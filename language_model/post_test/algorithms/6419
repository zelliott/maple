zzso of genes into clusters according to their expression levels is important for zzso biological information, zzso on gene functions based on zzso and other related zzso The paper introduces the selection of the number of clusters based on the minimum description length zzso principle for the selection of the number of clusters in gene expression zzso The main feature of the new method is the ability to evaluate in a fast way the number of clusters according to the sound zzso principle, without exhaustive evaluations over all possible partitions of the gene zzso The zzso method can be used in conjunction with various zzso zzso A recent zzso zzso using principal component analysis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be modified to make use of the new zzso zzso method, replacing the Gap statistics originally used in zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso is shown to perform better than zzso and zzso zzso expectation zzso in the simulations using artificial zzso The proposed method is applied to zzso differentiation data, and the resulting clusters are compared with those found by zzso maps zzso
