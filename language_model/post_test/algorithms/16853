zzso effects are ubiquitous in real world zzso In many settings, the observed signals are a mixture of underlying stationary and zzso sources that cannot be measured zzso For example, in zzso analysis, zzso on the scalp record the activity from several sources located inside the brain, which one could only measure zzso Discerning stationary and zzso contributions is an important step towards uncovering the mechanisms of the data generating zzso To that end, in zzso zzso Analysis zzso the observed signal is modeled as a linear zzso of stationary and zzso sources, where the aim is to separate the two groups in the zzso In this paper, we propose the first zzso zzso that has a closed form zzso The novel method, Analytic zzso zzso is more than 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art, zzso stable, and guaranteed to be optimal when the zzso between stationary and zzso sources is zzso In zzso simulations on wide range of settings, we show that our method yields superior results, even for signals with zzso zzso zzso In an application to zzso data analysis, zzso extracts meaningful components that shed new light on the zzso 2 zzso of the zzso zzso
