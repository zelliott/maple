Data from the alkaline zzso zzso form were collected at a resolution of zzso A using an in-house X-ray source zzso K zzso By using different fragments of zzso from the model solved by zzso zzso means, the zzso program zzso was used to arrive at the complete zzso Attempts have been made to use various percentages of input phasing information from these zzso The minimum input phasing required in feeding the fragments was about zzso of the whole zzso The zzso obtained from zzso were of superb quality, allowing automated model building to be carried out using zzso zzso manual model building was required and the structure determination was completed using the zzso refinement program zzso The whole process, starting from the running of zzso and ending with the refined model, took nearly 15 h of CPU time using a zzso III zzso
