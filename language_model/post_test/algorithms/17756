Suppose zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two independent sequences with distribution functions zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the combination of zzso and zzso with a probability zzso for each i with zzso The extreme value distribution zzso of this particular triangular array of the zzso random variables zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso We found a new form of the extreme value zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are not zzso It occurs if zzso and zzso belong to the same zzso or zzso
