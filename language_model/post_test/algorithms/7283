zzso techniques are commonplace in medical image zzso due to their high performance and ease of zzso zzso weighting the contributions from the different zzso in the label fusion process can improve the quality of the zzso However, how to define these weights in a zzso way in zzso scenarios remains an open zzso Here we propose a label fusion scheme that does not require zzso intensity consistency between the zzso and the target image to zzso The method is based on a zzso model of image data in which each intensity in the zzso has an associated conditional distribution of corresponding zzso in the zzso The zzso is zzso using zzso expectation zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The method was evaluated with a zzso of eight zzso density weighted brain zzso scans with nine labeled structures of zzso The results show that the zzso zzso majority voting and a recently published zzso label fusion zzso
