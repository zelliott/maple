To examine an alternative to exclusion of apparently implausible data when examining the relationship of dietary energy density to total energy intake and of energy intake to body mass index zzso The objective is to show the advantages of retaining all available data but zzso based on level of energy zzso 

We examined 24-hour dietary recall data obtained from zzso adult participants (18 to 64 years old) in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The relationship of energy density to energy zzso and of energy intake to zzso was assessed using linear zzso models adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and zzso A sensitivity analysis was done to determine whether the relationship differed when generally accepted zzso criteria were zzso 

Although the relationship of energy density to energy intake is similar across a large range of energy zzso it differs at very low levels of energy zzso Energy intake is much less dependent on energy density at low zzso The relationship of energy intake to zzso is different at both high and low levels of zzso Furthermore, the nature of the relationship between zzso and energy intake differs based on reporting status zzso reported energy intake is consistent with energy expenditure zzso 

Instead of excluding observations based on energy zzso examining all the data but zzso by level of intake may be more zzso of population zzso zzso
