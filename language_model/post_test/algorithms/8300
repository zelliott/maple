This study was undertaken to determine what characteristics should be recorded on which days to build a zzso model for selection of Day 3 zzso 

zzso failing to form a clinical zzso or that formed a viable fetus (to zzso or zzso weeks), and transferred zzso zzso zzso zzso or in pairs zzso zzso zzso were scored for early zzso and zzso status on Day 1, and cell number, zzso and symmetry on Days 2 and 3, with number of zzso per zzso also recorded on Day zzso Seven candidate models were identified using a zzso clinical knowledge and zzso zzso Each model was fit on a zzso and evaluated on a zzso with zzso with discrimination assessed using the area under the zzso curve zzso and zzso assessed using the zzso zzso 

Models built using Day 1, 2 or 3 scores independently on the 30 zzso data sets showed that Day 1 evaluations provided the poorest zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso for Day 2 and zzso Combining information from Day 1, 2 and 3 marginally improved discrimination zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the final Day 3 model fitted on the whole zzso the median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso would be correctly classified with a zzso probability equal to zzso 

Day 2 or Day 3 evaluations alone are sufficient for zzso selection of zzso stage zzso The derived zzso zzso can be used zzso in an zzso to rank zzso for zzso
