One bottleneck in zzso structure determination lies in the zzso and time-consuming process of zzso resonance and zzso zzso Compared to the well-studied backbone resonance assignment problem, automated zzso resonance and zzso assignments are relatively less zzso Most zzso assignment zzso require nearly complete zzso resonance assignments from a series of zzso experiments such as zzso or zzso Unfortunately, these zzso experiments perform poorly on large zzso To overcome this zzso we present a novel algorithm, called zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to automate both zzso resonance and zzso assignments and to perform high-resolution protein structure determination in the absence of any explicit zzso experiment to facilitate zzso resonance assignment, such as zzso After casting the assignment problem into a zzso Random Field zzso zzso extends and applies zzso protein design zzso to zzso optimal assignments that best interpret the zzso zzso The zzso captures the contact map information of the protein derived from zzso zzso exploits the backbone structural information determined by zzso and considers all possible zzso zzso The complexity of the zzso search is reduced by using a dead-end elimination zzso algorithm, which zzso zzso resonance assignments that are zzso not part of the optimal zzso Then an zzso search zzso is employed to find a set of optimal zzso resonance assignments that best fit the zzso zzso These zzso resonance assignments are then used to resolve the zzso assignment ambiguity and zzso high-resolution protein zzso Tests on five proteins show that zzso assigns zzso for more than zzso of zzso zzso and achieves about zzso correct zzso The final structures zzso using the zzso distance restraints assigned by zzso have backbone zzso zzso from the reference structures determined by traditional zzso zzso
