zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging can zzso image deformation of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of tag data requires fitting a deformation model to tag lines in the image zzso In this paper, we present a zzso zzso displacement and strain reconstruction method based on a zzso deformation model defined in zzso zzso zzso which more closely matches the shape of the zzso wall than existing Cartesian or zzso coordinate zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso deformation model also zzso zzso across and can zzso strain at the zzso The zzso reconstruction zzso was evaluated on a previously published data set to allow head-to-head comparison of the zzso model with existing zzso deformation reconstruction zzso We conclude that the zzso method can accurately reconstruct deformation and strain in the zzso wall from zzso MR images and has several advantages relative to existing zzso
