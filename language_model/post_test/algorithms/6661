Event correlation between zzso in the coherent noise model is studied by making use of natural time, which has recently been introduced in complex zzso zzso It is found that the aging phenomenon and the associated zzso property discovered in the observed zzso data are well reproduced by the zzso It is also found that the zzso function is given by the zzso function appearing in zzso statistical mechanics, showing zzso zzso of event correlation in natural zzso
