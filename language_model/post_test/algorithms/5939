zzso water clusters are important molecular species to understand the nature of hydrogen bonded zzso zzso studies for the dynamics of triple zzso transfer in the zzso water zzso were zzso The potential energy surface zzso of triple zzso transfer is generated by the zzso molecular mechanics zzso zzso We have used the zzso level for high-level zzso zzso data zzso zzso and zzso which are used in the Shepard zzso Eight high-level reference points were added step by step, including two points for the critical zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso The more high-level points are used, the better the potential energy surfaces zzso The rate constant and kinetic isotope effect zzso for the triple zzso transfer at 300 K, which have been calculated by the zzso zzso zzso theory with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is very important not only for the triple zzso transfer but also for the triple zzso zzso The zzso results show good agreement with those from the direct zzso zzso dynamics zzso
