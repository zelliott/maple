Analysis of a major zzso zzso study of heart disease has required zzso of the zzso correlation of several zzso across zzso Because the zzso from each zzso were subject to sampling zzso the zzso product moment zzso of these correlations produces biased zzso This paper proposes a model that takes into account within and between zzso variation, provides zzso for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of these correlations and discusses several approaches for obtaining zzso zzso
