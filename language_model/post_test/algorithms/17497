This paper proposes a new zzso zzso Blind Signature scheme which is a cross between the traditional signature scheme and the blind signature zzso In this proposed zzso the message M that the zzso signed can be divided into two zzso The first part can be known to the zzso (like that in the traditional signature zzso while the other part cannot be known to the zzso (like that in the blind signature zzso After having signed M, the zzso cannot determine if he has made the signature of M except through the part that he zzso We draw ideas from zzso zzso Blind zzso to solve the zzso zzso Blind Signature zzso Our scheme is a zzso signature scheme and the security of our zzso zzso Blind Signature scheme relies on the difficulty of computing discrete zzso
