More than 300 air change rate experiments were completed in two occupied zzso a two-story detached house in Redwood City, CA, and a three-story townhouse in Reston, zzso A continuous monitor was used to measure the zzso of zzso zzso gas over periods of zzso zzso Each experiment first included a measurement of the air change rate with all exterior doors and windows closed zzso zzso then a measurement with the single change from State 0 conditions of opening one or more zzso The overall average State 0 air change rate was zzso air changes per hour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the California house and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the Virginia zzso zzso temperature differences appeared to be responsible for the variation at the Virginia house of zzso zzso when windows were zzso Opening a single window increased the State 0 air change rate by an amount roughly zzso to the zzso of the zzso reaching increments as high as zzso zzso in the California house and zzso zzso in the Virginia zzso Multiple window openings increased the air change rate by amounts ranging from zzso to zzso zzso in the California house and from zzso to zzso zzso in the Virginia zzso Compared with temperature differences and wind effects, opening windows produced the greatest increase in the air change rates measured in both zzso zzso of this study indicate the importance of occupant zzso behavior on a home's air change rate and the zzso need to incorporate this factor when zzso human exposure to indoor air zzso
