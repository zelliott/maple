Assessment of left zzso zzso capture is of paramount importance in patients with zzso zzso zzso Our goal was to identify zzso features that differentiate between zzso and right zzso zzso pacing in patients with zzso RV zzso 

The study enrolled 300 consecutive patients with zzso devices and zzso RV zzso and obtained from them zzso zzso with either zzso pacing zzso zzso zzso or zzso pacing zzso zzso zzso RV pacing served as a surrogate for loss of zzso zzso zzso from the first 150 patients were used to identify zzso features, and to construct an zzso to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the second 150 patients were used to validate the zzso 

The following zzso features typical of zzso pacing were zzso zzso in lead zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso dominant R in lead zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso in lead zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso The zzso based on those features was found to have an overall diagnostic accuracy of zzso a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso 

The study identified zzso features that were very specific for zzso pacing in patients with zzso RV zzso zzso arrangement of those features resulted in an zzso that was very accurate for zzso between zzso pacing and loss of zzso zzso
