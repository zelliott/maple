We describe a zzso profile correction technique for zzso zzso optical measurement of tissue zzso zzso and reduced scattering zzso zzso based on geometric correction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because the projection of structured light onto an object is the basis for both zzso zzso and modulated imaging, we were able to develop a single instrument capable of performing both zzso In so doing, the surface of the three-dimensional object could be acquired and used to extract the zzso optical zzso The optical properties of flat zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso optical properties were zzso with and without zzso zzso after vertical translation and tilting of the zzso at various zzso zzso having a complex shape, including a zzso silicone phantom and human fingers, were acquired and similarly zzso with vascular zzso of a finger being readily zzso through changes in its optical zzso Using zzso zzso the accuracy of extracted zzso and reduced scattering zzso improved from two- to zzso for surfaces having height variations as much as 3 zzso and tilt angles as high as 40 zzso These data lay the foundation for employing structured light for quantitative imaging during zzso
