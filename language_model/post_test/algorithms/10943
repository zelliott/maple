Cheng and Church zzso is an important approach in zzso zzso In this paper, the process of the extended space in the second stage of Cheng and Church zzso is improved and the selections of two important parameters are zzso The results of the improved zzso used in the gene expression spectrum analysis show that, compared with Cheng and Church algorithm, the quality of zzso results is enhanced obviously, the mining expression models are better, and the data possess a strong consistency with fluctuation on the condition while the zzso time does not increase zzso
