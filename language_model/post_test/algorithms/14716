We propose a data refinement and channel selection method for vapor zzso in a portable zzso zzso For the robust zzso system in a real environment, we propose to reduce the noise in the data measured by sensor zzso and distinguish the important part in the data by the use of feature zzso Experimental results on different volatile organic compounds data show that the proposed data refinement method gives good zzso for different classes and improves the zzso zzso Also, we design a new sensor array that consists only of the useful zzso For this purpose, each channel is evaluated by measuring its zzso power based on the feature mask used in the data zzso Through the experimental results, we show that the new sensor array improves both the zzso rates and the efficiency in zzso and data zzso
