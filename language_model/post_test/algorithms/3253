zzso factors acting within the zzso nerve head zzso likely play a role in the loss of vision that occurs in zzso In a companion paper zzso et zzso zzso we zzso the zzso environment within zzso zzso models reconstructed from human post zzso zzso Our goal in this manuscript was to use finite element modeling to investigate the influence of tissue material properties on zzso zzso in these same zzso zzso A sensitivity analysis was carried out by simulating the effects of changing zzso pressure on zzso zzso as tissue mechanical properties were systematically varied over ranges reported in the zzso This procedure was repeated for each zzso model described in the companion paper zzso et zzso zzso The outcome measures of the analysis were first and third principal zzso as well as the derived quantity of maximum zzso strain, in zzso zzso zzso zzso had by far the largest influence in zzso zzso and this result was remarkably consistent across zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and pia mater were also zzso These results are consistent with those obtained using generic zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso neural tissue influenced zzso and zzso zzso Overall, tissue material properties had a much greater influence on zzso zzso than did tissue zzso as assessed by comparing results between our zzso zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso particularly of the zzso zzso play a dominant role in the mechanical response of an zzso to acute changes in zzso and may be important in the zzso of zzso We need to better understand zzso differences in zzso zzso properties and whether they are clinically zzso
