Although molecular dynamics methods are commonly used to drive zzso simulations, the technique provides insufficient sampling to impact studies of the zzso zzso proteins of greatest zzso One severe limitation of molecular dynamics is that the zzso are restricted by resonance phenomena to small time steps zzso zzso zzso much slower then the time scales of important structural and zzso zzso Here, a novel set of equations of motion and a zzso zzso zzso are designed which permit step sizes on the order of 100 zzso to be zzso
