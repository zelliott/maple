Development of a method for retrospective assessment of exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso organic zzso zzso aromatic zzso and zzso to known or suspected lung zzso for a zzso zzso study of lung cancer mortality among European asphalt zzso 

Company questionnaires and structured questionnaires used in interviews and zzso zzso zzso zzso were elaborated and zzso Three sources of information were eventually used for exposure assessment and zzso zzso data obtained in cohort phase, zzso data from living subjects, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso exposure by inhalation and via skin and zzso to known or suspected lung zzso within and outside cohort zzso zzso and zzso exposure estimates for zzso were adjusted for time trends, time spent in a job, and other zzso of exposure zzso oil gravel zzso Clothing patterns, personal protective devices, and personal hygiene were taken into consideration while zzso zzso zzso 

Occupational zzso could be assessed for 433 cases and zzso controls for relevant time zzso Only zzso of work histories were spent inside original asphalt and construction zzso A total of zzso of job periods in cohort companies could be coded at a more detailed zzso zzso of work time and zzso zzso zzso was needed for zzso of work history zzso Overall, downward trends in exposure were present and differences existed between countries and zzso As expected, correlations were strongest zzso zzso zzso among zzso agents, while correlations between coal zzso zzso agents, and established lung zzso were weaker zzso zzso zzso 

A systematic and detailed approach was developed to estimate inhalation and zzso exposure for a zzso zzso study among asphalt zzso
