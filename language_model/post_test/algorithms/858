zzso limits the effectiveness of zzso but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain incompletely zzso zzso geometry and expansion during deployment produce zzso in vascular anatomy that may adversely affect wall zzso stress zzso and correlate with zzso zzso These considerations have been neglected in previous zzso fluid dynamics models of zzso zzso Thus we tested the hypothesis that deployment diameter and zzso zzso properties zzso number, zzso and zzso influence indexes of zzso predicted with three-dimensional zzso fluid zzso zzso were based on canine coronary artery diameter zzso zzso ratios of zzso or zzso were zzso and zzso vessels containing four or eight zzso of two zzso zzso or zzso zzso and two thicknesses zzso or zzso zzso subjected to an inlet zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and spatial zzso zzso were calculated and expressed as a percentage of the zzso and vessel zzso zzso zzso thickness caused regions subjected to low zzso zzso zzso to decrease by approximately zzso zzso the number of zzso produced a zzso increase in exposure to low zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused a modest increase in the area of the vessel experiencing low zzso Use of a zzso deployment ratio increased exposure to low zzso by zzso compared with zzso implanted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a modest reduction in the area of the vessel subjected to elevated zzso zzso but values were similar for the other zzso The results suggest that zzso designs that reduce zzso number and thickness are less likely to subject the vessel to zzso of zzso associated with zzso zzso
