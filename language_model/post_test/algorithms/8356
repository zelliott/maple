zzso gene identification by sequence inspection remains a challenging zzso For a typical zzso zzso gene with five zzso at least one of the zzso is expected to have at least one of its borders predicted incorrectly by zzso zzso gene finding zzso More detailed analysis for individual zzso zzso can often resolve the uncertainty on the basis of zzso evidence or similarity to potential protein zzso Such methods are part of the routine zzso zzso However, because the zzso and protein databases are constantly growing, in many cases original zzso must be zzso extended, and corrected on the basis of the latest zzso The zzso Genome Initiative is zzso this task on the zzso scale via its participating zzso zzso The current zzso zzso zzso provides an excellent starting point for assessing the protein repertoire of a flowering zzso More accurate zzso zzso will require the combination of zzso and individual gene experimental approaches and zzso zzso The purpose of this article is to discuss tools available to an individual researcher to evaluate gene structure prediction for a particular zzso
