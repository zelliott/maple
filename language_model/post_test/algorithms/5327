The robust synchronization problem is studied in this paper for uncertain chaotic zzso zzso It is assumed that the mismatched zzso uncertainties appear in the master system and are norm zzso An integral sliding mode control approach is developed to address this zzso First, a suitable integral sliding surface is constructed, and a zzso condition by means of linear zzso zzso is derived under which the resulting error system is globally zzso stable in the specified switching zzso Then, an integral sliding mode controller is designed guaranteeing the zzso of the specified sliding zzso When the bounds of the mismatched zzso uncertainties are unknown, an zzso integral sliding mode controller is further zzso Finally, the zzso circuit is provided as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed zzso
