zzso of state for completely unfolded proteins have been generated from group zzso zzso and the revised zzso zzso equations of state to zzso the standard zzso zzso properties of these molecules at elevated temperatures and zzso The requisite equations of state parameters were zzso from those of groups retrieved by zzso of experimental zzso and zzso data reported in the zzso This approach permits calculation of the standard zzso zzso properties as a function of temperature and pressure for any completely unfolded protein for which the zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso of this kind have been carried out for 11 zzso zzso The zzso properties reported below can be combined with those for protein unfolding to zzso the corresponding properties of completely folded zzso zzso zzso
