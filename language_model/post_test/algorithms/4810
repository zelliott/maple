The momentum distribution of zzso in the zzso shell of a zzso protein has been measured through deep zzso zzso scattering at 180 and 290 K, below and above the crossover temperature zzso where zzso K is the glass transition zzso It is found that the mean kinetic energy of the water zzso shows no temperature zzso but the zzso are accurate enough to indicate a sensible change of momentum distribution and effective potential felt by zzso compatible with the transition from a single to a double potential zzso This could support the presence of zzso effects even at room temperature, playing an important role in biological zzso
