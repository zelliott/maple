The continuing explosion of sequencing data has inspired a corresponding effort in the zzso and zzso of protein zzso Within a particular protein family, however, individual members may have distinct functions, although they share a common fold and broadly defined zzso zzso zzso zzso are the largest zzso of the Ras zzso yet from early in their discovery, it was apparent that each zzso protein has a unique zzso zzso and regulates a particular zzso membrane zzso To gain insight into the contribution of individual zzso to unique protein functions a general strategy is zzso This method should allow the cell and molecular biologist with no specialist expertise to implement an zzso that makes use of a combination of experimental and zzso zzso The zzso is zzso to the analysis of any protein domain and here is illustrated with the analysis of zzso contributing to the individual functions of a pair of zzso zzso
