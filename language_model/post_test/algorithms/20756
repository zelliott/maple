We zzso the effect of zzso interaction and stretching on the fluctuation properties of a zzso with its end points held zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exactly for this zzso we study both flexible and zzso zzso zzso such as zzso freely zzso chain, and zzso chain zzso zzso We compare the zzso of zzso scales for the effective normal modes of these zzso The zzso differ across models with respect to the degree of stretch, but their zzso zzso with low mode numbers turns out to be the zzso The characteristics of the zzso modes of zzso agree very well with the experimental data on zzso The crossover zzso function for zzso the inverse of the distance along the zzso zzso yields a modified formula for the size of a zzso zzso appropriate for the zzso boundary zzso
