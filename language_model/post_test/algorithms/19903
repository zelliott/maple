A graph of tissue zzso is an essential requirement to model the exchange of zzso and zzso between the blood and cells in the zzso Such a graph is derived from a zzso representation of anatomical data, provides a map of all vessels as zzso and zzso and may include the location of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Yet zzso data sets typically contain erroneous gaps, zzso zzso and zzso merged zzso Current methods to correct such defects only address the issue of connecting gaps and further require manual tuning of parameters in a high zzso zzso To address these shortcomings, we introduce a supervised machine learning method that zzso connects vessel gaps by zzso threshold zzso zzso removes zzso segments by zzso to eliminate deletion candidate zzso and zzso zzso consistency in the joint space of learned vascular graph corrections through zzso zzso Human operators are only required to label individual objects they recognize in a training set and are not burdened with tuning zzso The supervised learning procedure examines the geometry and zzso of features in the neighborhood of each vessel segment under zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on four sets of zzso data, each with zzso zzso obtained with all optical zzso of mouse tissue and zzso by state-of-the-art techniques in image zzso Through statistically validated sampling and analysis in terms of precision recall curves, we find that learning with bagged zzso decision trees reduces zzso error rates for threshold relaxation by zzso and strand elimination performance by zzso We benchmark zzso performance across zzso while improvements vary between data sets, learning always leads to a useful reduction in error zzso Overall, learning is shown to more than zzso the total error rate, and therefore, human time spent manually correcting such zzso
