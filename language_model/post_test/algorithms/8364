The zzso flop zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso receptors greatly determines calcium zzso and kinetic properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso editing of this zzso at the zzso site controls calcium zzso whereas editing at the zzso site is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso We used zzso techniques with zzso solution exchange to examine the zzso of zzso human zzso zzso flop channels zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso at the zzso site and zzso site zzso and zzso zzso and edited zzso at the zzso site both with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The time constant of zzso after application of 10 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso flop zzso zzso and zzso channels, zzso The time constant of zzso was 75 zzso for the zzso flop zzso and 30 zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso of the peak current zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and peak open probability did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso The study shows that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso flop channels are controlled by a single zzso acid exchange zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso analysis by computer simulation using a circular kinetic scheme allows the prediction of the main experimental zzso
