In this paper, we address the problem of zzso image sets for face recognition, where each set contains images belonging to the same subject and typically covering large zzso By modeling each image set as a zzso we formulate the problem as the zzso of the distance between two zzso called zzso distance zzso Since an image set can come in three pattern levels, point, zzso and zzso we systematically study the distance among the three levels and formulate them in a general zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we express a zzso by a collection of local linear models, each depicted by a zzso zzso is then converted to integrate the distances between pairs of zzso from one of the involved zzso We theoretically and zzso study several zzso of the ingredients of zzso The proposed method is applied to the task of face recognition with image sets, where identification is achieved by seeking the minimum zzso from the probe to the gallery of image zzso Our experiments demonstrate that, as a general set similarity measure, zzso consistently zzso other competing zzso methods and is also zzso comparable to the state-of-the-art zzso zzso
