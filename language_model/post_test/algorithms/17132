We propose a simple zzso for zzso the number of zzso differences between a pair of zzso or DNA sequences through comparison of their zzso A mismatch zzso zzso In the zzso A mismatch zzso technique two or more sample sequences are zzso to the same zzso probe, the hybrids are partially zzso with zzso A, and the zzso products are compared on an zzso zzso Here we provide an zzso for converting the numbers of unique and matching zzso bands into an estimate of the number of zzso differences between the zzso Computer simulation indicates that the proposed method yields a robust estimate of the genetic distance despite zzso errors and occasional violation of certain zzso Our study suggests that the method performs best when the distance between the sequences is zzso 15 zzso When the sequences under analysis are likely to have larger zzso we advise to substitute one long zzso with a set of shorter zzso zzso The new zzso is applied to zzso the proximity of several strains of zzso zzso
