The purpose of this study was to introduce a novel meal detection zzso zzso to be used as part of an artificial zzso that uses a continuous zzso monitor zzso 

We developed our zzso on a zzso of 26 meal events using records from 19 children aged zzso years who used the zzso zzso zzso We then applied this zzso to zzso records from a zzso pilot study of the zzso Navigator continuous zzso zzso During a research center admission, breakfast insulin was withheld for 1 zzso and discrete zzso levels were obtained every 10 zzso after the zzso 

Based on the Navigator readings, the zzso detected a meal at a mean time of 30 zzso from the onset of eating, at which time the mean serum zzso was 21 zzso above baseline zzso zzso zzso and zzso of meals were detected before the zzso had risen 40 zzso from zzso 

The zzso will enable automated insulin dosing in response to meals, zzso the development of an artificial zzso
