Shape information about zzso is increasingly available but is difficult to use in modeling zzso We demonstrate that shape information alone can often distinguish structural models of biological zzso By using a data structure called a surface envelope zzso to represent the shape of the zzso we propose a method that generates a fitness score for the shape of a particular molecular zzso This score zzso well with root mean squared zzso zzso of the model to the known test structures and can be used to filter models in decoy zzso The scoring method requires both alignment of the model to the zzso in three-dimensional space and assessment of the degree to which atoms in the model fill the zzso zzso combines a hybrid zzso using principal components and a previously published zzso closest point zzso We test our method against models generated from random atom zzso from crystal structures, published decoy sets used in structure zzso and models created from the zzso of atoms in molecular modeling zzso We also test our alignment zzso against experimental electron microscopic data from rice dwarf zzso The alignment performance is reliable, and we show a high correlation between model zzso and score zzso This correlation is stronger for molecular models with greater oblong character (as measured by the ratio of largest to smallest principal zzso
