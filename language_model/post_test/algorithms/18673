The accuracy of an alignment between two protein sequences can be improved by including other zzso related sequences in the zzso We zzso and benchmark such an approach that relies on aligning two multiple sequence zzso each one including one of the two protein zzso Thirteen different protocols for creating and comparing profiles corresponding to the multiple sequence alignments are implemented in the zzso command of zzso A test set of 200 zzso zzso alignments with sequence identities below zzso is used to benchmark the 13 protocols as well as a number of previously described sequence alignment methods, including zzso zzso sequence alignment by zzso zzso sequence alignment by global dynamic programming with an zzso gap penalty function by the zzso command of zzso zzso alignment by zzso Hidden zzso Model methods implemented in SAM and zzso zzso sequence alignment relying on predicted local structure by SEA, and multiple sequence alignment by zzso and zzso The alignment zzso of the best new protocols were significantly better than those of the other tested zzso For example, the fraction of the correctly aligned zzso relative to the zzso alignment by the best protocol is zzso which can be compared with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the other methods, zzso The new method is currently applied to large-scale comparative protein structure modeling of all known zzso
