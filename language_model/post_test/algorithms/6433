zzso drug release rates were measured from a model zzso zzso comprised mainly of the sparingly soluble drug zzso zzso suspended as an obstacle in a zzso flow zzso zzso medium was delivered at a steady, slow flow rate zzso zzso using an zzso zzso and samples from the zzso were analyzed by direct injection onto an zzso zzso zzso rates were determined as a function of flow rate for three different implant zzso elevated to the center of the dissolution zzso zzso zzso and zzso resting directly upon the flat porous inlet zzso zzso rates were ranked as zzso zzso floor zzso zzso zzso zzso The steady, zzso flow enabled use of the finite element method zzso to simulate the dissolution process using zzso zzso dissolution zzso zzso predicted the absolute magnitude of the release rate to within zzso zzso for all situations, and predicted the power law zzso of the dependence of release rate on flow rate with great zzso The current method is more general than zzso methods that provide a zzso surface that is zzso accessible to the dissolution zzso or a zzso rate that is uniform across the entire zzso zzso The current approach may be zzso to provide estimates of dissolution rates for any geometry and set of zzso conditions that can be zzso zzso
