The zzso of process parameters for high zzso production by the marine zzso strain zzso zzso zzso in solid-state zzso zzso was carried out using central composite design zzso one of the response surface zzso zzso We found that moisture, zzso size, the amount ratio of wheat zzso to rice zzso temperature and pH had great influence on zzso production by strain zzso zzso the zzso was used to evaluate the influence of the five factors on the zzso production by strain zzso Then, five levels of the five factors above were further zzso using the zzso Finally, the optimal parameters obtained with the zzso were the initial moisture zzso zzso zzso the amount ratio of wheat zzso to rice zzso zzso temperature 29 degrees C, pH zzso Under the zzso conditions, zzso U zzso of dry zzso of zzso activity was reached in the solid-state zzso culture of strain zzso within 120 h whereas the predicted maximum zzso activity of zzso U zzso of zzso activity of zzso U zzso of dry weight was derived from the zzso zzso This is the highest zzso activity produced by the zzso strain reported so zzso A large amount of zzso and zzso were detected after zzso zzso by the crude zzso
