The problem of marker selection in DNA zzso analysis has been addressed so far by two basic types of approaches, the so-called filter and wrapper zzso zzso methods operate in a zzso fashion where feature zzso weights are re-evaluated and zzso changing from iteration to zzso while in filter methods feature weights remain zzso Our objective in this study is to show that the application of filter criteria in a zzso fashion, where weights are potentially adjusted from cycle to cycle, produces noticeable improvement on the zzso performance measured on independent test zzso 

Toward this direction we explore the behavior of two well known and broadly accepted pattern recognition approaches namely the support zzso machines zzso and a single linear zzso zzso properly adapted to the problem of marker zzso Within this context we also show how the kernel ability of zzso could be employed in a practical manner to provide alternative ways to approach the problem of reliable marker zzso 

We explore how the proposed approaches behave in two application zzso zzso cancer and zzso achieving comparable or even better results than those reported in the related zzso An important advantage of these approaches is their ability to derive stable performance without deteriorating due to the complexity of the application zzso zzso is performed using internal leave one out zzso and zzso cross validation as well as independent test set zzso 

zzso show that the proposed zzso achieve remarkable performance and indicate that applying filter criteria in a wrapper fashion zzso filtering zzso provides a useful tool for marker zzso The contribution of this study is zzso First it provides a methodology to apply filter criteria in a wrapper way (which is a new zzso second it introduces a fundamental pattern recognition component namely the single zzso (which is a linear zzso and explores its behavior on marker selection and third it demonstrates an approach to exploit the kernel ability of zzso in a practical and effective zzso
