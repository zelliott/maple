In the area of medical image analysis, zzso zzso image registration is an important zzso In the processing of zzso an zzso approach has been applied to estimate the transformation of the reference image and target zzso Some local zzso techniques are frequently used, such as the zzso descent zzso However, these methods need a good initial value in order to avoid the local zzso In this paper, we present a new improved global zzso approach named hybrid particle swarm zzso zzso for medical image zzso which includes two concepts of genetic zzso and zzso
