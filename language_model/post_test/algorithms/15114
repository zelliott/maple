This paper presents systematic analyses by the finite element method of release zzso of a dispersed zzso from various zzso zzso , zzso sphere, cylinder, and convex zzso with or without zzso resistance, into a finite or an infinite external zzso In the case of sink conditions, the zzso results agree well with the existing zzso zzso For the problems of zzso release into a finite external volume, where the zzso solutions are not available, this work has provided zzso solutions of the differential equations describing the release zzso moving zzso and concentration zzso This work has also revealed the dependence of release zzso on the initial zzso zzso the external volume, and the zzso zzso The method presented here can describe the entire process of zzso release before and after the dispersed zzso has been dissolved without the zzso zzso assumption and it is zzso to both small and large ratio of initial zzso loading to the zzso zzso in the zzso
