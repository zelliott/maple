Many zzso processing tasks, such as edge zzso image zzso and stereo matching, can be performed more easily when all objects in the scene are in good zzso However, in practice, this may not be always feasible as optical lenses, especially those with long focal zzso only have a limited depth of zzso One common approach to recover an zzso image is to use zzso image zzso First, several source images with different focuses of the same scene are taken and processed with the discrete zzso transform zzso Among these zzso zzso the zzso zzso with the largest magnitude is selected at each zzso zzso Finally, the fused image can be recovered by performing the inverse zzso In this paper, we improve this fusion procedure by applying the discrete zzso frame transform zzso and the support zzso machines zzso Unlike zzso zzso yields a zzso signal zzso Using features extracted from the zzso zzso a zzso is trained to select the source image that has the best focus at each zzso location, and the corresponding zzso zzso are then incorporated into the composite zzso zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method zzso the traditional approach both visually and zzso
