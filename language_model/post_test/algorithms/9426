As a novel approach to drug discovery involving zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso our laboratory targeted zzso binding sites zzso zzso binding sites, negative zzso binding zzso located on zzso zzso bovine adrenal cells were used as zzso models to investigate interactions of 67 zzso of zzso zzso on native zzso zzso The availability of large numbers of structurally related molecules presents a unique opportunity for the development of zzso models for zzso binding zzso Our zzso zzso inhibited zzso functional zzso of both native and zzso zzso zzso with a wide range of zzso values zzso zzso These zzso had little or no zzso effects on zzso binding to native or zzso zzso supporting zzso zzso zzso Based on these data, two highly zzso zzso quantitative zzso relationship zzso molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity index zzso models were zzso These zzso models were successfully validated and provided insights into the molecular interactions of zzso zzso with zzso In addition, a zzso model was constructed to analyze and zzso the binding requirements to the analog binding zzso The zzso model was subsequently applied to search structurally diverse molecular databases to zzso identify novel zzso The rapid identification of eight molecules from database mining and our successful demonstration of in zzso zzso activity support the utility of these zzso models as novel tools for the efficient retrieval of zzso These results demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso modeling and zzso development, which may lead to the identification of new therapeutic drugs that target novel sites on zzso
