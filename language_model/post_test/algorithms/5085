zzso zzso zzso and zzso are well-known indoor air pollutants, especially after house zzso They are also common pollutants in the working places of the plastic industry, chemical industry, and leather zzso It has been reported that these pollutants cause people to be zzso sick, experience a headache, and be zzso They also have the potential to induce zzso zzso zzso and zzso even cause abortion or fetus zzso in zzso In this study, the airborne toxicity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso embryonic stem cells zzso zzso were tested using airborne exposure technique to evaluate the zzso cell airborne exposure model on zzso zzso Briefly, zzso cells were cultured on zzso zzso and were exposed to an airborne surrounding of test chemicals in a chamber for 1 h at 37 degrees zzso zzso was determined using the zzso zzso after further culture for 18 h at 37 degrees C in normal zzso The airborne zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from the fitted zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 16,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso 500, and zzso zzso 310 zzso zzso zzso was found to be the compound most toxic to zzso cells compared to zzso zzso The toxicity data had good correlation with the in zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso airborne exposure model may be used to predict zzso of volatile organic zzso
