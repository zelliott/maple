In zzso treatment planning, zzso zzso currently represent the best practical approach for accurate zzso dose calculation in zzso zzso In this work, the zzso accuracy and performance of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso and zzso models use the same zzso calculation and are commissioned using the same zzso Both models use the same zzso incorporate the same zzso softening and base incident lateral zzso on the same zzso In addition, corrections are explicitly applied to the zzso and parallel kernel zzso and electron contamination is zzso zzso generated by zzso Carlo zzso zzso of treatment heads are zzso zzso using the zzso zzso were in excellent agreement with zzso for many linear accelerator zzso To speed up the calculations, a number of calculation techniques were zzso including separate primary and scatter dose zzso the zzso technique which assumes kernel zzso for the zzso calculation and a zzso zzso acceleration technique for the zzso zzso zzso results show that the zzso model is faster than zzso by a factor of 4 and 8 for small and large field sizes, zzso Comparisons with measured data and zzso zzso results for a wide range of clinical beam zzso show that zzso zzso and zzso doses match zzso to better than zzso or 2 zzso in homogeneous zzso zzso zzso is more accurate than zzso in lung zzso where zzso doses are within zzso or 3 zzso of zzso results and zzso zzso zzso the dose in lung by a maximum of zzso compared to zzso
