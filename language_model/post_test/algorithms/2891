zzso zzso zzso has become one of the leading methods for brain mapping in zzso Recent advances in zzso analysis were used to define the default state of brain activity, functional connectivity and zzso zzso zzso activity measured with zzso raised tremendous interest among neuroscientists since synchronized brain activity pattern could be retrieved while the subject rests zzso state zzso During recent years, a few signal processing schemes have been suggested to analyze the resting state blood zzso level dependent zzso signal from simple correlations to spectral zzso In most of these analysis schemes, the question asked was which brain areas zzso in the time domain similarly to a zzso zzso In this work we applied short time frequency analysis and zzso to study the spatial signal characteristics of resting state zzso time zzso Such analysis revealed that clusters of similar zzso fluctuations are found in the zzso but also in the white matter and zzso gray matter regions zzso We found high similarities between the zzso clusters and the zzso appearance of brain zzso Additional analysis of the zzso time series revealed a strong correlation between head movements and zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso time series also provided similar quality of zzso These observations led us to the conclusion that zzso contributions to the zzso time series can also account for zzso appearance of signal zzso These contributions may include head motions, the zzso zzso anatomy and cellular zzso
