Our approach is motivated by the need to generate a rigorous measure of the degree of disorder (or zzso of the zzso signal in brain zzso zzso is a method to zzso the zzso of a time zzso It is the first time that a zzso zzso zzso is used in the zzso of brain injury zzso The zzso was sensitive enough to monitor the significant changes in the zzso brain rhythms during recovery from global zzso brain zzso Among the different zzso measures, we used zzso zzso This zzso is zzso and is able to match with the particular properties of zzso like long-range zzso zzso and zzso The method was tested in a signal composed of segments of synthetic signals zzso and uniform zzso and segments of real zzso The real signal segments were extracted from normal zzso zzso recordings from early recovery, and normal zzso corrupted by simulated spikes and zzso Adult zzso rats were subjected to zzso arrest for 3 and 5 zzso The zzso detected the pattern of zzso zzso zzso and was able to discriminate the different injury zzso Two parameters seem to be good zzso of the recovery process; the mean zzso and the zzso of the estimate followed opposite trends, with the mean zzso decreasing and its zzso increasing with zzso
