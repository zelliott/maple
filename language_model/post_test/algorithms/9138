zzso is consequence of lots of small coordinated variations that occur during zzso In zzso zzso tissue growth is coupled to changes in shape and zzso A number of studies have analyzed the zzso properties of zzso zzso using the zzso wing disc as a zzso These works are based in the existence of a fixed distribution of these zzso cells according to their number of zzso Cell division, cell zzso or a combination of both mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for this zzso zzso Here, we have used different system biology methods to compare images from two close zzso stages that present high zzso zzso This approach enables us to search for traces of zzso zzso First, we show that geometrical and network characteristics of individual cells are mainly dependent on their number of zzso Second, we find a significant divergence between the distribution of polygons in zzso from zzso zzso zzso versus early zzso We show that this zzso zzso into changes in zzso zzso zzso only the variation in polygon distribution driven by zzso leads to progression in zzso zzso In addition, we identify the relevant features that characterize these zzso Our results reveal signs of zzso homogenization during the growing phase, before the zzso cell polarity zzso leads to the zzso packing of the zzso during zzso zzso
