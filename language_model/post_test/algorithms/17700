The basic parameters for zzso zzso provided by zzso zzso are the local zzso and scattering zzso For the adult human head, they have been difficult to measure zzso because of the layered structure of the zzso The results of zzso of zzso and reduced scattering zzso through the forehead on 30 adult volunteers using a zzso frequency domain method are zzso The zzso separation distance ranged from 10 to 80 zzso and zzso were recorded at zzso and 830 zzso The measured zzso and reduced scattering zzso of the forehead were used to evaluate the zzso content in the scalp and brain as well as cerebral oxygen zzso We found that cerebral zzso was relatively narrowly distributed within the subject group (the standard zzso was about zzso for scalp and zzso for brain, respectively), whereas zzso zzso had a relatively broader zzso We found that as the zzso distance increased, the zzso zzso increased and the scattering zzso zzso retrieving the optical values of scalp and brain for shorter and longer zzso zzso zzso We present the transition zzso of the zzso and reduced scattering zzso as functions of the zzso zzso In order to verify the values for each layer, a comparison between the experimental data and a prediction based on the zzso model of the adult head was carried zzso The thicknesses of scalp and skull for the zzso model were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging of a zzso zzso The optical parameters obtained from the zzso model agreed very well with those measured by the zzso zzso
