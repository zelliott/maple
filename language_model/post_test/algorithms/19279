Respiratory motion can cause significant dose delivery errors in zzso radiation therapy for zzso and upper abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to provide the image data necessary to model tumor motion and consequently reduce these zzso The purpose of this work was to compare zzso CT reconstruction methods using zzso sorting and phase angle zzso A zzso CT scanner was operated in zzso mode to acquire 25 scans zzso at each couch position through the zzso The patient underwent synchronized external respiratory zzso The scans were sorted into 12 zzso based, respectively, on the zzso and direction zzso or zzso or on the phase angle zzso zzso of the external respiratory zzso With the assumption that lung motion is largely zzso to the measured respiratory zzso the variation in zzso zzso to the variation in motion for each zzso A smaller variation in zzso would associate with an improved reconstructed zzso Air content, defined as the amount of air within the zzso zzso and trachea in a zzso CT segment and used by our group as a surrogate for internal motion, was correlated to the respiratory zzso and phase angle throughout the zzso For the 35 patients who underwent quiet breathing, images zzso to those used for treatment zzso and zzso zzso to display respiratory zzso generated using zzso sorting displayed fewer reconstruction artifacts than those generated using phase angle zzso The variations in respiratory zzso were significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso with zzso sorting than those with phase angle zzso The subdivision of the breathing cycle into more zzso zzso improved the consistency in respiratory zzso for zzso zzso but not for phase angle zzso For 33 of the 35 patients, the air content showed significantly improved zzso zzso zzso correlation with the respiratory zzso than with the phase angle, suggesting a stronger relationship between internal motion and zzso Overall, zzso sorting performed better than phase angle sorting for 33 of the 35 patients and equally well for two patients who were immobilized with a zzso body frame and an abdominal zzso zzso
