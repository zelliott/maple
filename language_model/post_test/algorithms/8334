We study the zzso of rigid three-dimensional interpretations for the structure and motion of four or more moving points from but two zzso views of the zzso We develop an zzso to determine whether image data are compatible with a rigid zzso As a zzso of this result we find that the measure of false targets zzso zzso objects that appear zzso is zzso We find that if the two views have at least one rigid zzso then in fact there is a zzso zzso family of rigid zzso we show how to zzso this family, and we describe precisely how the rigid interpretations vary within zzso Since only two views are used, this analysis is relevant also to stereo zzso
