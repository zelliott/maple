In porous material research, one main interest of nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion zzso experiments is the determination of the shape of zzso While it has been a longstanding question if this is in principle achievable, it has been shown recently that it is indeed possible to perform zzso diffusion pore zzso In this work we present a zzso of these previous zzso We show that the specific zzso zzso profiles that were used so far are not unique as more general zzso diffusion zzso profiles may be zzso These zzso zzso profiles may consist of any number of zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso of small zzso may be present, which can be used to zzso the zzso condition for the complete zzso Some exceptions zzso For example, classical zzso zzso consisting of two short zzso zzso of opposite sign cannot be used as the phase information is lost due to the zzso zzso of this zzso
