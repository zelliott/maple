We investigate the performance of the method proposed in Part I of this paper in several situations of interest in diffuse optical imaging of biological zzso zzso Carlo simulations were extensively used to validate the approximate zzso relationship between zzso and zzso self moments of the generalized zzso zzso function in zzso and slab zzso More specifically we found that in a wide range of cases the zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Part zzso lie in the intervals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationships between zzso and zzso self moments are useful for the calculation of the zzso of a single zzso in a straightforward zzso Although these relationships are more accurate for inclusions of linear size less than approximately zzso their performance is also studied for larger zzso A good agreement, to within approximately zzso was found between the zzso of single and multiple defects calculated with the proposed method and those obtained by zzso Carlo zzso We also provide formulas for the calculation of the moments up to the fourth order for which it is clear how zzso moments can be used for the calculation of zzso zzso
