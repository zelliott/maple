The objective was to evaluate and to compare two completely different detection zzso of intermittent zzso zzso coordination during night zzso The first method is based on a combination of respiratory flow and zzso recordings and determines the relative zzso of R waves between successive zzso of zzso zzso phase coordination is defined as phase recurrence with accuracy alpha over at least k zzso The second, recently introduced method zzso only zzso coded variations of heart rate zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and identifies zzso pattern classes which can be assigned to respiratory zzso zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso pattern class recurrence over at least k zzso is strongly related with the intermittent phase coordination defined zzso 

Both methods were applied to night time recordings of 20 healthy zzso In subjects zzso zzso and setting k zzso 3 and alpha zzso zzso the phase and zzso pattern recurrence were highly zzso Furthermore, in most subjects the pattern predominance zzso showed a pronounced zzso which is most likely linked with the dynamics of sleep zzso However, the analysis of zzso variation and the use of surrogate data suggest that short-term phase coordination mainly resulted from central adjustment of heart rate and respiratory rate rather than from real phase synchronization due to zzso zzso 

zzso pattern analysis provides essential information on short-term phase recurrence and reflects nighttime sleep architecture, but is only zzso linked with true phase synchronization which is rare in zzso processes of zzso
