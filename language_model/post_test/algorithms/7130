X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide the internal structure information of biomedical specimens with high-quality zzso images and has become an invaluable analysis zzso Here a simple and fast reconstruction zzso is reported for zzso zzso differential zzso zzso which is called the zzso zzso It combines the existing zzso method of zzso zzso zzso CT with the differential nature of zzso zzso The reconstruction can be performed using zzso zzso filtered back projection zzso with the zzso imaginary zzso The quality of the results for large zzso pitches is surprisingly zzso In particular, with this zzso comparable quality is obtained using zzso zzso zzso data with a zzso pitch of 10 to that obtained using the traditional zzso zzso reconstruction with a zzso pitch of zzso This method will push the future medical zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso
