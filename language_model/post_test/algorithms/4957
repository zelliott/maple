The present study aimed to evaluate the drying quality of three tomato zzso zzso zzso and zzso at low zzso zzso zzso were cut into slices and zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso final moisture content at 55 degrees C, 65 degrees C and 75 degrees C at zzso zzso air zzso zzso total soluble zzso zzso zzso acidity zzso and zzso acid zzso content were measured in both fresh and dried zzso zzso of the dried tomato slices was significantly zzso while intensity of the red and yellow colors and brightness of the red color zzso zzso Low overall color change zzso was obtained at the lowest drying temperature (55 degrees zzso zzso and zzso showed a higher zzso value and lower zzso zzso The zzso content was increased, while the zzso and AA contents were decreased through zzso This study shows that it is possible to zzso dry tomato slices to a final moisture content of zzso maintaining quality that is comparable with studies where the zzso content was higher zzso or zzso
