The origin of the zzso nucleus is difficult to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso but the source of nuclear genes has been obscured by multiple zzso zzso Using evolutionary zzso a newly developed zzso zzso algorithm, the zzso zzso zzso genes are shown to have evolved from the zzso a group of extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso The deepest zzso yet found separates the reconstructed tree into two zzso zzso These are a zzso group zzso and an essentially bacterial one zzso Within the precision of the rooting zzso the tree is not consistent with either the zzso or the zzso zzso It implies that the last common zzso of extant life, and the early ancestors of zzso probably lacked zzso zzso zzso and lived at zzso zzso
