zzso data structures have a number of applications in zzso including the zzso of zzso or zzso probabilities in humans and agricultural species, and the zzso of breeding values in agricultural zzso zzso zzso for general purpose zzso computers are commonly used, but are inadequate for some tasks on large data zzso We show that pedigree data can be directly represented on Field zzso Gate zzso zzso allowing highly efficient zzso parallel simulation of the flow of zzso zzso on the whole pedigree in zzso the transmission of genes can occur for all individuals in a single clock zzso By using zzso the zzso to estimate zzso zzso and zzso probabilities are shown to operate hundreds to thousands of times faster than the corresponding zzso based zzso Where problems can be largely represented in an zzso form, zzso provide an efficient platform for zzso on pedigree zzso
