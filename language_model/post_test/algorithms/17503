zzso engineering in the manufacturing field is a process in which the digitized data are obtained from an existing object model or a part of it, and then the zzso model is zzso This paper presents an zzso neural network approach to modify and fit the digitized zzso The centers for the zzso are selected by using the zzso least squares learning zzso A zzso known surface is used for generating a number of samples for training the zzso The trained networks then generated a number of new points which were compared with the calculating points from the zzso Moreover, a series of practice zzso zzso are used to test the zzso The results showed that this approach is effective in zzso and fitting digitized data and generating data points to reconstruct the surface zzso
