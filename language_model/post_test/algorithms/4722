In this paper, we present an zzso system for terrain zzso In our approach, patches from a sample terrain zzso by a height zzso are used to generate a new zzso The synthesis is guided by a zzso feature map that specifies where terrain features occur in the resulting synthetic zzso Our system emphasizes large-scale zzso features zzso and zzso because such features are the dominant visual elements in most zzso Both the example height field and user's sketch map are analyzed using a technique from the field of zzso The system finds patches from the example data that match the features found in the user's zzso zzso are joined together using graph cuts and zzso zzso The order in which patches are placed in the zzso terrain is determined by zzso zzso of a feature tree and this generates improved results over standard zzso placement zzso Our technique supports zzso terrain synthesis in a wide variety of styles, based upon the visual richness of real-world terrain zzso
