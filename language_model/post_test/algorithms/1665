zzso zzso zzso analysis is a method for the zzso study of zzso It has been used in the two-dimensional plane for closed zzso but rarely for lines in the three-dimensional zzso The method consists of an expansion of a zzso as a sum of zzso In this article, we study three-dimensional zzso zzso lines embedded in the three-dimensional zzso We zzso for the first time the relations between the zzso zzso and its geometric zzso We then use these relations for zzso and zzso of three-dimensional zzso Such an zzso can be used to perform zzso comparisons between zzso regardless of differences in viewpoint or global zzso Human and small animal illustrative examples using biomedical X-ray CT imaging data of open bone structures demonstrate the interest and potential of the method for zzso zzso
