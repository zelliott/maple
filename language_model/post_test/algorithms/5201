zzso gene sequencing gives an opportunity to reconstruct the tree of life and histories of zzso species zzso from very large zzso A primary need for reconstructing large-scale zzso is a zzso efficient and accurate zzso Current efforts to achieve such a goal include zzso described by zzso et zzso zzso 2007), an zzso based on maximum likelihood zzso and neighbor joining zzso zzso Although it has been reported that the zzso method performs better than the NJ method, studies comparing the accuracy of the zzso and zzso methods are zzso Here, accuracy of the zzso and the zzso methods are zzso The zzso approach (by progressive addition of zzso is used in a biologically realistic computer simulation to zzso the accuracy of the zzso zzso results clearly show that although zzso is zzso efficient and zzso NJ method, the zzso method is clearly much more accurate than the zzso zzso The results encourage the use of the zzso zzso where zzso include up to several hundred species, but for reconstructing zzso zzso zzso where several thousand of zzso are included) zzso is zzso
