An individual zzso planning and application monitoring by zzso is presented for a zzso zzso zzso technique using zzso wires which is applied in zzso zzso The errors of reconstruction of the implants are zzso The consideration of errors for zzso can be extended to other zzso zzso In this case the quality considerations made by other authors have to be zzso The maximum reconstruction error was investigated for a given zzso precision, focus size, and object blur by patient's movements in dependence on the zzso zzso The optimum zzso angle is about 45 degrees, depending on the importance given to the individual parts and almost without being influenced by the relation between the zzso and the zzso zzso In case of an zzso zzso angle, a displacement of an implant point of 1 zzso leads to a maximum reconstruction error of 2 zzso The dosage is made according to the Paris zzso If the zzso radius of the application triangle is modified by 1 zzso a dosage modification of zzso will be the consequence in case of very short wires and a small side zzso A zzso in a phantom showed a positioning error below zzso zzso The dosage error is zzso due to the mutual compensation of the zzso reconstruction errors of the needles the number of which is between seven and zzso
