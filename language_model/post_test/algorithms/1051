zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on the dark appearance of a white spot in otherwise highly fluorescent zzso This can be explained by the increased scattering zzso in the white spot compared with that of sound zzso The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of different sound zzso scattering zzso zzso and zzso thickness zzso caused by zzso zzso differences, on the zzso appearance of zzso zzso We ran a zzso Carlo simulation of a 4 zzso 4 zzso illuminated zzso slab on a highly fluorescent zzso The slab had a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso white spot in the zzso Fluorescent and zzso photons zzso from the central 2 zzso 2 zzso were zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso from the white spot zzso was less than that of sound zzso zzso with an optimum difference for zzso between 20 and zzso For zzso zzso both zzso and zzso decreased with zzso We found no relation with d for zzso zzso The results indicate that for small zzso we are suffering from edge losses, which explains why the optimum for zzso visibility is not found at zzso zzso zzso as would be zzso
