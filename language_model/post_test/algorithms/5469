zzso zzso provide an elegant zzso for constructing and evaluating protein multiple sequence zzso Their use requires the zzso of zzso mixture zzso from curated sets of accurately aligned zzso This article addresses two questions relevant to such zzso of how many components should a zzso mixture zzso and how may a zzso mixture be derived from a given data zzso To apply the Minimum zzso zzso principle to the first question, we extend an zzso formula for the complexity of a zzso model to zzso zzso by informal zzso We apply a zzso based approach to the second zzso Using artificial data generated by a zzso mixture, we demonstrate that our methods are able to approximate well the true theory, when it zzso We apply our methods as well to real data, and zzso zzso zzso that describe the data better than does a mixture derived using previous zzso
