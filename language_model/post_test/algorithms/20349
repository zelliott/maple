zzso Recent reports have shown zzso changes in zzso activity in the zzso zzso range in the zzso zzso of human subjects and monkeys during skilled hand zzso In the monkey these zzso have been shown to be coherent with zzso activity in the zzso activity of hand and zzso zzso zzso In this study we investigated the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of human volunteers during tasks requiring precision grip of two zzso zzso zzso Two tasks were zzso in the zzso task, subjects were required to maintain a steady grip force zzso zzso N or zzso N) for 8 zzso In the zzso task, there was an initial hold period for 3 s zzso ca zzso N) followed by a linear increase in grip force over a 2 s zzso The task ended with a further steady hold for 3 s at the higher force level zzso zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso were recorded from five hand and zzso muscles in 12 zzso The zzso of zzso activity was calculated between each muscle zzso zzso between 1 and 100 zzso were zzso zzso Each subject showed a peak in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso bandwidth during the hold zzso This zzso was absent during the initial movement of the zzso During the ramp task the zzso in the zzso zzso range was also significantly reduced during the movement phase, and significantly increased during the second hold period, relative to the initial zzso zzso There was zzso between the simultaneously recorded zzso zzso and zzso during steady grip in the hold zzso this zzso disappeared during the initial lever zzso Using a single equivalent current zzso source model, the coherent cortical activity was localized to the hand region of the zzso motor zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso was, therefore, at least in part, of cortical zzso zzso The results are discussed in terms of a possible role for zzso in the efficient recruitment of motor units during maintained zzso
