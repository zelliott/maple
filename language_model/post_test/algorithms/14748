Satellite remote zzso with its unique zzso coverage capabilities, can provide accurate and immediately valuable information on fire analysis and zzso assessment, including zzso of zzso zzso In this study the potential for zzso area mapping of the combined use of zzso zzso Network zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso TM satellite imagery was evaluated in a Mediterranean zzso As a case study one of the most catastrophic forest fires, which occurred near the capital of Greece during the summer of 2007, was zzso The accuracy of the two zzso in zzso the zzso area from the zzso TM imagery, acquired shortly after the fire suppression, was determined by the zzso accuracy results of the produced zzso zzso In addition, the derived zzso area estimates from the two zzso were compared with independent estimates available for the study region, obtained from the analysis of higher spatial resolution satellite zzso In terms of the overall zzso zzso ANN outperformed zzso accuracy zzso Kappa zzso zzso the SAM zzso zzso accuracy zzso Kappa zzso zzso Total zzso area estimates from the two zzso were found also to be in close agreement with the other available estimates for the study region, with a mean absolute percentage difference of zzso zzso for ANN and zzso zzso for zzso The study demonstrates the potential of the examined here zzso in detecting zzso areas in a typical Mediterranean zzso
