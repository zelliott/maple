In this paper, we develop a zzso zzso mathematical zzso theory for zzso signals and images in the zzso zzso The proposed theory preserves the geometrical concept of the structuring function, which provides the foundation of classical zzso and is essential in signal and image processing zzso We define the basic zzso zzso zzso operators zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and investigate their zzso We demonstrate the ubiquity of zzso zzso zzso systems by zzso a kernel representation for a large class of systems, called zzso in terms of the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso is defined to be a zzso operator, which is zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso attention is focused on the class of zzso flat zzso zzso The kernel representation for increasing zzso is a zzso of zzso kernel representation for increasing and zzso zzso zzso A representation of zzso in terms of their kernel elements is established for increasing and zzso zzso This representation zzso a large class of zzso linear and zzso systems under the same mathematical zzso Finally, simulation results show the potential power of the general theory of zzso zzso mathematical zzso in several image analysis and computer vision zzso
