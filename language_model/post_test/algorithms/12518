To assess the zzso between standard automated zzso zzso and short wavelength automated zzso zzso To analyze comparatively the early detection and the extent of visual field defects in glaucoma suspects and in early zzso 

A zzso zzso study that included 55 patients zzso zzso glaucoma suspects or with early glaucoma who were randomly subject to both zzso and zzso the examinations were repeated at 3 and 6 months in order to establish that the visual field defects were zzso The studied parameters were the mean value of MD and zzso in the two techniques, the correlation between the results zzso and on patients zzso the percentage of patients in which the defects were larger, deeper or new defects were found when examined in zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference in the MD value between the two methods zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso p zzso zzso the zzso value was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a high correlation of the MD and zzso values between the two zzso the highest correlation appeared in zzso zzso The zzso test has evidenced visual field defects in zzso of eyes with normal zzso tests and also larger and deeper defects in zzso of zzso 

The zzso and zzso results were zzso the visual field defects were earlier zzso appeared larger and deeper in zzso than in zzso
