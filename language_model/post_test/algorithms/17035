The authors discuss two approaches to assisted medical diagnosis of chronic zzso respiratory diseases, zzso linear discrimination and a decision tree based on the linear zzso functions of the individual zzso Only the two most zzso variables obtained for differentiation of groups at individual zzso are used for the zzso zzso They are the four linguistic variables zzso character of zzso physical examination of the chest, and zzso examination of the chest obtained by conversion of discrete zzso No laboratory finding is zzso The tree zzso simulates a zzso thought zzso zzso with zzso linear discrimination on the same four variables for both a zzso and a zzso technique were comparable to the zzso zzso The tree zzso lends itself to simple graphic zzso the patient being created as a point in the plane of the two most zzso variables without the need for mathematical formulas and zzso zzso The zzso errors that appear in the chronic zzso group can be easily corrected using an additional zzso smoking zzso
