A method is described to zzso identify zzso clusters in proteins of known zzso zzso are found by examining a protein for compact groupings of side zzso Compact clusters contain seven or more zzso have an average of zzso zzso zzso and usually occur in protein zzso Although smaller clusters contain only zzso zzso larger clusters zzso significant portions of the zzso backbone in regular secondary zzso These clusters agree well with zzso regions assigned by more intuitive methods and many larger clusters correlate with protein zzso These results are in striking contrast with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso That method finds that clusters located on a zzso surface are not especially zzso and average only zzso zzso in zzso zzso clusters can be correlated with experimental evidence on early folding zzso This correlation is zzso when clusters with less than nine zzso zzso are removed from the data zzso This suggests that zzso clusters are important in the folding process only if they have enough zzso zzso
