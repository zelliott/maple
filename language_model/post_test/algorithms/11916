The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new technique minimizing test time without reduction of data zzso In this retrospective study we compared visual fields assessed with the conventional zzso technique with those by zzso and analyzed qualitative and quantitative differences and the test time reduction of zzso 

113 eyes with different zzso field damage of 66 patients aged from 22 to 89 years were zzso The patients underwent zzso with each strategy within four zzso zzso criteria were eyes with progressing zzso damage and high rate of zzso results or artifacts by corrective zzso 

The qualitative differences of the analysis were zzso full threshold demonstrated more relative zzso in eyes with normal zzso readings, whereas zzso assessed with zzso were often pronounced to absolute zzso Average time reduction by zzso was zzso and depended on the severity of zzso zzso No reduction was found for advanced glaucoma, whereas normal fields using zzso were performed in half of the time of full threshold zzso 

zzso of zzso to conventional full threshold testing may be related to fatigue effects of full threshold strategy due to longer test zzso The reduction of test time enables more motivation for more frequent visual field examinations and thus a better detection of early glaucoma or progressing visual field zzso
