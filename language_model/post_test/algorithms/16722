In zzso localized and fully zzso zzso and zzso polarization transfer experiments were designed and performed in the rat brain at zzso T after infusion of zzso sodium zzso and sodium zzso zzso The method presented zzso leads to highly enhanced in zzso detection of zzso zzso as well as attached zzso This indirect detection scheme allows for probing additional molecular sites in zzso zzso and their zzso and can thus lead to improved spectral resolution such as in the case of zzso zzso
