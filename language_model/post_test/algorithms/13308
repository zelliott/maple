Both zzso and directional responses of a cavity inside a two-dimensional sonic crystal are zzso The size of the cavity is large compared to the lattice zzso and the wavelength for the frequency range of zzso zzso a hybrid method to zzso the response is proposed, combining zzso theory for the calculation of the reflective properties of the sonic crystal with a modified zzso zzso for the sound propagation within the zzso The response of this zzso displays zzso for certain frequency bands that depend on the geometry of the lattice and the zzso When a full band gap exists in the sonic zzso rays cannot zzso through the medium and total reflection occurs for all zzso angles, leading to strong zzso with an zzso intensity field inside the zzso When only some propagation directions are forbidden, total reflection occurs for certain ranges of zzso angles, and zzso can also be zzso but with a highly zzso intensity zzso The spectrum of zzso of the cavity is strongly affected by changes in the lattice zzso suggesting that they can be tailored to some extent, a feature that can lead to potential applications in architectural zzso
