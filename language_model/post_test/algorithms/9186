The aim of this study is to demonstrate a novel, fully automatic computer detection method zzso to zzso tumors to the lung with a diameter of zzso zzso in high-risk patients using typical zzso zzso zzso scans of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor appearance models zzso of various sizes were created to match representative CT imaging parameters and to incorporate partial volume zzso Taking into account the zzso in the location of CT sampling planes cut through the zzso models, three offsetting template models were created for each appearance model zzso Lung volumes were automatically extracted from zzso zzso images and the correlation zzso between the zzso around each zzso in the lung volume and the set of appearance models were calculated using a fast frequency domain zzso To determine optimal parameters for the templates, simulated tumors of varying sizes and zzso were generated and zzso onto a representative human chest image zzso The method was applied to real image sets from 12 patients with known zzso disease to the zzso A total of zzso slices and 47 identifiable tumors were zzso zzso templates of three sizes zzso 8, and 10 zzso in zzso were used on the patient image zzso all 47 true tumors were detected with the inclusion of only 21 false zzso This study demonstrates that an automatic and straightforward zzso zzso method, without any complex training or zzso can be used to detect small lung zzso quickly and reliably in the clinical zzso
