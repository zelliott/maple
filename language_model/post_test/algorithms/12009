Reconstruction and restoration of the lesser zzso zzso after an zzso complication of a lesser zzso zzso provides a difficult surgical dilemma for the foot and ankle zzso This study's purpose was to determine if a formula could be developed, through a geometric and mathematical basis, for the zzso zzso lesser zzso zzso to aid the surgeon in determining the amount of bone needed to be zzso to correct the zzso This study was divided into three zzso In part I, 15 lesser zzso zzso 2, 3, and 4) harvested from fresh frozen zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso removes a zzso piece of bone that is perpendicular to the zzso zzso from the zzso aspect of the lesser zzso to create zzso zzso of the zzso and changes the relationship of the zzso head to the zzso zzso These zzso had five zzso markers placed into them and were zzso zzso and zzso These markers created a zzso and zzso graphic plotting for the changes in zzso zzso and zzso Computer zzso was then zzso to analyze changes in zzso zzso and zzso of each zzso zzso were created from these zzso to determine the actual change in zzso zzso and zzso for a set amount of bone zzso The formulas created from these data were: zzso zzso change zzso Bone removed zzso zzso zzso change zzso Bone removed zzso and zzso zzso change zzso Bone removed zzso zzso In part II of study, 15 identical saw bone lesser zzso were used to verify the formulas, by taking out the amount of bone needed for zzso zzso change, starting at zzso zzso and increasing to zzso zzso zzso used were identical to part zzso Part III was performed to demonstrate that the formula would be zzso for height when there is a difference in the zzso of the zzso Fifteen identical zzso where plotted in plaster at zzso ranging from 8 degrees to 42 zzso Then the zzso was performed removing zzso zzso of zzso from each zzso using the same technique as parts I and zzso All parts and the formulas were statistically analyzed using a zzso zzso model, which showed that the formulas were valid for zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso With these experimental models, the authors found zzso formulas that hopefully could aid the surgeon in determining the amount of bone they needed to zzso to effect correction of this difficult zzso
