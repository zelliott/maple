This article describes the abrupt and sustained zzso of the sensed zzso delay in a patient with an zzso Marathon zzso zzso programmed to the zzso function, which prevents tracking of inappropriate zzso zzso The zzso delay remained extended and stable when the zzso cycle became equal to the prevailing upper rate zzso determined by sensor zzso When the zzso rate remained stable, the zzso delay returned abruptly to its shorter programmed duration at the end of the zzso terminating zzso and remained constant zzso This behavior is caused by a zzso zzso upper rate response related to the slow prevailing upper rate at rest provided by sensor input to the zzso function of the pulse zzso
