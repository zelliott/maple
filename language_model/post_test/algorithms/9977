We develop a zzso group method to investigate synchronization clusters in a one-dimensional chain of zzso coupled phase zzso The method is best suited for chains with strong disorder in the intrinsic zzso and zzso zzso The results are compared with zzso simulations of the chain dynamics and good agreement in several characteristics is zzso We apply the zzso group and simulations to zzso zzso of intrinsic zzso and zzso and investigate the statistics of the zzso cluster sizes and zzso as well as the dependence of the characteristic cluster length upon parameters of these zzso zzso
