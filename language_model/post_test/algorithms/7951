Complex polarization ratio zzso in materials with zzso and zzso is shown as a zzso spiral in the complex zzso A zzso zzso zzso fitting zzso using the zzso trajectory collected by polarization sensitive optical zzso zzso zzso was developed to determine polarization properties of an zzso scattering zzso The zzso zzso fitting zzso using the zzso trajectory is verified using simulated zzso data with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso film, zzso zzso tail zzso and zzso zzso retinal nerve fiber layer were determined using measured zzso zzso and the zzso zzso fitting zzso
