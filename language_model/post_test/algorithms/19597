Previous studies demonstrated breast cancer tumor tissue samples could be classified into different zzso based upon DNA zzso zzso The most recent study presented evidence for the existence of five different zzso normal zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, and zzso 

Based upon the analysis of zzso zzso (five separate zzso zzso zzso using a novel approach, we present evidence in support of the most consistently identifiable zzso of breast cancer tumor tissue zzso being: zzso zzso and zzso zzso called the zzso zzso We validate all three zzso statistically and show the zzso to which a sample belongs is a significant predictor of overall survival and zzso free zzso 

As a consequence of the statistical validation procedure we have a set of zzso which can be applied to any zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso to zzso it to one of the zzso zzso Moreover, the method used to define the zzso zzso is not specific to the zzso The method can be used to identify zzso in any disease for which there are at least two independent zzso zzso of disease zzso
