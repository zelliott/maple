We extend a simple zzso approximation model to predict zzso scattering from small zzso This zzso method is known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been extensively used to model linear scattering by small particles of various shapes and zzso We show here that zzso can be used to efficiently model second harmonic scattering by small zzso Our results are compared with experimental data and other zzso zzso
