To develop a map of disease associations exclusively using two publicly available genetic zzso the catalog of single zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and the catalog of Genome Wide Association Studies zzso from the zzso and to evaluate it with a large, long-standing electronic medical record zzso 

A zzso model, In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was developed to learn associations among diseases using a zzso network zzso zzso using only genetic zzso The zzso model zzso was zzso using data from our zzso zzso Separately, another clinical model zzso was learned from this training zzso The zzso was compared with both the zzso and the zzso for power to discriminate a disease given other diseases using a test zzso from our zzso Area under receiver operator characteristics curve was used as a performance zzso zzso associations between diseases in the zzso were also searched in the zzso database and in classes of the Human Disease Network zzso 

On the basis of genetic information alone, the zzso linked a third of diseases from our zzso When compared to the zzso the zzso predicted diseases given other diseases with zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso positive zzso zzso The zzso contained 117 direct associations between zzso Of those associations, 20 zzso were absent from the searches of the zzso zzso one of these was present in the zzso Of the direct associations in the zzso 7 zzso were absent from disease classes of zzso 

Using only publicly available genetic sources we have mapped associations in zzso to a human disease map using an in zzso zzso Furthermore, we have validated this disease map using zzso data from our zzso Models predicting disease associations on the basis of known genetic associations alone are specific but not zzso zzso data, as it currently exists, can only explain a fraction of the risk of a zzso Our approach makes a quantitative statement about disease variation that can be explained in an zzso on the basis of genetic associations described in the zzso
