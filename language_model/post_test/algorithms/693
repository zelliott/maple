We propose a method for displaying zzso in space that is based on three-dimensional zzso integral imaging, in which zzso images are calculated from a two-dimensional sampling of the optical field along different depths by use of zzso scanning zzso Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that a zzso magnified zzso biological zzso can be displayed in space, and thus integral imaging can be used for zzso display of zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso integral imaging of zzso zzso
