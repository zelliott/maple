Profile Hidden zzso Model zzso is a powerful statistical model to represent a family of DNA, zzso and protein zzso Profile zzso has been widely used in zzso research such as sequence zzso gene structure zzso motif zzso protein structure zzso and biological database zzso However, few comprehensive, visual editing tools for profile zzso are publicly zzso 

We develop a visual editor for profile Hidden zzso Models zzso zzso can zzso the profile zzso architecture, transition zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, it provides functions to edit and save zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso allows users to align a sequence against the profile zzso and to zzso the corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso provides a set of unique functions to zzso and edit a profile zzso It is a useful tool for biological sequence analysis and zzso Both zzso software and web service are freely zzso
