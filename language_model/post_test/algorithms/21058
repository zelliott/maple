Modern zzso steadily zzso more of the available degrees of freedom provided by zzso equipment, raising the need for the zzso methods to deliver reliable zzso for situations where the spectral properties of the radiation field may also zzso A zzso zzso method is presented for which the zzso from any field zzso can be instantly zzso thus zzso the determination of zzso quantities at arbitrary zzso A database of zzso pencil kernels describing the zzso resulting from point zzso zzso beams incident onto a water phantom has been calculated with the zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso calculated by means of the kernels are presented for various 6 zzso zzso The zzso have been used to investigate depth and lateral variations of zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso ratio decreases with depth, and that this effect is more pronounced for small zzso These variations are clearly connected to spectral zzso For a 10 zzso 10 zzso field, the difference between the zzso ratio at zzso zzso depth and 30 zzso depth is less than zzso while for a zzso zzso zzso zzso field this difference is zzso zzso outside the field were found to be sensitive to the zzso leakage spectral zzso
