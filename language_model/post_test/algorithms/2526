Recent advances in zzso DNA sequencing technologies and associated statistical analyses have enabled in-depth analysis of zzso zzso As this technology is applied to a growing number of individual human zzso entire families are now being zzso Information contained within the pedigree of a zzso family can be leveraged when zzso the zzso zzso The presence of a de zzso zzso within the pedigree is indicated by a violation of zzso inheritance zzso Here, we present a method for zzso zzso zzso across a pedigree using zzso sequencing data and producing the zzso probability of de zzso zzso at each zzso site zzso This framework can be used to zzso the effects of zzso and zzso zzso processes and to simultaneously estimate the effect of sequencing error and the initial genetic variation in the population from which the founders of the pedigree zzso This approach is examined in detail through simulations and areas for method improvement are zzso By applying this method to data from members of a zzso nuclear family with accurate pedigree information, the stage is set to make the most direct estimates of the human zzso rate to zzso
