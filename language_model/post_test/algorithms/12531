The aim of this article is to develop an zzso zzso approach to estimate the genetic differentiation between zzso The conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods that use sample counts of zzso may cause severe zzso of zzso which means zzso of zzso when the number of sampling localities is zzso To reduce such bias in the zzso of genetic zzso we propose an zzso method in which the mean zzso zzso over populations are regarded as nuisance parameters and are eliminated by zzso To maximize the zzso function, we have developed two zzso a zzso Carlo zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Our simulation studies show that the method proposed here zzso the conventional zzso and zzso methods in terms of zzso and zzso The zzso method was applied to real data for Pacific zzso and African zzso
