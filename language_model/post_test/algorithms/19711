Imaging studies of the human brain indicate that the zzso zzso zzso changes during the aging zzso With the ability to study the human brain in zzso using magnetic resonance imaging, understanding the nature and location of these changes is of increasing zzso In this work, we investigate zzso and zzso age effects on the geometric shape and gray matter zzso volume for regions of interest on the cortical zzso Each of the regions zzso to the buried zzso surrounding the zzso spaces and is termed a zzso zzso The study consists of 35 older adults scanned three times over a zzso time zzso The group includes 19 women and 16 men ranging in ages from 59 to 84 years zzso zzso standard zzso zzso We analyze 8 zzso zzso buried zzso surrounding the left and right central, superior zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso We examine surface area, zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso depth, local zzso index, and measures of zzso zzso indicate zzso age effects in mean zzso zzso volume, zzso depth, and zzso characteristics of zzso zzso In addition, we found zzso decreases in surface area, mean zzso zzso volume, and zzso depth measures as well as changes in zzso zzso
