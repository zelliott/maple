The development of modern critical care lung ultrasound is based on the classical representation of anatomical structures and the need for the assessment of specific zzso zzso and zzso The air and fluid content of the lungs is interpreted using few typical zzso and phenomena, with which the most important differential diagnoses can be zzso According to a recent international consensus conference these include lung zzso lung pulse, zzso lung point, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso An increased number of zzso is an unspecific sign for an increased quantity of fluid in the lungs resembling zzso zzso for example in the case of zzso pulmonary zzso or lung zzso In the diagnosis of zzso syndromes lung ultrasound provides higher diagnostic accuracy zzso than zzso zzso and chest zzso zzso Diagnosis of pneumonia and pulmonary embolism can be achieved at the bedside by evaluating zzso lung zzso zzso of lung sliding can help to detect zzso ventilation and allows the exclusion of a zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso is superior to zzso anterior chest zzso for ultrasound the sensitivity is zzso and the specificity zzso For the diagnosis of zzso a simple zzso was therefore zzso in the presence of lung zzso lung pulse or zzso zzso can be ruled out, in contrast a positive lung point is a highly specific sign of the presence of zzso Furthermore, lung ultrasound allows not only diagnosis of zzso zzso with significantly higher sensitivity than chest zzso but also visual control in zzso zzso
