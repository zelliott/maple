zzso the nature of dense particle zzso is a subject of intense research in the physical, zzso and biological zzso The preponderance of previous work has focused on zzso particles and very little is known about dense zzso zzso We formulate the problem of generating dense zzso of zzso zzso zzso within an zzso fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions as an zzso problem, which we call the zzso shrinking cell zzso zzso This zzso problem is solved here zzso a variety of zzso initial zzso to find the dense zzso of each of the zzso zzso in three-dimensional zzso space zzso , except for the zzso which is the only zzso solid that tiles zzso We find the densest known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the densest zzso packing possesses no long-range zzso Unlike the densest zzso zzso which must not be a zzso lattice zzso the densest zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso that we obtain are their previously known optimal zzso lattice zzso We also derive a simple upper bound on the zzso density of zzso of zzso zzso particles and apply it to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that what we term the zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso is sufficiently small, the upper bounds are relatively tight and thus close to the corresponding zzso of the optimal lattice zzso of the centrally zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our simulation results, rigorous upper bounds, and other theoretical arguments lead us to the conjecture that the densest zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice zzso This can be regarded to be the analog of zzso sphere conjecture for these zzso truncated zzso is the only zzso zzso solid that is not centrally zzso zzso the densest known packing of which is a zzso packing with density at least as high as zzso zzso zzso We discuss the zzso of our conjecture to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, we conjecture that the optimal packing of any zzso zzso zzso without central symmetry generally is not a lattice zzso Finally, we discuss the possible applications and zzso of the zzso scheme in predicting the crystal structures of zzso zzso and the study of random zzso of hard zzso
