The effect on the zzso zzso and reduction zzso of zzso zzso and its metal derivatives zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso was systematically performed in zzso containing zzso M zzso by differential pulse zzso zzso The zzso energy level zzso constructed from the zzso data revealed zzso of the zzso level and stabilization of the zzso level upon zzso formation while such a zzso was larger for the zzso level than the zzso zzso The geometry and electronic structure of a representative zzso and its zzso zzso were evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso method utilizing a mixed basis set of zzso for zzso K, O, and N and zzso for C and zzso The zzso ring distance of the zzso calculated from the zzso geometry agreed with the zzso determined one, and the calculated zzso and zzso frontier zzso revealed zzso on both of the zzso zzso The zzso distances calculated from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso induced zzso zzso bearing zzso metal zzso in the cavity followed the trend zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the spectral shifts resulting from the zzso zzso of the interacting zzso zzso revealed no specific trend with respect to the metal zzso in the zzso zzso Additionally, linear trends in the zzso measured zzso gap and the energy corresponding to the most intense visible band of both zzso and zzso were zzso A reduced zzso gap predicted for the zzso by zzso zzso calculations was confirmed by the results of optical zzso and zzso zzso
