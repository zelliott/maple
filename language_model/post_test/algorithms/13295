The zzso function captures the dynamics of zzso fluctuations and contains important information about the underlying kinetic rate zzso zzso fluctuations in zzso reaction networks are typically zzso using a master equation zzso In general, the equation cannot be solved exactly and approximation methods are zzso For small fluctuations close to zzso a zzso of the dynamics provides a very good description of the relaxation of the zzso zzso As the number of molecules in the system decrease, zzso from the linear theory zzso zzso out a systematic zzso expansion of the master equation to capture these effects results in formidable zzso however, symbolic mathematics packages considerably zzso the zzso The authors demonstrate that zzso effects can reveal features of the underlying zzso such as reaction zzso not available in zzso zzso Furthermore, in models that exhibit zzso zzso zzso corrections result in a shift in the base frequency along with the appearance of a secondary zzso
