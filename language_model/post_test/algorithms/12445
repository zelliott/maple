Current techniques used to zzso zzso often rely upon manual zzso or potentially expensive commercially available programs for automated zzso We describe a computerized method for the detection and zzso of zzso in the rat zzso using readily available free zzso Feature J, a zzso plug-in to the imaging software zzso Image J, faithfully detects linear structures such as zzso in zzso or zzso images using a zzso zzso We validated the method by comparing values obtained by manual and automated analyses of zzso induced to grow in response to zzso zzso in the rat spinal zzso We also demonstrated that the program can be used to zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso in the rat cortex, where manual measurement would be zzso due to dense zzso zzso The use of this software suite provided faster and less biased zzso of labeled zzso in comparison to manual zzso at no zzso
