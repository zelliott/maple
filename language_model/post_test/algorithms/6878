Research on the use of zzso and zzso zzso has led to the development of techniques for zzso subsurface zzso amount and zzso zzso zzso Although these techniques have been zzso with some success at field sites, current application is limited largely to zzso at residual zzso such as for the case of zzso settings where mobile zzso has been removed through product zzso The goal of this study was to fundamentally evaluate zzso and zzso zzso behavior in controlled zzso test cells for a range of zzso zzso varying in zzso zzso with the results serving as a zzso of technique efficacy (and design zzso for use with zzso distributed zzso possibly at high zzso in zzso zzso Representative end members of the range of zzso zzso observed under conditions of natural zzso (an occurrence with residual zzso zzso zzso zzso and an occurrence with high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Study results indicated accurate prediction zzso measured zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso amount and zzso zzso area for the case of residual zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso area, but not zzso amount zzso by zzso can be reasonably determined using conventional zzso zzso zzso of zzso amount lead to an erroneous prediction of zzso distribution, as indicated by the zzso zzso zzso In light of these results, careful consideration should be given to technique design and critical assumptions before applying zzso zzso zzso methodology to settings where zzso are zzso zzso such as in naturally zzso subsurface zzso
