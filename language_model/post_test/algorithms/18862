In this paper, an zzso algorithm, called the Independent zzso Pursuit zzso for zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso estimates a set of linear combinations of image bands that enhance different structures embedded in the zzso In particular, the first estimated combination enhances the contrast of the zzso to facilitate its zzso Given an zzso image, this first combination zzso to a line in N dimensions, such that the separation between the two main modes of the zzso obtained by projecting the zzso onto this line, is zzso The remaining combinations are estimated in a similar way under the constraint of being zzso to those already zzso The performance of the zzso is tested on five different zzso zzso The results obtained on these zzso indicate the zzso of the zzso and its suitability to deal with different types of zzso zzso The boundary detection precision using zzso zzso was close to zzso The proposed zzso can be easily combined with the majority of zzso zzso
