zzso scanning zzso and the introduction of deletions and insertions were used to address the role of the large zzso loop in zzso zzso zzso by zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso of 29 zzso acid zzso that are identical or zzso in zzso to zzso demonstrated that the transport activities of only a few zzso were zzso Progressive zzso of the loop by six deletions leaving intact 59 zzso 49 zzso 39 zzso 28 zzso 18 zzso or 10 zzso zzso acid zzso resulted in a progressive decrease in zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso the zzso rates varied between zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso or zzso to fill in the deletion zzso restored zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso in the case of zzso whereas zzso zzso was without zzso zzso laser zzso demonstrated that a deletion of six zzso acid zzso did not influence the expression level in the plasma membrane zzso zzso whereas the plasma membrane zzso of the zzso zzso was comparable with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structure prediction of the loop suggested that it consists of a long zzso bundle interrupted or zzso by the highly zzso zzso
