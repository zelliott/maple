The action of zzso antibiotics is inhibited by chemical modification zzso by zzso zzso zzso which bind these zzso zzso with active site pockets that contain a preponderance of zzso charged zzso In this study, it was observed that several zzso zzso zzso representing different structural classes, could serve as zzso of such zzso resistance zzso The bovine zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso appeared to be especially effective against a range of resistance zzso zzso zzso belonging to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso classes, where the mode of action was dependent on the class of zzso resistance zzso These peptides represent the first example of zzso zzso of zzso resistance zzso
