zzso of zzso changes that result from genetic or environmental zzso has several important applications, including diagnosing zzso disorders and discovering novel drug zzso A zzso challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of zzso regulatory networks with the corresponding zzso zzso We propose a method called zzso regulation of metabolism zzso that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, zzso and quantitative integration of zzso data into zzso zzso making it an ideal tool for constructing zzso zzso network models for zzso zzso zzso introduces probabilities to represent gene states and zzso factor zzso By using zzso we constructed an integrated zzso network for the model zzso zzso coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated zzso is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual zzso of zzso After zzso the approach, we used zzso to build a zzso integrated zzso model for zzso zzso a critically important human zzso This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 zzso 2,000 zzso zzso interactions regulating 3,300 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso with zzso as high as zzso and predicted growth rates zzso with correlation of zzso zzso zzso represents the successful integration of a zzso zzso statistically zzso regulatory network with a bottom-up zzso zzso detailed zzso network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined zzso
