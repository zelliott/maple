Any attempt to characterize a bacterial community and their functional genes coding for zzso of the nitrogen cycle is faced with its extreme zzso Novel techniques, based on zzso amplification of target genes in DNA from environmental samples, have been developed for characterizing both cultured and as yet zzso bacteria in the last few zzso zzso assignment tools have now been developed utilizing terminal restriction fragments obtained from zzso with multiple restriction zzso Such programs allow the gross characterization of bacterial life in any complex bacterial community with zzso
