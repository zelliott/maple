The performance of the zzso and zzso zzso measures in predicting patient outcomes have been well validated with zzso data but not with zzso data, especially in disease specific patient zzso The objective of this study was to assess the performance of these two zzso measures in the prediction of zzso and 1 year mortality among patients with zzso heart failure zzso diabetes, chronic zzso failure zzso stroke and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass zzso zzso 

A Canadian provincial hospital discharge administrative database was used to define 17 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso values were calculated to evaluate the performance of two zzso One year mortality information was obtained from the provincial Vital Statistics zzso 

The absolute difference between zzso and zzso data in zzso ranged from 0 to zzso across five zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso measures predicting zzso or 1 year zzso In the models predicting zzso mortality using zzso data, the zzso ranged from zzso (for zzso - zzso (for zzso for zzso measure and zzso (for zzso to zzso (for zzso for zzso zzso 

The change in coding zzso did not influence the performance of either the zzso or zzso zzso measures in the prediction of zzso Both zzso measures were still valid zzso indicators in the zzso data and had a similar performance in predicting short and long term mortality in the zzso and zzso zzso
