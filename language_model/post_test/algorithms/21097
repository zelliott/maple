It is natural to want to relax the assumption of zzso and zzso error in zzso zzso For a zzso zzso model with 2 zzso k cells, one can derive tests of main effect for the factor with two levels zzso to as zzso without assuming zzso or zzso zzso zzso likelihood can be used to derive testing zzso An approximate empirical likelihood ratio test zzso is derived for the test of group main zzso To approximate the zzso of the test statistics under the zzso hypothesis, simulation from the approximate empirical maximum likelihood estimate zzso restricted by the zzso hypothesis is zzso The zzso zzso F zzso and a zzso approximation to the distribution of the zzso zzso F zzso are compared to the zzso in level and zzso The zzso procedure is shown by simulation to have appropriate type I error control (although possibly zzso when the distribution of the test statistics are zzso by simulation from the constrained zzso The methodology is motivated and illustrated by an analysis of folate levels in the blood among two alcohol intake groups while accounting for zzso
