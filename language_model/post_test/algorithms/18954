A measure of the sharpness of vessel wall zzso in carotid artery zzso may be useful for assessing the zzso of the zzso zzso An edge detection technique was used to measure the signal intensity zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso recovery zzso zzso carotid artery images of normal subjects that were acquired at zzso T with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso and zero filled to reduce the zzso reconstructed zzso size by one half in each dimension as well as with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso and at zzso T with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso using surface zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso interface varied closely with the zzso ratio of the zzso zzso For the zzso imaging, in which higher spatial frequency artery structures are visible, the zzso zzso at the zzso were higher than theoretically predicted at both field strengths with smaller acquisition zzso The use of acquisition zzso smaller than those previously used at zzso T can improve the zzso of carotid artery structures at zzso and zzso T with surface zzso zzso
