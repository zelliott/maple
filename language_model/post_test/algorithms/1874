Over time, methods for the development of clinical decision support zzso systems have evolved from zzso and zzso scoring systems to very complex and zzso mathematical zzso In order to accomplish effective decision support, zzso systems should provide information on how the model arrives at a certain zzso To address the issue of zzso between performance, zzso and zzso of zzso systems, this paper proposes an innovative model structure, automatically leading to zzso and easily zzso zzso The resulting models can be used to guide clinicians when deciding upon the appropriate treatment, zzso zzso risks and to improve communication with zzso 

We propose the zzso coded scoring zzso system, which zzso that the effect of each variable on the estimated risk is constant within consecutive zzso The number and position of the intervals are automatically obtained by solving an zzso problem, which additionally performs variable zzso The resulting model can be zzso by means of appealing scoring tables and color zzso zzso models can be used within software packages, in zzso applications, or on paper, which is particularly useful for bedside medicine and zzso The zzso approach is illustrated on two zzso problems: diagnosis of zzso of zzso tumors using a zzso containing zzso patients, and prediction of first zzso viability of zzso using a zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the performance of the zzso approach with a range of prediction models proposed in the literature illustrates the ability of zzso to combine optimal performance with the zzso of simple scoring zzso 

The zzso approach can improve zzso communication and will provide additional insights in the importance and influence of available zzso Future challenges include extensions of the proposed methodology towards automated detection of interaction effects, zzso decision support systems, prognosis and zzso zzso
