zzso of marine inherent optical properties zzso from ocean color satellite instruments provide valuable data records for studying long-term time changes in ocean zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a common method for zzso zzso from zzso zzso of the marine light zzso Most zzso assign constant spectral values for seawater zzso and zzso assume spectral shape functions of the remaining constituent zzso and scattering components zzso zzso zzso zzso and colored dissolved organic zzso and retrieve the zzso of each remaining constituent required to match the spectral distribution of measured zzso Here, we explore the use of zzso and zzso values for seawater zzso in lieu of the constant spectrum currently employed by most zzso Our results suggest that use of zzso and zzso seawater zzso elevate the zzso particle zzso reduce the zzso particles plus colored dissolved organic matter zzso and leave the derived zzso by zzso zzso
