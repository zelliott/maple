National birth cohort zzso 

zzso 

zzso live zzso with primary analysis based on zzso white zzso 

zzso study based on the 50 states and the District of Columbia during two time periods 10 years zzso zzso and zzso

The state-level ecological analysis among zzso white women showed that the change in zzso birth rate from zzso to 2002-04 was significantly associated with the change in rate of zzso induction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with the change in rate of zzso delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso but otherwise similar associations with zzso induction were observed in Hispanic women and in zzso black zzso 

zzso use of zzso induction is probably an important cause of the observed increased rate in zzso zzso
