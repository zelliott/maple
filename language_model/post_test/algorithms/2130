In anorexia zzso serum zzso levels are increased under zzso conditions and respond zzso to provocative zzso We report here, for the first time, an analysis of zzso zzso zzso in these patients performed by zzso zzso Seven zzso and six normal weight, healthy women underwent serial blood sampling at zzso intervals form zzso h for zzso zzso The total area under the curve zzso zzso per zzso was elevated zzso in zzso patients compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso largely due to an increase in the zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the valley mean value was higher in zzso than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was also greater in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso due to a significant increase in zzso peak frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No correlations were observed in these patients between body mass index and any of the parameters of spontaneous zzso release, whereas a positive correlation was found between zzso growth factor I levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso peak height zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso peak zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso valley mean zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, it appears that the enhanced zzso zzso in anorexia zzso is the result of an increased frequency of zzso zzso superimposed on enhanced zzso zzso zzso Although this latter is consistent with a reduction of zzso zzso tone, the former may be accounted for by an increased number of zzso zzso Considering that in normal weight and obese subjects parameters of zzso release are zzso correlated with zzso indexes, the lack of such a negative correlation in our patients suggests that the enhancement of spontaneous zzso release in zzso patients is not merely the consequence of zzso impairment of zzso growth factor I production, but reflects a more complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso
