Fluorescence zzso was used to characterize municipal wastewater at various stages of treatment in order to understand how its zzso signature changes with treatment and how the signal relates to zzso oxygen demand zzso and chemical oxygen demand zzso The impact of size zzso on the zzso signal was also zzso Fluorescence zzso were taken for unfiltered and filtered zzso and zzso zzso samples of zzso settled and secondary treated wastewater zzso sludge and trickling zzso and final zzso Good correlations were observed for zzso diluted wastewater samples between zzso and zzso intensity at zzso 280 zzso zzso 350 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and Peak zzso intensity zzso zzso zzso The majority of the zzso and zzso signal was found to be derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso results indicate that zzso zzso and changes in Peak zzso intensity in particular, could be used for zzso real-time wastewater quality assessment and process control of wastewater treatment zzso
