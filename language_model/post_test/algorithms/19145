The identification of alpha rhythm in the human electroencephalogram zzso is generally a zzso task involving visual inspection of the zzso zzso the occurrence of multiple alpha rhythms is often zzso This paper seeks to automate the process of identifying alpha zzso and zzso their frequency, zzso and zzso as a function of position on the zzso Experimental zzso was fitted with zzso zzso spanning the alpha range, with results zzso by zzso criteria into three distinct zzso no distinguishable alpha peak, a single alpha peak, and two alpha zzso The technique avoids visual bias, zzso spatial information, and is zzso We show that multiple alpha zzso are a common feature of many zzso
