This paper presents a complete zzso of the Principal zzso Analysis zzso zzso in Field zzso Gate zzso zzso devices applied to high rate background zzso of zzso The classical sequential execution of different parts of the zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso has led to the specific development and zzso in hardware of the different stages of zzso such as zzso of the correlation zzso zzso zzso using the zzso method and zzso projections of zzso On the application side, the paper presents a motion detection algorithm, also entirely implemented on the zzso and based on the developed zzso zzso This consists of zzso zzso the differences between the input image and the one obtained by expressing the input image using the zzso linear zzso previously obtained as a background zzso The proposal achieves a high ratio of processed images (up to 120 frames per zzso and high quality zzso results, with a completely embedded and reliable hardware architecture based on commercial zzso sensors and zzso zzso
