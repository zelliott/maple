In zzso screens zzso of small molecules for activity in an in zzso zzso it is common to search for active zzso with at least one example successfully confirmed as an zzso The number of active scaffolds better reflects the success of the screen than the number of active zzso Many existing zzso for deciding which hits should be sent for zzso testing neglect this zzso 

We derived a new extension of a recently proposed economic zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso changing which hits are sent for zzso zzso maximize the number of scaffolds with at least one confirmed zzso In both retrospective and prospective experiments, zzso accurately predicted the number of scaffold discoveries in a batch of zzso experiments, improved the rate of scaffold discovery by zzso and was surprisingly robust to the size of the zzso test zzso As an extension of our previously reported economic zzso zzso can be used to decide the optimal number of hits to send for zzso testing by zzso computing the cost of discovering an additional scaffold, the marginal cost of zzso
