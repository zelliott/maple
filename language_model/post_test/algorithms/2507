The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of fused diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and planning zzso scans on zzso of lung cancer for zzso 

Five radiation zzso zzso five radiation zzso zzso and a zzso contoured five cases of zzso cell lung zzso The CT alone, the diagnostic zzso and planning zzso each registered to the CT, were used to zzso three zzso The zzso index zzso was used to compare each volume with a reference zzso 

Although there was considerable zzso zzso in CT zzso there was no significant difference between mean volumes of the gross zzso volume for the zzso and radiation zzso zzso using any zzso There was no increase in zzso with the addition of zzso either diagnostic or planning, for the zzso However, the volumes of the radiation zzso zzso showed a significant increase in zzso from zzso with CT alone to zzso and zzso with diagnostic zzso and planning zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Mean variation at the zzso interface was significantly reduced with addition of registered zzso 

The zzso of zzso with the reference zzso did not significantly increase with use of integrated zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of radiation zzso zzso became more zzso with the zzso
