We propose a universal approach for analysis and fast simulations of stiff zzso zzso networks, which rests on elimination of fast chemical species without a loss of information about zzso zzso fluctuations of the slow zzso Our approach is similar to the zzso approximation in quantum mechanics and follows from the zzso path integral representation of the zzso generating function of reaction zzso In applications with a small number of chemical zzso it produces zzso expressions for zzso of chemical zzso between the slow zzso This allows for a zzso zzso representation and can be used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As an example, we derive the zzso description for a chain of zzso reactions and show that the zzso and the microscopic simulations agree, but the former is 3 orders of magnitude zzso
