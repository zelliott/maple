A procedure based on release rates is proposed for the establishment of dissolution specifications that ensure the zzso of a test and a reference zzso This zzso which confines zzso (the maximum concentration of the drug in zzso and zzso (the area under the zzso curve, zzso to zzso values within any desired range zzso to a reference zzso can be used as an alternative to the methods presented in the zzso zzso or the zzso The method is appropriate for zzso or zzso release products with linear Level A in zzso zzso correlations zzso Based on the result that the relative difference in zzso must always be smaller than the relative difference in the zzso rate zzso (for any test and reference products of a given zzso the zzso zzso specifications are zzso These zzso which are identical for both zzso and zzso release products, are of general zzso They depend only on the relative zzso of release, but are otherwise drug or zzso zzso For certain extended release products demonstrating a constant release rate that is unaffected by dissolution conditions zzso allowing the assumption of Level A zzso the zzso zzso dissolution limits are zzso even when in zzso data is not zzso If the reference product in zzso data is available, wider limits (which are product zzso may be zzso If the drug disposition is zzso the specifications generated are the zzso zzso They are termed the zzso zzso In the case of a zzso zzso the limits set by the procedure will zzso not be the zzso zzso Although the method is based on zzso models, it is essentially model independent in the sense that microscopic modeling is redundant for its zzso
