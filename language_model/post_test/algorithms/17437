We describe here an zzso for distinguishing sequential from zzso folding zzso Several experiments have recently suggested that most of the proteins that are zzso in the zzso cell may fold zzso This proposed folding mechanism in zzso is particularly advantageous to the zzso In the absence of zzso the probability that a zzso folding protein will zzso is reduced zzso The problem we address here is devising a procedure that would differentiate between the two types of folding zzso zzso of sequential folding may be found in structures where consecutive fragments of the chain interact with each zzso In such cases, the folding complexity may be viewed as being zzso On the other hand, higher folding complexity suggests that at least a portion of the zzso backbone folds back upon itself to form three-dimensional zzso interactions with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we look at the mechanism of folding of the zzso via analysis of its complexity, that is, through the zzso interactions formed by zzso segments on the zzso zzso To zzso zzso the structure into zzso interacting fragments, we either cut it into compact zzso folding units or into a set of hypothetical, zzso highly populated, zzso fragments zzso zzso of the zzso In sequential zzso successive building blocks interact with each other from the zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the results of the parsing differentiate between zzso zzso zzso folded zzso The automated assessment of the folding complexity provides insight into both the likelihood of zzso and the kinetic folding rate of the given zzso In terms of the funnel free energy landscape theory, a protein that truly follows the mechanism of sequential zzso in principle, encounters zzso free energy zzso A simple zzso folded protein should, therefore, be less error prone and fold faster than a protein with a complex folding zzso
