Many image analysis systems are available for processing the images produced by laser scanning of DNA zzso The image processing system takes zzso intensity data and converts it to a set of zzso expression or copy number zzso that will be used in further zzso Image analysis systems currently in use differ with regard to the specific zzso they zzso ease of use, and zzso Thus, it would be desirable to have an objective means of comparing zzso Here we describe a systematic method of comparing image processing results produced by different image analysis systems using a series of replicate zzso zzso We demonstrate the method with a comparison of zzso zzso data generated by the zzso Spot and the zzso image processing zzso
