The function of zzso protein is closely correlated with its zzso zzso The number of newly found protein sequences entering into data banks is rapidly increasing with the success of human zzso zzso It is highly desirable to predict a protein zzso automatically from its zzso acid zzso In this paper, zzso acid zzso patterns and average zzso density zzso are introduced to define zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso predictor is used to predict zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to find the zzso weight factors which are very important in this zzso As such, high success rates are obtained by both zzso test zzso and zzso test zzso More than zzso zzso accuracy is achieved in independent zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the proposed method is zzso And, the method illuminates that the protein zzso location can be predicted from its surface zzso characteristic of protein zzso
