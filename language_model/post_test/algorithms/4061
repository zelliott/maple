This paper presents a comparative study on the relative performance of alternative strategies for zzso an individualized central zzso blood pressure zzso zzso Based on the transmission line representation of the central zzso zzso line, a fully individualized zzso 1), two partially individualized zzso 2 and zzso 3 ), and a fully zzso zzso transfer functions zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso were constructed using experimental data collected from nine zzso zzso The central zzso zzso zzso estimated by these transfer functions were compared against their measured gold standards, with the zzso zzso error and the absolute errors associated with zzso and pulse pressures as performance zzso Overall, the advantage of the individualized over the zzso approach was modest but zzso The superiority of the individualized approach to its zzso counterpart was increasingly pronounced under zzso or extreme zzso conditions, as the zzso pulse transit time deviated from the averaged nominal zzso The results suggest that the use of a fully individualized transfer function zzso 1) is strongly recommended for zzso zzso conditions, whereas a partially zzso 2 and zzso 3) or even fully zzso transfer function zzso may also yield acceptable performance under nominal zzso zzso
