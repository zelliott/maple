Two new zzso programs FRED zzso Scientific zzso and Glide zzso zzso in combination with various scoring functions implemented in these programs have been evaluated against a variety of seven protein targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso A, zzso in order to assess their accuracy in virtual zzso zzso of known zzso were added to and ranked relative to a random library of zzso zzso Performance was compared in terms of enrichment factors and CPU time zzso zzso and specific features of the two new tools are discussed and compared to previously published results using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso In addition, general criteria for the selection of zzso zzso and scoring functions based on zzso characteristics of specific protein targets are zzso Figure zzso factors obtained with zzso Glide and FRED zzso engines in combination with different scoring functions for seven selected targets with highly variable binding sites
