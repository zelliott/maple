We study the problem of zzso a zzso solid with a union of overlapping zzso In comparison with a state-of-the-art approach, our method offers more than an order of magnitude zzso and achieves a tighter approximation in terms of volume difference with the original solid while using fewer zzso The spheres generated by our method are internal and zzso to the zzso boundary, which permits an exact error analysis, fast updates under local feature size preserving zzso and conservative zzso We show that our zzso spheres offer superior time and error performance in approximate separation distance tests than the state-of-the-art method for sphere set approximation for the class of zzso zzso We envision that our zzso approximation will also prove useful for a range of other applications, including shape matching and shape zzso
