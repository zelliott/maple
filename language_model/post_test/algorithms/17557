It is pointed out that the so called momentum method, much used in the neural network literature as an acceleration of the zzso method, is a stationary version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the continuous zzso method known as heavy ball with friction are also zzso In both cases, zzso zzso choices of the so called learning rate and momentum parameters are obtained using a control zzso function analysis of the zzso
