We present two variations of a novel zzso technique capable of simultaneously measuring multiple targets with high zzso The technique performs a zzso phase measurement by application of a four point phase shifting algorithm, with zzso switching between points to allow zzso measurement based upon propagation delay zzso By zzso zzso and shifting complexity into signal processing, both zzso zzso significant complexity reductions over comparable zzso The first zzso performs a typical coherent detection with a dedicated reference field and achieves a displacement noise floor zzso zzso above 50 zzso The second allows for removal of the dedicated reference, resulting in further zzso and improved low frequency performance with a 1 zzso noise floor measured down to 20 zzso These results represent the most sensitive measurement performed using this style of zzso whilst simultaneously reducing the zzso zzso
