We have developed an zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso vascular structures from zzso zzso zzso Previously we evaluated the accuracy of the zzso zzso on a zzso level in terms of inclusion and exclusion of vascular and background zzso In this paper we evaluate the diagnostic zzso of the zzso zzso By diagnostic zzso we mean that the data preserves the structural information necessary for diagnostic zzso This evaluation is necessary to establish the potential usefulness of the zzso for improved image display, or whether the segmented data could form the basis of a computerized analysis zzso We assessed diagnostic zzso by measuring how well human observers could detect zzso in the segmented data zzso zzso zzso of 30 zzso cases containing 29 zzso was zzso Image display used zzso zzso with shaded surface highlighting that were generated from the segmented zzso Three zzso independently reviewed the generated zzso images for zzso The observers had zzso sensitivity zzso for zzso larger than zzso with zzso false zzso per zzso Good agreement with the gold standard for describing aneurysm size and orientation was zzso These preliminary results suggest that the zzso has diagnostic zzso with the original data and may be useful for improved zzso or automated analysis of the zzso
