We have analyzed the implications of a simple zzso mathematical model zzso and Schmidt, zzso to anticipate the limits of zzso zzso action within single zzso The zzso equations are derived for four special cases representing the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso concurrent zzso exclusion and zzso H action, and zzso decreased delivery of mature zzso to the zzso due to zzso zzso interference with zzso zzso or zzso zzso relationships have been derived for these mechanisms under ideal zzso Our results indicate that frequently translated zzso producing stable proteins are the most attractive zzso targets because these protein levels are sensitive to the changes in the zzso levels that can be zzso using zzso zzso The zzso solutions show that both zzso and protein zzso can determine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso A rapid onset of effect will be observed when the zzso is rapidly zzso and slowly translated and when the translated protein is rapidly zzso When the protein is slowly zzso the zzso of effect are limited by protein zzso When the zzso rate constant is large compared to the absolute difference between the zzso and protein degradation rate constants, the zzso of zzso action are determined by both degradation rate zzso but are limited by the slower of the two zzso zzso We also show that the zzso and zzso solutions may be used to design experiments that discriminate among mechanisms of zzso zzso
