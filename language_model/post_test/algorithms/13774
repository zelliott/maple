This paper describes two new methods to solve the following zzso zzso Given zzso noisy zzso zzso i zzso zzso zzso of the response of a system to a known input zzso where zzso indicates zzso and zzso noisy zzso zzso i zzso zzso zzso of the response of a system to an unknown input zzso obtain an estimate of zzso and zzso (the unit impulse response function of the zzso under the model: zzso see zzso where zzso are independent zzso distributed random zzso Both methods use zzso functions to represent the unknown functions, and they automatically select the zzso functions representing the unknown input and unit impulse response zzso The first method estimates separately the unit impulse response function and the zzso recasting the problem in terms of zzso linear zzso The second method jointly estimates the unit impulse response function and the input function, recasting the problem in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and real data analysis are zzso
