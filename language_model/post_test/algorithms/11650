Class distinction is a supervised learning approach that has been successfully employed in the analysis of zzso gene expression zzso Identification of a set of genes that predicts differential biological states allows for the development of basic and clinical scientific approaches to the diagnosis of zzso The Independent zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed to provide a more biologically relevant search criterion during predictor selection by embracing the inherent zzso of gene expression in any biological zzso The four components of zzso include zzso zzso of raw zzso zzso assignment of weights to genes from both zzso zzso counting of votes to determine optimal number of predictor genes for class zzso zzso calculation of prediction strengths for zzso zzso The search criteria employed by zzso is designed to identify not only genes that are consistently expressed at one level in one class and at a consistently different level in another class but identify genes that are variable in one class and consistent in zzso The result is a novel approach to accurately select biologically relevant zzso of differential disease states from a small number of zzso zzso 

The data described zzso zzso zzso to analyze the large zzso training and test data set zzso et zzso 1999, Science, zzso zzso in addition to a smaller data set consisting of an animal model of the childhood neurodegenerative disorder, zzso disease, generated for this zzso Both of the analyses presented zzso have correctly predicted biologically relevant zzso that can be used for disease zzso irrespective of sample zzso Furthermore, the results have provided candidate proteins for future study in understanding the disease process and the identification of potential targets for therapeutic zzso
