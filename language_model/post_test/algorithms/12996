Within the framework of transition path sampling zzso zzso energies can be zzso as path ensemble averages without a zzso information about the reaction mechanism zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso zzso energies zzso for different conditions can then be used to determine by zzso integration the rate constant for a system of interest from the rate constant known for a reference zzso However, in systems with complex potential energy surfaces, multiple reaction pathways may exist making zzso sampling of trajectory space zzso Here, we present a combination of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso for an efficient sampling of the transition path zzso This method, zzso by zzso has the advantage that from one single zzso zzso energies at different temperatures can be determined even for systems with multiple reaction zzso The proposed methodology for rate constant calculations does not require the knowledge of the reaction coordinate and is generally zzso to zzso and zzso zzso We illustrate the zzso of this technique by studying a two-dimensional toy system consisting of a zzso zzso immersed in a fluid of repulsive soft zzso We also provide an expression for the calculation of zzso volumes from path averages such that the pressure dependence of the rate constant can be obtained by zzso zzso
