We briefly review the application of zzso recording materials in the area of holographic data zzso In particular we discuss the recent development of the zzso zzso Driven zzso zzso zzso this model we develop simple zzso zzso expressions describing the spatial frequency response of zzso zzso The assumptions made in the derivation of these zzso are described and their ranges of zzso are zzso The effects of particular physical parameters of a zzso on the material response are zzso
