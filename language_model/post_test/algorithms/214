zzso zzso iron containing systems are versatile and vital zzso of zzso zzso reactions in many zzso zzso the rate constant of zzso zzso with the strength of the zzso bond that is broken in the zzso The zzso reason behind these zzso however, has never been zzso In this work results of a series of density functional theory calculations of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a 2 zzso zzso structural motif analogous to zzso dependent zzso are zzso The calculations show that these zzso are very efficient and able to zzso strong zzso bonds, zzso the hydrogen abstraction barriers correlate zzso with the strength of the zzso bond of the zzso that is zzso These trends have been rationalized using a zzso bond zzso zzso zzso which explains the correlation using electron transfer mechanisms in the hydrogen abstraction zzso We also rationalized the subsequent reaction step for radical rebound and show that the barrier is zzso to the electron affinity of the zzso intermediate zzso It is shown that zzso zzso complexes have a larger electron affinity than zzso zzso complexes and therefore also experience larger radical rebound zzso which may have implications for product zzso and zzso zzso Thus, detailed comparisons between zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveal the fundamental differences in zzso capabilities of these important classes of zzso in zzso and synthetic zzso for the first time and enable us to make predictions of experimental zzso
