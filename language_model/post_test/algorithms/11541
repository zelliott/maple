zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been predicted to improve vascular and organ enhancement with little effect on image zzso To see if this was the case, we studied 100 patients referred for zzso zzso where we would normally have performed dynamic incremental zzso zzso zzso Patients were randomly allocated to undergo either standard zzso or zzso The resulting images were zzso for overall quality, the degree of contrast medium enhancement and the extent of zzso associated with the zzso No statistically significant difference in overall image quality between zzso and zzso was found, apart from images of the zzso zzso where the quality was significantly worse on zzso zzso zzso zzso due to the low zzso zzso zzso enhancement was better with zzso although only for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the group taken as a whole zzso zzso zzso did this improvement reach statistical zzso There was no statistically significant difference between the extent of zzso observed in the two zzso As expected, all acquisition times were shorter using zzso The benefits of zzso have been well described and include the absolute zzso of the reconstructed images and the ability to obtain many images at peak contrast zzso We have confirmed the latter zzso We are now also satisfied that there is no appreciable loss of overall image quality except where large volumes of solid tissue are being examined zzso zzso
