zzso design is one of the most important tasks in successful zzso acid zzso zzso We propose a zzso evolutionary zzso method for zzso probe design based on the zzso nature of the probe design zzso The proposed zzso evolutionary approach has several distinguished features, compared with previous zzso First, the evolutionary approach can find better probe sets than existing simple filtering methods with fixed threshold zzso Second, the zzso approach can easily incorporate the user's custom criteria or change the existing zzso Third, our approach tries to zzso the combination of zzso for the given set of zzso in contrast to other tools that independently search each gene for qualifying zzso Lastly, the zzso zzso method provides various sets of probe combinations, among which the user can choose, depending on the target zzso The proposed method is implemented as a platform called zzso and is available for service on the zzso We test the performance of zzso by designing probe sets for 19 types of Human zzso and 52 genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The design results from zzso are proven to be superior to those from well-known existing probe design tools, such as zzso and zzso
