The mathematical aspects of the problem of the interpretation of the experimental data on the zzso zzso of materials by making use of the linear and zzso relaxation model proposed by zzso are zzso Three idealized cases of the growth of the strain from the zero value of its value a zzso zzso that it will keep at zzso greater than or equal to zzso are zzso Case zzso jump at zzso zzso zzso Case zzso linear law of growth in the zzso 0 less than or equal to zzso less than or equal to zzso Case zzso zzso law of growth in the same zzso The exact zzso for calculation of the stress are zzso From them the simple zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressions are zzso These expressions are used for comparison of the Cases 1, 2, zzso An zzso is suggested for the zzso zzso evaluation of the parameters of the linear model on the basis of the experimental data, corresponding to Case 1, 2 or zzso
