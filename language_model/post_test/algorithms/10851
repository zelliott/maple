zzso modifications zzso are of great biological zzso Most existing approaches perform a restrictive search that can only take into account a few types of zzso and ignore all zzso We describe an zzso zzso search zzso that searches for all types of zzso at once in a blind mode, zzso without knowing which zzso exist in a zzso The blind zzso identification opens a possibility to study the extent and zzso of different types of zzso still an open problem in zzso Using our new algorithm, we were able to construct a two-dimensional zzso frequency zzso that reflects the number of zzso zzso in a sample for each putative zzso type and each zzso zzso Application of this approach to a large zzso zzso resulted in the largest set of zzso reported for a single zzso sample so zzso We demonstrate an excellent correlation between high values in the zzso frequency zzso and known zzso thus zzso our zzso We further argue that the zzso frequency zzso may reveal some still unknown modifications that warrant further experimental zzso
