To zzso the clinical usefulness of serial zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso in comparison with zzso zzso investigations were performed in 41 patients with zzso documented coronary artery zzso Both zzso were administered simultaneously during zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired immediately after stress, and delayed imaging was performed after 1 h for zzso and 4 h for zzso zzso were evaluated both zzso and zzso using a newly developed zzso for automated image zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso was closely correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Both zzso also revealed a similar sensitivity for the identification of individual coronary artery zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with identical specificity zzso The number of persistent zzso however, was significantly higher with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that visual analysis of serial zzso zzso may overestimate the presence of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, previous Q wave zzso zzso was associated with a decreased regional zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso P zzso zzso The data indicate that serial zzso zzso with zzso is essentially as sensitive as zzso with zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso however, is required for the evaluation of tissue zzso
