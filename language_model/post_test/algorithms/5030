Many decoding zzso for brain machine zzso zzso estimate hand movement from zzso spike rates, which do not fully exploit the resolution contained in spike timing and may exclude rich neural dynamics from the zzso More recently, an zzso filtering method based on a zzso approach to reconstruct the neural state from the observed spike times has been zzso However, it assumes and zzso a zzso distributed state zzso density, which in general is too zzso We have also proposed a sequential zzso Carlo zzso methodology to reconstruct the zzso states directly from the zzso spike zzso This letter presents a systematic testing of this zzso in a simulated neural spike train decoding experiment and then in zzso zzso Compared to a zzso zzso filtering zzso with a linear observation model and a zzso approximation (the counterpart for point processes of the Kalman zzso our sequential zzso Carlo zzso methodology exploits a detailed zzso model zzso zzso derived for each zzso from training zzso However, this added complexity is translated into higher performance with real zzso To deal with the intrinsic spike randomness in online zzso several synthetic spike trains are generated from the intensity function estimated from the zzso and zzso as extra model zzso in an attempt to decrease the zzso in the zzso zzso The performance of the sequential zzso Carlo zzso methodology zzso with this synthetic spike input provides improved zzso which raises interesting questions and helps explain the overall modeling requirements zzso
