Many common solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance problems take advantage of the zzso of the underlying zzso to simplify the zzso of an zzso Most of the zzso methods used, however, require the time step between observations to be some zzso or zzso multiple of the period, thereby restricting the observation zzso zzso of zzso observations are usually reduced to zzso force direct methods resulting in many demanding zzso zzso For large spin systems, the zzso zzso becomes the limiting zzso A simple method that can dramatically reduce the number of zzso zzso required to calculate the time evolution when the observation time step is some rational fraction of the period of the zzso is zzso The zzso zzso two different zzso zzso One uses pattern matching and additional memory storage, while the other zzso generates the zzso via time zzso The net result is a significant speed improvement for some types of zzso zzso
