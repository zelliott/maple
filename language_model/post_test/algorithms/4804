The dynamics of fluid zzso in simple zzso flow is studied using zzso simulations of zzso zzso surfaces, as well as a theoretical approach based on two zzso a shape zzso and the inclination angle, which has no adjustable zzso We show that, between the well-known zzso and tumbling states, a new zzso state can zzso We predict the dynamic phase zzso as a function of the zzso rate, the zzso of the membrane and the internal fluid, and the reduced zzso zzso Our results agree well with recent zzso
