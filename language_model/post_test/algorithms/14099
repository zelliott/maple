Data are reported on the zzso states of a series of zzso zzso type alternating zzso based on pulse zzso transfer and flash zzso zzso From the pulse zzso experiments, zzso are given for eight zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso yields for zzso formation zzso have been obtained by flash zzso following laser zzso and in one case by zzso zzso In addition, yields of zzso formation of zzso oxygen have been determined by zzso zzso and are, in general, in excellent agreement with the zzso zzso In all cases, the presence of zzso units is seen to increase zzso quantum yields, probably because of the presence of the heavy sulfur zzso However, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso low yields of zzso formation are zzso With three of the zzso the energies of the zzso states have been zzso With zzso the zzso energy is virtually identical to that of zzso In contrast, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso energies are closer to those of zzso zzso indicating that there is significant zzso between zzso and zzso units but also that there is a more localized zzso state than with the zzso
