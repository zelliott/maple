zzso zzso zzso are often well suited for zzso problems involving several conflicting zzso It is more suitable to model the protein structure prediction problem as a zzso zzso problem since the potential energy functions used in the literature to evaluate the zzso of a protein are based on the calculations of two different interaction zzso local zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and experiments have shown that those types of interactions are in conflict, by using the potential energy function, zzso at Harvard zzso zzso In this paper, we have modified the immune inspired zzso zzso evolutionary strategy zzso zzso and zzso it as zzso It can effectively exploit some prior knowledge about the zzso zzso which is one of the most important driving forces in protein folding to make zzso The proposed zzso is comparable with other evolutionary zzso proposed in literature, both in terms of best solution found and the zzso time and often results in much better search ability than that of the zzso zzso
