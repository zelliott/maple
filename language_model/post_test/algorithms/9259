The use of an effective zzso potential often involves a compromise between more accurate, complex functional forms and more zzso simple zzso To study this choice in detail, we systematically derive zzso zzso pair zzso that accurately reproduce the zzso zzso distribution function of the zzso water model at state points over density ranges from zzso to zzso zzso and temperature ranges from 235 to 310 zzso Although by construction these effective zzso correctly represent the zzso zzso of zzso water, they do not accurately resolve other zzso properties such as the zzso pressure, the internal energy, or zzso zzso Because at a given state point the pair potential that reproduces the pair structure is unique, we have therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to simultaneously represent the pair structure and several key equilibrium zzso properties of water with zzso dependent zzso zzso pair zzso We argue that such zzso problems are related to, but different from, more widely acknowledged zzso problems and discuss in detail the implications this has for the modeling of water and other liquids by zzso zzso Nevertheless, regardless of zzso zzso the zzso dependent effective zzso for water do generate structural and zzso zzso
