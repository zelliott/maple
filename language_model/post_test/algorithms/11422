We investigate a recent methodology we have proposed to extract valuable information on the competitiveness of countries and complexity of products from trade zzso Standard economic theories predict a high level of specialization of countries in specific industrial zzso However, a direct analysis of the official databases of exported products by all countries shows that the actual situation is very zzso Countries commonly considered as developed ones are extremely zzso exporting a large variety of products from very simple to very zzso At the same time countries generally considered as less developed export only the products also exported by the majority of zzso This situation calls for the introduction of a zzso and zzso measure for country economy complexity which zzso the hidden potential for development and zzso The statistical approach we present here consists of coupled zzso maps relating the zzso of countries to the complexity of their zzso The fixed point of this transformation defines a metrics for the fitness of countries and the complexity of zzso We argue that the key point to properly extract the economic information is the zzso of the map which is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting zzso We present a detailed comparison of the results of this approach directly with those of the zzso of Reflections by Hidalgo and zzso showing the better performance of our method and a more solid economic, scientific and consistent zzso
