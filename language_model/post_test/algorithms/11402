To improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis in zzso breakdown zzso the plasma produced by a zzso laser from steel targets was confined by a zzso A number of elements with low zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the steel samples were zzso After the zzso of the cavity dimension and laser zzso significant enhancement factors of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso intensity of zzso zzso and zzso lines, respectively, were achieved at a laser zzso of zzso zzso using a zzso cavity zzso 5 zzso More importantly, the correlation zzso of the V I zzso I zzso zzso was increased from zzso (without the zzso to zzso (with the zzso and similar results for zzso I zzso I zzso zzso and zzso I zzso I zzso zzso were also zzso zzso it was demonstrated that the accuracy of quantitative analysis with low concentration elements in steel samples was improved, because the plasma became uniform with spatial zzso The results of this study provide a new zzso for improving the accuracy of quantitative analysis of zzso
