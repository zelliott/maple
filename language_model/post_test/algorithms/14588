zzso structures zzso are the building blocks of protein zzso zzso zzso prediction of zzso can be one important step toward building a zzso structure from the specified secondary zzso How to improve the accuracy of prediction of zzso by effectively incorporating the sequence order effects is an important and challenging zzso Based on a different form of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso a novel approach for feature representation of zzso is zzso zzso acid basic compositions, zzso zzso and zzso acid composition distribution are incorporated to represent the compositional features of zzso Each zzso structural motif is characterized as a zzso of 36 zzso In addition, we propose a novel prediction system by using zzso and zzso zzso as zzso Our method is trained and tested on zzso zzso containing zzso zzso The highest overall accuracy for the training zzso and the independent testing zzso are zzso and zzso zzso
