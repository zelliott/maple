The following three zzso combinations were zzso a) a combination of zzso film and zzso emitting screens, b) a combination of zzso emitting screens and film, and c) a conventional green zzso zzso zzso zzso of a specially designed zzso phantom zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with bar patterns of lead and plaster and of air, respectively were obtained using the following zzso 12 pulse zzso zzso zzso focus size, zzso zzso aluminum zzso a grid with 40 zzso zzso and a zzso distance of zzso zzso Image analysis was performed using an zzso system and a zzso zzso zzso Display conditions were the zzso display distance zzso zzso a zzso film objective zzso zzso a video camera tube with a zzso zzso 625 lines zzso zzso an zzso image zzso of 512 zzso 512 zzso with a resolution of 7 zzso the projected zzso area was zzso zzso Grey scale ranges were measured on a line perpendicular to the grouped bar zzso The difference between the maximum and minimum density value served as zzso The spatial resolution of the detector system was measured when the signal value was three times higher than the standard zzso of the means of multiple density zzso The results showed considerable advantages of the two new zzso combinations as compared to the conventional zzso zzso The result was contradictory to the findings with pure visual assessment of thresholds zzso I) that had found no zzso The authors concluded that zzso interactive image analysis zzso serve as an objective measure and are specifically advantageous when small differences in image quality are to be zzso
