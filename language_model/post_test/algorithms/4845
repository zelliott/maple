In this work, two different approaches are proposed for region of interest zzso zzso using zzso ultrasound zzso zzso The two methods aim to extract zzso features that are able to characterize suspicious regions in the zzso zzso Both proposed methods are based on zzso analysis that is characterized by its high zzso in both the frequency and the spatial zzso Being highly localized in both zzso the proposed methods are expected to accurately identify the suspicious zzso On one hand, the first method depends on a zzso filter that captures the high frequency changes in the image zzso On the other hand, the second method depends on zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso It is shown in this paper that both methods reveal details in the zzso which correlate with their pathological zzso It was found that there is a good match between the regions identified using the two methods, a result that supports the ability of each of the proposed methods to mimic the zzso decision in identifying suspicious zzso zzso two zzso zzso methods is important since the only available zzso is the zzso suspicious regions, and there is a need to support the results obtained by either one of the proposed zzso This work is mainly a preliminary proof of concept study that will ultimately be expanded to a larger scale study whose aim will be introducing an assisting tool to help the zzso identify the suspicious zzso
