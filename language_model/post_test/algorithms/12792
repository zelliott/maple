We present a zzso efficient method for flexible refinement of zzso predictions that reflects observed motions within a zzso structural zzso Using structural zzso we derive deformation models that capture likely zzso The models or zzso typically align along a rigid core, with a handful of flexible zzso zzso and zzso A few replicates can generate a much larger number of zzso by exchanging each flexible region independently of the zzso In this way, 10 replicates of a protein having 6 flexible regions can be used to generate a million zzso of a zzso While this has obvious advantages in terms of zzso the cost of assessing energies at every zzso is prohibitive, particularly when both molecules are zzso Our approach addresses this zzso explosion, using key assumptions to compress the sampling by many orders of zzso zzso can perform zzso zzso from a list of rigid zzso predictions and find nearby structures to any promising cluster zzso These predicted complexes can then be refined and zzso zzso scoring function includes a zzso potential softened using the zzso decomposition, a zzso term derived from the Atomic zzso Energy function, zzso zzso hydrogen zzso and terms to model zzso and zzso zzso zzso has performed well on several recent zzso zzso We are presently zzso zzso on the complete zzso benchmark set to fully establish its utility in refining rigid zzso predictions and identifying zzso zzso
