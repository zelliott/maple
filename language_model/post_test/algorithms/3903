To define a quantitative zzso zzso for the risk of zzso zzso zzso in newborns zzso 34 zzso zzso 

We conducted a retrospective zzso zzso study that used split zzso Data collected on each infant included zzso risk at birth based on objective maternal factors, zzso specific clinical zzso and vital signs during the first 24 hours after zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso regression, we developed a risk zzso scheme for zzso on the derivation zzso This scheme was then applied to the validation zzso 

Using a base population of zzso live zzso zzso 34 zzso gestation at 14 hospitals between 1993 and 2007, we identified all 350 zzso cases zzso hours of age and frequency matched them by hospital and year of birth to zzso zzso Using maternal and zzso data, we defined a risk zzso scheme that divided the zzso population into 3 groups: treat zzso zzso of all live zzso zzso of all zzso cases, zzso zzso of zzso live zzso observe and evaluate zzso of zzso zzso of cases, zzso and continued observation zzso of zzso zzso of cases, zzso zzso 

It is possible to combine objective maternal data with evolving objective zzso clinical findings to define more efficient strategies for the evaluation and treatment of zzso in term and late zzso zzso zzso application of our scheme could result in decreased zzso treatment in zzso to zzso US newborns each zzso
