Modeling potential disease spread in wildlife populations is important for zzso responding to and recovering from a foreign animal disease zzso To make spatial epidemic predictions, the target animal species of interest must first be represented in zzso We conducted a series of simulation experiments to determine how estimates of the spatial distribution of zzso deer impact the predicted magnitude and distribution of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso were simulated using a zzso geographic zzso zzso The study region was a zzso area (24 zzso zzso of southern zzso zzso used for creating deer zzso included zzso zzso zzso and remotely sensed image zzso The zzso and zzso of the predicted outbreaks were evaluated by comparing the median number of deer infected and median area affected zzso zzso The methods were further evaluated for similar zzso power by comparing the model predicted zzso with zzso pair group method with zzso mean zzso zzso There were significant differences in the estimated number of deer in the study region, based on the zzso zzso procedure used zzso 385 zzso zzso There were also substantial differences in the predicted magnitude of the zzso outbreaks zzso 1 zzso zzso and land area affected zzso zzso zzso for the different estimated animal zzso zzso zzso indicated there were two main groups of zzso and one zzso We recommend that one distribution from each of these two groups be used to model the range of possible zzso zzso included in cluster 1 (such as zzso zzso could be used in conjunction with any of the methods in cluster 2, which included zzso zzso split by zzso or zzso at the regional level, to represent the zzso in the model predicted outbreak zzso How animal populations are represented needs to be considered in all spatial disease spread zzso
