An experimental study of some assorted zzso properties is carried out in order to zzso under high zzso pressure, the zzso zzso zzso zzso against temperature by a modified zzso zzso The zzso pressure and temperature ranges exploited in this experimental investigation, of various zzso properties, are extended respectively from zzso to 100 zzso and from 10 to 100 degrees zzso The zzso pressure step of two consecutive zzso is 10 zzso and the temperature step is 10 degrees zzso The measured values show that, in zzso the density zzso and the zzso zzso wave zzso zzso increase zzso with the imposed zzso pressure and decrease zzso with zzso The present investigation shows that the zzso zzso zzso is a function of the imposed zzso pressure and zzso The accuracy of the measured zzso values is estimated at about zzso
