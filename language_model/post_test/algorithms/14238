Computer models of zzso trees can be generated from zzso principles using the zzso of constrained constructive zzso zzso Up to now this zzso could handle only tissue areas of convex shape, without zzso zzso is now generalized to cope also with zzso organ shapes, possibly featuring external as well as internal zzso This allows the modeling of a much larger class of interesting real zzso zzso The concept of a generalized zzso was developed to represent arbitrary zzso shapes zzso and incorporate them as boundary conditions to zzso zzso may be derived from zzso representations as well as from finite element zzso obtained from organ zzso To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the zzso growth of an zzso tree model is confined to some part of an elliptical zzso representing the free wall of the left zzso of the zzso
