Recent studies suggest that the zzso is organized into blocks of zzso and efforts to create a zzso zzso map of zzso zzso zzso are already zzso zzso blocks are defined zzso and to date several zzso have been zzso However, little is known about their relative performance in real data or about the impact of zzso zzso and zzso choices on the detection of zzso blocks and the markers that tag zzso Here we present a formal comparison of two major zzso a linkage zzso zzso method and a dynamic programming zzso zzso in three zzso regions differing in gene content and zzso zzso The two methods produced zzso different zzso zzso identified fewer and larger zzso blocks as well as a smaller set of tag zzso than the zzso zzso For both methods, the results were strongly dependent on the zzso zzso zzso the minor zzso frequency led to an up to zzso increase in the number of zzso blocks and tag zzso Definition of zzso blocks and tag zzso was also sensitive to zzso changes, but the results could not be zzso simply by zzso zzso These results show that two major methods for detecting zzso blocks and tag zzso can produce different results in the same data and that these results are sensitive to marker zzso zzso and zzso zzso More information is needed to guide the choice of method, marker zzso zzso and parameters in the development of a zzso zzso
