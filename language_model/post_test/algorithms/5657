The zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso in the zzso wing disc, and spreads through the target tissue in order to form a long range concentration zzso Despite extensive studies, the mechanism by which the zzso zzso is formed remains zzso Two opposing mechanisms have been zzso zzso zzso zzso and restricted zzso diffusion zzso In these scenarios the zzso for zzso plays different zzso In the zzso model it is essential for zzso zzso and thus transport of zzso whereas in the RED model it merely zzso zzso distribution by binding it at the cell surface for zzso and subsequent zzso Here we analyzed the effect of zzso zzso clones on the zzso profile in quantitative mathematical models representing transport by either zzso or zzso We then, using novel genetic tools, zzso monitored the actual zzso zzso in wing discs containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso clones reveal that zzso binds in zzso strongly to the type I zzso zzso zzso but not to the type II zzso zzso zzso results with the zzso clones then zzso the zzso model for zzso zzso formation, while supporting the RED model in which the majority of zzso is not bound to zzso zzso Together our results show that zzso zzso cannot account for zzso zzso formation, and support restricted zzso diffusion as the main mechanism for zzso zzso The properties of this zzso in which only a minority of zzso is zzso may facilitate long-range zzso
