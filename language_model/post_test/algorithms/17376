A statistically constrained minimum mean squares error zzso zzso has been shown to be useful in zzso internal zzso distribution by the use of simulated zzso In this study, the performance of the zzso zzso is tested by using measured data from zzso zzso The zzso uses a zzso information on body zzso zzso position, statistical properties of tissue zzso zzso noise and zzso error to calculate the optimum inverse zzso which maps the surface zzso to unknown regional zzso In this study, the zzso is also constrained with the zzso of the zzso error to improve the zzso zzso The data are obtained from two different phantom zzso namely zzso and zzso Using the measured data, the zzso are realized and errors are zzso Then, the results are compared with the results obtained by using a conventional least squares error zzso zzso The zzso model results show similarity with the simulation study results of zzso and zzso On the zzso model, the total zzso error is zzso with the zzso compared with zzso with the zzso It is concluded that the zzso is more robust than the zzso and zzso to measured zzso
