zzso to zzso the performance of zzso cameras for electron detection are investigated with particular emphasis on the difference between the transfer of signal and zzso Similar to the zzso Transfer zzso zzso which describes the spatial frequency dependent zzso of contrast in the image, we introduce a Noise Transfer zzso zzso that describes the transfer of the zzso noise that is inevitably present in any electron zzso A general model for signal and noise transfer by an image zzso is zzso This allows the calculation of zzso and zzso from zzso simulations of the zzso of electrons and photons in the zzso and the optical zzso of the zzso Furthermore, accurate methods to measure the zzso and noise transfer functions zzso are zzso The zzso dependent zzso zzso Efficiency zzso an important figure of merit of the camera which has so far not been measured zzso can be obtained from the measured zzso and zzso The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations and show that the zzso at high spatial zzso is in some cases by a factor of four higher than the zzso This implies that the noise method, which is frequently used to measure the zzso but in fact measures the zzso gives zzso zzso Furthermore, the spatial frequency dependent zzso is lower than previously zzso
