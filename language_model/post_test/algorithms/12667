zzso zzso is a common chest wall anomaly in zzso zzso imaging for zzso zzso is performed with CT, which is used to calculate the Haller index to determine the severity of zzso zzso 

To determine the correlation between Haller index values calculated with zzso chest zzso and those calculated with CT and to zzso with CT as the reference standard, the diagnostic performance of zzso Haller index for identifying cases that meet imaging criteria for surgical correction of zzso zzso 

For the period zzso our zzso information system was searched to identify all children who had undergone CT for Haller index zzso Children who had also undergone zzso chest zzso zzso within 6 months of the CT were included in this retrospective zzso Two zzso independently calculated CT Haller index and zzso Haller zzso Data zzso were tested for zzso with the zzso W zzso The associations between CT Haller index and zzso Haller index were determined with the zzso zzso of rank zzso zzso between CT Haller index and zzso Haller index were tested with the zzso signed rank zzso Haller index values were zzso into positive zzso and negative zzso zzso Using CT as the reference standard, the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso Haller index in identifying children who meet imaging criteria for surgery were zzso 

CT and zzso for evaluation of zzso zzso were available for 32 children zzso zzso median age zzso zzso With CT, the median Haller zzso for observers 1 and 2 were zzso and zzso and with zzso zzso and zzso There were statistically significant correlations between the zzso Haller index and CT Haller index estimated by the two observers zzso correlation zzso zzso confidence zzso for observer zzso zzso zzso and for observer zzso zzso zzso A statistically significant correlation was found between the zzso Haller index calculated by the two observers zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso Using CT Haller index as the reference standard, zzso Haller index had a sensitivity of zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso for observer 1, and a sensitivity of zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso for observer zzso 

zzso Haller index zzso strongly with CT Haller index, has good zzso zzso and has a high diagnostic accuracy for zzso evaluation of zzso zzso We suggest that a CT of the chest is not required for zzso evaluation of zzso zzso and a zzso chest zzso is sufficient for zzso imaging of zzso zzso
