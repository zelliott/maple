zzso are known to regulate both gene expression and protein activity through the use of zzso modifications zzso Common zzso involved in cellular signaling and gene control include zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso have been implicated as an indicator of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that demonstrates both respiratory versatility and the ability to sense and adapt to diverse environmental zzso The data set used in this study consisted of tandem mass zzso derived from zzso phase zzso cultures of zzso zzso either native or shocked with 1 zzso zzso zzso In this study, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated for their ability to scrutinize shotgun zzso data for evidence of zzso The use of conservative scoring filters for peptides or proteins versus creating a zzso first from a zzso search was evaluated with zzso The use of zzso filters for zzso identifications was found to result in optimal identifications of zzso peptides with a zzso false discovery rate zzso for the total data set using the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso to unacceptably high levels when only zzso peptides are zzso zzso was evaluated as a method for confirming zzso peptides zzso identified using zzso however, there was a low identification rate ( approximately zzso for the searched zzso zzso was found to have a much lower, and thus more acceptable, zzso than zzso for zzso zzso Comparisons between zzso and zzso were made with respect to both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a demonstration of this approach, a number of zzso zzso zzso proteins as well as zzso signal zzso proteins were identified as being zzso modified in response to zzso zzso
