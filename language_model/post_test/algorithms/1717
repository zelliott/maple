zzso of zzso aberrations assume circular zzso However, the zzso becomes increasingly elliptical with increase in visual field zzso We address this and other issues concerning peripheral aberration zzso 

One approach uses an elliptical zzso similar to the actual zzso shape, stretched along its minor axis to become a circle so that zzso circular aberration zzso may be zzso Another approach uses a circular zzso whose diameter matches either the larger or smaller dimension of the elliptical zzso Pictorial presentation of zzso influence of wavelength on zzso sign differences between aberrations for fellow eyes, and zzso position to either the visual field or the zzso are zzso 

Examples show differences between the two zzso Each has its advantages and zzso but there are ways to compensate for most zzso Two representations of data are zzso aberration maps at each position in the visual field and maps showing the variation in individual aberration zzso across the zzso 

Based on simplicity of use, zzso of zzso possible departures of zzso pupils from zzso and ease of understanding by zzso the circular zzso approach is preferable to the stretched elliptical approach for studies involving field angles up to 30 zzso
