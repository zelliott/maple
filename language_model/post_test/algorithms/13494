We report a zzso approach for the automatic identification of zzso zzso as well as its application to the zzso database, with more than 5,000 zzso Each zzso in a given analysis is represented by a feature zzso composed of 20 zzso which are then projected into a two-dimensional space by applying principal component zzso zzso kernel density zzso is then used to obtain the probability distribution for the group of cells, so that the cells with highest probabilities are understood as archetypes while those with the smallest probabilities are classified as zzso The potential of the methodology is illustrated in several cases involving uniform cell types as well as cell types for specific animal zzso The results provide insights regarding the distribution of cells, yielding single and zzso zzso and they suggest that zzso cells tend to be more zzso and zzso The proposed methodology can be used in several situations involving one or more categories of cells, as well as for detection of new categories and possible zzso
