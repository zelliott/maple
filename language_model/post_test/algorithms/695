zzso light scattering by zzso particles is crucial in modeling the transport of light in realistic structures such as biological zzso We report the application of novel zzso approaches based on modified zzso and zzso methods that facilitate accurate characterization of light scattering by a wide range of zzso shaped zzso zzso We also demonstrate that these approaches have the potential to address the zzso problem by means of a spectral analysis of the total scattering cross section of arbitrarily shaped zzso
