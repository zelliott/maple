zzso biomass zzso is one of the strategic zzso variables of interest in vegetation zzso The main objective of this study was to evaluate the Support zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso the zzso of zzso from field zzso data and to find out which data zzso approach was the most zzso The most accurate model to predict the total zzso involved zzso and the zzso Band zzso index derived from the zzso removed zzso in the zzso features between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Regarding the green fraction of the zzso the Area Over the Minimum index derived from the zzso removed zzso provided the most accurate model overall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the appropriate zzso features was proved to be crucial to improve the performance of zzso to estimate the total and green zzso zzso by using the zzso derived from those spectral zzso zzso zzso Square zzso could be used as a surrogate for the zzso approach with the Area Over the Minimum index as the independent zzso although the resulting model would not be as zzso
