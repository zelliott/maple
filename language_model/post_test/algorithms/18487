zzso modeling is used to indirectly measure zzso parameters from dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Usually, the unknown parameters of the model are estimated, in any given region of interest zzso by least squares zzso However, when the zzso ratio zzso of PET data is too low, zzso does not allow reliable zzso zzso To overcome this problem, we study in this paper the zzso of approaches originally developed in the zzso literature and referred to as zzso zzso In particular, we consider the zzso two stage zzso method, which, given a set of M zzso drawn on PET images of a given individual, estimates the unknown model parameters of each zzso by exploiting the information contained in all the M zzso After having revised the theory behind zzso we assess its performance versus zzso by using zzso Carlo simulations which allow us to evaluate the bias of the two methods in a variety of zzso Then, we compare the performance of zzso and ITS in two case studies on zzso zzso in human skeletal zzso Both simulated and real case studies results show that a population approach is of potential in modeling PET images since it allows to reliably estimate model parameters also in those zzso where either a bad zzso or a poor sampling zzso zzso scanning and/or short experiment zzso make the use of zzso zzso
