zzso zzso can reduce the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac zzso zzso Bellini et al have previously derived a zzso exact method to compensate for zzso in a uniform zzso Since the human zzso contains structures with differing zzso properties, zzso zzso compensation is required in cardiac zzso Given an estimate of the patient zzso map, we show that the Bellini zzso compensation method can be used in cardiac zzso to provide a zzso accurate reconstruction of a central region in the image which includes the heart and surrounding soft zzso zzso using a mathematical zzso phantom were conducted to evaluate the Bellini method and to compare its performance to the zzso zzso algorithm, and to 180 degrees and 360 degrees filtered zzso zzso with no zzso zzso zzso polar maps and zzso profiles showed that both the Bellini method and the zzso zzso provided zzso accurate reconstructions of the zzso with a substantial reduction in zzso artifacts that were observed in the zzso zzso The zzso load required to implement the Bellini method is approximately equivalent to that required for one iteration of the zzso algorithm, thus it is suitable for routine clinical zzso
