A zzso zzso based on a zzso approximation of the zzso transfer equation zzso is developed to reconstruct scattering characteristics of biological zzso from optical zzso zzso zzso zzso According to the algorithm, biological tissue is considered to be a layered random medium with a set of scattering parameters in each zzso total scattering zzso zzso of a zzso scattering phase function, and probability of zzso which fully describe the zzso signal behavior versus probing zzso The reconstruction of the scattering parameters is performed by their variation to fit the experimental zzso signal by the theoretical one using a zzso genetic zzso The proposed reconstruction procedure is tested on model media with known scattering zzso The possibility to estimate scattering parameters from zzso images is studied for various regimes of zzso signal zzso The developed zzso is applied to reconstruct optical characteristics of zzso and zzso for normal cervical tissue and its zzso and the potential to distinguish between the types of pathological changes in zzso tissue by its zzso images is zzso
