This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of zzso site zzso by applying zzso grammar zzso We used four grammar zzso zzso to zzso 1465 zzso and used zzso zzso to select the best grammar for each zzso The corresponding zzso were embedded into a zzso and used to run zzso site prediction and compare the results with those of zzso the predictor used by the zzso gene zzso We indicate possible paths to improve this performance by using zzso zzso technique to find probability thresholds that will lower zzso zzso
