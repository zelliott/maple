The zzso of the protein energy surface poses a significant challenge to search zzso that seek to obtain a structural characterization of the native zzso Recent research seeks to bias search toward zzso zzso through one-dimensional structural profiles of the protein native zzso Here we investigate the effectiveness of such profiles in a structure prediction setting for proteins of various sizes and zzso We pursue two zzso We first investigate the contribution of structural profiles in comparison to or in conjunction with zzso energy functions in providing an effective energy zzso We conduct this investigation in the context of zzso zzso Carlo with zzso zzso Second, we explore the effectiveness of structural profiles in providing projection coordinates through which to organize the zzso zzso We do so in the context of a zzso search framework proposed in our lab that employs projections of the zzso space to guide zzso Our findings indicate that structural profiles are most effective in obtaining physically realistic zzso zzso when employed in conjunction with zzso energy zzso Our findings also show that these profiles are very effective when employed instead as projection coordinates to guide zzso search toward zzso regions of the zzso zzso
