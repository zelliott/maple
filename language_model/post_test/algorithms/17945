This paper presents a zzso investigation of the zzso function in the motor zzso zzso the ability to zzso its functioning by virtue of a shift of the lost function in the surrounding zzso which becomes able to zzso Several experimental studies in animals and humans have shown that motor recovery after partial destruction of the motor zzso is based on adjacent motor zzso This study provides zzso evidence of this zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis according to which the zzso function is possible because there is a synaptic zzso of the weights (which are comparable to the zzso of the zzso of the zzso layer zzso of previous silent zzso zzso and our results confirm this zzso We argue that functional recovery is possible only when having zzso connections and that it is facilitated when zzso areas can guide the layer to zzso the lost zzso
