zzso cancer is the third most common type of cancer zzso However, this disease can be prevented by detection and removal of precursor zzso zzso during optical zzso zzso During zzso the zzso looks for colon zzso While zzso zzso are benign zzso zzso zzso are likely to become zzso zzso it is a common practice to remove all identified zzso and send them to subsequent zzso zzso But removal of zzso zzso poses unnecessary risk to patients and zzso unnecessary costs for zzso zzso In this paper, we develop the first part of a novel optical biopsy application based on zzso imaging zzso A barrier to an automatic system is that zzso zzso zzso require manual zzso of the zzso so we automatically segment zzso in zzso zzso zzso We propose an algorithm, zzso which is an extension of the zzso algorithm, a state-of-the-art zzso for boundary detection and zzso zzso zzso the intrinsic scale selection problem of zzso by including prior knowledge about the shape of the zzso zzso zzso previous methods with a specificity of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso for automatic zzso of a test set of 87 zzso
