zzso flux may increase over 100 times in skeletal muscle during zzso transition, whereas zzso zzso zzso remain relatively zzso This constancy cannot be explained by an identical direct zzso of all zzso zzso because the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the activity of different zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated in the present in zzso study that a perfect zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be achieved if zzso is divided into appropriate blocks of zzso that are directly activated to a different extent in order to compensate the effect of the zzso
