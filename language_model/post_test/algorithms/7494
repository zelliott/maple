We propose a zzso zzso Hidden zzso Model zzso zzso for glaucoma progression modeling given zzso structural and functional zzso zzso is suitable for modeling zzso medical data consisting of visits at arbitrary times, and zzso state structure is more appropriate for glaucoma since the time courses of functional and structural zzso are usually zzso The learned model not only corroborates the clinical findings that structural zzso is more evident than functional zzso in early glaucoma and the opposite is observed in more advanced zzso but also reveals the exact stages where the trend zzso A method to detect time segments of fast progression is also zzso Our results show that this detector can effectively identify patients with rapid zzso The model and the derived detector can be of clinical value for glaucoma zzso
