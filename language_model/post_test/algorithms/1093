zzso zzso fixation has a variable effect on the zzso abundance of different parts of zzso zzso in fixation result in zzso enrichment of zzso while zzso in combination with an increased zzso of mineral zzso result in zzso depletion of the root zzso The difference between soybean shoot and zzso zzso zzso was assessed in zzso culture over a range of rates of supply of mineral zzso The fractional contribution of zzso fixation to N zzso zzso was determined using the natural abundance zzso technique with zzso as a reference zzso zzso and zzso were highly zzso and the relationship was tested using the same soybean zzso grown in pots in zzso zzso Estimates of zzso derived from the zzso method and from the zzso approach yielded zzso zzso A literature survey showed similar relationships between zzso and zzso with different growth stages of soybeans grown under zzso and field conditions, different zzso zzso zzso zzso in the field, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plant or zzso zzso influences are zzso The difference in zzso signatures between zzso roots and shoots is confirmed as a robust means of zzso zzso it is independent of reference plants and offers the possibility of zzso zzso in zzso where the isotope composition of mineral N closely matches that of atmospheric zzso
