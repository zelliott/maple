To evaluate the outcome of zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso for zzso and borderline zzso pancreatic cancer zzso with a focus on the differences in surgical outcomes and patterns of recurrence between these 2 zzso 

Various zzso treatment strategies have been proposed to improve the surgical outcomes of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent surgery is one of the promising strategies for zzso zzso and borderline zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 268 patients with zzso and zzso received zzso zzso zzso The numbers of zzso and zzso cases were 188 and 80, zzso We evaluated the following comparisons between patients with zzso and those with zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso survival, and zzso pattern of the treatment failure, including local zzso zzso zzso and distant zzso 

The zzso rate of patients with zzso zzso was higher than that of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved in zzso and zzso of the patients with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso survival rates of the zzso and zzso cases were 57% and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso cumulative zzso of local recurrence was comparable in both groups zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso the zzso cumulative zzso of zzso and distant recurrence was significantly higher in the patients with zzso zzso and zzso than in the patients with zzso zzso and zzso 

In the zzso cases, the zzso control was comparable between patients with zzso and zzso after zzso zzso The survival rate for the patients with zzso was lower than the rate for those with zzso due to a higher zzso of zzso and distant recurrence in the patients with zzso zzso
