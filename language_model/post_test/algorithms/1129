To examine the predictability of zzso length measurement when lens thickness and zzso body length are zzso 

Center of zzso University of Cologne, Cologne, zzso 

This study comprised 227 patients with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso None of the eyes examined had a history of surgery or zzso Patients with systemic disease were excluded from the zzso Before cataract surgery, the length of the zzso body and thickness of the lens were measured and the correlation between these data and the zzso length was zzso Two zzso devices were used for zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso System zzso and the Cooper Vision zzso Digital zzso zzso The correlations between the zzso length and zzso body length and the lens thickness and zzso body length were analyzed using multiple linear zzso 

The zzso zzso provided the best prediction of zzso length based on zzso body zzso Considering sex but not age significantly improved the model zzso With the zzso zzso the following formula was developed to predict zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso sex zzso zzso 0, male zzso 1) + zzso zzso zzso body length zzso An approximate zzso prediction limit may be calculated by the following formula: zzso length zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 

This study yielded an zzso formula for predicting the zzso length using the zzso body length and the patient's zzso The remaining error in prediction is likely to be the result of patient zzso in age, zzso globe size, and lens thickness zzso zzso Good prediction of the zzso length is important to zzso outcomes to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso length zzso to choose zzso and the opening size in penetrating zzso Further studies to detect a clinically relevant improvement in such outcomes are required to assess the utility of the prediction zzso
