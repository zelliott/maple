For an electron accelerated by a tightly focused zzso laser zzso its dynamics are usually simulated through the field obtained by zzso approach zzso zzso A 11, zzso zzso However, as zzso series field zzso is not always zzso the obtained results are usually inaccurate and even zzso Here we report that the divergence of zzso can be eliminated by using zzso zzso and the electron dynamics simulated by this new field are logical and zzso
