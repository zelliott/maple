zzso zzso has demonstrated its great potential in biomedical field zzso In this study, the polarization characteristics of red blood cell zzso suspensions in a zzso geometry have been investigated with experimental zzso and zzso Carlo zzso simulation based on Mueller zzso zzso It is revealed that the simulated dependence of degree of polarization zzso and zzso on the distance away from incident point is zzso consistent with experimental zzso zzso and zzso zzso with increasing zzso distance except in the region adjacent to the incident zzso Further analysis shows that the number of scattering events and the scattering angle simultaneously influence the trends of zzso and zzso zzso in the central zzso
