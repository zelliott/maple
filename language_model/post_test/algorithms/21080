Certain widely used wind rose programs and air zzso models use an overly simple zzso zzso that zzso a directional bias in their output zzso The purpose of this paper is to provide a revised zzso that zzso the directional bias that occurs from the zzso that occurs when the sector zzso used to report wind direction data are on the same order of zzso but not equal, to the sector zzso used in the wind direction zzso The directional bias issue arises when output products in 16 direction sectors zzso degrees each) are produced from wind direction data reported in terms of 36 sectors (10 degrees zzso The result directional bias affects the results of simulations of air and surface zzso using widely applied air zzso zzso zzso or models with the directional bias discussed here give consistent positive biases zzso zzso for zzso direction sectors zzso south, east, and zzso and consistent negative biases for all of the other sectors zzso zzso Data summary and air zzso programs providing zzso in direction sectors that do not match the zzso sectors need to be checked for this zzso A revised zzso zzso is provided that zzso the directional bias that can occur in transferring wind direction data between different sector zzso
