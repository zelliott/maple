zzso zzso methods were applied to assess the effect of nerve crush on zzso number and mean volume of zzso zzso in adult rat zzso root zzso zzso The zzso spinal nerve of 20 zzso rats was crushed approximately 7 zzso zzso to the zzso and the zzso spinal nerve and zzso were left intact and used as zzso After four, 15, 45, and 120 days, the rats were killed, and the tissue was fixed and processed for subsequent preparation of zzso zzso Estimates of zzso number were obtained with the optical zzso technique and estimates of the mean zzso volume with the vertical zzso rotator zzso zzso loss was progressive during the early study period but stabilized 45 days after nerve zzso The mean number zzso of all zzso in intact zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The loss of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso after four days, zzso zzso zzso zzso after 15 days, zzso zzso zzso zzso after 45 days, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 120 zzso B cells were lost at an earlier time than were A cells, and the B cell loss was more pronounced zzso zzso zzso respectively, after 120 zzso For A cells, the mean zzso volume was initially reduced but was zzso at the end of the zzso zzso of zzso volume showed that the zzso of both A and B cells were zzso displaced toward smaller values 15 and 45 days after zzso zzso loss caused by crush seems similar to that seen in rats exposed to permanent zzso zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso at the same location, indicating that survival of zzso is not dependent on possibility for fiber zzso
