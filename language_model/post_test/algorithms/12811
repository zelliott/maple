In this paper, an automated zzso is proposed for distinguishing zzso zzso zzso based on their zzso This sorting system uses visible zzso zzso zzso to separate zzso zzso according to their zzso A zzso identification zzso was developed to recognize the zzso color zzso red, green, white or zzso and zzso give the command for throwing or not throwing zzso to a series of zzso zzso zzso The proposed sorting system was demonstrated to be fast and accurate, despite the presence of different labels and surface contamination on the zzso zzso
