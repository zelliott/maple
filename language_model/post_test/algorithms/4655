zzso of zzso experimental cancer biology through the development of computer simulation models seems to be a necessary step towards the better understanding of cancer and zzso individualized treatment zzso The integration of a zzso zzso model of in zzso tumor response to zzso developed by our group with a model of slowly responding normal tissue based on zzso zzso approach is presented in this zzso The case of zzso zzso and its surrounding neural tissue is addressed as a modeling zzso 

A cubic zzso mesh is superimposed upon the zzso region of interest as is reconstructed from pertinent imaging zzso zzso zzso On each geometrical cell of the mesh the most crucial biological zzso zzso zzso cell zzso tumor geometry changes, cell kill following zzso zzso are zzso Slowly responding normal neural tissue is modeled by a functional compartment containing zzso cells and a zzso compartment containing zzso zzso 

The model code has been executed for a simulated period normally covering the zzso course duration and extending a few days after its zzso The following schemes have been zzso standard zzso zzso accelerated zzso accelerated zzso and zzso The predictions are in agreement with the outcome of the zzso zzso phase zzso trial, the retrospective study conducted by zzso et zzso and the theoretical predictions of zzso et zzso 

The presented model, although zzso may serve as a basis for a refined simulation of the biological mechanisms involved in tumor and normal tissue response to zzso
