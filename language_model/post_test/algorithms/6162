To evaluate the accuracy of zzso planning in an Integrated zzso Unit zzso using dedicated image distortion correction zzso correcting the geometric distortion and magnetic distortion zzso and to determine the effect of the reconstruction accuracy on clinical treatment plans in terms of zzso in treatment time and zzso 

The reconstruction accuracy has been measured using 20 zzso positioned at well known locations in a zzso zzso Treatment plans of two zzso representing clinical implant zzso have been compared with reference plans to determine the effect of the reconstruction accuracy on the treatment zzso Before clinical introduction, treatment plans of three representative patients, based on zzso zzso have been compared with reference zzso 

The average reconstruction error for 10 zzso images reduces from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso after image distortion correction and for 15 zzso images from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The error in case of eccentric positioning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso reduces to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Correction of the image zzso reduces the zzso in the calculated treatment time of zzso zzso to less than zzso in case of eccentrically positioned clinical zzso The zzso in the treatment time or reference dose in the plans based on zzso reconstruction with image distortion correction of the three patient examples is smaller than zzso 

zzso zzso implant reconstruction using the zzso zzso and dedicated correction zzso separating the geometric distortion and the magnetic distortion is zzso The results fulfill the minimum requirements as imposed by the Netherlands Commission on zzso zzso zzso without limitations regarding the usable range of the field of view of the image zzso However, the zzso angle is limited to those angles for which magnetic distortion corrections have been zzso
