An intelligent zzso zzso zzso has been designed and built for use in a cardiac research zzso The device is capable of measuring and responding to cardiac zzso phenomena in real time with carefully timed and placed electrical zzso The system consists of 16 channels of zzso electronics controlled by a digital signal zzso zzso data acquisition card and a host computer and can be expanded to include more zzso The zzso allows for powerful and flexible zzso to be implemented for real-time interaction with the cardiac zzso Although a number of possible uses can be conceived for such a device, the initial motivation was to improve upon attempts to terminate zzso by zzso The IMS was tested in an zzso animal model, both in zzso rhythm and during zzso It was shown to be an effective research tool by demonstrating the ability to measure and respond to cardiac zzso in real time using complex zzso zzso and appropriately timed zzso
