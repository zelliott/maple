This paper addresses the problem of pulmonary zzso pressure zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso approaches in the context of zzso detection are zzso From a linear viewpoint, the zzso technique and the zzso representation for zzso detection are discussed in general under the zzso zzso A technique as well as a criterion for the zzso and the extraction of the region of interest or the optimal scale is zzso A new zzso zzso technique for zzso detection is also zzso This zzso representation is based on rank order filters and on mathematical zzso operators in zzso A zzso zzso is introduced for such operators as in the linear continuous zzso transform leading to what we call zzso zzso performed on pulmonary artery pressure zzso illustrate how the proposed technique can give a synopsis of the signal characteristics through the zzso
