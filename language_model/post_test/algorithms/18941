A new method is proposed for assessing the severity of hip zzso zzso based on zzso hip joint space zzso zzso 64 hips of patients with verified unilateral zzso or bilateral zzso were studied by zzso the corresponding pelvic zzso zzso zzso severity was assessed employing the zzso and Lawrence zzso zzso Using zzso software, zzso were zzso the margins of both zzso were zzso and 64 regions of interest zzso corresponding to the delineated zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso an index zzso space zzso zzso - zzso evaluating zzso in the shape and size of zzso was introduced, calculated and zzso with respect to each patient's individual zzso The zzso values were used to introduce zzso rules concerning the characterization of a hip in accordance with the zzso zzso For each patient in the unilateral zzso group, the zzso severity was expressed as the percentage of the zzso area difference between the patient's zzso and zzso normal zzso The per cent zzso area difference and the zzso values were used in the design of a zzso model for providing a quantitative zzso of zzso zzso The per cent zzso area difference correlated highly with the pathological zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso rules resulted in high zzso zzso for characterizing hips as normal or zzso zzso zzso exact confidence zzso zzso zzso as well as for discriminating among zzso severity categories, zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a simplified approach of zzso calculation is suggested for daily clinical zzso These zzso values zzso zzso were found not to differ significantly from zzso and to be strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding ones obtained by the computerized zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso rules based on zzso simplified resulted in zzso zzso identical to the corresponding ones obtained for the zzso zzso The proposed method may be zzso for evaluating zzso and monitoring zzso zzso
