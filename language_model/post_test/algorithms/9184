zzso zzso scans are used in PET for zzso correction zzso For zzso PET this is typically done using zzso sources, for zzso using zzso zzso zzso PET suffers from zzso contamination during zzso scans, zzso does zzso Here, we studied the effects of zzso across the two zzso With a zzso phantom zzso zzso Data zzso zzso with hollow spheres zzso zzso zzso two studies were zzso In the first study the hollow spheres were filled with 150 zzso zzso and the background with 15 zzso In the second study we used 120 zzso in the spheres and 50 zzso in the zzso Both a low and a high zzso ratio are studied this zzso Multiple scans were acquired on a zzso PET and a zzso until zzso of the initial concentration zzso zzso concentration in the spheres and background was measured from the reconstructed images and compared to the actual zzso For zzso zzso zzso scans were reconstructed using hot zzso zzso zzso and cold zzso (not zzso zzso within the spheres was investigated by profile zzso For zzso the concentration in the big spheres zzso 16 zzso was zzso For the smaller zzso recovery was insufficient due to partial volume zzso For zzso PET the zzso of the spheres zzso 16 zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower than the actual zzso Using hot zzso zzso of activity concentration was up to zzso zzso zzso within the biggest spheres were up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso PET with hot zzso cold zzso and using zzso zzso Due to contamination of zzso by zzso zzso zzso PET results in a bias in the activity concentration and zzso Especially when patients get follow-up PET scans on both zzso PET and zzso this may lead to zzso
