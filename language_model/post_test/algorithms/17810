The energy function of a protein consists of a tremendous number of zzso zzso the global energy minimum zzso structure, which zzso approximately to the native structure, is a severe problem in global zzso Recently we have proposed a zzso search technique based on the zzso Carlo zzso zzso method of Li and zzso where trial zzso angles are not selected at random within the range zzso zzso degrees ] (as with zzso but with biased probabilities depending on the increased zzso correlations as the zzso is approached during the zzso This method, called the zzso Carlo zzso with an zzso bias zzso was applied initially to the zzso zzso Here we study its properties further by applying it to the larger zzso with bulky side zzso zzso zzso We find that on average the number of energy zzso required by zzso to locate the zzso for the first time is smaller by a factor of approximately three than the number required by zzso zzso with results obtained for zzso
