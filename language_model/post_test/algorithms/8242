We present a method for zzso maximum a zzso zzso zzso reconstruction which is based on the use of sparse zzso zzso Our approach is to zzso and store the inverse zzso required for zzso zzso This approach has generally not been used in the past because the inverse zzso is typically large and fully populated zzso not zzso In order to overcome this problem, we introduce two new zzso The first idea is a novel theory for the zzso source coding of zzso transformations which we refer to as zzso source zzso This theory is based on a distortion metric that reflects the zzso produced in the final zzso product, rather than the zzso in the coded zzso zzso The resulting zzso are shown to require zzso transformations of both the measurement data and the zzso rows and columns before zzso and zzso The second idea is a method for efficiently storing and computing the required zzso zzso which we call a zzso transform zzso The zzso is a zzso of the classical zzso in that it uses butterflies to zzso an zzso zzso but unlike an zzso the zzso uses the butterflies in an irregular pattern, and is zzso designed to best approximate the desired zzso We demonstrate the potential of the zzso zzso reconstruction with examples from optical zzso The method requires zzso zzso to zzso the inverse zzso However, once these zzso zzso are completed, the zzso zzso zzso is shown to reduce both storage and zzso by well over two orders of zzso as compared to a linear zzso reconstruction zzso
