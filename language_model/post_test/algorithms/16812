zzso trait zzso zzso mapping aims at finding zzso zzso associated with the zzso whereas zzso selection focuses on breeding value prediction based on zzso zzso zzso selection is a key to both of these tasks as it allows to zzso detect clear mapping signals of zzso activity, and zzso predict the zzso breeding values zzso In this paper, we provide an overview of a statistical method called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator zzso and two of its zzso named elastic net and zzso zzso in the contexts of zzso mapping and zzso breeding value prediction in plants (or zzso We also briefly zzso the zzso interpretation of zzso and the inspired zzso zzso zzso We illustrate the zzso and examine the performance of methods using three public data zzso zzso North American barley data with zzso individuals and 145 zzso zzso a simulated zzso zzso data with zzso individuals and 6,000 markers for both zzso mapping and zzso selection, and zzso a wheat data with zzso individuals and zzso markers only for zzso zzso
