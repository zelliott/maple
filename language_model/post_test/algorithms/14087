Patient dose zzso is becoming increasingly important with the advent of new complex zzso techniques such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An electronic portal imaging device zzso has potential application for in zzso zzso In the current work, an zzso has been zzso using a treatment planning system zzso to predict transmitted dose zzso A thin slab of zzso material used to initially represent the zzso A homogeneous zzso phantom and the thin zzso slab placed at a clinical distance away from the phantom were scanned using a CT zzso The resulting CT images were transferred via zzso to the zzso and the density of the CT data corresponding to the thin zzso slab was changed to 1 zzso zzso dose maps zzso in the zzso zzso were calculated by the zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A 6 zzso beam was used in the simulation to deliver 300 zzso to the zzso phantom using an zzso and zzso zzso zzso The phantom thickness was varied and the calculated zzso in the zzso zzso were compared with corresponding zzso obtained from a zzso scanning liquid-filled zzso chamber zzso zzso The two zzso were compared using the gamma evaluation technique of Low et zzso The predicted and measured zzso agree to within 2 % zzso over all phantom zzso on the central beam zzso More than 90 % of points in the dose maps zzso field zzso produce a gamma index less than or equal to 1, for dose difference zzso over all phantom zzso and zzso criteria of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the noise level on the central axis in the predicted dose maps is less than zzso zzso We found that phantom thickness changes of approximately 1 zzso which zzso to dose changes on the central beam axis of less than zzso zzso can be detected in the predicted transmitted dose zzso
