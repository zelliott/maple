The World Wide Web allows access to zzso partner perspectives on the lived experience of zzso We were interested in how symptoms that care partners target for tracking relate to zzso stage, and whether zzso could be staged using only these online profiles of targeted zzso 

To use clinical data where the zzso stage is known to develop a model that zzso an zzso stage of zzso based on their symptom profile and to apply this model to zzso zzso stages for subjects from a Web-based zzso 

An zzso zzso Network zzso was used to identify the relationships between the zzso stages and individualized profiles of people with zzso obtained from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso training zzso zzso with known zzso zzso was used to create an ANN model for zzso stages in Web-based users zzso 

The ANN model was trained in zzso of the 320 Memory Clinic patients, with the remaining zzso used to test its accuracy in zzso Training and testing staging zzso were not significantly zzso In the 1930 Web-based profiles, 309 people zzso were classified as having mild cognitive zzso zzso as mild zzso zzso as moderate, and zzso as zzso In both the clinical and Web-based symptom profiles, most symptoms became more common as the stage of zzso worsened zzso mean zzso zzso zzso symptoms in the zzso group versus zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Overall, Web profiles recorded more symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso than did clinic ones zzso zzso zzso zzso Even so, symptom profiles were relatively similar between the Web-based and clinical zzso 

zzso targeted for online tracking by care partners of people with zzso can be used to stage zzso Even so, caution is needed to assure the zzso of data collected online as the current staging zzso should be seen as an initial zzso
