A new zzso method was developed for characterizing zzso interactions between an immobilized binding agent and zzso zzso This approach was illustrated by using it to characterize the interactions between tamoxifen and zzso during their binding to the protein human serum zzso zzso with zzso being employed as a zzso agent for these zzso It was confirmed in this work through several experiments that zzso had a single binding site on zzso with an association equilibrium constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, in agreement with previous zzso It was also found that tamoxifen had a single major binding site on zzso with an association equilibrium constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso When zzso was used as a zzso additive in competition studies with zzso this had a positive zzso effect on zzso zzso giving a zzso constant of zzso zzso Competitive studies using tamoxifen as a zzso additive indicated that tamoxifen had a negative zzso effect on zzso zzso providing a zzso constant of zzso zzso A unique feature of the technique described in this report was its ability to independently examine both directions of the zzso zzso zzso This approach is not limited to zzso zzso and zzso but can also be used to study other zzso and binding zzso
