The most frequently used method to demonstrate testosterone abuse is the determination of the testosterone and zzso concentration ratio zzso zzso in zzso Nevertheless, it is known that factors other than testosterone administration may increase the zzso zzso In the last years, the determination of the carbon isotope ratio has proven to be the most promising method to help discriminate between naturally elevated zzso ratios and those reflecting T zzso In this paper, an zzso study following oral administration of 40 zzso testosterone zzso initially and 13 h later is zzso Four testosterone zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and 5 zzso together with an zzso reference (5 zzso were extracted from the zzso and the zzso ratio of each compound was analyzed by gas zzso ratio mass zzso The results show similar maximum zzso variations zzso per thousand difference of zzso ratio from the isotope ratio zzso for the T zzso and zzso changes of the zzso ratios after administration of the first and the second dose of zzso Whereas the zzso ratios as well as the zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso returned to the baseline 15 h after the second T administration, a decrease of the 5 zzso zzso could be detected for over 40 zzso This suggests that zzso of 5 zzso zzso allow the detection of a testosterone zzso over a longer zzso period than other T zzso zzso or than the usual zzso ratio zzso
