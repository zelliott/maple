We provide an illustration of an application of the elastic net to a large number of common genetic zzso in the context of the search for the genetic bases of an zzso conceivably related to individual differences in zzso zzso concentration in the zzso cortex, a critical area for reading, was obtained in a group zzso zzso zzso of children aged 6-10 zzso Two extreme groups, high and low, were selected for zzso with the zzso zzso array chip zzso An elastic net approach was applied to the resulting zzso zzso 100 zzso were identified for each zzso as zzso based on having the highest absolute value zzso The analyses highlighted zzso 15 and 20, which contained 55 candidate zzso The STRING partner analyses of the associated proteins pointed to a number of related zzso most notably, zzso and zzso zzso
