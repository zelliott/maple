The zzso and stationary properties of zzso learning from finite training sets are analyzed by using the cavity zzso For large input dimensions, we derive equations for the zzso zzso zzso the student-teacher zzso the zzso zzso and the learning force zzso This enables us to provide zzso solutions to zzso learning as a zzso zzso predictions of training errors in transient and stationary states are obtained by a zzso Carlo sampling zzso zzso and training errors are found to agree with zzso The physical origin of the critical learning rate is zzso zzso with batch learning is discussed throughout the zzso
