X-ray zzso studies of zzso C zzso zzso and James, zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso have revealed a novel protein structure consisting of two zzso zzso each containing two zzso sites, connected via a zzso zzso three turns of which are fully exposed to zzso Since the zzso were grown at pH approximately 5, it is of interest to determine whether this structure is zzso to the protein in solution under zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso scattering to examine the solution structure of zzso C at pH zzso and the effect of zzso on the zzso The scattering data are consistent with an zzso structure in solution with a radius of zzso of approximately zzso A, which is quite comparable to that zzso for the crystal zzso The experimental scattering profile and the scattering profile zzso from the crystal structure coordinates do, however, exhibit differences at the zzso zzso A weak zzso zzso of zzso C was zzso The data rule out large zzso structural changes, indicating rather that the zzso with zzso bound is only slightly more compact than the zzso zzso
