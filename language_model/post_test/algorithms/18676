zzso the mechanism for the fast folding of proteins is a challenging zzso In our earlier work, we introduced the concept of zzso zzso and related it successfully to protein folding zzso In this article, we propose a new hypothesis for the folding of two-state zzso zzso The mechanism is based on the formation of a zzso core, propagation of zzso and the establishment of hydrogen zzso Our hypothesis has been strengthened by the observation of a folding nucleus in zzso and the zzso network between zzso in zzso Our insights on protein folding show an excellent agreement with experimental zzso
