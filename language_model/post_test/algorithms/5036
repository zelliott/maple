Over a zzso zzso performs a vast number of different cognitive actions, mostly dependent on zzso Previously it has not been known how such capabilities can be zzso even in principle, with the known resource constraints on cortex, such as low connectivity and low average synaptic zzso Here we describe neural circuits and associated zzso that respect the zzso most basic resource constraints and support the execution of high numbers of cognitive actions when presented with natural zzso Our circuits simultaneously support a suite of four basic kinds of task, each requiring some circuit zzso zzso memory formation, zzso association, supervised memorization, and zzso learning of threshold zzso The capacity of our circuits is established by experiments in which sequences of several thousand such actions are simulated by computer and the circuits created tested for subsequent zzso Our underlying theory is apparently the only biologically plausible zzso theory of learning and memory in zzso for which such a demonstration has been performed, and we argue that no general theory of information processing in the brain can be considered viable without such a zzso
