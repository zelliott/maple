In this study the application of advanced zzso processes zzso dark Fenton and zzso Fenton type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for degradation of zzso as a model organic zzso in the wastewater was zzso A detail kinetic modeling which describes the degradation of zzso was zzso zzso models which predict zzso decomposition and formation of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by applied processes were zzso The study also consist the modeling of zzso kinetic of the zzso solution by applied zzso This part, besides well known reactions of Fenton and zzso chemistry, involves additional reactions which describe removal of iron from zzso cycle through formation of zzso complexes and its zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso decomposition kinetic was monitored by zzso analysis and total organic carbon content zzso zzso Complete zzso removal was obtained by all applied zzso zzso zzso by applied Fenton type processes ranged between zzso and zzso while the efficiency of those processes was significantly enhanced in the presence of zzso light, where residual zzso ranged between zzso and zzso
