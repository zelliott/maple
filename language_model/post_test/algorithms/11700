The data on which a zzso zzso zzso is to be trained to approximate a continuous function may have zzso that are zzso rather than zzso or quantitative such as color, zzso race, zzso A zzso variable causes a zzso relationship between an input variable and the zzso A zzso with connection zzso that multiply input values and zzso functions that further transform values, represents a continuous mapping in all input zzso A zzso therefore requires that all zzso zzso to zzso continuously valued variables and represents a continuous function in all input zzso The way that this problem is usually dealt with is to replace the zzso values by zzso ones and treat them as if they were continuously zzso However, there is no meaningful correspondence between the continuous quantities generated this way and the original zzso zzso Another approach is to zzso the zzso portion of the input using zzso zzso and include this code as input to the zzso The approach in this paper is to segregate zzso variables from the continuous independent variables zzso The zzso is trained with multiple zzso a separate output unit for each of the allowed combination of values of the zzso independent zzso During training the zzso value or combination of zzso values determines which of the output units should have the target value on it, with the remaining zzso being 'do not zzso Three data sets were used for comparison of zzso zzso show that this approach is much more effective than the conventional approach of assigning continuous variables to the zzso zzso In case of the data set where there were several zzso variables the method proposed here is also more effective than the zzso input zzso
