The aim was to develop an automated screening system to zzso digital zzso retinal images for important features of zzso diabetic zzso zzso 

High performance zzso of the zzso images was zzso Previously described automated image analysis systems were used to detect major landmarks of the retinal image zzso disc, blood vessels and zzso zzso region growing zzso zzso combined with the use of a new technique, termed a zzso zzso were used to automatically detect features of zzso These features included zzso and zzso zzso which were treated as one group, and hard zzso as another zzso zzso and specificity data were calculated by comparison with an experienced zzso 

The zzso for zzso recognition was applied to 30 retinal images of which 21 contained zzso and nine were without zzso The sensitivity and specificity for zzso detection were zzso and zzso respectively, when compared with the zzso zzso were present in 14 retinal zzso The zzso achieved a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for detection of zzso 

zzso automated computer zzso were able to detect hard zzso and zzso This paper presents encouraging results in automatic identification of important features of zzso
