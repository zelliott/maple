The aim of the present study was to design a test to ascertain the zzso and reliability of a membrane used in drug release and simulated zzso tests in order to arrive at useful indications for simulating topical as well as zzso zzso The membrane can be used in two different conditions: a) as a simple porous membrane placed between the zzso and an accepting liquid phase, generally water zzso b) as a membrane soaked in a zzso liquid phase to simulate the zzso layer between the zzso and accepting water zzso In this study the zzso point zzso was used to test the integrity of the soaking film as well as the zzso during and after drug release and simulated zzso tests with different types of zzso In the case of a drug release test from an zzso the bubble point test may determine the test conditions, that is the zzso applied to either a dry or hydrated zzso Only the use of a previously hydrated membrane can guarantee constant conditions in the in zzso zzso Use of a dry membrane may lead to zzso of liquid components of the zzso base, thus altering the contact conditions between the two zzso of the zzso compartment model zzso and zzso zzso The use of a hydrated membrane may also lead to interactions between the two zzso of the zzso with zzso exchanges between the zzso phase and zzso sample zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The hydrated membrane is therefore reliable only for comparison between zzso base zzso In a simulated zzso test, determination of the bubble point makes it possible to ascertain the physical integrity of the zzso liquid film immobilized by zzso action in the inner zzso structure of the membrane during the zzso This condition is essential to maintain a balance between the parameters regulating the diffusion process between the different compartments of the zzso The use of a zzso membrane makes it possible to avoid interactions between the zzso sample and an zzso zzso phase, such as zzso zzso Since the diffusion across a zzso film zzso within a porous membrane depends on the drug release rate from the zzso base, the test allows a contextual evaluation of the release zzso as well as an indication of the drug zzso possibilities through an in zzso model of the zzso zzso
