zzso is a diffuse and highly variable disease of arteries that alters the mechanical properties of the vessel wall through highly variable changes in its cellular composition and zzso zzso We have analyzed the effects of acute zzso changes on the mechanical properties of the descending zzso zzso of rabbits fed a zzso cholesterol zzso 

Two groups of eight male New Zealand White rabbits were randomly selected and fed for 8 weeks either an zzso diet zzso cholesterol plus regular rabbit zzso or regular zzso Animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks, and the descending zzso zzso were excised for zzso tests and zzso evaluation to examine the relationship between zzso elastic properties and zzso zzso 

All rabbits fed the zzso diet developed either intermediate or advanced zzso zzso particularly American Heart zzso III and IV, which were fatty and contained abundant zzso foam cells zzso zzso zzso and fewer zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, rabbits fed a normal diet had no visible zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with a statistically significant decrease in mean vessel wall zzso in the zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the control animals zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in rabbits with more progressive zzso 

zzso zzso appears to decrease with the progression of zzso after the zzso zzso
