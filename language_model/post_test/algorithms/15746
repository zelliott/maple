The zzso coli zzso system, zzso zzso folding of zzso proteins zzso that are otherwise destined to zzso The zzso zzso mechanism suggests that the zzso zzso transitions leading to changes in the zzso of the SP constitutes the zzso action of zzso To describe the molecular basis for the changes in the nature of zzso interactions we use the crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso (R zzso and the zzso zzso zzso complex to determine the zzso changes in the accessible surface area and the number of zzso contacts as a result of the zzso zzso We find large changes in the accessible area in many zzso in the zzso domain, but relatively smaller changes are associated with zzso in the equatorial zzso In the course of the zzso transition the zzso of the SP changes which suggests that zzso is an zzso machine even without zzso This is reflected in the exposure of zzso which loses six contacts in the zzso zzso We also evaluate the conservation of zzso that participate in the various zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments and chemical sequence zzso calculations reveal that, to a large extent, only the chemical identities and not the zzso themselves important for the nominal functions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso are strongly zzso Using chemical sequence zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso into four types zzso zzso positively charged and zzso zzso we make several new predictions that are relevant for zzso binding and zzso function of zzso We identify a number of zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso domain which coincide with those found in the zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso family, that might control zzso in zzso are also strongly zzso Most importantly, we find that charged zzso zzso in the T state zzso zzso zzso 252 and zzso zzso are strongly zzso This leads to the prediction that mutating these zzso that control the zzso function of the SP, can decrease the efficacy of the zzso zzso
