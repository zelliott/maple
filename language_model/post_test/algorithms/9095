Leaf zzso content is an important zzso zzso which can serve as an indicator of nutritional status, plant stress or zzso zzso zzso to the zzso content can be measured zzso with instruments detecting leaf zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso showing zzso differential vegetation index, zzso in red and near infrared spectral zzso The zzso are based on the assumption that only zzso absorb in the examined red zzso However, there is a question whether zzso of other zzso zzso zzso could in some cases affect the zzso meter zzso To answer this question, we cultivated tomato plants zzso zzso zzso for a long time under low light conditions and then exposed them for several weeks zzso a day) to high sunlight containing the zzso spectral zzso The zzso leaves of these plants evolved a high relative content of zzso and visually revealed a distinct blue zzso The zzso and zzso data were collected and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the leaves were measured using an integration zzso The content of zzso and zzso was measured zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso measurement can be significantly affected by the accumulated zzso in the leaves with relatively high zzso zzso To describe theoretically this effect of zzso concepts of a specific zzso and a leaf spectral polarity were zzso Corrective procedures of the zzso meter readings for the zzso contribution are suggested both for the zzso and zzso zzso
