This paper presents the design, zzso zzso zzso and experimental validation of a zzso probe that measures zzso zzso of biological zzso The probe consists of a pair of zzso line heating elements and resistance temperature detector sensors, which were zzso by using zzso zzso on a glass zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso can be determined by the temperature response induced by the uniform heat flux in the heating zzso After zzso the probe using a material zzso zzso of known zzso zzso the probe was deployed to calculate the zzso zzso of zzso The measured value is in agreement with that determined by the zzso probe method to within zzso Finally, the zzso zzso probe was used to investigate the change of zzso zzso of pig liver before and after zzso zzso zzso The results show an increase in zzso zzso of liver after the zzso zzso
