Geometric differential evolution zzso is a recently introduced formal zzso of traditional differential evolution zzso that can be used to derive specific differential evolution zzso for both continuous and zzso spaces retaining the same geometric interpretation of the dynamics of the DE search across zzso In this article, we first review the theory behind the zzso algorithm, then, we use this framework to formally derive specific zzso for search spaces associated with zzso strings, permutations, zzso of permutations and genetic zzso The resulting zzso are zzso differential evolution zzso searching the target spaces by acting directly on their underlying zzso We present experimental results for each of the new zzso on a number of well-known problems zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso strings, permutations, and zzso of zzso We also present results for the regression, artificial zzso parity, and zzso problems within the genetic programming zzso zzso show that overall the new DE zzso are competitive with zzso standard search zzso
