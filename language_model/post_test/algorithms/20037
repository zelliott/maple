The trajectory tracking problem of a zzso zzso robot is studied in this zzso Based on an error transformation function and the zzso technique, an zzso tracking zzso is proposed, which can guarantee the control performance of the robotic system in both the stable and transient zzso In particular, the zzso settling time, and final tracking error of the robotic system can be all adjusted by properly setting the parameters in the error transformation zzso The zzso basis function neural network zzso is used to compensate the complicated zzso terms in the zzso dynamics of the robotic zzso The approximation error of the zzso is only required to be zzso which zzso the initial zzso zzso of the neural zzso zzso examples are given to verify the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso Finally, it is also shown that the proposed zzso controller can be simplified by a smart mechanical design of the zzso robot, which demonstrates the promise of the integrated design and control zzso
