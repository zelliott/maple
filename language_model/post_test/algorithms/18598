Currently, optical devices, such as zzso and zzso cameras, are zzso for identification of bullets and tool marks in the field of forensic zzso While these optical methods are easily manageable and effective, they are under great influence of zzso zzso In other words, appearances of zzso through these optical devices have possibility to be changed by lighting zzso Besides these zzso approaches, we can zzso three zzso zzso geometric data of tool marks that are free from lighting zzso In this study, we focused on zzso geometric data of landmark impressions on fired bullets for zzso We obtained the zzso surface data of tool marks by a zzso microscope and reconstructed virtual impressions on a PC monitor from the geometric zzso Furthermore, the zzso data are exploited to zzso matching of two surface zzso We also zzso the difference of two zzso In order to do this, two surface models are aligned zzso In this process, pairings of correspondent points on both surfaces are zzso zzso analysis between these pairs leads to a shape zzso Since comparison results are zzso they are intuitive and easily zzso
