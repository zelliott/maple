This paper presents a modified zzso resonance theory zzso control strategy for a zzso zzso zzso The statistical parameters and zzso from two channels of an zzso zzso signal have been used as the feature space for the zzso of four limb zzso The zzso neural network zzso has been used for the zzso zzso has been modified to learn the patterns in supervised manner to suit the zzso Further, the criteria for the modification of the stored pattern have been made zzso and the matching criteria have been designed for zzso zzso The major challenge of using zzso is to decide on the value of the vigilance zzso as the zzso success is drastically affected by this zzso The criteria have been evolved to get the optimal value of the vigilance zzso It is concluded that the best value of vigilance zzso is that which provides the same tolerance in matching as the minimum bit distance between the stored zzso This scheme has also been implemented on an zzso zzso
