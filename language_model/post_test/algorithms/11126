The dynamics of zzso zzso have been studied extensively for many years, and the kinetic mechanism of the zzso dynamics has been discussed zzso Recent experimental results have suggested that equilibrium zzso dynamics are governed by movement of the zzso boundary along the zzso chain, which leads to slower unfolding zzso in the zzso center compared with the zzso ends and zzso zzso formation zzso We tested this diffusion of boundary model in zzso peptides of different lengths by zzso energy transfer zzso and compared the data with simulations based on a kinetic linear zzso zzso The results show that boundary diffusion in zzso peptides can be described by a classical, zzso zzso diffusion process with a diffusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso with a length longer than about 40 zzso zzso unfolding by zzso nucleation in a zzso region occurs frequently in addition to boundary zzso zzso diffusion is slowed down by zzso capping motifs at the zzso ends in agreement with predictions from the kinetic linear zzso zzso We further tested local and zzso effects of zzso acid replacements on zzso zzso Single zzso acid replacements locally affect folding and unfolding dynamics with a zzso of zzso which shows that interactions leading to different zzso zzso for different zzso acids are already partially present in the transition state for zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso acid replacements only influence zzso unfolding zzso zzso zzso in agreement with a zzso boundary zzso
