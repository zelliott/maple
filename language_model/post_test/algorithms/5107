zzso wave propagation techniques have been introduced for measuring the zzso material properties of zzso but assessing the accuracy of these zzso is difficult for in zzso zzso in zzso We propose using the zzso relationships to assess the consistency and quality of the zzso of zzso wave zzso and phase zzso In ex zzso skeletal muscle we measured the wave zzso at different zzso and then applied finite bandwidth zzso equations to predict the phase zzso We compared these predictions with the measured phase zzso and assessed the mean square error zzso as a quality zzso An zzso was derived for computing a quality factor using the zzso zzso
