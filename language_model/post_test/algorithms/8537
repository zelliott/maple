A zzso zzso zzso protein complex of zzso coli was expressed under the control of a synthetic mini zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso showed that the zzso complex has substantially higher affinity for the zzso zzso sequence motif of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso Single base exchanges in zzso zzso reduced the affinity of the protein complex up to zzso The impact of base exchanges in the zzso zzso on the interaction with zzso protein was studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained with modified zzso sequences were zzso by a novel generic zzso Replacement of bases in the terminal segments of the zzso zzso motif caused minor chemical shift changes as compared to base exchanges in the central part of the zzso zzso zzso
