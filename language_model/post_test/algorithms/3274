Despite a search, no chaotic driven zzso zzso of the form zzso or zzso are found, where f is a zzso with real zzso It is shown that, for zzso functions zzso driven zzso zzso of the form zzso cannot have chaotic zzso Seven simple driven chaotic zzso of the form zzso with zzso zzso are zzso Their chaotic zzso are displayed, and zzso zzso are zzso zzso for two of the cases have symmetry across the zzso zzso The zzso behavior with zzso as a control zzso in the range of zzso is zzso revealing cases of period doubling, zzso chaotic zzso and period adding as routes to zzso Numerous cases of zzso zzso are also zzso
