zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecular weight and narrow zzso confined within the zzso zzso between positively zzso aligned zzso was measured using zzso zzso nuclear magnetic zzso The zzso consisted of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to which zzso had been added in the ratio zzso zzso The field zzso were applied such that diffusion was measured in the direction parallel to the normal to the zzso zzso regions, thereby rendering the experiment sensitive to the ability of zzso to traverse zzso defects within the zzso The zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso intensity zzso were zzso in all cases, with zzso zzso corresponding to many hundreds of zzso zzso This permitted a description of such zzso zzso in terms of a mean behavior involving a combination of straight obstruction effects common to all zzso with hindrance to diffusion zzso to the relative size of a given zzso with respect to the size of the zzso zzso Across the range of zzso molecular weights zzso and zzso compositions zzso the apparent zzso dimension of the zzso defects decreased from 165 A with zzso zzso zzso to 125 A with zzso zzso zzso This is opposite to the trend predicted from zzso geometric models of either zzso disks or zzso zzso zzso the observed trend suggests that mobility of the zzso to diffusion will need to be considered to reconcile these zzso
