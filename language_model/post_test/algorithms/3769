Data sets of zzso male rats from zzso and zzso strains have been investigated with two different versions of the zzso zzso expansion zzso model of zzso These so-called zzso zzso and zzso zzso models are named after the zzso processes that are assumed to be induced by zzso The analysis was done with all zzso lung zzso taken to be incidental and with fatal zzso zzso For all zzso treated as zzso both models could explain the zzso zzso data equally zzso zzso to its better fit, only the zzso model was applied in the analysis of fatal zzso that carry additional information on the time when they cause zzso A statistical test rejected the hypothesis that a joint cohort of zzso and zzso rats can be described with the same set of model zzso Thus, the risk analysis has been carried out for the zzso rats and the zzso rats separately and has been restricted to fatal zzso alone because of their similar effect in zzso Using a refined technique of zzso the lifetime excess absolute risk has been zzso with the survival function from competing risks in the control zzso The zzso excess risks for both strains of rats were of similar size, for animals with first exposure later in life they decreased zzso For high cumulative exposure the excess risk increased with longer exposure zzso for low cumulative exposure it showed the opposite zzso In addition, high cumulative exposure exerted lethal effects other than lung cancer on the zzso
