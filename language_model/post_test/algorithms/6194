In process of creating genetic maps different zzso groups obtain overlapping parts of the zzso zzso these parts into one zzso map is based on looking for maximum shared marker orders among the zzso Really, not all shared markers of such maps have consensus order that zzso building of the zzso zzso In this paper we propose a new approach to build verified zzso consensus genetic maps in which shared markers always are integrated in stable consensus zzso The approach is based on combined analysis of initial mapping data rather than manipulating with previously constructed zzso We show that more effective and reliable solutions may be obtained based on zzso zzso facilitated by cycles of zzso unstable zzso The proposed zzso of consensus genetic mapping can be considered as a version of traveling zzso problem zzso that we refer to as zzso From the viewpoint of zzso zzso belongs to discrete constrained zzso zzso Earlier we developed new powerful and fast guided evolution strategy zzso for some types of discrete constrained zzso These zzso were used here as a basis for solving more challenging problems of consensual marker zzso
