This article is the first of a series of papers dealing with domain decomposition zzso for implicit zzso zzso We show that, in the framework of the zzso model, with van der zzso molecular cavities and classical charge zzso the zzso energy contribution to the zzso energy, usually zzso by solving an integral equation on the whole surface of the molecular zzso can be zzso more efficiently by using an integral equation zzso of zzso domain decomposition method for boundary value zzso In addition, the zzso potential energy surface is smooth, which is a critical property to perform geometry zzso and molecular dynamics zzso The purpose of this first article is to detail the methodology, set up the theoretical foundations of the approach, and study the zzso and convergence rates of the resulting zzso The full efficiency of the method and its zzso to large molecular systems of biological interest is demonstrated zzso
