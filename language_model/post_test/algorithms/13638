Virtually all existing zzso zzso zzso for quantitative trait locus zzso mapping overlook the zzso structure of genetic effects, even though this information can help enhance the zzso of zzso zzso 

Here, we propose fast zzso and zzso procedures for zzso shrinkage analysis of zzso designed to accommodate the zzso zzso structure of genetic effects through a zzso zzso That is, updating all genetic effects simultaneously through many cycles of zzso 

zzso results based on computer-generated and real-world marker data demonstrated the ability of our method to swiftly produce sensible results regarding the zzso zzso Our new method provides a robust and remarkably fast alternative to full zzso zzso in zzso models where the zzso burden associated with zzso chain zzso Carlo simulation is often zzso The R code used to fit the model to the data is provided in the online supplementary zzso
