zzso detection zzso can help zzso to detect pulmonary zzso at an early zzso In pulmonary zzso zzso systems, feature extraction is very important for describing the characteristics of zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional zzso feature zzso to detect pulmonary zzso in CT zzso After lung volume zzso zzso candidates are detected using zzso dot enhancement filtering in the segmented lung zzso Next, we extract feature zzso from the detected zzso candidates, and these are refined using an zzso wall elimination zzso Finally, a support zzso zzso zzso is trained to zzso zzso and zzso The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on Lung Image Database zzso zzso The proposed method significantly reduces the number of false zzso in zzso zzso This method achieves zzso sensitivity, with only zzso false zzso per zzso
