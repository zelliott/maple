The receptive fields of simple cells in the visual zzso can be understood as linear zzso These filters can be modeled by zzso functions or zzso zzso zzso functions can also be combined in an energy model of the complex cell zzso This letter proposes an alternative model of the complex cell, based on zzso zzso It is most important to account for the zzso of the complex response to small shifts of the zzso The new model uses a linear combination of the first few zzso zzso at a single position, to approximate the first zzso zzso at a series of adjacent zzso The maximum response, over all positions, gives a signal that is insensitive to small shifts of the zzso This model, unlike previous approaches, is based on the scale space theory of visual zzso In particular, the complex cell is built from filters that respond to the zzso differential structure of the zzso The zzso aspects of the new model are studied in one and two dimensions, using the zzso of the zzso zzso The response of the model to basic images, such as edges and zzso is derived zzso The response to natural images is also zzso using statistical measures of shift zzso The neural zzso and predictions of the model are zzso
