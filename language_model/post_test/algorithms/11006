zzso of bone contours from zzso plays an important role in disease diagnosis, zzso planning, and treatment zzso We present a fully automatic method to accurately segment the zzso zzso in zzso pelvic zzso A number of candidate positions are produced by a global search with a zzso Each is then refined using a statistical shape model together with local detectors for each model zzso Both global and local models use Random Forest zzso to vote for the optimal positions, leading to robust and accurate zzso The performance of the system is evaluated using a set of zzso images of mixed zzso We show that the local search significantly zzso a range of alternative matching techniques, and that the fully automated system is able to achieve a mean zzso error of less than zzso zzso for zzso of all zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate automatic method for zzso the zzso zzso in zzso yet zzso
