The purpose of this research was to study the zzso and zzso of a projection zzso system, measuring volume differences of zzso different formed specimens mimicking localized zzso zzso zzso Nine pairs of specimens were zzso each of which simulated a zzso zzso zzso and a corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso pairs had a zzso defined form which allowed the accurate assessment of their volume differences by a mechanical 3-D coordinate measuring machine or by a zzso milling zzso zzso achieved with these methods were used as the references for zzso Six zzso pairs, A1 to zzso possessed a simple zzso geometrical form which facilitated their zzso Three zzso pairs, B1 to zzso were zzso and consisted of zzso more complex 3-D sculptured surfaces, which came closest to a true zzso of a localized zzso zzso An optical measurement system in the form of the projection zzso was zzso applying a zzso shift technique, and results obtained with this device were regarded as test zzso The absolute zzso of the test volume zzso differed between zzso zzso to zzso zzso corresponding to a relative zzso of zzso to zzso The mean of the relative zzso was within zzso for the zzso specimens and zzso for the zzso zzso However, the difference was not zzso probably due to the limited number of zzso zzso The systematic error of the zzso zzso in relation to the reference methods was surprisingly low, ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The relative systematic error, expressed as a percentage of reference volume, ranged between zzso and zzso The mean of the relative error for the more complex zzso specimens was zzso which was less accurate in comparison to the more simply formed zzso specimens with a relative systematic error of zzso zzso in this in zzso model it was possible to measure volume differences of zzso different formed zzso mimicking localized zzso zzso zzso with a zzso within zzso and with a zzso of less than zzso
