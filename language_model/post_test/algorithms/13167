For any initially correlated network after any kind of attack where either zzso or edges are removed, we obtain general expressions for the zzso probability zzso and degree zzso We show that the proposed zzso approach predicts the correct zzso changes after the attack by comparing the evolution of the zzso zzso for different attack strategies and zzso in theory and zzso We find that it is possible to turn an initially zzso network into a zzso one, and vice versa, by zzso removal of either zzso or zzso For an initially zzso network, on the other hand, we discover that only a targeted zzso attack can induce such zzso
