The aim of this article was to compare gene expression programming zzso method with three types of neural networks in the prediction of adverse events of radical zzso in cervical cancer zzso zzso and seven patients treated by radical zzso were zzso Each record representing a single patient consisted of 10 zzso The occurrence and lack of zzso complications imposed a zzso zzso zzso In the simulations, zzso zzso was compared to a zzso zzso zzso a zzso basis function network zzso and a zzso neural zzso The zzso ability of the models was assessed on the basis of their zzso the sensitivity, the zzso and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso The zzso zzso provided best results in the prediction of the adverse events with the accuracy of zzso zzso but slightly worse outcomes were obtained using zzso zzso zzso For each of measured zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and the zzso the standard zzso was the smallest for the models generated by zzso zzso
