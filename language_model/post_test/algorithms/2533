zzso paired data sets often occur in zzso experiments zzso et zzso 2005; Liu, Liang and zzso zzso zzso of testing with partially paired data are found in the literature zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1976; zzso zzso zzso zzso initially proposed a test statistic that uses a convex combination of paired and zzso zzso zzso Kim et zzso (2005) later proposed the zzso zzso which is a linear combination of paired and zzso zzso statistics, and then used it to detect zzso expressed zzso genes in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we extend Kim et zzso zzso statistic to the zzso zzso type statistic zzso for detecting DE gene sets of size zzso We employ zzso empirical zzso principle to incorporate zzso correlation in the zzso of the false discovery zzso Then, the proposed zzso statistic is applied to Kim et zzso zzso data to detect the DE gene sets of sizes zzso and zzso Our results show that for small zzso particularly for zzso and marginally for zzso the proposed zzso statistic zzso the zzso procedure by detecting additional DE genes that were zzso in the zzso test zzso We also conduct a simulation study to demonstrate that zzso empirical zzso principle is robust to the departure from the normal zzso
