Due to their zzso nature, complex zzso zzso of molecules can be analyzed much better by zzso zzso than by zzso zzso So far, the zzso function has been used for zzso of zzso zzso of different fluorescent zzso such as zzso and zzso but to our knowledge it is far less used for zzso zzso In this article, we present the decomposition of zzso zzso zzso in large zzso zzso using a procedure that relies on the zzso zzso zzso The procedure was zzso using zzso zzso in homogeneous solutions of various zzso Comparing our results with the ones obtained from a zzso fit, we show that zzso the position of the elementary zzso zzso and zzso zzso is preserved in a large range of temperatures that include the main phase transition of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso as reported by zzso increases approximately 8 times from the gel phase to the liquid zzso one, a result that fits with other reports, providing a more realistic zzso In addition, we propose a new zzso to globally evaluate zzso zzso zzso with the prospect of acquiring a larger range of values than the classical zzso zzso
