The objective of the Florida zzso zzso Study was to assess the performance of zzso field zzso zzso The study addressed three specific age groups: pediatric (age zzso 15 zzso adult (age zzso zzso and geriatric (age zzso zzso Since 1990, Florida has used a uniform set of eight zzso criteria, known as the trauma zzso for zzso adult trauma patients to zzso trauma zzso However, only five of the criteria are recommended for use with pediatric zzso This article presents the findings regarding the performance of the zzso when applied to a pediatric zzso 

We used state trauma registry data linked to state hospital discharge data in a retrospective analysis of trauma patients transported by zzso providers to any acute care hospital within nine selected Florida counties between July 1, 1991, and December 31, zzso We used zzso and zzso zzso analysis to determine the ability of zzso criteria to correctly identify patients who were zzso defined as major zzso We applied the field criteria to zzso and zzso of injury data contained in the trauma registry to zzso the patient as major or minor zzso To make our retrospective determination of major or minor trauma we used the protocols developed by an expert medical panel as described by zzso zzso MacKenzie et zzso zzso 

We calculated sensitivity, zzso and the corresponding zzso and zzso rates by comparing patient zzso zzso or minor zzso produced by the zzso criteria and the retrospective zzso We used zzso zzso to identify which zzso criteria were statistically significant in predicting major zzso 

zzso cases accounted for zzso of the total study population, zzso of all hospitalized cases, and zzso of all trauma zzso Of the zzso pediatric cases available for analysis, the zzso criteria classified zzso cases as expected major trauma and zzso cases as expected minor zzso The retrospective zzso classified 78 cases as expected major trauma and zzso cases as expected minor zzso The resulting specificity is zzso zzso zzso and the sensitivity is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that, of the eight zzso field zzso criteria, only the zzso coma score, ejection from vehicle, and penetrating injuries have a statistically significant impact on predicting major trauma in pediatric zzso 

Although the zzso trauma zzso applied to a pediatric population, produced acceptable zzso it did not produce acceptable zzso However, our zzso rate is comparable to the results of other published studies on pediatric zzso As a result of the Florida zzso zzso zzso a new pediatric zzso instrument was zzso It is currently being zzso
