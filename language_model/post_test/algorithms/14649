In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it frequently happens that the patient exceeds the scan field of view zzso in the zzso direction because of the limited detector zzso This results in data zzso and CT image zzso In this work three zzso correction approaches for extended zzso zzso reconstructions have been implemented and zzso An zzso method estimates the patient size and shape from the truncated projections by fitting an elliptical model to the raw data in order to apply an zzso In a zzso approach the patient is sampled with an optical tracking system and this information is used to apply an zzso In a zzso method the projections are completed by artificial projection data obtained from the CT data acquired in an earlier zzso For all methods the extended projections are filtered and zzso with a standard zzso zzso zzso evaluations have been performed by simulations of zzso zzso on the basis of the root mean square zzso and a quality factor Q zzso zzso 1 represents the ideal zzso zzso with a zzso zzso system have been used to validate the simulations and to investigate the practical zzso using zzso zzso which caused zzso in all zzso The proposed approaches enlarged the zzso to cover wider patient zzso Thus, image quality inside and outside the zzso has been zzso Best results have been obtained using the zzso method, followed by the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso For simulations, quality factors up to zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reduced, zzso from zzso to less than zzso for the zzso The proposed zzso correction approaches for zzso reconstructions are an effective way to ensure accurate CT values inside the zzso and to recover peripheral information outside the zzso
