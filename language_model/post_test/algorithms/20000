Models of tissue zzso properties zzso and zzso enable the interactions of zzso and electromagnetic fields to be zzso which has many useful applications in zzso imaging, radio zzso and zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso are available, based on a zzso model of tissue zzso but although they give the zzso properties over a wide frequency range, they do not convert easily to the time zzso An alternative is the zzso zzso model which works well in both time and frequency zzso zzso zzso are an evolutionary approach to zzso and we found that this technique was effective at finding the best values of the zzso zzso Our genetic zzso zzso these parameters to fit to either a zzso model or to measured data, and worked well over wide or narrow frequency zzso Over 10 zzso zzso the best fits for muscle, fat or bone were each found for ten zzso or poles in the zzso zzso The genetic zzso is a fast and effective method of developing tissue models that compares zzso with alternatives such as the rational zzso zzso
