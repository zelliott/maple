Volume zzso was developed to analyze the distribution and elimination of zzso given zzso However, when groups of patients are being zzso the current approach is limited by the need for several models, which yield parameters that cannot be zzso To meet the requirement to handle all patients in a group individually and without zzso a new all-encompassing model was zzso The aim of this paper was to test whether the new model could be used to analyze all patients in a zzso 

The new model consists of zzso and zzso parameters instead of zzso and zzso zzso With this change, a redundant zzso can be taken out, but the zzso nature is zzso The new parameters are the volume of distribution zzso zzso the zzso rate constant zzso and the elimination rate constant zzso The success rates of the new and original models in producing results within a set of zzso quality requirements were compared using blood dilution data from 10 volunteers challenged with intravenous zzso zzso zzso 

The new model could be used to analyze all 10 cases within the zzso criteria, but the original zzso model failed in zzso of zzso The zzso improved with the new zzso The medians zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The new model was suited to the analysis of all cases, and is therefore a better approach to study how clinical conditions change the distribution and elimination of infused zzso
