The zzso discrete zzso transform zzso transform can be zzso on a support of arbitrary shape, but retains a zzso complexity comparable to that of the usual zzso zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso and energy zzso properties, application of the zzso has been rather zzso targeted nearly exclusively to video zzso In this paper, we present a novel approach to image filtering based on the zzso We use the zzso in conjunction with the zzso Local zzso zzso of zzso zzso technique, which defines the shape of the zzso support in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso or attenuated zzso zzso are used to reconstruct a local estimate of the signal within the zzso zzso Since supports corresponding to different points are in general zzso the local estimates are averaged together using zzso weights that depend on the region's zzso This approach can be used for various zzso zzso In this paper, we consider, in particular, image zzso and image zzso and zzso from zzso zzso A special structural constraint in zzso space is also proposed to enable an accurate filtering of color zzso zzso experiments show a state-of-the-art quality of the final estimate, both in terms of objective criteria and visual zzso Thanks to the zzso support, reconstructed edges are clean, and no unpleasant ringing artifacts are introduced by the fitted zzso
