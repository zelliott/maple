The theory that human zzso proceeds through mental simulations, if true, would provide a zzso explanation of how the mechanisms of reasoning and problem solving integrate with and develop from mechanisms underlying forms of zzso that occur earlier in evolution and zzso However, questions remain about whether simulation mechanisms are powerful enough to exhibit zzso reasoning and zzso In order to investigate this issue, we show that it is possible to characterize some of the most powerful modern artificial intelligence zzso for logical and zzso zzso as methods of simulating alternate states of the zzso We show that a set of specific human zzso mechanisms, even if not implemented using mechanisms described in artificial intelligence, can nevertheless perform the same operations as those zzso Although this result does not demonstrate that simulation theory is true, it does show that whatever mechanisms zzso perception have at least as much power to explain zzso human reasoning and problem solving as some of the most powerful known zzso
