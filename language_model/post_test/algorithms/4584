For patients with diffuse large zzso zzso zzso the International zzso Index zzso predicts the likelihood for cure with zzso Biological zzso including expression of zzso zzso zzso major zzso complex class II, and categorization as zzso center zzso type have been described as zzso zzso zzso 

Biological parameters were evaluated zzso by zzso in 60 consecutive zzso patients of the zzso zzso zzso of 60 patients underwent a zzso treatment strategy including zzso stem-cell transplantation for high-risk patients zzso zzso zzso zzso slow response to zzso 

zzso expression was associated with superior overall survival zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso survival zzso was independently correlated with high expression of zzso and low zzso for zzso and zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso and zzso expression had no independent zzso zzso Within the zzso treatment strategy, only zzso retained a zzso impact on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In 60 patients with zzso treated with zzso therapy, zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso type has little clinical zzso The zzso risk appears to be zzso by intensified upfront zzso Low zzso expression is associated with poor outcome after intensified upfront zzso zzso additional treatment zzso appear to be zzso
