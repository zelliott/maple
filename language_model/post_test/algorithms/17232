Many base calling zzso implicitly or explicitly rely on predictions of local sequence parameters such as zzso peak time and peak zzso For example, an zzso may search for the next peak about a predicted peak time formed by adding the mean peak separation to the last position zzso In this paper, zzso models are presented which characterize the dependence of peak parameters on those of other zzso Based on experimental zzso the model features an exponential zzso in peak time jitter zzso with respect to base zzso Both peak zzso and peak zzso are zzso as being zzso with those of adjacent zzso In the model, linear expressions are given to describe the growth in peak time jitter and peak zzso as a function of base position while other zzso such as zzso zzso are modeled by zzso Together, these results form a simple model which may be used in the derivation of new sequencing zzso or in simulations for the testing of such zzso We suggest that the correlation of the peak times is related to the Kuhn length of the zzso DNA zzso
