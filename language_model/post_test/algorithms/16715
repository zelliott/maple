Fast and accurate zzso mapping is possible using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso needed for zzso zzso mapping methods can easily be implemented in multiple MR zzso zzso zzso mapping has thus been introduced for zzso echo zzso zzso zzso and Carr, zzso zzso Gill zzso zzso and zzso zzso When using zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, the high intrinsic specific zzso rates must be considered in clinical zzso This study introduces a fast zzso zzso mapping method based on a zzso sequence zzso With zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso are applied prior to the zzso zzso Thus, multiple and different zzso echoes can be acquired per zzso zzso Compared with a zzso zzso this zzso strategy results in a similar zzso ratio zzso per unit time but with reduced specific zzso zzso The proposed zzso sequence was implemented on a conventional 3 T whole body zzso scanner and applied zzso
