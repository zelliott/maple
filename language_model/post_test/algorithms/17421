In a recent paper we have estimated the total number of protein coding open reading frames zzso in the zzso zzso zzso based on their properties, at about zzso This number is much smaller than the zzso which is widely zzso In this paper we zzso differences between the set of zzso with known zzso zzso in the Munich Information Centre for zzso zzso zzso database and zzso for which the probability of coding, counted by us, is very zzso We have found that many of the latter zzso have properties of zzso sequences of coding zzso which suggests that they could have been generated by zzso of coding zzso Since coding sequences generate zzso inside themselves, with especially high frequency in the zzso zzso we have looked for zzso between known proteins and hypothetical zzso generated by zzso under consideration in all the six zzso For many zzso we have found zzso and zzso in zzso different than the phase which had been assumed in the zzso database as zzso
