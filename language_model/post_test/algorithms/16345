zzso spectrum matching zzso is the standard method in shotgun zzso data zzso It relies on the availability of an accurate and complete sample zzso that is used to make interpretation of the zzso zzso Although this procedure has proven to be effective in many zzso studies, the approach has limitations when applied on complex samples of microbial communities, such as those found in the human zzso zzso zzso studies have indicated that the human zzso zzso contains over 100 times more genes than the human zzso and it has been estimated that this zzso contains over zzso bacterial zzso The zzso of the vast majority of these species have not yet been zzso and hence their zzso remain zzso To enable data analysis of shotgun zzso data using zzso and circumvent the lack of a defined matched zzso an zzso zzso was developed that is based on a synthetic zzso and the developing zzso databases that are both representative for but not necessarily originating from the sample of zzso 

Two human zzso samples for which zzso data had been collected, were analyzed for their zzso using liquid zzso zzso and used to benchmark the developed zzso zzso to other zzso The results show that the developed method is able to detect over 3,000 peptides per zzso sample from the spectral data by zzso the lack of a defined zzso without zzso translation of matched zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The developed zzso zzso achieved an approximate zzso increase in the amount of identified zzso at a false discovery rate of zzso and can be applied in zzso studies of the human zzso tract or other complex zzso
