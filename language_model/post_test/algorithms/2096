zzso methods for gene identification in zzso sequences typically have two zzso coding region prediction and gene zzso While there are many effective methods for predicting coding regions zzso parsing the predicted zzso into proper gene structures, to a large extent, remains an zzso zzso This paper presents an zzso for zzso gene structures from predicted zzso candidates, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and biological zzso The zzso first finds all the related zzso in the zzso database zzso for each predicted zzso and zzso the boundaries of one or a series of genes based on the available zzso information and biological zzso Then it zzso gene models within each pair of gene zzso that are most consistent with the zzso zzso By exploiting zzso information and biological rules, the zzso can zzso model complicated multiple gene structures, including embedded zzso zzso identify zzso zzso and locate missed zzso and zzso make more accurate zzso boundary zzso The zzso has been implemented and tested on long zzso sequences with a number of zzso Test results show that very accurate zzso gene models can be expected when related zzso exist for the predicted zzso
