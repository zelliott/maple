An zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso boundary condition at walls at rest for the lattice zzso zzso method is zzso The main result of this analysis is an alternative zzso for the zzso boundary condition at walls at zzso zzso experiments assess the accuracy and stability of this zzso for zzso and zzso flows, flow over a backward facing step, and unsteady flow around a square zzso This zzso boundary condition is compared zzso and zzso to the boundary conditions of zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso and Zou and He zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso and it is found that all three make use of the same mechanism for the zzso element of the stress zzso Mass zzso however, is only assured by the present zzso In addition, our analysis points out which mechanism lies behind the zzso also observed by zzso zzso zzso E 77, zzso zzso for this kind of boundary zzso We present a way to remove these zzso allowing one to reach relaxation zzso considerably closer to zzso
