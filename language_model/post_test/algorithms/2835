The dynamics of energy transport along rigid rod zzso zzso is modeled with a special emphasis on the role of zzso zzso A simple random growth zzso based on zzso zzso with increasing zzso yields zzso chains with increasing degree of zzso and zzso energetic zzso Despite the fact that the average hopping rate between two zzso is reduced (because the decrease in electronic zzso overwhelms the increase in spectral zzso a more efficient zzso motion along chains with longer zzso segments is predicted, in good agreement with recent zzso This points to the central role of zzso disorder on zzso energy diffusion in zzso zzso
