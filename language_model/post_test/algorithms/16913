Breast cancer outcome can be predicted using models derived from gene expression data or clinical zzso Only a few studies have created a single prediction model using both gene expression and clinical zzso These studies often remain zzso regarding an obtained improvement in prediction zzso We rigorously compare three different integration strategies zzso zzso and late zzso as well as zzso employing no integration zzso one data zzso using five zzso of varying zzso We perform our analysis on a set of 295 breast cancer samples, for which gene expression data and an extensive set of clinical parameters are available as well as four breast cancer zzso containing 521 samples that we used as independent zzso the 295 samples, a nearest mean zzso employing a logical OR operation zzso zzso on clinical and expression zzso significantly zzso all other zzso Moreover, regardless of the integration strategy, the nearest mean zzso achieves the best zzso All five zzso achieve their best performance when zzso clinical and expression zzso Repeating the experiments using the 521 samples from the four independent validation zzso also indicated a significant performance improvement when zzso clinical and gene expression zzso Whether integration also improves performances on other zzso zzso other tumor zzso has not been investigated, but seems worthwhile zzso Our work suggests that future models for predicting breast cancer outcome should exploit both data types by employing a late OR or intermediate integration strategy based on nearest mean zzso
