The gamma index is a tool for dose distribution zzso It combines both dose difference zzso and distance to agreement zzso into a single zzso Though it is an effective measure, making up for the zzso of zzso or zzso alone, its calculation can be very zzso For a zzso space with N zzso levels in each dimension, the complexity of the exhaustive search is zzso In this work, we proposed an efficient method that reduces the complexity from zzso to zzso where M is the number of zzso dose values and is comparable to zzso More precisely, by embedding the reference dose distribution in a zzso zzso space, we can use fast zzso distance transform with linear complexity to obtain a table of gamma zzso evaluated over a range of the zzso zzso zzso Then, to obtain gamma zzso for the test dose distribution, it requires only table zzso with complexity zzso Such a table can also be used for other test dose zzso as long as the reference dose distribution is the zzso zzso demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed zzso The zzso for zzso gamma index calculation is expected to be on the order of tens of thousands (from zzso to zzso if N is a few zzso which makes clinical usage of the zzso gamma index zzso A byproduct of the gamma index table is that the zzso of the gamma index with respect to either the spatial or dose dimension can be easily zzso The zzso can be used to identify the main causes of the zzso from the reference distribution at any dose point in the test distribution or incorporated in treatment planning and machine zzso zzso
