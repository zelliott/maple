We present a technique for enhancing zzso zzso video by fusing it with simultaneously captured video from sensors in zzso zzso such as Short Wave zzso or Near zzso Although zzso sensors can accurately capture video in zzso and zzso applications, they lack the color and relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso sensors do capture color and correct relative zzso but are zzso zzso and lack fine features due to short video exposure zzso Our enhanced fusion output is a reconstruction of the zzso input assisted by the zzso data, not an incorporation of elements zzso only in zzso With a zzso noise reduction, we first remove shot noise and increase the color accuracy of the zzso zzso The zzso video is then zzso to ensure zzso zzso with the zzso video using ratio zzso To aid fusion, we decompose the video sources with zzso zzso We introduce a zzso version of the bilateral filter called the zzso zzso that robustly zzso the zzso zzso It zzso the zzso zzso for edge detection but also preserves strong zzso edges not in the zzso We fuse the zzso low zzso the zzso texture details, and the dual bilateral edges into a zzso video with sharp details, correct zzso and natural relative zzso
