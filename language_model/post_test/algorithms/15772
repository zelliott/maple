In animals, the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso learning fear to context and fear to tone, doing so at zzso that produce zzso in zzso zzso are zzso compounds that do not produce zzso in response to noxious zzso nor do they decrease the requirement for conventional zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso learning at zzso less than those predicted from its zzso to produce zzso The capacity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to affect learning and memory has not been zzso Both zzso can cause zzso We hypothesized that if zzso zzso and zzso act by the same mechanism to impair learning and memory, their effects should be zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso impaired learning fear to context and fear to tone in rats, with the zzso doing so at zzso less than those that cause zzso zzso was defined by freezing zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso stimulus zzso or zzso However, the combination of zzso and zzso or zzso produced an zzso rather than an additive effect on learning, a finding in conflict with our zzso And zzso was no less potent than zzso (at least no less potent relative to the concentration of each that produced zzso in its capacity to impair zzso We conclude that conventional zzso zzso and zzso impair learning and memory by different zzso The basis for this impairment remains zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in their effects on learning and memory, and this finding suggests that they impair learning and memory, at least in part, by different zzso
