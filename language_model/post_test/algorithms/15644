Assessment of potential spine injuries is inconsistent and zzso zzso morbidity includes prolonged zzso and missed zzso To address these issues, a multidisciplinary team was organized to design a cervical spine zzso zzso The process, algorithm, and initial results are zzso 

Team members consisted of pediatric zzso orthopedic zzso zzso emergency room physicians, and trauma nurse zzso zzso standards, guidelines, and experiences across disciplines were zzso and a consensus zzso evolved for cervical spine clearance in children 8 years and zzso A short-term retrospective review (5 zzso was performed to assess initial zzso Time required for zzso number and type of imaging studies, and number of missed injuries were compared between a group of patients before zzso zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso 

zzso guidelines for cervical spine zzso and clearance criteria were zzso After zzso of this pathway, time required for cervical clearance in zzso children decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso v after, zzso zzso zzso hours; P zzso A clear trend toward earlier clearance in zzso patients existed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso v after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hours; P zzso there need to be larger numbers to determine statistical zzso The 2 study groups were similar in zzso mechanism of zzso zzso coma scale zzso and number of plain zzso zzso zzso scans, and magnetic resonance imaging studies zzso Neither group had missed zzso 

standards for cervical spine zzso assessment, and zzso Implementation of such guidelines decreased time for cervical spine zzso and ongoing analysis of sensitivity is zzso
