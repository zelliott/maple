In this paper, we present a zzso zzso model for representing the images and surface depth maps of drapery and zzso The upper level consists of a number of folds which will generate the high contrast zzso areas with a dictionary of zzso zzso (for zzso zzso and fold zzso (for zzso depth zzso These zzso are represented in zzso forms and are learned in a supervised learning phase using zzso surfaces of clothes acquired through zzso zzso The lower level consists of the remaining flat areas which fill between the folds with a zzso prior zzso random zzso We show that the classical zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be much improved by this zzso model for its reduced zzso and incorporation of zzso visual knowledge, zzso the dictionary of zzso Given an input image, we first zzso the folds and zzso a sketch graph using a sketch pursuit zzso as in the primal sketch zzso zzso The zzso folds are estimated by zzso fitting using the fold dictionary and they form the zzso of the zzso zzso Then, the lower level is zzso by conventional zzso method using the fold areas as boundary zzso The two levels interact at the final stage by zzso a joint zzso zzso probability on the depth zzso We show a number of experiments which demonstrate more robust results in comparison with state-of-the-art zzso In a broader zzso our representation can be viewed as a zzso zzso zzso model which is zzso to general zzso zzso Our study is an attempt to revisit zzso idea zzso of computing the zzso sketch from primal zzso In a companion paper zzso we study shape from stereo based on a similar zzso zzso sketch zzso
