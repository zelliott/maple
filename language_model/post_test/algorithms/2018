zzso scans are inefficient when the size of the anatomy under investigation is small relative to the zzso full zzso The field of view must be expanded, and acquisition times accordingly zzso zzso scans are feasible with reduced field of view imaging zzso using outer volume suppression zzso a zzso preparation sequence that zzso signal outside a region of interest zzso This work presents a new zzso sequence with a zzso zzso short zzso and improved tolerance for zzso zzso The sequence consists of a zzso zzso zzso pulse, which provides zzso signal suppression, and a fast zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the Bloch equations with zzso initial zzso reveals a zzso zzso constraint for zzso zzso with small flip zzso This property is exploited to achieve zzso performance from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence is validated in zzso and in zzso with zzso spiral imaging at 3 zzso The relative zzso ratio efficiency of the proposed sequence was zzso in a phantom and zzso in zzso The effectiveness is demonstrated with cardiovascular zzso imaging, which exhibits improved resolution and reduced artifacts compared to zzso full field of view zzso
