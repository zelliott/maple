To compare the performance of zzso versus zzso visual fields zzso in detecting progression of initial zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with the following criteria: zzso an zzso zzso 3 adjacent points with zzso within the central zzso degrees of zzso 1 point or more with zzso lying at the zzso zzso points, and no zzso outside the central zzso in either zzso based on 2 reliable zzso zzso Swedish interactive threshold zzso standard zzso and zzso 5 or more zzso and zzso zzso 

Based on threshold map sensitivities, zzso zzso defined as having 1 or more significantly progressing zzso with a slope of sensitivity of less than zzso zzso at zzso was evaluated using zzso linear zzso 

The number of progressing eyes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Fifty eyes zzso zzso were included zzso age zzso standard zzso 62 zzso 9 zzso Mean follow-up period zzso zzso zzso zzso and number of zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar between zzso and zzso analyses (all zzso zzso more progressing eyes were detected in zzso than in zzso analyses (24 zzso 11 zzso P zzso zzso This difference became greater within the central zzso (24 zzso 4 zzso zzso Four of the 11 progressing eyes in zzso analysis were missed in zzso analysis, whereas 17 of the 24 progressing eyes in zzso analysis were missed in zzso zzso The 4 progressing eyes missed in zzso analysis had progressing zzso only outside the central zzso in zzso zzso The other 3 eyes with progressing zzso only outside the central zzso in zzso analysis were detected as progressing in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when more stringent criteria (at least 2 significantly progressing points within the same zzso were used for zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso detects more progressing eyes than the zzso zzso in glaucoma patients with zzso suggesting that closer surveillance of the central zzso using testing zzso with closely spaced zzso is warranted in eyes with zzso zzso
