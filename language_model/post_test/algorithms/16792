zzso zzso zzso has been widely used as a new technology to diagnose gastrointestinal tract diseases, especially for small zzso However, the large number of images in each test is a great burden for zzso As such, computer aided detection zzso scheme is needed to relieve the workload of zzso In this paper, automatic differentiation of tumor zzso image and normal zzso image is investigated through comparative textural feature zzso Four different color textures are studied in this work, zzso texture spectrum zzso color zzso zzso rotation zzso uniform local zzso pattern and zzso based local zzso zzso With support zzso machine being the zzso the discrimination ability of these four different color textures for tumor detection in zzso images is extensively compared in zzso Lab and zzso color space through zzso zzso experiments on our zzso image zzso It is found that zzso color space is the most suitable color space for all these texture based zzso zzso Moreover, the best performance achieved is zzso in terms of average zzso which is obtained by the scheme based on rotation zzso uniform local zzso zzso
