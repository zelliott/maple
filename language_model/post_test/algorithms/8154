Although the zzso of zzso zzso differ among racial groups, most zzso zzso for zzso zzso dosing only include two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso or zzso commonly found among zzso zzso this study sought to identify other zzso and zzso zzso important in zzso dose zzso and to determine their zzso in different racial and ethnic zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes were zzso in selected sensitive zzso 21 zzso and resistant zzso 49 zzso individuals with zzso therapeutic and zzso zzso doses based on prior zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined in healthy, racially zzso blood zzso 

zzso identified an African-American male with a lower than predicted therapeutic zzso dose zzso zzso previously zzso as zzso who was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 600 African-American zzso identified zzso as their most frequent zzso zzso zzso zzso and the combined zzso frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Given most zzso zzso dosing zzso only include zzso and zzso the inclusion of zzso alone could zzso the predicted zzso zzso of almost zzso of African-Americans, or when combined with zzso zzso and zzso more than zzso In addition, the African-American zzso zzso zzso frequency was zzso and three zzso zzso carriers were zzso 

zzso is prevalent among African-Americans ( approximately 1 in 11 zzso Thus, in this racial group, the incorporation of zzso into zzso panels may improve dose prediction of zzso drugs, including zzso
