In patients with zzso pneumonia zzso switching from IV to PO antibiotics offers advantages over IV therapy alone, including improved zzso through reductions in the length of hospital stay and treatment zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine whether a method for switching therapy in clinical practice could be used in patients with zzso and whether differences were found in the duration of IV treatment and length of hospital stay between the 5 risk classes of the zzso zzso Index zzso after the therapy zzso 

This was a zzso zzso study of patients aged zzso years presenting with zzso at our teaching hospital between December 1998 and November zzso zzso and zzso tests were performed, and signs and symptoms of zzso zzso protein levels, and white blood cell counts were assessed throughout treatment and at the zzso zzso Patients were zzso by zzso risk zzso When the patient's temperature had been zzso for 72 hours and respiratory symptoms zzso zzso and zzso zzso had improved, patients were switched from IV to PO therapy zzso zzso 

The study included 180 patients with zzso Clinical cure was seen in 174 zzso zzso No significant difference between the 5 risk classes was found in duration of zzso Patients in risk class V remained hospitalized for a significantly longer period than patients in risk classes I through IV zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, after patients were switched to PO zzso the level of zzso protein decreased in patients in all risk classes and was zzso by zzso 

In the population zzso use of specific criteria zzso absence of fever for 72 hours and reduction in respiratory zzso allowed successful switch from IV to PO zzso therapy for the treatment of zzso zzso of therapy was not affected by zzso risk class, but those in risk class V were hospitalized longer than other risk zzso
