We report a new method to create high purity zzso polarized field with extremely long depth of focus in the focal volume of a high zzso zzso zzso objective zzso Through reversing the radiated field from an electric zzso array situated near the focus of the zzso zzso the required incident field distribution in the zzso plane for the creation of an zzso optical needle field can be zzso zzso examples demonstrate that an optical needle field with a depth of focus up to zzso is zzso Throughout the depth of focus, this engineered focal field maintains a zzso limited zzso spot size zzso with high zzso polarization zzso From the calculated zzso plane distribution, a simplified discrete complex zzso filter can be designed and significant improvements over the previously reported complex filters are clearly zzso
