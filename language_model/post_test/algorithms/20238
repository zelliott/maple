This paper reviews and develops the applications of zzso chain zzso Carlo methods in pedigree analysis, with particular stress on the zzso zzso In likelihood based genetic zzso standard deterministic zzso often fail because of the zzso complexity of the observed pedigree data under a proposed genetic zzso The new zzso Carlo methods permit approximate maximum likelihood zzso in the presence of such zzso zzso Carlo zzso of the zzso zzso is the key to successful maximum likelihood zzso Gibbs sampling and the zzso zzso are alternative ways of defining zzso chains for performing the E step of the zzso zzso Two applications illustrate the power and simplicity of the zzso zzso One of these applications involves a discrete model for zzso component analysis of quantitative zzso the other application involves a zzso Carlo version of location scores for zzso linkage zzso
