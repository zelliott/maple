Despite significant progress in imaging technologies, the efficient detection of edges and zzso features in images of zzso and zzso structures acquired using light or electron zzso is a challenging and time consuming task in many zzso 

We present a novel method, based on the discrete zzso zzso to extract a directional field from the image that indicates the location and direction of the zzso This directional field is then processed using the zzso suppression and zzso steps of the zzso zzso to trace along the edges and mark zzso zzso the edges may then be extended along the directions given by the zzso to provide a more connected edge zzso We compare our scheme to the zzso edge detector and an edge detector based on zzso zzso and show that our scheme performs better in detecting larger, zzso structures possibly composed of several step or zzso zzso 

The proposed zzso based edge detection is a novel and competitive approach for imaging zzso We expect that the methodology and the accompanying software will facilitate and improve edge detection in images available using light or electron zzso
