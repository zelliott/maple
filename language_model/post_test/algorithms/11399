zzso zzso is usually limited to zzso homogeneous zzso A hybrid scheme is developed to break this limitation by utilizing ultrasound to determine the unknown Green's function of zzso zzso The method can effectively decrease the distortion and false contrast in images by zzso information from zzso zzso The method does not depend on the prior knowledge of tissue and the medium zzso Moreover, the zzso of Green's function and the zzso detection are performed by the same zzso zzso the scheme could be easily integrated into a classical zzso zzso system and extend its application in zzso zzso
