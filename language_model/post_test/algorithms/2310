A program for automatic and periodic determination of respiratory mechanics in artificially zzso patients is zzso zzso pressure and flow signals are obtained from the zzso in the controlled ventilation mode with constant flow inflation and zzso zzso Periodically, the program records both signals for a given time and it zzso a zzso cycle and its components out of this zzso Then, four mechanical parameters of the respiratory system are zzso zzso zzso the resistance obtained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso calculated from the slope of the airway pressure profile during zzso zzso zzso the zzso time zzso zzso zzso the global positive end zzso zzso All zzso zzso have been evaluated in experimental conditions, and are in good agreement with reference zzso The complete software includes the display of the signals and of the trends together with automatic disk file zzso An additional program allows one to display the trends again and to create table text files containing all the recorded data for further zzso The system proved to work in zzso and zzso patients with various zzso
