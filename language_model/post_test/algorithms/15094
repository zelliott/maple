The long-term results and zzso of success for vascular access at The Toronto Hospital were zzso This report describes the access program and emphasizes the role of the vascular access zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive patients underwent zzso vascular access zzso The access program is centered around a dedicated, full-time vascular access coordinator, who is a registered nurse and is responsible for all aspects of access care, including zzso zzso variables were collected zzso zzso zzso and secondary success was determined by means of zzso analysis, and the zzso Cox zzso hazards model was used for zzso analysis of the factors that were independently zzso of primary zzso 

There were 235 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 231 zzso zzso zzso The cumulative primary, zzso and secondary success zzso and functional for effective zzso at 24 months for all zzso cases combined was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary success for zzso and zzso at 2 years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso success for zzso and zzso at 2 years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso and the secondary success for zzso and zzso at 2 years was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of variables revealed significant benefit for zzso zzso zzso the female sex zzso zzso and the absence of diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with Cox zzso determined that access type zzso vs zzso P zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso were independently zzso of primary zzso The improved clinical coordination of access patients with the initiation of the vascular access program resulted in a significant reduction in length of hospital stay before and after the program was organized zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

The organization of a vascular access program in a practical and cost-effective way for reduced length of hospital stay is streamlined through a dedicated access coordinator, who ensures an zzso multidisciplinary zzso The results for the Cox model is useful when discussing the anticipated results of access procedures with individual zzso
