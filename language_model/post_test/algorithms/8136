Time series are used in many zzso including finance, engineering, economics and zzso generally to represent the change of a measurement over zzso Modeling techniques may then be used to give a synthetic representation of such zzso A new approach for time series modeling is proposed in this zzso It consists of a zzso model incorporating a discrete hidden zzso process allowing for zzso smoothly or abruptly different zzso zzso zzso The model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method performed by a dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso The M step of the zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to estimate the hidden process zzso To evaluate the proposed approach, an experimental study on simulated data and real world data was performed using two alternative zzso a zzso zzso zzso model using a global zzso zzso based on dynamic programming, and a Hidden zzso zzso Model whose parameters are estimated by the zzso zzso Finally, in the context of the remote monitoring of components of the French railway infrastructure, and more particularly the switch zzso the proposed approach has been applied to modeling and zzso time series representing the condition zzso acquired during switch zzso
