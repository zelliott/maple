The original zzso feature map did not define any probability distribution on the input zzso However, the advantages of introducing zzso zzso into zzso map models were soon zzso This has led to a wide range of proposals which reflect the current emergence of zzso approaches to zzso zzso The underlying zzso theories behind them derive from two main lines of thought: the expectation zzso methodology and zzso approximation zzso Here, we present a comprehensive view of the state of the art, with a unifying perspective of the involved theoretical zzso In particular, we examine the most commonly used continuous probability zzso zzso mechanisms, and learning zzso Special emphasis is given to the connections among them and their relative advantages depending on the characteristics of the problem at zzso Furthermore, we evaluate their performance in two typical applications of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
