zzso transformation of MR brain images is a standard tool used in automated anatomical zzso and other quantitative and qualitative methods to assess brain tissue volume, zzso and zzso Despite widespread use, the quantitative effects of spatial transformation on regional brain volume estimates have been little zzso We report on the effects of transformation on regional brain volumes of 38 zzso zzso manually zzso zzso After tracing in native space, regions of interest were transformed using a classic zzso zzso transformation zzso or a zzso registration zzso 5th order zzso algorithm, 158 zzso to one of three zzso zzso 1) zzso constructed from 50 zzso normal zzso 2) the zzso zzso atlas, 3) zzso constructed from zzso scans of the 38 subjects used in this zzso Native volumes were compared to the transformed zzso We found that: 1) significant zzso differences can be obtained in transformed data sets that are in the opposite direction of effects obtained in native space; 2) the effects of transformation are zzso across brain regions, even after zzso for total brain volume and zzso 3) zzso zzso correlations between native and transformed brains differ by registration method and template choice, region, and tissue type; and 4) transformed brains produced zzso and corpus zzso volume proportions that were significantly different from those obtained in native zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso differences uncovered by zzso methods should be zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso should take into account whether volumes are determined using zzso images and/or specific automated zzso
