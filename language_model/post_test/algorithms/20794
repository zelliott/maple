The study of genetic interactions zzso is central to the understanding of zzso organization and zzso A general correlation between zzso and zzso complexity has been recently zzso such that in simpler zzso zzso is zzso on average zzso effects tend to cancel each other zzso whereas a transition towards synergistic zzso occurs in more complex zzso zzso effects strengthen each zzso Here, we use a simple network model to identify basic features explaining this zzso We show that, in small networks with zzso zzso lack of zzso and absence of alternative zzso zzso is zzso on zzso In contrast, lack of zzso high zzso and zzso favor synergistic zzso Moreover, we confirm the previous finding that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso in less robust networks it tends to be zzso whereas in more robust networks it tends to be zzso We argue that network features associated with zzso zzso are typically found in simple zzso such as those of viruses and bacteria, whereas the features associated with synergistic zzso are more extensively exploited by higher zzso
