Several zzso methods exist to suggest rational genetic interventions that improve the productivity of industrial zzso Nonetheless, these methods are less effective to predict possible genetic responses of the strain after the zzso This problem requires a better understanding of potential alternative zzso and regulatory pathways able to counteract the targeted zzso 

Here we present zzso an zzso based on zzso zzso zzso that zzso alternative zzso pathways between input and output species in a reconstructed zzso The pathways can be constructed zzso in order of increasing zzso zzso allows the zzso of zzso in the zzso which permits discovering pathways missed by most traditional zzso analysis zzso In addition, we provide a proof of concept experiment for the zzso of the zzso We deleted the genes for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and isolated zzso zzso strains able to grow on zzso as single carbon zzso Our SAT approach proposed candidate alternative pathways which were decisive to pinpoint the exact zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso is the first application of SAT techniques to zzso zzso It is particularly useful for the characterization of zzso zzso zzso and can be used in a synthetic biology setting to design new pathways with specific zzso zzso
