DNA zzso provide a broad snapshot of the state of the cell by measuring the expression levels of thousands of genes zzso zzso techniques can enable the exploration and detection of patterns and relationships in a complex data set by presenting the data in a zzso format in which the key characteristics become more zzso The zzso and size of array data sets however present significant challenges to zzso The purpose of this study is to present an interactive approach for visualizing variations in gene expression profiles and to assess its usefulness for zzso zzso 

The first zzso harmonic projection was used to map zzso gene expression data to two dimensions in an zzso called zzso The zzso method was tested using the zzso expressed genes identified in eight separate gene expression data zzso The samples were classified using the zzso decision tree zzso zzso to provide a procedure for zzso zzso The zzso were evaluated by the holdout and the zzso zzso The proposed method was found to achieve high zzso 

zzso mathematical derivation of all mapping properties as well as figures in color can be found as supplementary on the web page zzso All programs were written in zzso and zzso and software code is available by request from the first zzso
