zzso zzso frequently observed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso result in zzso expression of the zzso protein zzso and surface zzso zzso which display one or more novel variable zzso region zzso zzso In the present study, we develop a simulation model of the zzso center zzso to explore how these zzso might influence the emergence and zzso expansion of key zzso which provoke FL zzso The simulations employ a zzso method for calculating the cellular zzso which incorporates actual zzso region sequences and a simplified zzso zzso We first bring our simulations into agreement with experimental data for zzso normal and zzso zzso zzso responses in mice to provide a model for understanding how zzso expression leads to zzso selection and memory cell differentiation of zzso competitive zzso However, as zzso expression in the zzso alone is thought to be insufficient for FL development, we next monitor simulated zzso region zzso to determine the emergence times of key zzso displaying zzso zzso motifs zzso observed in human FL zzso zzso zzso of 26 zzso zzso gene segments indicate that particular zzso regions have a zzso selective advantage by virtue of the speed with which one or more of their key sites can generate zzso motifs upon zzso Separate calculations attribute the high occurrence frequency of such zzso regions in FL to an ability to produce key zzso at a fast enough rate to overcome zzso processes in the zzso that hinder zzso zzso Altogether, these simulations characterize three pathways for FL maturation through positively selected zzso zzso via one of two key sites within zzso zzso region gene zzso or via a site in the third heavy chain zzso region zzso that is generated from zzso zzso
