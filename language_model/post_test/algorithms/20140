The comparison between two protein structures is important for understanding a molecular zzso In particular, the comparison of protein surfaces to measure their similarity provides another challenge useful for studying molecular evolution, zzso and drug zzso This paper presents an algorithm, called the zzso which evaluates the similarity between the surfaces of two structures using the zzso which is a geometric structure derived from the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso performs zzso of mix-and-match between the zzso of two structures for the optimal zzso from which a similarity measure is zzso where each mix-and-match step attempts to solve an zzso zzso The devised zzso zzso based on the assignment problem zzso quickly produces a good zzso and an assessment of zzso The zzso was fully implemented and zzso against popular programs, the zzso and the zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso is freely available to the public from the zzso zzso Research Center ( zzso zzso
