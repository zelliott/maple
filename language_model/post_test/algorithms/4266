Recently, investigators have proposed state-of-the-art zzso zzso mapping methods to detect zzso segments between purportedly unrelated zzso The zzso information can then be used for association testing in genetic association zzso One approach for this zzso association testing strategy is to test for excessive zzso between pairs of cases zzso zzso However, this approach is inefficient because it requires a large number of zzso Moreover, a limited number of permutations define a lower bound for zzso which makes zzso of associated regions difficult because, in practice, a much larger zzso region is implicated than the region that is actually zzso 

In this article, we introduce a new zzso method zzso zzso uses importance sampling to improve efficiency and enable approximation of extremely small zzso zzso method takes only days to complete a zzso zzso In the application to the zzso type 1 diabetes data, zzso successfully zzso a known human zzso zzso gene that is known to cause the zzso
