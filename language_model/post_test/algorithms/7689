We propose a novel framework for rapid and accurate zzso of a cohort of zzso First, it zzso local and global image context through a product rule to simultaneously detect multiple landmarks on the target zzso The global zzso zzso evidence over all volume patches, while the local image context is modeled with a local zzso zzso Through zzso modeling of the global zzso it exploits zzso in the global context for efficient zzso The complete surface of the target zzso is then zzso by robust alignment of a shape model to the resulting landmarks and finally zzso using zzso boundary zzso Using our approach, we demonstrate efficient detection and accurate zzso of liver, zzso heart, and lungs in challenging zzso MR data in less than one second, and of zzso zzso zzso and zzso heads in CT scans, in roughly one to three seconds and in both cases with accuracy fairly close to zzso zzso
