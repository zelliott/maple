zzso can be an effective approach for several applications other than image coding and zzso database indexing, texture zzso and even pattern recognition problems such as writer zzso However, zzso zzso are strongly zzso because, in spite of the zzso of the decoding phase, the coding process is much more time zzso Many different solutions have been proposed for this problem, but there is not yet a standard for zzso zzso This paper proposes a method to reduce the complexity of the image coding phase by zzso the blocks according to an approximation error zzso It is formally shown that zzso zzso domain comparisons with respect to a zzso block, it is possible to reduce drastically the amount of operations needed to zzso each zzso The proposed method has been compared with three other zzso coding methods, showing under which circumstances it performs better in terms of both bit rate and/or computing zzso
