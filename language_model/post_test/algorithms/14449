zzso weight zzso are an important method for modeling signals or motifs in biological zzso both in DNA and protein zzso In this paper, we present fast zzso for the problem of finding significant matches of such zzso Our zzso are of the online type, and they zzso classical zzso matching, zzso and zzso techniques of zzso string matching to the problem of weight zzso zzso Several zzso of the zzso are developed, including multiple zzso extensions that perform the search for several zzso in one scan through the sequence zzso Experimental performance evaluation is provided to compare the new techniques against each other as well as against some other online and zzso zzso proposed in the zzso Compared to the zzso zzso approach, our solutions can be faster by a factor that is zzso to the zzso length zzso Our zzso zzso zzso had the best performance in the zzso On a current PC, this zzso finds significant matches zzso zzso zzso of the 123 zzso zzso in the human zzso in about 18 zzso
