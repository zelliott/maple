Many plant zzso are already known, and new ones are being zzso every zzso The next step for researchers is to identify all of the functional elements in these zzso including the important class of functional elements known as zzso zzso which are involved in zzso regulatory zzso However, zzso tools for predicting new plant zzso are zzso and there is a particular need for tools that can be used easily by laboratory zzso We present zzso a new tool for predicting zzso in plant zzso available as a Web zzso This tool takes a putative target sequence such as a zzso zzso zzso as zzso and allows users to search for zzso that target this zzso It can also be used to determine whether small zzso sequences from massive sequencing analysis represent true zzso and to search for zzso in new zzso using zzso zzso has shown a high level of accuracy using various test sets, and gives users the ability to search for zzso with several different adjustable zzso zzso a zzso and intuitive Web server for predicting zzso zzso can be reached at zzso zzso It is useful for researchers searching for zzso involved in particular zzso as well as those searching for zzso in newly zzso zzso
