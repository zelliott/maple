zzso zzso interactions zzso is an essential step in drug development and drug zzso Most zzso zzso methods focus on modeling drug zzso aiming at interactions that result from a common zzso zzso zzso Here, we introduce a novel prediction method, zzso zzso Drug zzso allowing the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso (along with their associated zzso and zzso zzso associated zzso On cross zzso it zzso high specificity and sensitivity levels zzso zzso under the zzso characteristic zzso zzso In application to the zzso adverse event reporting system, zzso of the drug events could potentially be connected to known zzso or predicted zzso zzso Additionally, zzso predicts the severity level of each zzso upon zzso of the involved drugs, suggesting that severe interactions are abundant in the clinical zzso zzso regularly taken medications by hospitalized patients, zzso of the patients receive known or predicted severely interacting drugs and are hospitalized more zzso Access to zzso and its predictions is provided via a web tool at zzso zzso the zzso and exploration of drug interactions and providing important leads for physicians and pharmaceutical companies zzso
