This study tested whether cerebral zzso affects cognitive function during zzso We measured reaction times zzso of 12 participants while they performed a modified version of the zzso zzso task, at rest and while zzso In the exercise condition, participants performed the cognitive task at rest and while cycling at three zzso zzso 60, and zzso of peak oxygen zzso zzso see zzso In the control condition, the workload was fixed at 20 zzso zzso was divided into zzso and motor components based on surface zzso zzso The zzso component of zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the effects of acute exercise on cognitive zzso zzso zzso was monitored during the cognitive task over the right frontal zzso using zzso zzso In the exercise condition, we found that zzso time significantly decreased during exercise at zzso peak zzso see zzso relative to zzso However, this improvement was not observed during exercise at zzso peak zzso see zzso In the control condition, zzso time did not change during zzso zzso zzso during exercise at zzso peak zzso see zzso was not significantly different from that at rest, while cerebral zzso substantially decreased during exercise at zzso peak zzso see zzso The present results suggest that an improvement in cognitive function occurs during moderate exercise, independent of cerebral zzso
