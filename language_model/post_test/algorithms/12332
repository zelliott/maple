A method to measure the zzso profile of a zzso zzso zzso leaf along its travel range using a zzso film is reported by considering the zzso zzso A specific dynamic zzso field with leaves travelling from the field edge to the zzso line was zzso The field was used to expose a zzso film, which was then zzso and the dose profile along the horizontal leaf axis was zzso The zzso at a sampling point on the film can be calculated by considering the horizontal distance between the sampling point and the zzso line, dose at the sampling point, dose rate of the linear zzso the total leaf travel time from the field edge to zzso line and the zzso dose rate of leaf zzso With the leaf zzso and zzso profiles for all zzso leaves measured zzso a comprehensive and simple zzso for the zzso can be set up to test the consistency of the leaf zzso performance which is essential to the zzso delivery using a sliding window zzso
