The zzso zzso used in analyses that estimate the number of zzso segregating in a mapping population requires the calculation of an acceptance probability to add or drop a zzso from the zzso Expressions for this acceptance probability need to recognize that sets of zzso are zzso such that the number of equivalent sets increases with the zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we show how accounting for this fact affects the acceptance probability and review expressions found in the zzso
