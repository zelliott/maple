This article is the second of a series of two articles detailing the application of mixing index to assess zzso distribution in oral pharmaceutical solid dosage forms by image zzso Chemical imaging zzso is an emerging technique zzso conventional imaging and zzso techniques with a view to obtaining spatial and spectral information from a zzso Near infrared chemical imaging zzso has proved an excellent zzso tool for zzso high-quality information from sample zzso The primary objective of this second part was to demonstrate that the approach developed in the first part could be successfully applied to near infrared zzso images of oral pharmaceutical solid dosage forms such as coated, zzso and zzso zzso as well as to powder zzso To this end, we assessed a new criterion for establishing mixing zzso by using four different methods based on a three-dimensional zzso data array of zzso images zzso standard zzso and correlation zzso or a two-dimensional zzso data array zzso maps and zzso zzso The four methods were used applying zzso analysis to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso proved useful for assessing the degree of zzso of pharmaceutical zzso The results testify that the proposed approach can be effectively used in the pharmaceutical industry, in the finished products zzso zzso and in mixing unit operations for example, as a process zzso technology tool for the blending monitoring (see part zzso
