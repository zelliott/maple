Most zzso zzso memory zzso networks use a symmetrical output function for dual zzso zzso In this paper, we show that by introducing an asymmetry zzso into a recently introduced chaotic zzso output function, prior knowledge can be used to momentarily zzso desired zzso from memory, hence zzso the search space to improve recall zzso This property allows control of chaotic zzso favoring given zzso over zzso In addition, reinforcement learning can then enable a dual zzso architecture to store and recall zzso zzso zzso Our results allow the same zzso framework to model three different types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This ability is very promising from the cognitive modeling zzso The new zzso model is also useful from an engineering zzso our simulations results reveal a notable overall increase in zzso learning and recall performances when using a hybrid model with the general zzso neural network zzso
