zzso mobility is a fundamental material property that controls strength and zzso of zzso An important measure of dislocation mobility is its Peierls stress, zzso the minimal stress required to move a dislocation at zero zzso Here we report that, in the zzso cubic metal zzso the Peierls stress as a function of dislocation orientation exhibits fine structure with several singular zzso of high Peierls zzso zzso by zzso plateau zzso While the classical zzso model captures the high Peierls stress of singular zzso an extension that allows zzso to bend is necessary to account for the plateau zzso Our results clarify the notion of dislocation zzso as meaningful only for zzso within the plateau regions zzso to the Peierls stress zzso These observations lead us to propose a zzso type zzso of dislocation zzso into three distinct zzso zzso and zzso respect to their Peierls stress and motion zzso We predict that dislocation zzso expanding under stress at sufficiently low temperatures, should develop well defined zzso corresponding to two special zzso of highest Peierls stress, the screw and the zzso zzso both moving by zzso zzso We propose that both the screw and the zzso zzso are jointly responsible for the yield behavior of zzso metals at low zzso
