This paper presents an energy-efficient medium access control protocol suitable for communication in a wireless body area network for remote monitoring of zzso signals such as zzso and zzso The protocol takes advantage of the zzso nature of the body area network to implement the effective zzso multiple access zzso strategy with very little amount of overhead and almost no zzso listening (by static, we refer to the fixed zzso of the network zzso The main goal is to develop energy-efficient and reliable communication protocol to support streaming of large amount of zzso zzso synchronization problems are discussed and solutions are zzso zzso for duty cycle calculation are also derived for power consumption and battery life zzso The power consumption model was also validated through zzso Our results show that the protocol is energy efficient for streaming communication as well as sending short bursts of data, and thus can be used for different types of zzso signals with different sample zzso The protocol is implemented on the analog devices zzso zzso zzso
