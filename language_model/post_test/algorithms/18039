zzso zzso analysis has been used in population zzso and in the investigation of zzso zzso due to its high zzso Several methods for zzso zzso zzso data have been proposed, but it is unclear how accurate each of the methods is or which method is zzso The accuracy of two of the leading methods of zzso zzso zzso zzso based zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso based zzso in zzso zzso compared using a set of 122 zzso zzso zzso determined through direct zzso The accuracy was measured with the Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso Index zzso and zzso Identification Index zzso 

None of the methods zzso all of the known zzso and some differences were observed in the accuracy of the two methods in terms of both zzso determination and zzso zzso zzso Working with zzso composed by low zzso sites, present in more than one individual, increased the confidence in the assignment of zzso and in the zzso of the zzso zzso generated by both zzso 

The zzso zzso implemented method had the best overall performance both in zzso construction and frequency zzso although the differences between the two methods were zzso To our knowledge this was the first work aiming to test statistical methods using real zzso data from the zzso zzso
