zzso information on biological branching networks zzso nerves, airways or blood zzso is often required to improve the analysis of zzso medical imaging zzso A zzso zzso has been developed to obtain the full zzso zzso and dimensions zzso zzso zzso diameter, branching and gravity zzso of branching networks using their CT zzso It has been tested using CT images of a simple zzso branching network and applied to the CT images of a human cast of the airway zzso The zzso and zzso of the computer derived network were compared with the manually measured zzso Good agreement was zzso The airways dimensions also compared well with previous values quoted in zzso This zzso can provide complete data set analysis much more quickly than manual zzso Its use is limited by the CT resolution which means that very small branches are not zzso New data are presented on the branching angles of the airway zzso
