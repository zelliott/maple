zzso cone beam scanning methods that permit exact reconstruction in three-dimensional zzso are proposed, and their performances are investigated using the theory developed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 268 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 43, 546 zzso and Smith zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso 14 zzso The proposed methods move an zzso of a cone on two circles that are perpendicular to each other zzso zzso or on a few twists of a zzso curve zzso zzso The zzso information, the feasibility of zzso and the zzso of measurement by some typical cone beam scanning methods are analyzed using the relationship between the cone beam projections and the three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso it is found that the proposed methods can obtain the complete information about the three-dimensional zzso transform of an object with less redundant zzso Moreover, based on the analysis, a practically zzso reconstruction zzso suitable for the proposed methods is zzso zzso performed with both zzso and real zzso projections demonstrate the zzso of the proposed scanning methods and the reconstruction zzso Especially when a large cone angle is used, the proposed methods greatly improve the spatial resolution and the quantitative accuracy of reconstruction as compared with the method of circular zzso zzso
