In this paper, we present a zzso zzso method for magnetic resonance images of the zzso zzso Our method uses an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the level zzso zzso zzso The method only requires the input of a single point from the user inside the zzso zzso The templates are zzso selected from a set of images based on modes in the patient population, zzso sex and body zzso For a given image to be zzso a template is selected based on the smallest zzso divergence between the zzso of that image and the set of zzso The chosen template is then employed as an zzso for a level set zzso which captures individual anatomical variations in the image to be zzso Images from 103 subjects were analyzed using the developed zzso The zzso was trained on a randomly selected subset of 50 subjects zzso men and 25 zzso and tested on the remaining 53 zzso The performance of the zzso on the test set was compared against the ground truth using the zzso similarity index zzso The average zzso means and standard zzso against two different manual readers were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
