To investigate the impact of patient motion on zzso zzso imaging with zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and assess the effect of motion zzso 

Twenty zzso patients were included in the zzso Acquisitions were performed for all patients under the situations with or without body motion zzso Images were reconstructed without or with motion correction software zzso The extent of zzso defects was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso with a 20 zzso zzso scoring zzso 

The extent of artifacts and zzso defects was related to the extent zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and frequency zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of patient zzso The image quality was improved in 18 of 20 patients zzso significantly after motion correction zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso of segments that were previously considered normal zzso zzso 0 or 1) changed to abnormal zzso zzso zzso after motion zzso whereas zzso zzso of abnormal segments were reclassified as normal after motion zzso 

Motion correction is necessary in zzso zzso imaging reconstruction if the range of patient motion is out of one zzso or the motion frequency is more than one zzso But the correction is not helpful when the extent of body motion exceeds 3 zzso or the motion frequency is over one zzso
