zzso for risk definition in zzso zzso spectrum still go zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso techniques were combined with conventional zzso to realize whether an zzso is zzso for risk assessment to progress an invasive zzso in zzso zzso zzso spectrum is zzso 

The study was carried out on 20 benign zzso 35 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells, the volume percent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso were zzso zzso analysis was evaluated to set an objective zzso 

All benign zzso had zzso zzso whereas all zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso Of zzso 19 were zzso and 16 were zzso zzso value of zzso had zzso sensitivity, and zzso specificity zzso to distinguish zzso from zzso Neither zzso nor zzso data zzso the specificity or the sensitivity of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso values were found to be significant in differential of zzso zzso With this zzso a diagnostic zzso for zzso risk zzso was zzso This zzso is based on HE zzso zzso and zzso findings, and has zzso sensitivity and specificity to discriminate zzso zzso from zzso
