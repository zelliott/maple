A zzso zzso spin echo sequence was implemented on a GE zzso zzso zzso system for zzso zzso Data were acquired using an zzso designed zzso zzso zzso spiral zzso zzso This flexible design zzso allowed real-time prescription on the zzso Each zzso of the zzso spiral zzso the center of zzso The zzso provided an inherent motion compensation zzso The zzso zzso images showed good quality without any retrospective motion zzso An zzso motion correction zzso was developed to further reduce the signal cancellation artifact caused by zzso phase zzso In this algorithm, a zzso phase map was estimated using the zzso data in the center of zzso in order to correct for phase error in image zzso In zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso studies were performed on the brains of healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso images, trace zzso and zzso maps from zzso zzso and zzso slices were obtained using a zzso spiral zzso trajectory with zzso size 256 zzso zzso To our knowledge, this was also the first time in zzso 512 zzso 512 zzso results were zzso
