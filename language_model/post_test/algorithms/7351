zzso raise several information needs in the course of zzso Most of these needs can be met by online health knowledge resources such as zzso However, finding relevant information in these resources often requires significant time and cognitive zzso 

To design and assess zzso for zzso from zzso the sentences that represent the most clinically useful information for patient care decision zzso 

We developed zzso based on semantic zzso extracted with zzso a semantic natural language processing zzso Two zzso were compared against a gold standard composed of zzso sentences rated in terms of clinical zzso 

zzso useful sentences were strongly correlated with zzso frequency zzso zzso The two zzso did not differ in terms of top ten precision zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may serve as the basis for zzso clinically useful zzso Future research is needed to improve the zzso
