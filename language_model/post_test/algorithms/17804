The provision of nutritional support for patients in intensive care units zzso varies widely both within and between zzso We tested the hypothesis that evidence-based zzso to improve nutritional support in the zzso would improve patient zzso 

A zzso controlled trial was performed in the zzso of 11 community and 3 teaching hospitals between October 1997 and September zzso Hospital zzso were zzso by hospital type and zzso to the intervention or control zzso Patients at least 16 years of age with an expected zzso stay of at least 48 hours were enrolled in the study zzso zzso zzso zzso recommendations were introduced in the 7 intervention hospitals by means of zzso education sessions, reminders zzso zzso zzso and academic detailing that stressed early institution of nutritional support, preferably zzso 

Two hospitals crossed over and were excluded from the primary zzso Compared with the patients in the control hospitals zzso zzso zzso the patients in the intervention hospitals zzso zzso zzso received significantly more days of zzso nutrition zzso zzso zzso per 10 zzso p zzso zzso had a significantly shorter mean stay in hospital zzso zzso 35 zzso p zzso zzso and showed a trend toward reduced mortality zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The mean stay in the zzso did not differ between the control and intervention groups zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Implementation of evidence-based recommendations improved the provision of nutritional support and was associated with improved clinical zzso
