The properties of a system zzso were studied using zzso model of interaction and diffusion of charged particles near membrane in solutions of low zzso strength to which traditional assumptions about local zzso of medium are not zzso It is shown that the effect of zzso electric field leads to zzso the appearance of localized structures with contrast charge distribution and regimes zzso in time and in zzso
