zzso zzso zzso is associated with adverse zzso Whether recently discovered genetic risk markers improve zzso risk prediction is zzso 

We derived and validated a novel zzso risk prediction model from 32 possible zzso in the Women's Health Study zzso a cohort of 20 zzso women without cardiovascular disease zzso at baseline followed zzso for incident zzso zzso zzso zzso We then created a genetic risk score zzso comprised of 12 risk zzso in nine zzso and assessed model performance in the validation cohort with and without the zzso The newly derived zzso zzso risk zzso included terms for age, weight, zzso zzso blood pressure, alcohol use, and smoking zzso and zzso In the validation zzso this model was well zzso with good discrimination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and improved all zzso zzso when compared with age zzso The addition of the genetic score to the zzso zzso risk zzso model improved the zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the zzso net zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the integrated discrimination improvement zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, there was no improvement in net zzso into 10-year risk categories of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Among women without zzso a simple risk prediction model utilizing readily available risk markers identified women at higher risk for zzso The addition of genetic information resulted in modest improvements in zzso accuracy that did not translate into improved zzso into discrete zzso risk zzso
