An zzso spaced sampling zzso formed from a sequence of zzso frames is the input to an image sequence zzso zzso whose output is the set of image intensity values at the desired high-resolution image zzso The method of moving least squares zzso in zzso space has proved to be useful in filtering the noise and zzso scattered data by minimizing a weighted zzso error norm, but introducing blur in the zzso Starting with the continuous version of the zzso an explicit expression for the filter bandwidth is obtained as a function of the zzso order of approximation and the standard zzso zzso of the zzso weight zzso A discrete zzso of the zzso is performed on images and the effect of choice of the two dependent zzso scale and order, on noise filtering and reduction of blur introduced during the zzso process is zzso
