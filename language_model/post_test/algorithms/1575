We present a reduction framework from zzso ranking to zzso zzso The framework consists of three steps: zzso extended examples from the original examples, learning a zzso zzso on the extended examples with any zzso zzso algorithm, and constructing a zzso from the zzso zzso Based on the zzso we show that a weighted zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso cost of the zzso both zzso and zzso Our framework allows not only the design of good zzso ranking zzso based on zzso zzso zzso approaches, but also the derivation of new zzso bounds for zzso ranking from known bounds for zzso zzso In addition, our framework zzso many existing zzso ranking zzso such as zzso ranking and support zzso zzso zzso When compared zzso on benchmark data sets, some of our newly designed zzso enjoy advantages in terms of both training speed and zzso performance over existing zzso In addition, the newly designed zzso lead to better zzso zzso ranking performance, as well as improved zzso ranking zzso
