The current standard zzso Modeling zzso could not model framework flexibility and zzso adequately due to lack of appropriate zzso to distinguish framework zzso from kernel zzso A new zzso profile that may zzso zzso for framework modeling was presented using the extension mechanisms of zzso providing a group of zzso extensions to meet the needs of framework zzso In this profile, the extended class zzso and sequence zzso were defined to zzso identify the zzso and describe their zzso zzso A transformation model based on design patterns was also put forward, such that the profile based framework design zzso could be automatically mapped to the corresponding zzso zzso It was proved that the presented profile makes framework modeling more zzso and therefore easier to understand and zzso
