zzso acquisition of high-quality neural recordings is a cornerstone of zzso system zzso zzso the experimental zzso of chronically implanted zzso has been a formidable task because the sensor recording sites can be influenced by zzso and zzso zzso Several studies have implicated changes in electrical interface zzso as a preliminary marker to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the monitoring of low zzso and high-resolution zzso neural zzso In this work, we seek to zzso long-term zzso array functionality and derive an zzso predictor for zzso functionality that zzso the recording site electrical properties with the functional zzso recordings in zzso High zzso resolution metrics of this type would allow one to zzso zzso and improve zzso performance in the zzso In a large cohort of animals, we performed daily zzso zzso and neural signal recordings over long periods (up to 21 weeks) of time in rats using zzso zzso zzso implanted into the zzso zzso This study revealed that there was a zzso trend in the zzso of zzso that was related to zzso zzso Single units were best detected from zzso at time points when the zzso entered into the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso trend was modeled across the full cohort of animals to predict future zzso zzso The model was tested on data from all animals and was able to provide predictions of zzso performance zzso Insight from this study can be combined with knowledge of zzso materials and zzso analysis to provide a more comprehensive zzso model of zzso failure in the zzso
