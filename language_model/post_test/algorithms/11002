zzso is a major step in lung cancer zzso To perform zzso the physician uses a procedure plan, derived from a patient's zzso zzso zzso chest zzso to navigate the zzso through the lung zzso Unfortunately, physicians vary greatly in their ability to perform zzso As a result, zzso zzso systems, drawing upon the concept of zzso virtual zzso zzso have been zzso These systems attempt to register the zzso live position within the chest to a zzso virtual chest zzso Recent methods, which register the zzso video to zzso zzso airway zzso show promise but do not enable continuous real-time zzso We present a zzso registration method inspired by zzso innovations in the fields of image alignment and zzso zzso In particular, motivated by the zzso algorithm, we propose an zzso framework built around a zzso zzso zzso We next propose an zzso of the framework suitable for zzso zzso Laboratory tests, involving both single frames and continuous video zzso demonstrate the zzso and accuracy of the zzso Benchmark timing tests indicate that the method can run continuously at 300 zzso well beyond the real-time zzso video rate of 30 zzso This compares extremely favorably to the zzso 1 zzso speeds of other methods and indicates the zzso potential for real-time continuous zzso A human phantom study confirms the zzso efficacy for real-time guidance in a controlled setting, and, zzso points the way toward the first interactive zzso registration approach for zzso zzso Along this line, we demonstrate the zzso efficacy in a complete guidance system by presenting a clinical study involving lung cancer zzso
