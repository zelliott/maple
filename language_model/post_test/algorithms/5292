We investigated the genetic associations of zzso stroke by identifying zzso of its zzso zzso such as small vessel zzso zzso and large artery zzso zzso zzso was analyzed with 24 genes in zzso controls and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95) using zzso zzso reduction and zzso zzso The zzso zzso reduction analysis with any of zzso to zzso models showed no significant association with zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso however, revealed a significant association in the best zzso model with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of F5 zzso balanced accuracy zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed that such zzso was present and quite a large zzso was estimated among the 3 zzso for zzso zzso but only a relatively small zzso was estimated for zzso zzso This suggests that the synergistic zzso model might contribute specifically to the zzso of zzso which implies a different zzso of the zzso stroke zzso zzso reports zzso zzso zzso
