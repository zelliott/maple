For a zzso based zzso rendering system, the overhead of zzso rendering and the network zzso are major obstacles in achieving zzso In this paper, we first present a zzso hierarchy zzso management strategy to control the overhead of zzso rendering for zzso zzso Then we propose a zzso parallel strategy to overcome the network zzso for zzso based zzso zzso rendering zzso Our solution is to make the client process and the server process run in zzso using the rendering time to cover the network zzso For networks with long round-trip times, we manage to overlap the network zzso for one frame with the rendering time for multiple zzso zzso prediction is incorporated to make the zzso of the client and the server zzso In order to maintain an acceptable zzso rendering quality in the network environment, we develop a synchronization mechanism and a dynamic adjustment mechanism to handle the transient network slowdowns and the changes of the network zzso Our experimental results, in comparison with the sequential method, show that our zzso parallel approach can achieve an interactive frame rate while keeping an acceptable rendering quality for large triangle models over networks with relatively long round-trip zzso
