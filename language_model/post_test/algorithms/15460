The zzso zzso of zzso pressure is suggested to be less in prone posture than zzso Thus the zzso distribution of ventilation is expected to be more uniform zzso potentially affecting regional zzso zzso zzso Using a novel functional lung magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure regional zzso ratio, the zzso zzso in zzso density, zzso zzso and zzso ratio were measured in prone and zzso zzso Data were acquired in seven healthy subjects in a single zzso slice of the right lung at functional residual zzso Regional specific ventilation images zzso using specific ventilation imaging and zzso density images obtained using a fast zzso sequence were registered and smoothed to calculate regional zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso spin zzso zzso zzso images were combined on a zzso basis with smoothed zzso zzso images to obtain regional zzso zzso Data were averaged for zzso within zzso zzso planes, starting from the most zzso dependent zzso The slope of the relationship between zzso ventilation and vertical height was less prone than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prone zzso P zzso zzso as was the slope of the zzso relationship zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prone zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant zzso zzso in zzso ratio in both postures zzso zzso zzso that was less in prone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso and regional zzso ratio were greater zzso than zzso suggesting an interplay between zzso cavity zzso airway and vascular tree zzso and the effects of gravity on zzso zzso
