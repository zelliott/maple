To zzso the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map for monitoring tumor treatment response in cancer zzso 

Using zzso Carlo simulations, measurement precision of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and particularly accuracy of threshold determination from healthy reference zzso are evaluated by investigating the zzso limit of the zzso as a function of different degrees of diffusion weighting of the zzso Phantom and zzso experiments are performed to verify and illustrate the results of the zzso 

While diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map is hardly diminished by differing values of the zzso relaxation time in tumor and reference zzso it is shown to be impaired by differing zzso resulting in erroneously determined zzso zzso This problem can be addressed by decreasing the maximum zzso and increasing the number of signal averages at the maximum zzso or, zzso the number of zzso while favoring schemes with higher zzso Phantom experiments confirm the results of the zzso zzso data are presented to illustrate the effect of sequence zzso on the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion zzso 

The present work demonstrates that the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map can be impaired by inaccurate zzso thresholds and derives means for its zzso that will increase the zzso of future clinical zzso
