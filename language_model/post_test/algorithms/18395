An zzso for predicting the lowest energy structure of a zzso has been zzso zzso barriers on an energy surface can be easily overcome by zzso transforming the energy zzso For efficient zzso the energy space is searched using a zzso zzso sampling method, and zzso specific to a primary structure of the zzso are sampled with large zzso The efficiency of the present method is demonstrated by calculations on zzso zzso zzso
