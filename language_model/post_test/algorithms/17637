The overall zzso rates and mean relaxation times of zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso were determined at various temperatures to gain further insight into the effect of molecular mobility on the zzso rates of zzso drugs and the possibility of predicting stability from their molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso solid zzso were prepared by melting and rapidly cooling zzso of each drug and zzso The amount of zzso zzso remaining in the solid zzso was calculated from the heat of zzso was obtained by differential scanning zzso The amount of zzso zzso remaining in the solid zzso was estimated from the change in the heat capacity at its glass transition temperature zzso The time required for the amount of zzso drug remaining to fall to zzso zzso was calculated from the profile of time versus the amount of zzso drug zzso The zzso values for the solid zzso studied were zzso times longer than those of pure zzso drugs when compared at the same zzso zzso relaxation of the zzso drugs in the solid zzso was reduced compared with that in the pure zzso drugs, indicating that the molecular mobility of the zzso drugs is reduced in the presence of zzso The temperature dependence of mean relaxation time zzso for the zzso solid zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso zzso D and zzso in this equation were estimated from the heating rate dependence of zzso Similar temperature dependence was observed for zzso and zzso values of the solid zzso indicating that the information on the temperature dependence of the molecular mobility, along with the zzso data obtained at around the zzso are useful for zzso the zzso of overall zzso at temperatures below zzso in the presence of zzso
