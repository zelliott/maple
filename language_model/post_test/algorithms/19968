zzso room impulse responses have been proven to be both useful and indispensable for comprehensive testing of acoustic signal processing zzso while controlling parameters such as the zzso time, room dimensions, and zzso zzso In this work, a method is proposed for simulating the room impulse responses between a sound source and the microphones positioned on a zzso zzso The method takes into account zzso reflections of the source by employing the well-known image method, and scattering from the rigid sphere by employing zzso harmonic zzso zzso for the proposed method is zzso taking into account various zzso to reduce the zzso zzso The magnitude and phase errors that result from the finite order zzso harmonic decomposition are analyzed and general guidelines for the order selection are zzso Three examples are zzso an analysis of a diffuse zzso sound field, a study of zzso cues in the presence of zzso and an illustration of the zzso use as a mouth zzso
