The incorporation of biological knowledge can enhance the analysis of biomedical zzso We present a novel method that uses a zzso knowledge base to enhance the performance of a zzso zzso in identifying putative zzso of disease from zzso zzso mass spectral zzso In particular, we use the zzso zzso zzso zzso Base zzso that contains previously identified and validated zzso zzso to select zzso in a zzso zzso prior to analysis to increase zzso 

We show that using zzso as a zzso method, specifically selecting all zzso found only in the zzso of the zzso zzso reduces the zzso by zzso and provides a statistically significantly greater increase in performance over no variable selection and random variable zzso 

zzso variable selection even with a zzso resource such as the zzso increases overall performance of zzso for disease zzso from zzso zzso mass zzso
