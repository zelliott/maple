This chapter surveys the literature for state-of-the-art methods for the rational design of zzso zzso It identifies and presents major milestones in the field of zzso modeling of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso used features of zzso are summarized along with major machine learning techniques employed to build the zzso zzso It has also outlined several zzso zzso design zzso To face the challenge of modeling and rational design of chemically modified zzso it also proposes a new zzso approach for the representation and characterization of zzso zzso Some preliminary results with this new approach are presented to demonstrate the promising potential of this method for the modeling of zzso zzso Together with novel delivery technologies and chemical modification techniques, rational zzso design zzso will ultimately contribute to chemical biology research and the efficient development of zzso zzso
