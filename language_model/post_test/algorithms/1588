It is an effective scheme to the phase retrieval for zzso intensity zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate a method for zzso the zzso intensity zzso and improving the calculation accuracy in the transport of intensity equation zzso from multiple intensity zzso The method takes both the zzso intensity derivatives and the noise into account, and zzso the impact of detecting zzso The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the error of intensity zzso zzso
