The zzso zzso Simulator zzso was developed as a practical tool for assessing the risk of diminished alertness at zzso zzso of zzso include assessment of operational fatigue risk, work schedule zzso and zzso accident zzso Based on the documented work schedules of employees, sleep and alertness patterns are estimated and a cumulative fatigue score is zzso The risk assessment zzso are based on zzso zzso principles including zzso and zzso zzso The free parameters of the zzso were zzso using over 10,000 d of sleep and alertness data sets collected from transportation workers performing their regular zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso fatigue score was then tested using zzso and accident data from three trucking zzso Heavy truck drivers involved in zzso or zzso accidents were found to have significantly higher zzso fatigue risk scores than zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso safety program in a 500 zzso trucking fleet, where zzso and managers were held accountable for minimizing driver zzso fatigue risk scores, significantly reduced the frequency and severity of truck zzso Further examination of zzso risk assessment zzso using scenarios provided in a fatigue modeling workshop indicated that the zzso Model also performed well in zzso alertness with a real-world transportation scenario of railroad zzso engineer zzso zzso
