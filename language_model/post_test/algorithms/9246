This article describes the zzso solution of the zzso zzso equation to study diffusion in zzso zzso Specifically, finite element methods have been developed to calculate zzso binding rate zzso for large zzso The resulting software has been validated and applied to the mouse zzso zzso zzso and several zzso Rates for inhibitor binding to zzso were calculated at various zzso strengths with several different time zzso zzso rates show very good agreement with experimental and theoretical zzso zzso Furthermore, these finite element methods require significantly fewer zzso resources than existing zzso zzso dynamics methods and are robust for complicated zzso The key finding of biological importance is that the rate zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso that result from zzso steering are preserved under the zzso conditions that are expected to occur in zzso zzso
