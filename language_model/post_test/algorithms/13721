A zzso procedure is presented to regulate the workload on an zzso bicycle to an individually fixed level of heart rate as the zzso applying an integral controller zzso The workload is zzso in a few variable steps zzso to the target heart zzso A free zzso of the zzso has been fixed zzso In the empirical evaluation of the quality of this zzso a strictly linear relationship of individual Watt zzso and rise in heart rate was found in 27 subjects, with a median correlation of zzso The procedure is recommended for specific zzso workload regulation in which an upper limit of rise in heart rate should not be zzso zzso in cardiac zzso The procedure can also be generalized to comparable regulation tasks, zzso in the management of blood pressure to avoid an zzso zzso
