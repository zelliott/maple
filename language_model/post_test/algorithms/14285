Previous studies have shown the relative importance of zzso noise and zzso noise in zzso MR zzso Since zzso noise is zzso to the zzso it can be the dominant component at the center of zzso In this study we demonstrate that the zzso ratio zzso efficiency and zzso resolution for zzso functional zzso zzso are increased by the use of a zzso acquisition zzso In zzso methods, the zzso components are doubled in zzso during zzso resulting in twice as much noise from those zzso However, in sum these contributions are relatively small compared to those at the low spatial zzso where zzso noise is zzso zzso the effect on the final MR images is almost negligible due to the square zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso method sacrifices much less zzso than is expected from the zzso noise model, and the zzso efficiency is increased compared to a zzso acquisition since more time frames can be collected for the same scan zzso zzso the zzso resolution can be increased in zzso acquisitions because only partial coverage of zzso is zzso Experimental results confirm that more zzso with a higher average zzso is detected by this zzso
