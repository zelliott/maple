zzso or zzso zzso and incomplete zzso can introduce significant errors in the estimates of chemical rate zzso measured by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso methods of correction are effective only over a limited zzso zzso Here, a general approach of zzso solving the zzso equations to calculate exchange rates, relaxation times and zzso for the zzso experiment is investigated, but found to require more zzso and higher zzso ratios than in zzso studies can practically zzso As an alternative, correction zzso for the reaction rate are provided which account for the expected zzso ranges and limited zzso available in zzso The correction term is a zzso function of experimental zzso In computer simulations, the new zzso showed negligible bias and reduced the maximum error in the rate zzso by about zzso compared to traditional zzso and the error scatter by about zzso over a wide range of parameters for conventional zzso transfer employing progressive zzso and for the zzso zzso method applied to the zzso zzso zzso reaction in the human heart at zzso zzso In normal in zzso zzso affected by zzso the correction increases the mean calculated forward zzso reaction rate by zzso over traditional and prior correction zzso
