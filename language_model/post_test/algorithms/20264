Our zzso assist device uses a zzso zzso pump operating on the zzso rotary zzso It is driven by an electric motor and provides a zzso zzso zzso At each cycle, blood is actively zzso into the device, and zzso results in collapse at the pump zzso To prevent zzso it is necessary to ensure that pump intake does not exceed zzso zzso Poor long-term reliability rules out the use of current zzso pressure sensors for this zzso To resolve this problem, we have developed a method of control based on monitoring of the intensity of electric current consumed by the zzso The method consists of real time monitoring of current intensity at the beginning of each pump zzso A sudden change in intensity indicates zzso and motor speed is reduced to prevent zzso The current consumed by the motor also depends on the zzso but the form of the signal remains the same when zzso zzso After demonstrating the feasibility of this technique in a simulator, we are now testing it in zzso We were able to detect and prevent collapse due to zzso by the cardiac assist zzso This system also enables us to know the maximum possible assistance and to thus adapt assistance to the zzso
