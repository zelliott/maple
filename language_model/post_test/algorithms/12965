zzso transmission is studied theoretically and zzso for the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which are based on two-dimensional zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso The zzso transmission appears at a fixed angle of zzso as a combined effect of the peculiar zzso features of the zzso crystal and the properly designed zzso It is shown that the basic zzso transmission zzso which are observed at a zzso zzso are preserved at zzso and horn antenna zzso The main attention is paid to the zzso zzso regime, which is associated with the strong directional selectivity arising due to the first negative zzso zzso An additional degree of freedom for controlling the transmission of the electromagnetic waves is obtained by making use of the zzso zzso at the zzso crystal zzso
