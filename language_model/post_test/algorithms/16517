zzso science is zzso due to the lack of fast enough detectors and electronics, based on zzso zzso Typically, however, zzso zzso require significant powers and often operate in a limited spectral zzso Here we overcome the difficulties of zzso zzso zzso by precision zzso zzso of spectral zzso We zzso this for linear zzso characterization of pulse trains having zzso 1 zzso per pulse, a regime in which zzso techniques are zzso at a zzso resolution of zzso 10 zzso This technique does not only set a new scale of sensitivity in zzso pulse zzso but is also zzso in any spectral range from the zzso to the deep zzso
