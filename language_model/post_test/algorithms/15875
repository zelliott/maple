zzso iron zzso from a meal is determined by iron status, zzso and zzso zzso and amounts of various dietary factors that influence iron zzso Limited information is available about the net effect of these zzso 

The objective was to develop an zzso for predicting the effects of factors known to influence zzso and zzso zzso from meals and zzso 

The basis for the zzso was the zzso of iron from a wheat roll zzso zzso zzso containing no known zzso or enhancers of iron zzso and adjusted to a reference dose zzso of zzso This zzso zzso was multiplied by the expected effect of different amounts of dietary factors known to influence iron zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, meat, fish and zzso zzso egg, soy zzso and zzso For each factor, an equation describing the zzso relation was zzso Special considerations were made for interactions between individual zzso 

Good agreement was seen when zzso of iron zzso from 24 complete meals were compared with results from use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and when mean iron zzso in 31 subjects served a varied whole diet labeled with zzso and zzso zzso over a period of 5 d was compared with the mean total iron zzso calculated by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso has several zzso It can be used to predict iron zzso from various zzso to estimate the effects expected by dietary zzso and to translate zzso into dietary iron requirements from different types of zzso
