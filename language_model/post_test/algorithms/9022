The zzso of zzso zzso fatigue damage in the zzso zzso particularly of type I collagen zzso is thought to contribute to the development of zzso a chronic and degenerative pathology of zzso zzso assessment of collagen zzso alignment is paramount to understanding the importance of zzso injury to cellular function and zzso zzso This study presents a novel application of edge detection analysis to calculate local collagen zzso orientation in zzso This technique incorporates damage zzso and zzso by severity which will allow future analysis of the direct effect of zzso damage severity on the cellular and molecular zzso
