The zzso imaging of the monkey auditory system with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso can bridge the gap between zzso studies in monkeys and imaging studies in zzso Some of the recent imaging of monkey auditory cortical and zzso structures relies on a technique of zzso zzso which was developed in human studies to sidestep the negative influence of scanner noise by adding periods of silence in between volume zzso Among the various aspects that have gone into the ongoing zzso of zzso of the monkey auditory cortex, replacing the more common zzso paradigm with sparse imaging seemed to us to make the most obvious difference in the amount of activity that we could reliably obtain from awake or zzso zzso Here, we directly compare the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso We document a zzso greater auditory response with sparse imaging, both zzso and zzso which includes a more expansive and robust zzso zzso There were instances where continuous imaging could better reveal organizational properties that sparse imaging missed, such as aspects of the zzso organization of auditory zzso We consider the choice of imaging paradigm as a key component in zzso the zzso of the monkey auditory zzso
