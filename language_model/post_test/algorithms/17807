We investigated the effect of zzso zzso triggering on the accuracy of coronary zzso zzso zzso as compared with invasive zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with suspected coronary disease were studied with intravenous coronary zzso and conventional coronary zzso Patients were divided into 2 groups based upon zzso triggering on the zzso zzso Patients were divided into 2 groups based upon different zzso triggering zzso zzso zzso zzso trigger method zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso triggering zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which started at the end of the T wave in each study, was based on baseline heart zzso 

zzso sensitivity to detect a zzso or zzso 50% zzso zzso was zzso in group 1 and zzso in group 2 zzso zzso zzso specificity was zzso and zzso in group 1 and group 2, respectively zzso zzso zzso Using newer triggering techniques zzso 2) with zzso the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for patients with disease of the left main coronary artery or 3 vessel disease was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of coronary segments on zzso images was reduced from zzso in group 1 to zzso in group 2 patients zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso coronary images increased from zzso to zzso from group 1 to group 2 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso triggering improves zzso image quality, and zzso of segments of coronary zzso for the detection of zzso coronary artery zzso
