In controlled studies, zzso zzso has safely and effectively reduced zzso drug use for lower respiratory tract infections zzso However, controlled trial data may not reflect real zzso 

We performed an zzso quality surveillance in 14 centers in Switzerland, France, and the United zzso zzso adults with zzso presenting to emergency departments or zzso offices were enrolled and registered on a zzso which provided a previously published zzso zzso for zzso zzso The primary end point was duration of zzso therapy within 30 zzso 

Of zzso patients, zzso had a final diagnosis of zzso zzso pneumonia, zzso acute zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease, zzso and bronchitis, zzso Algorithm compliance overall was zzso with differences between diagnoses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pneumonia, zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso centers zzso zzso zzso and countries zzso zzso France, zzso and the United States, zzso P zzso zzso After zzso adjustment, zzso therapy duration was significantly shorter if the zzso zzso was followed compared with when it was overruled zzso vs zzso zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso No increase was noted in the risk of the combined adverse outcome end point within 30 days of follow-up when the zzso zzso was followed regarding withholding antibiotics on hospital admission zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and regarding early zzso of antibiotics zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso 

This study zzso previous results from controlled trials in real-life conditions and demonstrates that following a zzso zzso effectively reduces zzso use without increasing the risk of zzso zzso differences in zzso prescribing affect compliance with zzso stewardship zzso
