zzso is the major zzso acid zzso of the vascular zzso and is produced mainly via the zzso zzso By acting on the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso exerts zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso production increases after brain zzso but the importance of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival has not been zzso This study evaluated if zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso process in the brain after brain zzso This was performed by comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and mice with functional zzso zzso zzso after a controlled cortical injury regarding zzso volume, cerebral blood flow zzso zzso number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer constant zzso for zzso and brain water content zzso vs dry zzso in the injured and zzso zzso zzso volume was increased in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso Three hours after zzso cortical blood flow was decreased in the injured zzso of both groups and the reduction in blood flow in the zzso of the zzso mice persisted from 3 to 24 zzso whereas blood flow approached normal values in the zzso mice after 24 zzso No differences could be detected between the two zzso regarding other zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is beneficial for zzso survival after brain trauma in mice, an effect that may be zzso by improved cortical zzso
