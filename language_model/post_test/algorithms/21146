A recently developed method for exact density compensation of non zzso arranged samples relies on the zzso known zzso of zzso basis functions corresponding to the traced zzso zzso This method produces a linear system whose solution represents compensated samples that zzso the contribution of each independent element of information that can be expressed by the underlying zzso Unfortunately, linear zzso density compensation approaches quickly become zzso demanding with increasing number of samples zzso image zzso Here, it is shown that when a trajectory is composed of zzso zzso zzso such as spiral and zzso zzso this zzso method leads to a highly simplified system of zzso Specifically, it is shown that the system zzso is zzso zzso so that the linear system is easily zzso The method is described and demonstrated for zzso zzso spiral zzso designed for 256 image zzso samples are compensated non zzso in a few seconds by solving the small independent zzso linear systems in zzso Because the method is exact and considers all the interactions between all acquired samples, up to a zzso reduction in reconstruction error zzso with an up to zzso increase in signal to noise ratio are achieved compared to standard density compensation zzso
