These days, zzso are prevalent in almost all areas of the zzso Researchers have been actively analyzing wildfire damage using a variety of satellite images and zzso zzso This paper presents a method for detailed zzso of wildfire losses using various zzso zzso and an actual case of wildfire at zzso Republic of Korea in zzso A set of infrared zzso aerial images acquired after the wildfire were used to visually delineate the damaged regions, and information on forest type, diameter class, age class, and canopy density within the damaged regions was retrieved from zzso layers of the Korean national forest zzso Approximate tree heights were zzso from airborne zzso and verified by ground zzso zzso The corresponding stand volumes were zzso using tree volume equations zzso The proposed zzso can efficiently estimate fire loss using the zzso zzso in the present case, the total fire loss was estimated as zzso million, which is a more accurate estimate than zzso million based on conventional zzso The proposed method can be claimed as a powerful alternative for zzso damage caused by wildfires, because the aerial image interpretation can delineate and analyze damaged regions in a comprehensive and consistent manner; moreover, zzso zzso and national forest inventory data can significantly reduce field zzso
