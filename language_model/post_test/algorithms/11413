zzso inverse problems requires multiple forward calculations of measured zzso We present a fast method combining graphic processing zzso zzso Carlo simulations of individual photons and a new zzso scheme for a zzso zzso in comparison to conventional zzso zzso The method allows rapid calculations of the diffuse zzso and zzso signals from a zzso sample of zzso zzso zzso scattering zzso zzso and zzso factor g based on the principle of correlated zzso To demonstrate its strong utility, we have applied the method for determining the optical parameters of diluted zzso samples with satisfactory zzso
