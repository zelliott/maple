A zzso study of zzso statistical modeling and experimental analysis to investigate the critical zzso concentration zzso and environmental risk of 120 structurally diverse zzso zzso is zzso In this zzso the structural profiles of studied compounds are characterized using hundreds of constitutional, zzso geometrical and zzso zzso and the resulting variables of the characterization are then zzso on the basis of zzso measured properties via a variety of zzso techniques, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in conjunction with two sophisticated variable selection methods, zzso empirical zzso strategy and zzso genetic zzso Among all the built models the most predictable one is constructed based on the simplest combination of zzso variable selection and zzso zzso with its zzso zzso of determination zzso and zzso error of prediction zzso on external independent test set of zzso and zzso zzso zzso this model is used to explain the structural factors that fundamentally govern the zzso behavior of zzso zzso molecules in solution and to design several new zzso zzso with potentially high zzso activity and low environmental zzso Further, these designed compounds are zzso by zzso ammonium reaction and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso Found a promising candidate that possesses particularly high zzso potency as zzso zzso zzso at zzso This zzso measured value is in agreement with the zzso zzso zzso zzso fairly zzso
