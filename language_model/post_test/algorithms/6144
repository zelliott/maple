In this paper we report on a zzso zzso that may be used to replace a traditional speech zzso in cochlear implant zzso The zzso made from an array of zzso zzso zzso is capable of passively splitting sound into its frequency zzso without the need for zzso conversion and subsequent digital zzso Since all bands are mechanically filtered in zzso there is low zzso in the output zzso The simplicity of the device, high channel zzso low power requirements, and small form factor (less than 1 zzso make it a good candidate for a completely zzso zzso ear zzso
