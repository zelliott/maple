zzso extraction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated across the zzso zzso The distribution ratio zzso of zzso under an identical condition was the largest among all zzso The separation factor zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Upon analyzing the extraction data in detail on the basis of mass balance, it was found that the dominant extracted species of light zzso was a stable zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while the dominant extracted species of heavy zzso was the zzso pair, zzso The complex for zzso was very stable (the stability constant, zzso zzso as zzso was zzso It suggests that zzso can form two zzso rings with zzso and the size of zzso matches to the distance between the donor atoms in zzso Although the stability constant decreased with increasing zzso atomic number, the synergistic extraction constant zzso was the largest for zzso Since the constant, zzso is given by zzso where zzso the largest zzso of zzso is attributable to the difference of the degree of the variation of zzso between the light and the heavy zzso the zzso of extraction constant of zzso zzso for light zzso is larger than the zzso of the stability constant of zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso than the zzso of zzso From these results, it is concluded that selective separation of a particular zzso among all zzso is possible using synergistic extraction with a suitable combination of a zzso zzso and a Lewis zzso
