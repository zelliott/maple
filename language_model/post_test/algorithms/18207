Recently, the generalized additive models zzso have been presented as a novel statistical approach to distinguish zzso in zzso diagnosis zzso zzso In this paper, we present an extension of the zzso that allows for the introduction of factors and their interactions with continuous zzso for reducing false zzso in a zzso system for detecting clustered zzso in digital zzso The results obtained have shown an increase in the sensitivity from zzso to zzso while the false positive rate was drastically reduced from zzso to zzso false zzso per zzso
