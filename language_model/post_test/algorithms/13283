zzso activity of genes depends on many factors like DNA zzso zzso characteristics of DNA, melting zzso and there are zzso approaches for their zzso However, in real applications, the number of predicted, for example, DNA motifs may be considerably zzso In cases when various zzso programs are applied, systematic experimental knock out of each of the potential elements obviously becomes zzso zzso one needs an approach that is able to integrate many zzso zzso methods and upon that suggest selected regulatory elements for experimental zzso 

Here, we present an zzso zzso approach aimed at the discovery of regulatory zzso that can be effectively verified zzso It is based on zzso analysis of known and novel binding zzso as well as of any other known features of zzso The goal of this method is the identification of a collection of zzso that are specific for an established zzso and at the same time are optimal for experimental zzso The method is particularly effective on small zzso where most statistical approaches zzso We apply it to promoters that drive zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso The method successfully identified a number of potential zzso which required only a few experiments to be zzso The resulting minimal functional bacterial promoter exhibited high specificity of expression in zzso zzso 

Experimental analysis of promoter structures guided by zzso has proved to be zzso The developed zzso method is able to include zzso features of promoters and suggest zzso zzso for experimental zzso zzso and zzso of the methodology implemented in the approach ensures good results for a wide range of zzso
