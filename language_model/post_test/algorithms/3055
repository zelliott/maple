zzso tissue is highly zzso and expresses several genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso We took a zzso approach to study the relationships between zzso tissue blood flow zzso and genes involved in zzso zzso As zzso is impaired in zzso we tested whether body weight zzso with the zzso regulation of zzso The zzso content zzso zzso of 26 genes was zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso from 28 healthy men with a wide range of zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso None of the transcripts was related to zzso zzso zzso However, the expression levels of two transcripts involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Although zzso was zzso related to the zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso respectively), the strong associations found between zzso zzso and the two transcripts were not affected by zzso Several genes were subject to coordinated regulation of zzso This study demonstrates for the first time that zzso responsiveness to zzso intake is related to the zzso of two genes expressed in zzso tissue and directly involved in zzso actions zzso and zzso suggesting that part of the regulation of zzso is at a zzso zzso Interestingly, these associations were not secondary to changes in zzso We also found that certain genes involved in the regulation of zzso are subject to coordinate regulation of expression suggesting zzso zzso
