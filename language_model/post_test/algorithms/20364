zzso zzso boundary elements are applied to the zzso inverse problem as an example for zzso boundary zzso It is shown that the choice of the shape functions used for approximation of the zzso has a remarkable influence on the solution obtained if the number of zzso is smaller than the number of primary source points zzso equation zzso Three different zzso are investigated considering a concentric spheres problem where an zzso solution is zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso as a new zzso In a second step the zzso zzso (which provided the best results in the test zzso is applied to real word zzso The zzso potential pattern of a 40 years old female suffering from severe heart failure and zzso zzso after large anterior wall zzso zzso is reconstructed for one time zzso Furthermore, an zzso for the calculation of the transfer zzso is presented which avoids restrictions to the boundary element mesh caused by the placement of the zzso
