Physical simulation was used to study pollution zzso in a street zzso The street canyon model was designed to study the effect of measuring flow and concentration zzso A method of zzso zzso zzso was applied for detection of trace concentration of gas zzso The advantage of this method is its high sensitivity and broad dynamic range, permitting monitoring of zzso from trace to zzso zzso Application of this method enabled us to propose a simple model based on line zzso zzso source, developed on the principle of concentration standards, to ensure high precision and zzso of the concentration zzso zzso measurement of the concentration distribution inside the street canyon was performed on the model with reference zzso of zzso zzso
