This paper introduces a new zzso zzso for efficiently computing direct zzso in scenes with many lights and complex zzso Images are first divided into 8 zzso 8 zzso blocks and for each point to be shaded within a block, a probability density function zzso is constructed over the lights and sampled to estimate zzso using a small number of shadow zzso Information from these samples is then zzso at both the zzso and block level and used to zzso the zzso for the next zzso Over multiple passes the zzso and zzso estimates are updated until zzso Using zzso and feedback progressively improves the sampling and automatically exploits both visibility and spatial zzso We also use novel extensions for efficient zzso Our zzso zzso approach zzso accurate direct zzso eight times faster than prior approaches in tests on several complex zzso
