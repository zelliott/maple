A zzso quantitative zzso relationships zzso approach has been developed and applied to a data set of 98 zzso fragrance compounds with complex zzso The zzso approach explores all possible combinations of different independent zzso collections and various individual correlation methods to obtain statistically significant models with high internal (for the training zzso and external (for the test zzso zzso Seven different zzso collections were generated with commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso programs; we also included zzso zzso zzso recently developed in our laboratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, 41, zzso zzso zzso were used in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in combination with zzso zzso Each zzso collection was combined individually with four correlation methods, including zzso neighbors zzso zzso Support zzso Machines zzso decision trees, and zzso zzso giving rise to 28 different types of zzso zzso Multiple diverse and representative training and test sets were generated by the divisions of the original data set in zzso Each model with high values of zzso zzso correct zzso rate for the training set was subjected to extensive internal and external validation to avoid zzso and achieve reliable zzso zzso Two validation techniques were zzso zzso the zzso of the target property (in this case, odor zzso also known as the zzso test and the assessment of external prediction accuracy using test zzso We demonstrate that not every combination of the data modeling technique and the zzso collection yields a validated and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso was found to be the best zzso approach overall since zzso models with correct zzso rates for both training and test sets of zzso and higher were obtained for all divisions of the zzso data set into the training and test zzso Many zzso zzso models were also found using a combination of zzso zzso method with other collections of zzso The zzso zzso zzso automation, zzso efficiency, and higher probability of identifying significant zzso models for experimental data sets than the traditional approaches that rely on a single zzso zzso
