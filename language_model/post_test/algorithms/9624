The use of selective internal radiation therapy for treatment of zzso zzso and liver zzso using zzso labeled zzso has become an effective and widely used treatment zzso However, zzso evaluations of this treatment are still primitive as uniform distribution models based only on injected activity are often zzso This investigation attempts to zzso the effectiveness of several sophisticated zzso techniques which zzso the source distribution of zzso zzso simulation studies to perform zzso zzso zzso Among these techniques are complete zzso radiation transport zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso local energy deposition in patient specific zzso and kernel transport techniques in zzso Each technique was evaluated using three different phantom zzso dimensions and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso evaluation results using all methods were compared to the exact solution, obtained using fully 3-D zzso simulations with source distribution based not on zzso data, but on the injected activity and exact boundaries of the zzso phantom used in the zzso The results of this study show that at large zzso sizes and using zzso reconstructions with a small zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso and local deposition methods are nearly zzso However, using a large zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso the local deposition method is significantly more accurate than full 3-D zzso zzso and with a negligible zzso zzso
