It is well known that sampling zzso if not properly taken into account, affects various ecologically important zzso zzso zzso for zzso population dynamics models is difficult when, in addition to the process error, there is also sampling zzso The standard zzso approach suffers from large zzso zzso In this paper, I discuss an application of the zzso method for zzso of the parameters of the zzso model in the presence of sampling zzso The main advantage of the method of composite likelihood is that it reduces the zzso burden substantially with little loss of statistical zzso Missing observations are a common problem with many ecological time zzso The method of composite likelihood can accommodate missing observations in a straightforward zzso Environmental conditions also affect the parameters of zzso population dynamics zzso This method is shown to handle such zzso population dynamics processes as zzso Many ecological time series are short, and statistical zzso based on such short time series tend to be less zzso However, spatial zzso of short time series provide an opportunity to increase the effective sample zzso Application of zzso methods for spatial zzso data for population dynamics models is zzso zzso The method of composite likelihood is shown to have significantly less zzso burden, making it possible to analyze large spatial zzso zzso After discussing the methodology in general terms, I illustrate its use by analyzing a time series of counts of American zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Bird zzso data, San Joaquin kit fox zzso zzso zzso population abundance data, and spatial time series of Bull trout zzso zzso zzso count zzso
