In zzso ultrasound modulated optical zzso zzso an ultrasound zzso pulse performs as a scanning probe within the sample as it zzso modulating the scattered light zzso distributed along its propagation zzso zzso and processing the modulated signal can provide a zzso image along the US zzso A simple model is developed wherein the detected signal is zzso as a zzso of the US pulse and the properties zzso of the medium along the US zzso Based upon this model, a maximum likelihood zzso method for image reconstruction is zzso For the first time to our knowledge, the zzso technique for an zzso signal is investigated both theoretically and zzso The zzso method zzso the data to retrieve the zzso varying properties of the sample along the US zzso and a signal zzso to the optical properties can be zzso zzso results show that the zzso method can serve as a useful reconstruction tool for a zzso zzso signal even when the zzso ratio zzso is close to zzso Experimental data using 5 zzso thick tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso demonstrate that the zzso resolution is 160 zzso and the lateral resolution is 600 zzso using a 10 zzso zzso
