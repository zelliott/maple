Several published formulas exist for the determination of estimated fetal weight zzso with limited data on their comparative zzso The aims of our study were to assess and compare the performance of different zzso formulas in predicting actual birth weight zzso in an urban zzso 

Patients with an zzso determined within 7 days of delivery were considered eligible for the zzso Fourteen published formulas, derived from populations comparable to zzso were used to zzso zzso from the same initial zzso The accuracy of the zzso obtained from the different formulas were compared by percentage error methods using bias and precision and zzso limits of agreement zzso zzso and specificity for prediction of being small for zzso age zzso were zzso 

Eighty-one fetuses were included in the zzso Formula C of zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso circumference zzso length zzso + zzso zzso + zzso + zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso zzso had the best performance according to the bias and precision zzso zzso limits of agreement confirmed these zzso Among the formulas, the sensitivity for detection of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and specificity was zzso to zzso zzso C had the optimal zzso zzso for detection of zzso 

Fourteen formulas showed considerable variation of bias and precision in our population as well as a wide range of sensitivities and zzso for zzso The choice of the appropriate formula for zzso in a given population should be based on objective and explicit zzso Consideration of bias and precision for the formula in the population being assessed is critical and may affect clinical zzso
