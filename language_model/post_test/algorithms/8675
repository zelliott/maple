While zzso polarization is a powerful tool for the measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso its application in routine clinical chemistry and zzso has been limited because collection of data was error zzso and because analysis of data previously required tedious and imprecise manual zzso zzso We present the series of linear and zzso zzso required to calculate parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a and zzso and their corresponding standard zzso The values of a and zzso are comparable to those obtained by the method of finding the minimal the sum of zzso A menu operated computer program that uses these zzso zzso the collection, analysis and presentation of zzso polarization zzso A simple spread sheet system permits the zzso deletion or modification of zzso The results are presented in zzso and tabular form, either on a zzso a printer or an zzso zzso The system has its own zzso zzso
