For zzso transformations to be executed accurately, there must be mechanisms that can both establish and modify zzso between sensory and motor zzso Such mechanisms were investigated in normal subjects using a zzso zzso First, we replaced the normal input of visual information about object size with auditory information, zzso we attempted to establish an zzso zzso The size of the object was log zzso related to the frequency of the sound, and we measured the maximum grip zzso zzso during the reaching phase to determine if the subjects had learned the zzso Second, we changed the zzso size relationship to study adaptation in the newly acquired zzso Our results demonstrate that learning of an zzso map consisted of three distinct zzso during the first stage zzso zzso zzso subjects simply used zzso large enough to grasp any reasonably sized object and there were no overt signs of zzso During the second stage, there was a period of fast learning where the slope of the relationship between zzso and object size became steeper until the third stage where the slope was zzso In contrast, when zzso adaptation was studied in the established zzso map, there was rapid learning from the start of a size zzso We conclude that different learning strategies are employed when zzso transformations are established compared to when existing transformations are zzso
