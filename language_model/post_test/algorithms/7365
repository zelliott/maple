The inversion distance, that is the distance between two zzso zzso with the same content allowing only zzso of DNA zzso can be zzso thanks to a pioneering approach of zzso and zzso in zzso In 2000, zzso extended the inversion model to allow the comparison of zzso zzso with unequal zzso thus insertions and deletions of DNA segments besides zzso However, an exact zzso was presented only for the case in which we have insertions alone and no deletion (or vice zzso while a zzso was provided for the zzso case, that allows both insertions and deletions and is called the zzso zzso In 2005, zzso zzso and zzso started a new branch of research by introducing the generic double cut and join zzso operation, that can represent several zzso zzso (including zzso Among others, the zzso model gave rise to two important zzso First, it has been shown that the inversion distance can be zzso in a simpler way with the help of the zzso zzso Second, the zzso operation originated the zzso distance, that allows the comparison of zzso with unequal zzso considering zzso insertions and zzso and can be zzso in linear zzso 

In the present work we put these two results together to solve an open problem, showing that, when the graph that represents the relation between the two compared zzso has no bad zzso the zzso distance is equal to the zzso zzso We also give a lower and an upper bound for the zzso distance in the presence of bad zzso
