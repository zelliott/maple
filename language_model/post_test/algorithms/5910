The success of zzso depends on a balance between two conflicting zzso zzso of artery zzso zzso and zzso of mechanical zzso A finite element model for the zzso prediction of zzso is proposed as a potential tool to assist zzso This paper describes the general methodology and the zzso that zzso zzso friction work during balloon zzso and zzso The potential of the model is demonstrated with examples that include artery model reconstruction and prediction of friction on the zzso wall during balloon zzso and zzso
