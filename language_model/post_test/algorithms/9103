zzso structure prediction zzso is zzso a very challenging zzso The challenge largely comes from the fact that the energy function that needs to be zzso in order to obtain the native structure of a given protein is not clearly zzso A high resolution 20 zzso 20 energy model could better capture the zzso of the actual energy function than a low resolution energy model such as zzso zzso However, the fine zzso details of the high resolution interaction energy zzso are often not very zzso for guiding the zzso In contrast, a low resolution energy model could effectively bias the search towards certain promising zzso In this paper, we develop a genetic zzso that mainly uses a high resolution energy model for protein structure evaluation but uses a low resolution zzso energy model in zzso the search towards exploring structures that have zzso zzso We zzso show that this mixing of energy models leads to significant lower energy structures compared to the state-of-the-art zzso
