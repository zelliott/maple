About half of zzso zzso zzso cases are associated with skeletal muscle zzso zzso 1 zzso and calcium channel, zzso L type, zzso zzso zzso gene zzso leaving many with an unknown zzso The authors chose to apply a sequencing approach to uncover zzso zzso in unknown zzso zzso the zzso the zzso region of the zzso has power at low sample sizes and identified the cause of over a dozen zzso zzso 

The authors considered four families with multiple zzso cases lacking zzso in zzso and zzso by zzso sequencing of complementary zzso zzso sequencing in two zzso per family, chosen for maximum genetic distance, were zzso zzso were ranked by zzso frequency, protein change, and measures of conservation among zzso to assess likelihood of zzso Finally, putative zzso zzso were zzso in other family members to verify zzso with zzso 

zzso sequencing revealed one rare zzso zzso zzso in each of three families zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in the fourth zzso These were not seen in zzso databases or in our control population sample of zzso zzso zzso sequencing in other family members verified zzso of zzso with zzso 

The authors found that using both zzso sequencing and zzso frequency data from large sequencing efforts may aid genetic diagnosis of zzso In a sample selected by the authors, this technique was more sensitive for zzso detection in known genes than zzso sequencing of complementary DNA, and allows for the possibility of novel gene zzso
