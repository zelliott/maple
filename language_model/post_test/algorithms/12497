The number of sequences compiled in many zzso projects is growing zzso but most of them have not been characterized zzso An automatic zzso scheme must be in an urgent need to reduce the gap between the amount of new sequences produced and reliable functional zzso This work proposes rules for automatically zzso the fungus zzso The approach involves zzso the zzso zzso rule that is hidden in zzso protein zzso and then applying it for zzso The association algorithm, zzso is zzso to mine the relationship between the zzso class and significant zzso zzso The candidate rules are evaluated for their zzso zzso 

There were five zzso collected from the zzso for establishing the zzso zzso These were treated as the training zzso The zzso entries were treated as the testing zzso A correct zzso zzso rate of zzso was obtained for the zzso zzso and a similar rate of about zzso was obtained for the zzso zzso The fungus training zzso which lacks an zzso class description was also used to evaluate the fungus candidate zzso A total of 88 out of zzso test entries were matched with the fungus rule zzso These were otherwise poorly zzso using their functional zzso 

The feasibility of using the method presented here to zzso zzso classes based on the zzso domain rules is zzso The rules may be also employed by the protein zzso in manual zzso or implemented in an automatic zzso zzso
