zzso cells have been cultured for over 30 years, but their application is still hampered by low cell zzso in batch zzso and expensive culture zzso With respect to the culture method, the zzso culture mode is often found to give the best zzso However, zzso of the feed composition is usually a zzso zzso In this report, the successful use of genetic zzso zzso to zzso the growth of insect cells is zzso A feed was developed from 11 different medium zzso each used at a wide range of zzso The feed was zzso within four sets of 20 zzso The zzso feed was tested in zzso and the addition scheme was further zzso The zzso density of zzso zzso zzso insect cells improved zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to a control zzso in an zzso commercial zzso No zzso of waste products was found, and none of the zzso acids was zzso zzso was zzso which suggests that even further improvement is zzso We show that zzso are a successful method to zzso a complex zzso in a relatively short time frame and without the need of detailed information concerning the cellular physiology or zzso
