A fully automated and three-dimensional zzso zzso method for the identification of the pulmonary zzso in zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso It is meant to be used as zzso step in the zzso detection zzso system for zzso lung zzso detection that is being developed by the Medical zzso in a zzso Infrastructure zzso zzso zzso In this new approach the zzso of the external airways zzso and zzso is obtained by zzso region growing with zzso simulation and suitable stop conditions, thus allowing an accurate handling of the zzso region, notoriously difficult to be zzso zzso attention was also devoted to checking and solving the problem of the apparent zzso between the zzso caused by zzso effects, while zzso zzso operations ensure the accurate inclusion of all the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the segmented zzso The new zzso was initially developed and tested on a zzso of 130 CT scans from the zzso trial, and was then applied to the zzso images (55 zzso and to the zzso database zzso zzso giving very satisfactory zzso In particular, the lung zzso was adequately located in zzso of the CT scans, with incorrect zzso of the external airways in the remaining zzso zzso metrics were calculated that zzso express the consistency between automatic and manual zzso the mean overlap degree of the zzso masks is zzso and the mean and the maximum distance between the mask borders zzso on the whole zzso are zzso and zzso respectively, which confirms that the automatic zzso quite correctly reproduce the borders traced by the zzso Moreover, no tissue containing internal and zzso zzso was removed in the zzso process, so that this method proved to be fit for the use in the framework of a zzso zzso Finally, in the comparison with a two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso showing that the masks created by the zzso zzso are significantly zzso than those calculated by the zzso zzso
