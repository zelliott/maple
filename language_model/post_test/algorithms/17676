No widely used zzso instrument accurately zzso patient zzso The Emergency zzso Index zzso promises to facilitate reliable acuity assessment and possibly predict patient zzso However, reliability and zzso of zzso scores have not been established in emergency departments zzso outside the original research sites, and version 3 zzso of the zzso has not been zzso The study hypothesis was that scores on the zzso zzso show good zzso reliability and predict hospital admission, admission site, and zzso 

The authors conducted an zzso zzso retrospective study of zzso systematically selected zzso records of patients who presented to an academic medical zzso zzso variables were zzso including zzso level zzso admission status, site, and zzso Using a standard process, the researchers determined the true zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlation were used to calculate zzso reliability between true zzso level and zzso score assigned by the registered nurse zzso The relationships between the true zzso level and admission, admission site, and death were zzso 

zzso reliability between zzso zzso level and the true zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hospital admission by zzso level was as zzso 1 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso and 5 zzso A higher percentage of zzso zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso were admitted to the intensive care unit than zzso levels 3-5 zzso zzso zzso Admission to zzso for zzso levels zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three of four patients who died were zzso level 1 or zzso 

Scores on the zzso assigned by nurses have excellent zzso reliability and predict hospital admission and location of zzso
