We study the diffusion of influence in random multiplex networks where links can be of r different types, and, for a given content zzso zzso product, or political zzso each link type is associated with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso that measures the relative bias type i links have in spreading this zzso In this setting, we propose a linear threshold model of contagion where zzso switch state if their zzso proportion of active neighbors exceeds a threshold zzso zzso a zzso connected to zzso active neighbors and zzso inactive neighbors via type i links will turn active if zzso exceeds its threshold zzso Under this model, we obtain the condition, probability and expected size of global spreading zzso Our results extend the existing work on complex zzso in several directions by zzso providing solutions for coupled random networks whose zzso are neither identical nor zzso zzso highlighting the effect of content on the dynamics of complex zzso and zzso showing that zzso propagation over a multiplex network leads to a subtle relation between the giant vulnerable component of the graph and the global cascade condition that is not seen in the existing models in the zzso
