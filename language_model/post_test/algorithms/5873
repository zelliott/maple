This paper considers the zzso zzso zzso approach for zzso the zzso of time series at different zzso Sample zzso zzso and approximate zzso zzso are evaluated in zzso analysis on simulated data to enhance the main features of both zzso We applied the approximate zzso and the sample zzso zzso to fetal heart rate signals on both single and multiple scales for an early identification of fetal zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso index significantly zzso suffering from normal fetuses between the 30th and the 35th week of zzso Furthermore, our data shows that the zzso zzso values are reliable indicators of the fetal distress associated with the presence of a pathological condition at zzso
