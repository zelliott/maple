zzso are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common zzso of these zzso Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the zzso zzso It is hence important to identify zzso for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of zzso For example, zzso of human proteins are often functionally characterized in model zzso Unfortunately, zzso analysis between human and zzso zzso is often complex because of large numbers of zzso within protein zzso zzso that zzso the species split, which we call zzso can easily be confused with true zzso zzso that arose after the species split, which we call zzso however, are bona fide zzso by zzso zzso and zzso are typically detected with zzso methods, but these are slow and difficult to zzso Automatic zzso methods based on zzso best zzso matches on the other hand, have so far not separated zzso from zzso zzso We present a fully automatic method for finding zzso and zzso from two zzso zzso clusters are seeded with a zzso best zzso match, after which an zzso for adding zzso is zzso The method zzso multiple alignments and zzso trees, which can be slow and zzso steps in classical zzso zzso Still, it robustly detects complex zzso relationships and assigns confidence values for both zzso and zzso The program, called zzso was tested on all completely zzso zzso zzso To assess the quality of zzso results, zzso clusters were generated from a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and were compared to clusters derived by manual zzso zzso detection zzso This study led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel zzso zzso assignments that were previously zzso because of shortcomings of zzso zzso zzso server that allows searching for zzso between human and several fully zzso zzso is installed at zzso This is the first comprehensive resource with zzso of all fully zzso zzso zzso Programs and tables of zzso assignments are available from the same zzso
