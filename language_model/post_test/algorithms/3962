zzso the mechanism of zzso could help to decipher wound healing and embryonic development and to develop better treatment for diseases such as zzso zzso devices were developed to reveal the mechanisms of zzso but monitoring the zzso process zzso in these devices is a zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso imaging technique, zzso optical zzso zzso zzso to evaluate zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso system was capable of providing zzso zzso resolution and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution of the zzso vessels in the zzso device was zzso over zzso and details such as vessel zzso and branching points were clearly zzso An zzso based on stretching open active contours was developed for tracking and zzso the zzso vessels in zzso zzso The lengths for the zzso zzso and zzso vessels were measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The outer diameters for the zzso zzso and zzso vessels were zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate zzso as a promising tool for zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
