To determine criterion zzso of the zzso walk component of the Long zzso zzso Walk zzso and develop equations for zzso peak oxygen consumption zzso from zzso time and factors intrinsic to test performance zzso heart rate zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso in older zzso 

zzso validation zzso 

zzso Research Center, National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, zzso 

Healthy volunteers zzso men and 46 zzso aged 60 to 91 participating in the Baltimore zzso Study of Aging between August 1999 and July zzso 

The zzso consisting of a zzso walk followed immediately by a zzso walk zzso as quickly as zzso over a zzso course was administered the day after zzso treadmill zzso zzso and zzso were measured before testing and at the end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity level, perceived effort, and stride length were also zzso 

Peak zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso per minute, and zzso time ranged from 2 minutes 52 seconds to 6 minutes 18 zzso zzso between zzso time and peak zzso was zzso The zzso equation from linear zzso included zzso time zzso zzso of determination zzso long versus short stride zzso zzso ending zzso zzso zzso and a correction factor for fast zzso time zzso zzso partial zzso and explained zzso of the zzso in peak zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso walk performed as part of the zzso provides a valid estimate of peak zzso in older zzso zzso low-cost, safe assessments of fitness in clinical and research settings can identify early evidence of physical decline and individuals who may benefit from therapeutic zzso
