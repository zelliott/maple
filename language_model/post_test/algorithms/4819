zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso is a zzso method for measuring zzso DNA copy number zzso Current zzso methods have limited resolution, sensitivity and zzso zzso for zzso are available only for a few organisms and combination of zzso data with expression data is zzso 

We present a novel method of using commercial zzso expression zzso for zzso enabling DNA copy number zzso and expression profiles to be combined using the same zzso This method yields zzso data from zzso DNA without complexity reduction at a median resolution of approximately zzso base zzso Due to the zzso nature of zzso zzso DNA amplification and deletion can be defined at the level of individual genes and can easily be combined with gene expression zzso 

A novel method of gene resolution analysis of copy number variation zzso yields high-resolution maps of DNA copy number changes and is zzso to a broad range of organisms for which commercial zzso expression zzso are zzso Due to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso results can reliably be compared between laboratories and can easily be combined with gene expression data using the same zzso
