zzso of conversion zzso for the reconstruction of organ doses from entrance doses for abdomen zzso of 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30-year-old patients in conventional pediatric zzso for the zzso settings recommended by the German and European guidelines for quality management in diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the commercially available personal computer program zzso developed by the Finnish Center for zzso and Nuclear Safety zzso zzso conversion zzso for conventional abdomen zzso were calculated performing zzso Carlo simulations in mathematical zzso phantom models describing patients of different zzso The possible clinical variation of beam zzso was taken into consideration by defining optimal and zzso radiation fields on the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for the reconstruction of organ doses in about 40 zzso and zzso of the human body from measured entrance doses during abdomen zzso for 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30-year-old pediatric patients were calculated for the standard zzso and lateral beam projections and the standard focus film distances of 100 zzso and 115 zzso 

The conversion zzso presented in this paper may be used for organ dose assessments from entrance doses measured during abdomen zzso of patients of all age groups and all beam zzso within the optimal and zzso standard beam zzso
