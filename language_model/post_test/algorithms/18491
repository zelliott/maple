Automatic prostate zzso in ultrasound images is a challenging task due to zzso noise, missing boundary zzso and complex prostate zzso One popular approach has been the use of zzso zzso For such techniques, prior knowledge of the prostate shape plays an important role in zzso model zzso and constraining model zzso In this paper, we have modeled the prostate shape using zzso zzso This model was fitted to 594 manual prostate contours outlined by five zzso We found that the zzso with simple zzso zzso can efficiently model the prostate shape with the zzso distance error zzso versus manual zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean absolute distance error of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the manual zzso and their corresponding fitted zzso zzso was significantly less than the zzso between human experts with zzso being less than zzso Based on this zzso zzso model, we have developed an efficient and robust zzso zzso zzso This zzso was applied to 125 prostate ultrasound images collected from 16 zzso The mean error between the computer-generated boundaries and the manual zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso which is significantly less than the manual zzso zzso The zzso was also shown to be fairly insensitive to the choice of the initial zzso
