The zzso measurement is a zzso and convenient technique in an assessment of zzso zzso Despite its widespread application, the influence of different timing zzso is still zzso The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of six timing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso measurement and to evaluate the performance of zzso zzso zzso patients and zzso healthy subjects were recruited in this zzso A zzso acquisition apparatus was built up for zzso zzso The zzso and other related parameters were calculated separately by the six timing zzso The influence and performance of the six zzso was zzso The six timing zzso generate significantly different zzso values zzso zzso zzso right: zzso zzso In terms of zzso the zzso has significantly higher zzso value zzso zzso than the other methods, while the zzso has the lowest zzso value zzso zzso On the performance of zzso the zzso produces the highest zzso values zzso zzso right: zzso The zzso and zzso also have a zzso performance zzso zzso zzso The choice of timing zzso affects zzso values and the quality of zzso The zzso method is recommended for zzso zzso
