The pharmacological treatment of patients with spinal zzso injury zzso pain remains challenging despite new available zzso Such treatment should always be viewed in the context of global pain management in these zzso To date few clinical trials have been specifically devoted to this topic, and the zzso of treatments is generally based on results obtained in peripheral zzso zzso The aim of this review is to present evidence for efficacy and zzso of pharmacological treatments in zzso pain and propose therapeutic zzso 

The methodology follows the guidelines of the French Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation zzso It includes a systematic review of the zzso which is performed by two independent zzso The selected studies are zzso and classified into four levels of evidence (1 to 4) and three grades of recommendations are proposed zzso B, zzso The review is further validated by a reading zzso 

The efficacy of zzso has been confirmed in zzso pain associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso has a lower level of evidence in zzso pain zzso zzso but a grade A level of evidence for efficacy in peripheral zzso zzso Both drugs can be proposed as first line therapy and are safe to zzso zzso zzso zzso can also be proposed first line zzso B for zzso pain associated with depression, grade A for other zzso pain zzso especially in patients with zzso depressive zzso zzso can be proposed alone or in combination with zzso drugs if the pain has a zzso zzso zzso If these treatments fail, strong zzso can be proposed as zzso line zzso B in zzso grade A in other types of zzso zzso zzso may also be proposed at this stage, particularly in patients with incomplete zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso In zzso central pain, cannabinoids may be proposed on the basis of positive results in other central pain conditions zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso can only be proposed in specialized zzso Drug combinations may be zzso in case of partial response to first or second line zzso 

Very few pharmacological studies have dealt specifically with zzso pain related to zzso Large scale studies and trials comparing several active drugs are warranted in zzso zzso
