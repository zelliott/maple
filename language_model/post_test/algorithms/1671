The patterns of variation of zzso zzso such as heart and respiratory rate, and their zzso with age and illness have long been under zzso however, the origin and significance of zzso zzso zzso structures that characterize healthy zzso zzso remain zzso Quite zzso atmospheric and planetary scientists have led breakthroughs in the science of zzso zzso In this paper, we aim to provide two novel hypotheses regarding the origin and zzso of both the degree of zzso and its zzso zzso In a complex zzso system, we zzso that the degree of zzso reflects the zzso of the system and is zzso to maximum work output possible divided by resting work zzso zzso in zzso work output (and oxygen zzso or zzso in resting work output (or oxygen zzso will thus reduce overall degree of zzso Second, we zzso that the zzso nature of zzso is a zzso emergent property of complex zzso systems, precisely because it enables the system's ability to zzso zzso energy zzso and maximize zzso zzso In zzso terms, zzso patterns in space zzso zzso zzso or time zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability to deliver oxygen and clear carbon dioxide and zzso Examples of zzso are discussed, along with the need to further define necessary boundary zzso zzso as our focus is bedside utility, potential clinical applications of this understanding are briefly zzso The hypotheses are clinically relevant and have potential widespread scientific zzso
