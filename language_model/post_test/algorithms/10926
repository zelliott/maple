We present a completely automated zzso registration technique that accurately maps a zzso heart model, created from zzso images, to the patient's orientation in the operating zzso This mapping is based on the registration of preoperatively acquired zzso vascular data with zzso acquired zzso Registration using both single and zzso zzso is explored using simulated but realistic zzso that were created from clinical zzso Heart zzso and cardiac phase zzso are taken into account in our validation using a digital zzso human heart zzso In an ideal situation where the zzso and zzso images were acquired at identical time points within the cardiac cycle, the zzso and the zzso registrations resulted in zzso zzso zzso errors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When a zzso timing offset was added between the zzso and the zzso acquisitions, the zzso registration approach resulted in inaccurate registrations in the zzso zzso whereas the zzso registration exhibited a zzso success rate with a zzso zzso error of zzso zzso zzso zzso When all potential sources of error were included, zzso the anatomical background, timing zzso and typical errors in the vascular tree zzso the zzso registration performed at zzso with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso
