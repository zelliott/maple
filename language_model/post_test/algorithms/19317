We present a method for lung cancer detection exploiting zzso zzso measured in zzso during zzso imaging of the zzso The measured zzso zzso were analyzed using a specially developed zzso model to obtain quantitative information about zzso zzso and zzso changes in the superficial zzso zzso zzso The zzso model allowed us to obtain the zzso zzso zzso and further to derive the zzso blood volume fraction in tissue and the tissue blood oxygen zzso The model also allowed us to obtain the scattering zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and further to derive the tissue scattering zzso volume fraction and size zzso The zzso component of the zzso signal and the instrument response were accounted for during the zzso The method was validated using 100 zzso zzso measured in zzso in a zzso fashion from 22 lung patients zzso normal zzso zzso sites and 50 zzso zzso zzso The zzso between normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso was further investigated using the derived quantitative parameters and zzso function zzso The results demonstrated significant differences between the normal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in terms of tissue blood volume zzso blood oxygen zzso tissue zzso volume zzso and size zzso The results also showed that the zzso lung zzso can be differentiated from normal zzso zzso with both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of better than zzso
