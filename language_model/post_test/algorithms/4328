zzso oxygen zzso defined as the difference between zzso and zzso oxygen zzso zzso and zzso is a critical zzso for managing intensive care patients at risk for neurological zzso Although zzso of zzso is easily performed with pulse zzso or moderately invasive zzso blood draws in peripheral vessels, cerebral zzso is frequently not monitored because of the zzso and risk associated with obtaining jugular bulb or super zzso zzso zzso blood zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso measure cerebral zzso in zzso and mechanically zzso pediatric patients zzso zzso zzso To zzso zzso the zzso signal component that fluctuates at the zzso frequency is zzso This respiratory component is dominated by the zzso portion of the interrogated zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were validated against the clinical gold zzso zzso measured oxygen zzso from zzso blood zzso This technique was also applied in healthy volunteers zzso zzso 5) without mechanical ventilation to illustrate its potential for use in healthy populations with natural zzso 

Ten pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension were zzso In these patients, zzso in the zzso exhibited good agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso slope zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in the healthy adult volunteers, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso This value is in good agreement with the expected average central zzso zzso reported in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso cerebral zzso This bedside technique can be used to help assess brain health in zzso unstable zzso
