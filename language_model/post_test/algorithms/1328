The duration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging scan can be reduced if the transmission scan of one patient which is used for zzso correction can be zzso by using the reference transmission scan of another zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso PET zzso scan registration method and PET transmission synthesis method by using the boundary information of the body or brain scan of the PET zzso zzso The PET zzso scans have poor image quality and different intensity statistics so that we zzso the zzso scans to have similar zzso and then apply the point distribution model zzso zzso to extract the contours of the zzso zzso The extracted boundary zzso of every slice is used to reconstruct the three-dimensional zzso surface of the reference set and the target zzso Our registration is 3-D zzso which uses the normal flow method zzso to find the correspondence zzso field between two 3-D reconstructed zzso Since it is difficult to analyze internal organ using the PET zzso scan imaging without zzso we assume that the deformation of internal organ is zzso With the corresponding zzso field between the two zzso scans and the transmission scan of the reference set, we can zzso the transmission scan of the target zzso
