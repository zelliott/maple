To improve the local control of patients with zzso of the prostate we have implemented intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso to deliver a prescribed dose of 81 zzso This method is based on inverse planning and the use of dynamic zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is a new zzso a major emphasis was on the quality assurance of each component of the process and on patient zzso In this article we describe in detail our procedures and quality assurance zzso 

Using an inverse algorithm, we have developed a treatment plan consisting five zzso zzso zzso fields that are delivered with zzso In the planning stage, the planner specifies the number of beams and their directions, and the desired doses for the target, the normal zzso and the zzso zzso Then, the inverse zzso designs intensity profiles that best meet the specified zzso A second zzso determines the leaf motion that would produce the designed intensity pattern and produces a zzso file as input to the zzso control zzso Our quality assurance program for the planning and treatment delivery process includes the following zzso 1) zzso of the zzso field boundary on zzso port film, 2) zzso that the leaf motion of the zzso file produces the planned dose distribution (with an independent zzso 3) comparison of dose distribution produced by zzso in a flat phantom with that calculated by the treatment planning computer for the same experimental condition, 4) comparison of the planned leaf motions with that implemented for the treatment (as recorded on the zzso log zzso 5) confirmation of the initial and final positions of the zzso for each field by a zzso system, and 6) in zzso dose zzso 

Using a zzso zzso plan we have customized dose distribution to conform to and deliver 81 zzso to the zzso In addition, in the overlap regions between the zzso and the zzso and between the zzso and the zzso the dose is kept within the tolerance of the respective zzso Our zzso checks show acceptable agreement between the planned and the implemented leaf zzso zzso film and zzso zzso indicates that doses delivered agrees with the planned dose to within zzso As of September 15, 1996, we have treated eight patients to 81 zzso with zzso 

For complex planning problems where the surrounding normal zzso place severe constraints on the prescription dose, zzso provides a powerful and efficient zzso Given a comprehensive and rigorous zzso program, the zzso fields can be zzso and accurately delivered using zzso zzso treatment is now ready for routine zzso on a large scale in our zzso
