Where should a researcher conduct experiments to provide training data for a zzso zzso This question is investigated, and a statistical method for selecting optimal experimental design points for multiple output zzso zzso is zzso Multiple class discrimination problems are examined using a framework in which the zzso zzso is viewed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso Following a zzso zzso for the case where the zzso zzso of the responses is unknown, a selection criterion is zzso This criterion is based on the volume of the joint confidence zzso for the weights in a zzso zzso An example is used to demonstrate the superiority of zzso selected design points over randomly chosen points, as well as points chosen in a grid zzso zzso of the basic criterion is offered through the use of zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso
