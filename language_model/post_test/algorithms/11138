zzso is a zzso zzso active against most zzso bacteria and some zzso It binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso early zzso chain zzso By kinetic analysis it has been shown that zzso zzso competitively interacts with the zzso of translating zzso zzso to form the encounter complex zzso which then slowly zzso to a tighter complex, termed zzso As the final complex is capable of zzso zzso bonds with decreased zzso it was assumed that in zzso complex the drug is fixed near the zzso of the zzso In the present study, two series of chemical foot printing experiments were carried zzso In the first series, zzso and zzso complex C were incubated for 1 s and then zzso or zzso was added zzso zzso In the second series, complex C was zzso with zzso for 1 zzso before the addition of zzso or zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso in zzso complex protects zzso and zzso from chemical zzso both located within the zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, it strongly protects zzso in zzso complex, which is a discrete foot print of zzso bound to the zzso In both zzso and zzso complexes, zzso also protects zzso zzso and zzso located next to the entrance of the zzso where the nascent zzso leaves the zzso zzso zzso affect the protection of zzso but favor the protection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling confirms the kinetic and chemical foot printing results and suggests that zzso mode of action is more complex than a simple competitive zzso of zzso bond zzso
