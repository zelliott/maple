Single zzso zzso zzso provide abundant information about genetic zzso Large scale discovery of high frequency zzso is being undertaken using various zzso However, the publicly available zzso data are not always accurate, and therefore should be zzso If only a particular gene locus is zzso zzso chain reaction amplification may be zzso Problem of this method is that the secondary peak has to be zzso We have analyzed trace data from conventional sequencing equipment and found an zzso rule to discern zzso from zzso We have developed software that zzso this function to automatically identify zzso The software works accurately for high quality sequences and also can detect zzso in low quality zzso Further, it can determine zzso frequency, display this information as a bar graph and assign corresponding zzso zzso It is very useful for identifying de zzso zzso in a DNA zzso of zzso
