Tree comparison functions are widely used in zzso for comparing evolutionary zzso zzso trees can be compared with rooted trees by identifying all zzso of the zzso tree that minimize some provided comparison function between two rooted zzso The plateau property is satisfied by the provided function, if all optimal zzso form a zzso or zzso in the zzso tree, from which the zzso along every path toward a leaf have zzso increasing zzso This property is sufficient for the zzso identification of all optimal zzso and rooting zzso However, the plateau property has only been proven for a few rooted comparison functions, requiring individual zzso for each function without zzso from inherent structural features of such zzso Here, we introduce the consistency condition that is sufficient for a general function to satisfy the plateau zzso For consistent functions, we introduce general zzso solutions that identify optimal zzso and all rooting zzso Further, we identify novel relationships between consistent functions in terms of zzso especially the plateau of the well-studied zzso function is part of a plateau of every other consistent zzso We introduce a novel approach for identifying consistent cost functions by defining a formal language of zzso zzso zzso in this language can be interpreted as cost zzso Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our general zzso solutions in practice using empirical and simulation zzso
