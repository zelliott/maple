zzso is a zzso protein around neutral zzso but the zzso becomes the dominant species at pH zzso due to strong zzso zzso between the positively charged zzso It has been found that the addition of zzso to water at pH zzso favors the zzso of zzso In particular, the zzso is the dominant species at zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2001, 10, zzso The effect of these salt conditions on the strength of zzso interaction has been calculated by means of a simple but physically sound zzso The obtained estimates indicate that: zzso the zzso interaction contribution is strengthened in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with respect to pure water, but not in 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso binding on the positively charged surface of protein molecules has to be the major factor for the zzso zzso
