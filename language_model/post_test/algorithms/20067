Current breast cancer research involves the study of many different prognosis factors: primary tumor size, zzso zzso status, tumor grade, tumor zzso status, zzso and zzso levels, among zzso zzso zzso technologies are allowing to better understand and identify zzso factors in breast zzso But the massive amounts of data derived from these technologies require the use of efficient zzso techniques to unveil new and relevant biomedical zzso Furthermore, zzso tools are needed that effectively combine zzso types of biomedical data, such as prognosis factors and expression zzso The objective of this study was to integrate information from the main zzso factors in breast cancer with zzso zzso data to identify potential associations among zzso We propose the application of a data mining approach, called fuzzy association rule mining, to automatically unveil these zzso This paper describes the proposed methodology and illustrates how it can be applied to different breast cancer zzso The obtained results support known associations involving the number of copies of zzso zzso amplification, or the expression level of zzso and zzso receptors in breast cancer zzso They also confirm the correspondence between the zzso status predicted by different testing zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, other interesting rules involving zzso zzso and zzso genes are identified, although further detailed studies are needed to statistically confirm these zzso As part of this study, a web platform implementing the fuzzy association rule mining approach has been made freely available at: zzso zzso
