The propagation of the gastric slow wave is one of the most important spatial characteristics of gastric electrical activity zzso The time delay zzso zzso is an effective approach to zzso assessing the propagation zzso of zzso Traditional zzso analyses are developed under the condition reported that the background noise in zzso analysis is zzso zzso Due to the effects of spikes and/or motion artifacts, the zzso obtained from gastric zzso zzso often contains sharp zzso This paper proposes robust time delay zzso based on least mean zzso blind channel identification zzso under zzso noise zzso Compared with the least mean square time delay zzso zzso the zzso provides better performance in the impulsive noise zzso The zzso of the proposed method is demonstrated through computer simulations in both zzso and zzso noise zzso The results of the propagation zzso of real data obtained from gastric zzso zzso in zzso patients show that the propagation zzso in zzso patients is slower than in the normal subjects reported in the literature, and the zzso propagation is directed zzso to zzso from the corpus toward the zzso but not all the zzso of the propagation zzso increases zzso
