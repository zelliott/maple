zzso learning approaches offer the potential to systematically identify zzso regulatory interactions from a compendium of zzso expression zzso However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the zzso scale has remained zzso Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of zzso zzso using zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso known zzso coli regulatory interactions from zzso We also developed and applied the context likelihood of zzso zzso algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of zzso zzso demonstrates an average precision gain of zzso relative to the zzso performing zzso At a zzso true positive rate, zzso identifies zzso regulatory zzso of which 338 were in the previously known network and zzso were novel zzso We tested the predicted interactions for three zzso factors with zzso zzso confirming 21 novel interactions and zzso our zzso performance zzso zzso also identified a regulatory link providing central zzso control of iron zzso which we confirmed with real-time quantitative zzso The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with zzso provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network zzso zzso using experimental zzso
