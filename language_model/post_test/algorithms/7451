Recent advances in microscopic detection techniques include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso zzso These methods can be integrated with zzso zzso to assist zzso thus enabling diseases to be detected at an early and zzso stage, forgoing the need for zzso samples and zzso zzso Since zzso biopsy does not leave visible marks after zzso it is important to track the biopsy sites to enable accurate zzso and subsequent serial zzso In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for pathological site zzso in zzso zzso The proposed method is based on zzso deformation zzso with geometrical association combined with zzso online learning and zzso It provides online in zzso zzso and is able to track pathological sites in the presence of tissue zzso It is also robust to partial zzso and can be applied to a range of imaging zzso including zzso laser zzso
