Absolute zzso zzso counts are used in the initiation and monitoring of zzso therapy in zzso zzso Becton zzso zzso zzso system was introduced 12 years ago as a dedicated instrument for zzso of absolute zzso zzso However, this system does not provide percent zzso zzso that is the required monitoring zzso in pediatric zzso We evaluated a new BD zzso zzso software and zzso for simultaneous percent and absolute zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and absolute zzso zzso in 149 zzso blood samples were determined using a new zzso zzso zzso of percent and absolute zzso zzso were compared between the zzso zzso method, using BD zzso flow zzso plus zzso zzso and the standard zzso zzso zzso and agreement were analyzed using linear zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso values obtained from the new zzso system correlated well with zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Mean bias was only zzso zzso of agreement zzso zzso to zzso and percent similarity was zzso For absolute zzso zzso the new system correlated highly with standard zzso system zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with a percent similarity of zzso Mean bias was zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

This new zzso system is a simple and reliable system for zzso of absolute and percent zzso zzso Having one system giving both results should reduce the cost and thus increase access to zzso testing for pediatric and adult zzso
