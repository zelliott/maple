In this paper we present an approach to zzso zzso instruments with respect to the camera position, purely based on video image zzso No zzso are zzso The only requirement is a zzso strip at the zzso part of the instrument zzso to facilitate image zzso The method exploits perspective image analysis applied to the zzso shape of the instrument zzso allowing to measure five degrees of freedom of the instrument position and zzso We describe the method theoretically and zzso derive zzso zzso for tuning the parameters of the zzso zzso show that the method can be used for applications where accuracy is not critical, zzso zzso analysis, gesture analysis, zzso guidance, zzso zzso If this method is used in combination with a robotic camera holder, full zzso with respect to the operating room can be zzso
