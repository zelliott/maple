zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso data often is limited by zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso and accuracy of a quantitative CT zzso data analysis using automated software in comparison with qualitative zzso and zzso CT image reading in patients with peripheral bypass zzso 

zzso patients with 33 zzso bypass zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7) CT zzso Two readers evaluated in consensus the CT data zzso on zzso and zzso reconstructions and with the software regarding the presence of graft zzso zzso changes, and zzso zzso The time for data analysis was taken and the accuracy was compared with the results from digital zzso zzso zzso 

No significant difference was present between data analysis time using zzso and zzso CT images zzso zzso zzso minutes) and when using the software tool zzso zzso zzso zzso Good zzso zzso zzso to excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was present between qualitative and quantitative CT analysis regarding zzso zzso zzso and specificity for diagnosing zzso zzso and zzso did not differ significantly zzso zzso zzso between qualitative CT image reading and the automated software zzso 

CT zzso analysis of peripheral bypass zzso using an automated software tool is similar regarding zzso and accuracy when compared with qualitative CT data analysis on zzso and zzso zzso It may assist in determining the significance of an zzso and can yield objective zzso data of vessel zzso
