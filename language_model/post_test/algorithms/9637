The zzso neural network zzso is a fascinating neural network zzso which has been shown to possess chaotic properties, and to also demonstrate zzso memory zzso and pattern recognition zzso zzso zzso of the zzso have also been used to obtain other zzso phenomena, and even zzso An zzso problem associated with the zzso and the zzso referred to above is that all of them require a zzso number of zzso This is essentially because the zzso in each case are completely connected zzso In this paper, we consider how the zzso can be significantly reduced by merely using a linear number of zzso To achieves this, we extract from the original completely connected graph one of its spanning zzso We then address the problem of computing the weights for this spanning zzso This is done in such a manner that the modified zzso zzso has approximately the same zzso zzso and thus the new weights are themselves calculated using a zzso zzso By a detailed experimental analysis, we show that the new zzso zzso network possesses chaotic and zzso properties for different zzso As far as we know, such a zzso zzso has not been reported, and the results given here are zzso
