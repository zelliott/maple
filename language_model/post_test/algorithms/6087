zzso zzso are an zzso tool to zzso gene regulatory zzso In order for gene expression levels to be comparable across zzso zzso procedures have to be zzso A large number of methods have been described to correct for systematic biases in zzso zzso The performance of these methods has been tested only to a limited zzso Here, we evaluate two different types of zzso zzso zzso the same gene in replicate samples and zzso different, but zzso genes in the same zzso The reliability of the latter analysis needs to be determined for the analysis of regulatory networks and our report is the first attempt to evaluate for the accuracy of different zzso zzso methods in this zzso zzso with previous results we observed a large effect of the zzso method on the outcome of the expression zzso Our analyses indicate that different zzso methods should be performed depending on whether a study is aiming to detect differential gene expression between independent samples or whether zzso genes should be zzso We make recommendations about the most appropriate method to zzso
