We investigated influence of the zzso effect on optical Kerr signals of zzso glass zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso optical Kerr zzso By measuring the dependence of the Kerr signals on the pump power and on the polarization angle between pump and probe beams, we found that the optical Kerr signals of zzso consisted of two zzso a fast response and a slow zzso were attributed to the zzso effect and the zzso zzso effect, zzso The contribution of the zzso effect to the Kerr signals increased with increase of the pump zzso For the zzso glass, no evident influence of zzso on the Kerr signals was zzso
