To study the rules that apparent diffusion zzso zzso changes with time and space in cerebral zzso and to provide the evidence in defining the zzso zzso 

117 zzso in 98 patients with cerebral zzso (12 zzso 43 zzso 29 zzso 10 steady, and 23 chronic zzso were zzso with both conventional zzso and diffusion weighted zzso The average zzso values, the relative zzso zzso values, and the zzso values or zzso values from the center to the periphery of the zzso were zzso 

The average zzso values and the zzso values of zzso and acute zzso zzso depressed zzso zzso values in zzso and acute stage was zzso and increased progressively as time passed and appeared as zzso values in approximately 8 to 14 zzso zzso zzso values became greater than normal in chronic zzso There was positive correlation between zzso values and time zzso zzso zzso The zzso values and the zzso values in zzso and acute zzso had zzso signs that these zzso increased from the center to the zzso The zzso values and the zzso values in zzso zzso had adverse zzso signs that these zzso decreased from the center to the zzso 

The zzso values of zzso zzso have evolution rules with time and zzso The evolution rules with time and those in space can be helpful to decide the clinical stage, and to provide the evidence in guiding the treatment or judging the prognosis in zzso
