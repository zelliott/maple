Treatment of peripheral nervous system zzso pathology presents intervention challenges to every zzso Many of the current and future interventions will be directed at restoring the normal zzso function, and zzso properties of the zzso restoring normal neural physiology and ultimately patient function and quality of zzso Present interventions use mechanical zzso or electrical procedures to affect various properties of the peripheral zzso The purpose of this article was to apply basic science to clinical zzso The pathology and accompanying structural and zzso changes in the zzso will be presented in three specific areas commonly encountered in the zzso nerve injury and zzso zzso zzso and zzso pain and neural tension zzso The intent is to address possible interventions exploring the clinical reasoning process that combines basic science and evidence-based best zzso The current lack of literature to support any one intervention requires a strong foundation and understanding of the zzso structure and function to refine current and develop new intervention zzso Current evidence will be presented and linked with future considerations for intervention and zzso During this zzso of development and zzso best practice will rely on sound clinical reasoning skills that incorporate basic science to achieve a successful outcome when treating these challenging zzso
