To zzso systematic and random patient zzso errors in breast and head and neck conventional zzso and to evaluate a zzso level zzso protocol for systematic zzso error zzso correction in head and neck cancer and breast cancer zzso 

zzso electronic portal images of zzso zzso fields were obtained daily for the initial four consecutive zzso for 20 patients treated for breast cancer and for 20 head and neck cancer zzso The calculated systematic error was used to shift the zzso accordingly on the fifth treatment zzso From then until the end of the treatment course, pair zzso portal images of zzso fields were obtained zzso To assess the impact of the zzso zzso and zzso systematic errors were compared and zzso margins were estimated before and after correction using published margin zzso 

zzso systematic zzso error decreased in the breast cancer patient group after the zzso of zzso protocol from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The percentage of patients with individual systematic zzso error reduction was zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso y and zzso zzso zzso systematic zzso error decreased also in the head and neck cancer patient group from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso The percentage of patients with individual systematic zzso error reduction was zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction achievable with zzso protocol zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for breast cancer patients and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for head and neck cancer zzso 

zzso zzso protocol is useful for systematic zzso error correction and zzso margin reduction in conventional breast and head and neck zzso
