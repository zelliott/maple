In the zzso experiment, the new zzso zzso category was tentatively zzso zzso were asked to provide functional information on the zzso targets, many of which were of unknown zzso This article describes the setup of the experiment and its results, highlighting what was learned from it, and suggesting modifications to its format for the next zzso The obvious limitation of such an experiment is that the results cannot be assessed in the standard zzso fashion, as all targets remain of unknown zzso Furthermore, we had to face the expected difficulties due to the novelty of the experiment and to the problems connected with function zzso Nevertheless, and even with a limited number of participating groups, we believe that the results of the experiment can be useful both for its future and for zzso working on the functional assignment of the zzso zzso We found that, in a few cases, a consensus functional prediction could be derived for targets of unknown zzso However, our analysis suggests that a general description of the method used should be made available together with the predictions so that a higher reliability can be assigned to cases where completely independent methods give the same or similar zzso
