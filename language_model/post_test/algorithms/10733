An zzso signal zzso based on zzso statistics with a zzso variable zzso zzso is introduced to recover evoked zzso zzso zzso are usually embedded in the ongoing electroencephalogram with a very low zzso ratio zzso As a zzso statistics technique has a natural tolerance to zzso noise, it is zzso for filtering zzso An zzso signal zzso based on zzso statistics was used as the major filter in this zzso However, the efficiency of the zzso signal zzso was reduced when the total power of zzso noises was zzso To improve the performance for zzso under poor zzso a zzso signal is zzso Therefore a zzso with a zzso variable zzso zzso was employed to enhance the zzso of the signal in this zzso The fundamental idea of a zzso variable zzso zzso is that its zzso are regularly zzso to zzso Therefore this zzso can be used as a zzso with different noise zzso Experimental results showed that, for filtering zzso the proposed scheme is superior to the zzso signal zzso with a zzso least mean square zzso
