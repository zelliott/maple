In zzso zzso depletion zzso zzso the spatial resolution scales as the inverse square root of the zzso zzso zzso However, to fully exploit the maximum effective resolution achievable for a given zzso zzso intensity, several experimental precautions have to be zzso We focus our attention on the zzso alignment between the zzso and zzso zzso and the polarization state of the zzso zzso We present a simple theoretical framework that help to explain their influence on the performance of a zzso microscope and we validate the results by imaging zzso and biological samples with a custom made zzso architecture based on a zzso laser zzso We also highlight the advantages of using time gating detection in terms of zzso zzso
