A model is considered for a neural network that is a zzso process on a random zzso The zzso are represented by zzso zzso The structure of the graph is determined by the probabilities of the connections, and it depends on the activity in the zzso The dependence between the initial level of zzso of the connections and the dynamics of zzso in the network was zzso A balanced regime was found between activity, zzso the level of zzso in the network, and zzso that allows formation of zzso zzso
