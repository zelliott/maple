zzso bypass zzso is a safe support system during major cardiac operations because it allows the distribution of adequately zzso blood to the entire zzso The optimal zzso flow to be used during zzso zzso remains a controversial zzso In the present study, the effect of different flows and pressures on oxygen delivery, extraction and consumption was zzso Such an effect was evaluated for 40 patients undergoing zzso surgery using zzso zzso zzso and systemic zzso The patients were zzso into two groups (20 each) according to the flow and pressure zzso flow, low pressure and high flow, high zzso The electrical zzso from 50 zzso to 10 zzso for blood samples and zzso for both groups was also measured at different time intervals zzso during and zzso No significant change for low flow group was recorded zzso zzso zzso while the zzso properties of the zzso group were greatly affected by the time of zzso zzso low flow can be safely used in young patients without any organ impairment or carotid artery disease, while high flow should be used for patients with any organ dysfunction, at the initiation of zzso and during zzso to compensate for the increase in oxygen consumption and the need for better zzso zzso
