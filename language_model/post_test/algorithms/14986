Pulmonary imaging using single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the focus of current zzso research, including zzso analysis and three-dimensional zzso radiation treatment zzso Improvement in the quantitative capability of zzso may help establish its potential role in this application as well as others requiring accurate knowledge of pulmonary blood zzso The purposes of this study were to zzso evaluate zzso filtered zzso zzso and ordered zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for measuring absolute activity concentration in lung phantom experiments, and to incorporate quantitative zzso techniques in zzso for lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chang zzso compensation, scatter zzso and zzso zzso Metz zzso and zzso zzso were compared with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Chang zzso compensation and zzso von zzso zzso for their ability to improve zzso of inactive and active zzso defects in the lungs of an zzso torso zzso zzso concentration estimates were found to depend on many factors, such as region of interest size, scatter zzso constant zzso zzso zzso filtering and, in the case of zzso total number of zzso In general, reconstruction zzso incorporating compensation for zzso zzso and scatter provided reduced bias relative to the clinical zzso Potential applications to lung zzso including zzso zzso and treatment planning are also zzso zzso has the potential to provide accurate estimates of lung activity zzso that, together with improved image quality, may be useful for the study and prediction of therapeutic zzso
