zzso zzso hold promise for richer findings in association studies, but testing of several zzso traits zzso the grand challenge of association studies, that of multiple zzso Several methods have recently been proposed for testing jointly all traits in a zzso zzso of zzso with prospect of increased power to detect small effects that would be missed if tested zzso However, the methods have rarely been compared to the extent of enabling assessment of their relative merits and setting up guidelines on which method to use, and how to use zzso We compare the methods on simulated data and with a real zzso data set zzso 137 highly correlated variables and approximately zzso zzso zzso the methods to zzso data with hundreds of thousands of markers inevitably requires division of the problem into manageable parts zzso parallel processing, parts corresponding to individual genetic zzso zzso or zzso for zzso Here we zzso a straightforward zzso according to which the zzso is divided into blocks of nearby correlated genetic zzso tested jointly for association with the zzso This zzso is zzso zzso reduces the number of tests, and lets the methods take advantage of combining information over several correlated variables not only on the zzso side, but also on the zzso zzso Our experiments show that zzso correlation analysis has higher power than alternative methods, while remaining zzso zzso for routine use in the zzso setting, provided the number of samples is sufficient compared to the numbers of zzso and zzso variables zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis and zzso models with zzso zzso factors show promising performance when the number of samples is small compared to the zzso of the zzso
