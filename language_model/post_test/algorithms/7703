In this paper, we present a novel dictionary learning framework for data lying on the zzso of square root zzso and apply it to the reconstruction of diffusion zzso zzso fields given a zzso diffusion zzso data zzso Unlike most of the existing dictionary learning zzso which rely on the assumption that the data points are zzso in some zzso space, our dictionary learning zzso is designed to incorporate the intrinsic geometric structure of zzso and performs better than traditional dictionary learning approaches when applied to data lying on the zzso of square root zzso zzso as well as zzso across the whole field of the reconstructed zzso is guaranteed in our zzso We demonstrate the advantage of our approach by comparing it with an existing dictionary based reconstruction method on synthetic and real zzso zzso zzso
