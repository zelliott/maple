This study describes a prediction method for central zzso episodes of newborns during zzso The zzso between heart rate and zzso obtained from newborns is zzso zzso the zzso the displacement between heart rate and zzso before central sleep zzso episodes was much larger than the displacement in the stationary zzso As the result, it is possible to predict central sleep zzso episodes several minutes before their zzso
