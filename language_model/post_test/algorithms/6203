A minimal cardiac model has been developed which accurately captures the essential dynamics of the cardiovascular system zzso However, identifying patient specific parameters with the limited zzso often available, zzso the clinical application of the model for diagnosis and therapy zzso This paper presents an zzso zzso identification method for fast, accurate identification of patient specific parameters using limited measured zzso The integral method turns a previously zzso and zzso zzso problem into a linear and convex identification zzso The model includes zzso interaction and zzso valve zzso A healthy human state and four disease states, zzso zzso pulmonary zzso zzso shock and septic shock are used to test the zzso zzso for the healthy and disease states are accurately identified using only zzso flows into and out of the two cardiac chambers, the minimum and maximum volumes of the left and right zzso and the pressure zzso through the zzso and pulmonary zzso These input values can be readily obtained zzso using zzso and zzso or zzso via zzso that are often used in zzso zzso The method enables rapid identification of model parameters to match a particular patient condition in clinical real time zzso zzso to within a mean value of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso distributed measurement zzso The specific changes made to simulate each disease state are correctly identified in each case to within zzso without false identification of any other patient specific zzso zzso the resulting patient specific model can then be used to assist medical staff in understanding, diagnosis and treatment zzso
