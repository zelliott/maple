The capability of zzso zzso ultrasound therapy to produce continuous regions of zzso zzso that conform to human prostate zzso was evaluated using 3-D anatomical models of prostate cancer zzso 

zzso simulations incorporating acoustic and zzso modeling and a novel temperature control feedback zzso were used to evaluate treatment accuracy of a rotating zzso zzso zzso zzso were simulated on zzso anatomical models obtained from the manual zzso of the prostate and surrounding structures on MR images of prostate cancer patients obtained prior to radical zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso could be accurately shaped to zzso volumes within 1 zzso across the vast majority of the zzso zzso and zzso volumes remained smaller than zzso of the corresponding prostate volumes which ranged from 14 to 60 zzso Treatment times were typically 30 zzso and remained below 60 zzso even for large 60 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso wall remained below 30 zzso degrees zzso in half of the patient models with only minor, superficial heating in the other zzso The simulated feedback control zzso adjusted the ultrasound zzso parameters such that high treatment accuracy was maintained despite variable blood zzso changing tissue ultrasound zzso and practical temperature measurement noise and sampling zzso 

zzso simulations predict that zzso zzso ultrasound therapy is capable of producing highly accurate volumes of zzso zzso that conform to human prostate zzso
