zzso low- and zzso acquisitions of zzso CT zzso scan using different weighting factors leads to differences in zzso values and image zzso The aim of this work was to evaluate whether average weighting of zzso acquisitions could improve zzso of head and neck cancer and image zzso 

Among 60 consecutive patients who underwent zzso scan of the head and neck, 35 patients had positive findings and were included in the zzso Images were reconstructed as pure 80 zzso pure zzso zzso and zzso zzso image zzso from low- and zzso acquisitions using 3 different weighting factors zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso zzso zzso from the 80 zzso data, zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and objective noise were compared between different image zzso Two independent blinded zzso zzso rated the overall image quality of each image zzso on a zzso grading scale zzso zzso zzso image zzso and zzso zzso 

Mean zzso and tumor enhancement and muscle zzso increased zzso with decreasing tube zzso from zzso zzso through 80 zzso zzso increased significantly from zzso zzso to weighting factor zzso then to weighting factor zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso from weighting factor zzso to zzso then to 80 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso image zzso received the best image quality score by the 2 zzso 

zzso the DE data from the 80 zzso and zzso zzso tubes using weighting factor zzso zzso from 80 zzso zzso could improve zzso zzso and zzso overall image quality (including zzso zzso This weighting factor was significantly superior to the zzso weighting factor which simulates standard 120 zzso zzso
