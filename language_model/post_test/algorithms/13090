The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to process zzso data in liquids and can be advantageous when the spectrum is sparse enough, the lines are sharp and zzso raw sensitivity is adequate, and the measured zzso data is short, so that the zzso zzso spectrum exhibits distorted line zzso Noise can adversely impact resolution and/or frequency accuracy in zzso spectral zzso Paradoxically, more complete data can lead to worse zzso zzso if there is appreciable zzso However, by zzso the zzso method, the zzso noise performance improves significantly, without apparently losing any of the existing zzso The two key modifications are to adjust the zzso basis functions so that zzso elements zzso from them have less noise contribution on average, and to zzso each dimension of a zzso spectrum zzso The modifications can be recommended for zzso use in the case of somewhat zzso incomplete zzso
