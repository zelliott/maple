Automatic mode switching zzso is a useful means to avoid rapid zzso response during zzso zzso zzso but zzso cannot occur if the detected zzso rate during zzso is below the mode switching zzso This may be the result of zzso medications, or when the zzso events fall within the zzso zzso period, or if the zzso zzso during zzso are too small to be zzso We zzso that the addition of an automatic rate switching zzso zzso may complement zzso response during zzso with different detected zzso zzso We studied the Marathon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso that are independently zzso but can also operate in zzso zzso sensed above the zzso rate (160 zzso will lead to zzso zzso whereas zzso below zzso rate will be tracked at an interim rate as dictate by the zzso at a zzso response that is 20 zzso above the sensor indicated zzso zzso zzso were simulated by chest wall stimulation zzso zzso was applied to 33 patients (16 men, 17 women, mean age 69 zzso 11 zzso with a Marathon zzso zzso using an external zzso to simulate zzso occurring at two rate zzso above the zzso rate zzso at 160 zzso at 180 zzso and below the zzso rate at 120 zzso The zzso zzso and mean zzso rates during zzso in zzso mode with zzso alone, zzso alone, and their combination were zzso During zzso at 120 zzso the zzso plus zzso setting showed a mean zzso rate of 79 zzso 3 zzso and 124 zzso 14 zzso in the zzso setting alone zzso zzso zzso With zzso at 180 zzso the mean zzso rate in the zzso plus zzso setting compared to the zzso setting alone was not significantly zzso However, the variation in zzso pacing rate was 7 zzso 14 zzso in the zzso plus zzso setting and 40 zzso 42 zzso in the zzso setting zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is effective for simulated zzso zzso sensed above the zzso zzso Combined zzso with zzso is useful to handle simulated zzso zzso at a slower rate and to avoid rate fluctuation during zzso There is also a possibility that this can be applied to the naturally occurring zzso zzso
