The efficient filtering of zzso zzso would considerably benefit the exploration of the zzso space when searching for minimum energy structures or during molecular zzso The most important conditions for filtering are the maintenance of molecular chain integrity and the avoidance of zzso zzso These conditions can be seen as geometric constraints on a molecular zzso In this article, we discuss how techniques issued from recent research in zzso can be applied to this zzso Two complementary techniques are zzso one for zzso sampling and another for computing zzso changes satisfying such geometric zzso The main interest of the proposed techniques is their application to the structural analysis of long protein zzso First experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for studying the mobility of loop 7 in zzso from zzso zzso The supposed motions of this zzso loop would play an important role in the activity of this zzso
