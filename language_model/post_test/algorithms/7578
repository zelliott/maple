The cascade zzso is a usual approach in object detection based on vision, since it successively rejects negative zzso zzso background images, in a cascade structure, keeping the processing time suitable for zzso zzso On the other hand, similar to other zzso zzso cascade zzso are likely to have high zzso zzso dimension, which may lead to zzso the training zzso zzso this work aims at improving the zzso capacity of the cascade zzso by controlling its complexity, which depends on the model of their zzso zzso the number of zzso and the feature space dimension of each stage, which can be controlled by zzso the zzso setting of the feature zzso (in our case an image zzso into the zzso framework of support zzso machine training, as will be shown in this zzso Moreover, to set the number of cascade zzso bounds on the false positive rate zzso and on the true positive rate zzso of cascade zzso are derived based on a zzso zzso These bounds are applied to compose an enveloping receiver operating curve zzso zzso a new curve in the zzso space in which each point is an ordered pair of upper bound on the zzso and lower bound on the zzso The optimal number of cascade stages is zzso by comparing zzso of zzso with different numbers of zzso
