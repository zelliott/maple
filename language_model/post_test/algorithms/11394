This paper applies a recently proposed dominant point detection method - precision and reliability zzso zzso - for representing shapes in the zzso images of zzso zzso This method uses both the local and the global nature of fit for dominant point zzso A smaller value of its control zzso better represents the local zzso properties of the shape while a larger value better indicates the global zzso zzso The zzso of this method to a wide range of zzso images is demonstrated using four zzso examples of brightness enhancement films, electromagnetic and zzso band gap materials, and zzso mirror zzso It is shown that PRO can clearly highlight several image effects and imperfections which may not be easily identifiable by human eye or may be difficult to analyze and zzso Further, for large scale zzso it can be used to generate useful fabrication accuracy statistics and detect features with low zzso or more zzso
