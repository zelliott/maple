To present the aesthetic and functional outcomes of zzso zzso reconstruction in Asian patients and to propose a working surgical zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso zzso reconstruction at a zzso facial plastic surgery practice from March 1, 1998, through February 28, zzso The zzso ratio was zzso with a median age of 59 years zzso zzso zzso and the mean follow-up duration was 64 zzso 

The zzso was mostly caused by zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of 17 zzso followed by the zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso of a previous zzso The mean zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso defects were noted for 8 patients, whereas 9 had zzso zzso The choice of reconstruction method was primarily based on the size and depth of the surgical zzso Most of the defects 1 to 2 zzso in diameter needed zzso zzso (10 of 17 zzso whereas zzso defects larger than 2 zzso needed forehead zzso (3 of 17 zzso to reconstruct the external zzso Smaller defects less than 1 zzso were reconstructed with composite zzso (2 of 17 zzso a zzso zzso (1 of 17 zzso or primary closure (1 of 17 zzso Seven of 8 zzso defects had the internal zzso lining reconstructed using a zzso zzso zzso and 1 case was reconstructed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage graft was used in 8 zzso No zzso failure occurred except in 1 case, in which necrosis of the internal lining zzso caused contraction of the external zzso with zzso zzso rim zzso An zzso of the zzso margin and zzso groove zzso occurred in 3 zzso No functional problems zzso zzso surgical outcome on a 4-point satisfaction scale revealed that 5 patients zzso were much satisfied, 10 patients zzso were satisfied, 1 patient zzso was fairly satisfied, and 1 patient zzso was zzso 

The choice of reconstruction method of zzso zzso zzso in Asian patients depends primarily on the size and depth of the zzso zzso local zzso use of cartilage reinforcement zzso and internal lining reconstruction using zzso zzso zzso are key elements for achieving optimal aesthetic and functional zzso
