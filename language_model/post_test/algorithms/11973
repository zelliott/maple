zzso imaging zzso is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Unfortunately, local magnetic field zzso induced mainly by the zzso presence cause significant geometrical zzso predominantly along the zzso direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further zzso So far, this aspect has been too often zzso In this paper, we suggest a new approach using an zzso specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted zzso images with corresponding zzso correct zzso zzso We model the deformation field with zzso which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while zzso the zzso transform as a special zzso The registration criterion is least zzso Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control zzso The zzso model gives us good accuracy thanks to its high approximation zzso The short support of zzso leads to a fast zzso A zzso approach yields zzso and additional zzso The zzso was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual zzso A zzso zzso random deformation generator was developed for testing zzso A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual zzso
