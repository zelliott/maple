In this paper, two new concepts of DR zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are presented with their calculation zzso For the problem of selecting beam arcs in zzso zzso Planning system, a mathematics model of constrained zzso has been zzso Furthermore, we have produced a feasible project of automatic selecting zzso beam arcs plan using zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the distribution of the fields of DR and zzso in the reduced phase zzso
