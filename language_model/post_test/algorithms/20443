We have used zzso and zzso methods to study the zzso characteristics of a widely used technical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be stabilized by a combination of zzso and zzso mechanisms termed as zzso zzso The zzso stabilization is considered to arise in part from dissolved zzso chains with charged zzso groups extending out into the continuous zzso The presence of dissolved zzso chains in the zzso implies that zzso and zzso will be facilitated during film formation, enabling a smooth continuous film to be zzso The extent of the stabilization layer and an effective zzso volume was estimated to discuss the steady zzso and zzso properties in this zzso The glass transition temperature zzso of the particles making up the zzso has also been determined as a function of zzso moisture and modeled by the zzso equation modified for specific interaction between water, zzso and zzso This zzso at high moisture content can be used as a first approximation to the minimum zzso temperature zzso Change in zzso (and thus zzso with moisture content implies that the coating process must be controlled so as to produce a rate of drying slow enough to allow zzso to zzso
