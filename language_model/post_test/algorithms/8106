A simple pulse zzso derived from the shaped pulse zzso exciting the central transition of a spin zzso can be used to selectively detect ordered sodium with a given zzso zzso The pulse sequence consists of two zzso with opposite zzso and separated by a zzso called a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso sequence is tested with a phantom made of sodium zzso in zzso and in zzso solution and its feasibility for contrast modification based on the zzso zzso is zzso
