Modeling the zzso dynamics of zzso reaction systems at zzso resolution has become feasible with the increase of computing power and is applied especially to cellular signal zzso For an association reaction the two molecules have to be in zzso zzso a physically faithful model of the molecular interaction assumes zzso molecules that interact at their surfaces zzso zzso For performance reasons, this model can be replaced by particles that can overlap and react when they are closer than a certain distance with a reaction probability zzso zzso Here we present an zzso approximation for the reaction probability in the volume scheme and compare the zzso with the boundary zzso A zzso reaction, in contrast, creates two molecules next to each zzso If the reaction is zzso these two products can directly zzso again, leading to an zzso of the zzso state in the zzso We show how the correct zzso rate can be achieved if the products of the zzso are placed at identical positions, but cannot react for a certain zzso This zzso time zzso to the completion of the zzso zzso of the two molecules to their contact distance zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso for molecules with zzso zzso and zzso and diffusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso
