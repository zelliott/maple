zzso material properties at the zzso is critical to understanding the behavior of zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate a novel technique that allows direct determination and imaging of physical properties of individual zzso and zzso using zzso transmission electron zzso combined with zzso electron zzso zzso zzso We show that strong zzso correlations exist between the zzso energy and elastic properties, zzso zzso electron density and cohesive zzso We apply these zzso relationships to characterize the elastic properties of zzso zzso in a zzso structural zzso and the zzso of zzso soot zzso We also discuss additional factors that need to be considered when using zzso as a quantitative tool for zzso property zzso The results show that zzso has the potential to determine multiple solid-state properties of materials at the zzso establishing a new capability for zzso electron zzso
