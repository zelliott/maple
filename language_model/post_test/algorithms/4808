The origin of spike adding in bursting activity is studied in a reduced model of the zzso heart zzso We show that, as the zzso zzso of the slow zzso current are shifted towards zzso membrane potential values, the bursting phase zzso zzso more spikes into the zzso This phenomenon is zzso to be caused by the zzso zzso of a zzso periodic orbit setting the threshold between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The fundamentals of the mechanism are revealed through the analysis of a family of the onto zzso return zzso
