zzso data are among the most commonly collected, yet zzso demographic data gathered by wildlife zzso zzso population construction techniques can use this information to estimate the abundance of wild populations over wide geographic areas and zzso estimate zzso harvest, and natural survival zzso Although current reconstruction techniques use full zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is not always possible to determine an zzso age due to inaccuracy of the methods, expense, and logistics of sample zzso The ability to inventory wild populations would be greatly expanded if pooled adult zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be successfully used in statistical population zzso 

We investigated the performance of statistical population reconstruction models developed to analyze full zzso and pooled adult zzso zzso We performed zzso Carlo simulations using a zzso version of a Leslie zzso model, which generated data over a wide range of abundance levels, harvest rates, and natural survival zzso representing zzso game zzso zzso of full zzso and pooled adult zzso population reconstructions were compared for accuracy and zzso No discernible difference in accuracy was zzso but precision was slightly reduced when using the pooled adult zzso zzso On average, the zzso of variation zzso zzso increased by zzso when the adult zzso data were pooled prior to zzso The analyses and maximum likelihood model for pooled adult zzso reconstruction are illustrated for a zzso deer zzso zzso population in Washington zzso 

zzso wild populations is one of the greatest challenges of wildlife zzso These new statistical population reconstruction models should expand the demographic capabilities of wildlife agencies that have already collected pooled adult zzso data or are seeking a cost-effective method for monitoring the status and trends of our wild zzso
