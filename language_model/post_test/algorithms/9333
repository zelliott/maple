zzso of the blood volume per unit volume of brain tissue is important for understanding brain function in health and zzso We describe a direct method using zzso laser scanning zzso to obtain in zzso the local zzso blood volume in the zzso of zzso zzso We infused fluorescent zzso in the circulating blood and zzso the blood vessels, including the zzso to a depth of 600 zzso below the zzso at the brain zzso zzso cortical blood volume zzso was calculated without any form recognition and zzso by zzso the total zzso measured at each depth and zzso the collected zzso all over the zzso zzso justifications are presented and zzso simulations were performed to validate this method which was zzso sensitive to background zzso Then, zzso had been estimated on seven healthy mice between zzso and zzso We showed that this measure of zzso is zzso and that this method is highly sensitive to the explored zones in the zzso zzso density and zzso This method, which zzso with form recognition, is rapid and would allow to study in zzso zzso and highly resolute spatial variations of zzso under different conditions or zzso
