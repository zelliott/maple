A hybrid model consisting of an zzso zzso Network zzso and a zzso Algorithm procedure for diagnostic risk factors selection in Medicine is proposed in this zzso A medical disease prediction may be viewed as a pattern zzso problem based on a set of clinical and laboratory zzso zzso zzso Network models were assessed in terms of their zzso accuracy concerning medical disease zzso A zzso Algorithm search was performed to examine potential zzso in the diagnostic zzso This search led to a pruned ANN architecture, minimizing the number of diagnostic factors used during the training phase and therefore minimizing the number of zzso in the ANN input and hidden layer as well as the Mean Square zzso of the trained ANN at the testing zzso As a conclusion, a number of diagnostic factors in a patient's data record can be omitted without loss of zzso in the diagnosis zzso
