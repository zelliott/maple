A method to measure the zzso distance from the images obtained with stationary zzso zzso cameras for in zzso studies has been zzso It exploits the shift of the zzso object in the image plane, obtained at a certain tilt of the zzso zzso A linear dependence of the image displacement on the distance to the object has been measured using a zzso zzso camera employing an zzso zzso zzso zzso It is shown that the modified zzso camera can be used to obtain three-dimensional information without moving the camera or the zzso The method could be applied in zzso and zzso surgery, in zzso as well as in the analysis of the zzso of zzso
