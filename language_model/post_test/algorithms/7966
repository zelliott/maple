The possibilities of in zzso zzso zzso applied to phase transitions investigation in oxide thin films and zzso are examined in this work, along with the use of various parameters calculated from zzso data zzso gap energy zzso zzso index zzso and surface zzso together with the directly measured main zzso angles zzso and zzso for the detection of phase zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso on zzso phase transition and its sensitivity to surface defects are also zzso
