This study is a 10-year follow-up to our previous publication reviewing the complication rates of tissue expansion in the pediatric burn zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if our institutional experience with tissue zzso had remained stable during the subsequent 10 zzso 

There were 240 patients who were identified at a major pediatric burn center who underwent reconstruction with a tissue zzso zzso tissue zzso from 1996 to zzso Data were obtained zzso by reviewing patient medical zzso zzso were zzso into absolute and relative zzso 

Absolute complications occurred in 36 zzso of 256 zzso placed and relative complications occurred in 26 zzso of 256 zzso zzso There was no statistical difference between this study and our previous study for overall complication rates and complications for all zzso The highest complication rate occurred when the scalp was a surgical zzso zzso skin preparation was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso complications compared to other skin zzso The operating surgeon or age of patient was not found to be associated with increased complication zzso 

After changing our tissue zzso zzso the complication rates at our institution have remained stable during the 10-year follow-up zzso zzso expansion in the pediatric burn population continues to be a safe and effective zzso option with acceptable complication zzso
