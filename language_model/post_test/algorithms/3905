zzso modeling has suggested that the prevalence of false matches in data matching declines as the events become rarer or the number of matches zzso We examined the effect of case rate and zzso rate in the population on the positive zzso value zzso of a matching zzso for zzso and sexually transmitted disease zzso surveillance registry zzso 

We used zzso a zzso zzso program, to match zzso cases diagnosed in New York City zzso from 1981 to March 31, 2012, and reported to the NYC zzso surveillance registry against syphilis and zzso cases diagnosed in NYC from January 1 to June 30, 2010, and reported to the NYC zzso zzso Match results were manually reviewed to determine true zzso 

With an zzso comparison score zzso value of zzso zzso identified zzso matches, of which zzso were determined to be true by manual zzso zzso varied greatly in zzso with different case rates and zzso zzso zzso was the highest zzso in male syphilis cases, who had a relatively low case rate but a high zzso zzso rate, and lowest zzso in female zzso cases, who had a high case rate but a low zzso zzso zzso When the zzso value was increased to zzso zzso in male syphilis and female zzso cases increased to zzso and zzso zzso 

Case rates and zzso rates have a significant effect on the zzso of a registry zzso zzso zzso decreases as the case rate increases and zzso rate zzso Before conducting registry data matching, program staff should assess the case rate and zzso rate of the population included in the data matching and select an appropriate matching zzso
