zzso zzso zzso is a property of cardiac tissue zzso two closely timed zzso cause the subsequent contraction to be of increased zzso 

Ten subjects were studied in a zzso study to evaluate the safety and performance of an zzso coupled pacing zzso zzso to produce sustained zzso among subjects with moderate heart zzso The primary end points were zzso safety, patient perception, and cardiac zzso The effects of zzso on cardiac function were assessed by comparing zzso parameters before and after 15 to 20 minutes of zzso zzso produced no zzso episodes, ejection fraction increased by 8 ejection fraction points zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso volume decreased by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and a trend toward increasing zzso volume was observed zzso zzso zzso Stroke volume increased by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the pulse rate decreased by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso during zzso This resulted in decreased cardiac output of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Six of the 10 subjects felt no effects from zzso and four subjects felt a change with zzso turned zzso 

zzso zzso was found to be safe and well tolerated in a majority of zzso zzso effects were mixed with improved ejection fraction and stroke volume but decreased cardiac zzso
