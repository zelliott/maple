Early treatment of victims of high level acute zzso zzso or gamma exposure has been shown to improve their likelihood of zzso However, in such cases, both the magnitude of the exposure and the zzso zzso of the zzso are often not known in detail for days to zzso A simple zzso zzso based on zzso zzso as documented in prior radiation accidents is presented zzso This zzso provides an estimate of dose within the first 8 h following an acute zzso zzso Early zzso depletion zzso after a severe radiation accident follow a single zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is a rate constant, dependent primarily on the average dose, zzso Within the first 8 h zzso zzso may be calculated utilizing serial zzso zzso Data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to develop a zzso zzso from 43 gamma exposure cases where both zzso zzso and dose reconstruction were felt to be reasonably zzso The inverse relationship zzso may be modeled by a simple two zzso curve of the form D zzso zzso + zzso in the range 0 zzso or zzso D zzso or zzso 15 zzso with fitting parameters zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and b zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated in this manner is intended to serve only as a first approximation to guide initial medical zzso
