Recent changes in the epidemiology of dental zzso and advances in the development of new diagnostic measurement techniques have zzso interest in improved methods of assessing changes in dental zzso zzso Traditional methods for assessing change focus primarily on the development of new zzso at the zzso level and incorporate incomplete information on the progression of existing zzso zzso A methodology to expand the clinical recording of dental zzso in clinical studies to include 1) both zzso and zzso zzso and 2) the surface area affected for zzso is zzso New zzso are proposed to estimate changes in the number of new zzso the progression of existing zzso zzso and the total change in zzso status for a zzso It is anticipated that the new zzso will produce more efficient methods of assessing change in zzso status in zzso clinical zzso The degree of improvement can be estimated zzso zzso in efficiency may reduce the duration or number of subjects required in zzso clinical zzso
