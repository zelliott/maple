zzso zzso is a progressive disorder with high zzso in the zzso human population that still has no treatment zzso This disorder zzso the breakdown of zzso cartilage, leading to the exposure and damage of bone zzso For a global understanding of zzso development, the systematic integration of known zzso proteins with zzso interaction zzso networks is zzso In this work, the zzso zzso was reconstructed using multiple data sources to have the most up-to-date information on zzso proteins and their zzso We then combined emergent concepts in network medicine to detect new zzso zzso zzso The mapping of known zzso proteins with zzso networks showed that these proteins are locally connected to each other and zzso in a large zzso To expand this zzso we applied a zzso zzso that zzso zzso more searches in the vicinity of the seed zzso zzso As a result, the 10 zzso ranked proteins were connected to the zzso disease zzso supporting the local zzso We zzso structural zzso and selected those that had the highest enrichment of zzso zzso The identified molecules show a link between structural zzso and disease zzso Interestingly, the protein zzso was highlighted for zzso association by both methods, reinforcing the potential involvement of this zzso These results suggest that similar zzso zzso may exist in different human disorders, which could lead to systematic identification of genes or proteins that have a joint role in specific disease zzso
