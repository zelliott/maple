Current methods of predicting zzso protein stability change are zzso zzso learning methods have been introduced for this prediction zzso however, the available experimental data used for training these zzso are zzso zzso data are available for several frequently occurring zzso acid zzso whereas only limited data have been accumulated for some other zzso zzso Generally, current statistical models do not account for this bias toward the zzso zzso acids during the zzso process and are thus less effective in making predictions on less frequently occurring zzso In this paper, we propose a method based on support zzso machines and property zzso of zzso zzso The predictor we constructed zzso other methods on the same data sets and is more robust with poor training zzso The prediction accuracy for zzso with no training data exceeded zzso This advantage is critical for practical application, where the prediction could be applied for any type of zzso Further analysis demonstrates our model relies on biological significant features to make zzso To overcome the drawbacks of zzso zzso into zzso and zzso ones, a zzso zzso of zzso was also discussed, where our method obtained an overall accuracy of zzso
