We propose a new method based on an zzso usually dedicated to DNA sequence alignment in order to both reliably score short-term memory performance on immediate zzso tasks and zzso zzso zzso There can be considerable confusion on how performance on immediate serial list recall tasks is zzso especially when the zzso items are sampled with zzso We discuss the utility of zzso zzso to compare the stimuli to the zzso zzso The idea is that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are typical in DNA, are also typical putative errors in short-term memory zzso zzso confusion, zzso and intrusion zzso We zzso four data sets in which zzso lists included a few (or zzso zzso After examining the method on two simple data sets, we show that sequence alignment offers 1) a compelling method for measuring capacity in terms of chunks when many zzso are introduced in the material zzso data zzso and 2) a reliable zzso of individual differences in short-term memory zzso This study illustrates the difficulty of arriving at a good measure of short-term memory performance, and also attempts to zzso the primary factors underpinning remembering and zzso
