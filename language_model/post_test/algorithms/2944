Comparative analyses of zzso expressed genes between zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are important for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso zzso zzso we used the suppression zzso zzso approach and from more than 2900 clones identified 96 zzso expressed genes between the zzso and zzso zzso at the dome stage in zzso We report the first database of zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso undergo significant zzso processes during the dome zzso However, most zzso expressed genes are zzso in zzso zzso indicating failure of zzso Based on zzso description and Gene zzso zzso zzso the problems of zzso at the dome stage may occur during nuclear zzso translation zzso and regulation of the cell zzso The importance of regulation from recipient zzso in cloning should not be underestimated in zzso
