We designed a new methodology to estimate the pulse pressure variation index zzso in zzso blood pressure zzso The method uses automatic detection zzso kernel zzso and zzso filters to continuously estimate zzso The technique can be used to estimate zzso from zzso alone, eliminating the need for simultaneously acquiring airway zzso
