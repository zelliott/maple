The assumption that a name uniquely identifies an entity introduces two types of zzso splitting treats one entity as two or more (because of name zzso zzso treats multiple entities as if they were one (because of shared zzso Here we investigate the extent to which splitting and zzso affect zzso measures of large-scale zzso networks within two zzso zzso zzso one for co-author names in zzso zzso zzso the other for zzso names in zzso patents zzso zzso In both cases, we find that splitting has relatively little effect, whereas zzso has a dramatic effect on network zzso For example, in the biomedical zzso network, zzso (based on last name and both zzso drives several measures zzso the global zzso zzso by a factor of 4 (from zzso to zzso degree zzso by a factor of zzso (from zzso to zzso and average shortest path by a factor of zzso (from zzso to zzso These results can be explained in part by the fact that zzso artificially creates many zzso relationships and zzso zzso This effect of zzso is much less dramatic but persists with measures that give less weight to zzso zzso such as the mean local zzso zzso and zzso degree zzso Furthermore, the zzso distribution of collaborator counts follows a much zzso line zzso zzso with splitting and zzso errors than without, particularly at the low and the high zzso This suggests that part of the power law often observed for collaborator counts in science and technology reflects an zzso name zzso
