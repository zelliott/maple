A zzso approach to revealing the underlying molecular state of a cell is a long-standing biological zzso Developed over the last decade, gene expression profiles possess the characteristics of such an zzso They have the capacity to reveal both underlying molecular events as well as broader zzso such as clinical zzso To interpret these profiles, many gene sets have been developed that characterize biological zzso However, the full potential of these gene sets has not yet been zzso Since the advent of gene expression databases, many have zzso that they can reveal properties of activities that are not evident from individual zzso analogous to how the expression of a single gene generally cannot reveal the zzso of a biological zzso 

To address this issue, we have developed a zzso method to mine gene expression databases for the regulation of gene zzso Given a set of zzso we scored it against each gene expression zzso by looking for enrichment of zzso genes relative to an empirical zzso zzso After zzso the method, we applied it to address two biological zzso First, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that true zzso targets exhibit a distinct regulatory profile across a zzso Second, we leveraged the patterns of regulation across a database of gene sets to produce an automatically generated catalog of biological zzso These demonstrations revealed the power of a global analysis of the data contained within gene expression databases, and the potential for using them to address biological zzso
