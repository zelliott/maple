zzso satellite estimates of zzso a zzso zzso zzso are an important indicator of zzso zzso To correctly interpret zzso zzso estimates must be accurate and sources of zzso errors zzso While the underlying assumptions of band ratio zzso such as zzso have been tacitly hypothesized zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the influence of component zzso and scattering on the shape of the zzso and estimated zzso error has yet to be explicitly zzso We zzso the zzso zzso data set to examine variations between satellite estimated zzso and in zzso zzso We zzso the zzso into zzso signal contamination and zzso natural zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Not surprisingly, the zzso zzso curve resulted from a balance between these two different sources of variation confirming the bias by zzso zzso on global zzso Unlike previous descriptions of empirical zzso zzso our study zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso as zzso the global zzso data set, and zzso removed zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso in zzso transfer models directly showing that the scale of the remaining zzso in the band ratio zzso was dominated by zzso zzso cross zzso
