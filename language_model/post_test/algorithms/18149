This paper aims to address the problem of zzso video zzso captured in zzso for the applications of online normal zzso recognition and anomaly zzso A zzso is developed for automatic zzso profiling and online anomaly zzso any manual zzso of the training zzso The framework consists of the zzso zzso zzso A compact and effective zzso representation method is developed zzso discrete scene event zzso The similarity between zzso patterns are measured zzso zzso each pattern using a Dynamic zzso Network zzso zzso Natural grouping zzso patterns is discovered through a novel spectral zzso zzso with zzso selection and feature selection on the zzso of a zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model is constructed which is capable of zzso from zzso training set to accommodate variations in unseen normal zzso zzso zzso A zzso anomaly measure is introduced to detect abnormal zzso while normal zzso are zzso when sufficient visual evidence has become available based on an zzso zzso Test zzso zzso This ensures robust and reliable anomaly detection and zzso recognition at the shortest possible zzso The effectiveness and zzso of our zzso demonstrated through experiments using noisy and sparse zzso collected from both zzso outdoor surveillance zzso In particular, it is shown that a zzso model trained zzso zzso zzso is superior to those trained using the same but zzso zzso in zzso from an unseen zzso The experiments also suggest that our online zzso based zzso approach is advantageous over the commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ambiguities among different zzso classes observed zzso
