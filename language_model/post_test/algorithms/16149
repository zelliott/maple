We present a novel integrated zzso based framework zzso for 3-D zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data followed by source separation analysis using independent component analysis zzso in the zzso zzso We propose the idea of a 3-D zzso zzso zzso scheme where each volume in a zzso zzso data set is zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to obtain three different zzso representations of the same zzso The filtered intensity value of an arbitrary zzso is zzso as an expected value of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the three viewing zzso for each zzso This results in a robust set of zzso zzso zzso for each zzso Given the zzso nature of these zzso zzso zzso it is possible to obtain more accurate source estimates using zzso in the zzso zzso The contributions of this work can be realized as two zzso First, in the analysis module we combine a new 3-D zzso zzso approach with signal separation properties of zzso in the zzso zzso This step helps obtain an zzso component that zzso closely to the true underlying zzso which is zzso independent with respect to other zzso Second, we propose and describe two novel shape metrics for zzso comparisons between zzso regions obtained through different zzso We verified our method using simulated as well as real zzso data and compared our results against the conventional scheme zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show significant improvements based on two important features: zzso preservation of shape of the zzso region zzso zzso and zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso It was observed that the proposed framework was able to preserve the actual zzso shape in a consistent manner even for very high noise levels in addition to significant reduction in false positive zzso
