It has recently been discovered that guests combining a zzso core with zzso zzso bind zzso zzso in water with zzso zzso The present study uses the Mining zzso zzso to study the physics of these extraordinary associations and to zzso test a new series of zzso zzso designed to bind with similarly high zzso The calculations reproduce key experimental observations regarding the affinities of zzso guests with zzso and zzso and provide a coherent view of the roles of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of affinity in these zzso The newly designed series of compounds is based on a zzso core, which is similar in size and polarity to the zzso core of the existing zzso Mining zzso predicts that these new compounds will, like the zzso bind zzso with extremely high zzso
