Currently, there are no standard guidelines for recommending zzso of a zzso drug to a patient after a serious adverse drug reaction zzso zzso The decision on whether to zzso the patient is based on the experience of the zzso and is highly zzso Thus the aim of this study is to develop a decision support tool to assist clinicians in this decision making zzso 

The inclusion criteria for patients in this study are: zzso had chemotherapy at National Cancer Centre Singapore between 2004 to 2009, zzso suffered from serious zzso and zzso were zzso A total of 46 patients fulfilled the inclusion zzso A genetic zzso attribute selection method was used to identify clinical zzso for patients' zzso zzso A zzso zzso model was then developed using 35 patients and zzso validated using 11 zzso 

Eight patient attributes zzso zzso drug, zzso level, red blood cell level, zzso level, abnormal white blood cell level, abnormal alkaline zzso level and abnormal zzso zzso zzso were identified as clinical zzso for zzso status of zzso The zzso zzso model had an zzso of zzso and was found to be useful for assisting clinical decision making after clinicians had identified a group of patients for zzso A platform independent version and an online version of the model is available to facilitate independent validation of the zzso 

Due to the limited size of the validation set, a more extensive validation of the model is necessary before it can be adopted for routine clinical zzso Once zzso the model can be used to assist clinicians in deciding whether to zzso patients by determining if their initial assessment of zzso status of patients is zzso
