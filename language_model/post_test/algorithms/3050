This paper provides an investigation into some of the key practical issues for minimizing the cost of DNA zzso Previous studies focused on maximizing the utility of zzso by zzso individuals for zzso For logistical reasons, individuals may have to be zzso in groups rather than individually, and the best group to zzso is expected to differ from the zzso group chosen when individuals are zzso zzso In a zzso step, simulated populations and full knowledge of zzso were used to discover the best zzso to zzso The characteristics of these groups were then targeted in an zzso step, using normally available information for group formation in targeted zzso Contrasts were made among zzso zzso for: zzso individuals, with zzso between each zzso zzso individuals, with zzso occurring zzso and zzso groups, using group variables as zzso The results of this investigation allow the determination of the value of moving from individual to group zzso reveal the zzso attributes of individuals for group formation, and lead to methods to form groups for zzso The approach used has applications in reducing zzso costs in both experimental and commercial populations for both quantitative trait zzso zzso detection and zzso
