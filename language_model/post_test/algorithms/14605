With an increase in the understanding of the formation and treatment of cerebral zzso and an improvement in imaging technology, actual standardized measurement values for the cerebral arteries are zzso zzso the aim of this study was to provide a detailed assessment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso segment of the middle cerebral artery using computer zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso files from zzso of 40 male and 75 female individuals with a mean age of zzso years were analyzed using an interactive zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso segment was zzso zzso included the zzso internal diameter, volume, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso segment had a mean internal diameter of zzso zzso and was greater in zzso zzso asymmetry was identified in zzso of the individuals and was more common in zzso The mean length was zzso zzso and the left zzso segments were a little zzso The mean volume of the zzso segments was zzso zzso , and this was typically greater in men and on the left zzso The mean zzso and zzso for the zzso segment were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso segments are only slightly curved or straight in their zzso In addition, the longest vascular zzso segments are more deviated zzso and more zzso Such standardized data as presented zzso may be useful in the zzso evaluation of patients with zzso vascular pathology of the zzso zzso
