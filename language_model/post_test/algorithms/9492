zzso zzso of molecules oriented in the liquid zzso media provide information on the molecular structure and order zzso However, the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of strongly coupled spins is difficult and time zzso Such analysis is simplified if nearly accurate starting parameters are zzso One such zzso is the chemical shift which in the oriented media is very different from the zzso values due to zzso zzso In this study, we have explored the possibility of obtaining chemical shifts in the oriented phase to aid the analysis of the zzso A two zzso experiment in which zzso decoupling employed during the zzso period eliminates the zzso zzso zzso and retains only the chemical shifts has been zzso zzso on the zzso zzso demonstrate that the chemical shifts obtained by this procedure are nearly the same as the chemical shifts derived by zzso analysis of the one zzso spectrum of the zzso following the standard zzso The method has also been used to zzso the spectrum of zzso using the chemical shifts obtained from the proposed experiment as the starting zzso
