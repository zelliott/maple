There is substantial interest in implementing a zzso tool that allows the design of zzso to support the development of in zzso gene zzso Current protocols to make long synthetic DNA molecules rely on the in zzso assembly of a set of short zzso either by zzso chain reaction zzso or by assembly zzso zzso such zzso should represent both strands of the final DNA zzso They should be adjacent on the same strand and overlap the complementary zzso from the second strand to ensure good zzso during zzso This implies that the zzso properties of each zzso have to be consistent across the zzso Furthermore, any given zzso has to be totally specific to its target to avoid the creation of incorrectly assembled zzso We have developed zzso zzso a zzso tool that divides a long input DNA sequence into a set of adjacent zzso representing both DNA zzso The length of the zzso is zzso zzso to ensure both the specificity and the uniform melting temperatures necessary for in zzso gene zzso We have successfully designed and used a set of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso by using both zzso and assembly zzso
