During the course of their biological function, proteins undergo different types of structural zzso ranging from local to large-scale zzso zzso These changes are usually triggered by their interactions with zzso zzso or other zzso Because binding interactions occur at specific sites and involve only a small number of zzso a chain of cooperative interactions is necessary for the propagation of binding signals to zzso locations within the protein zzso This process requires an uneven structural distribution of protein stability and zzso as revealed by zzso zzso exchange experiments under native zzso The distribution of stabilizing interactions does not only provide the architectural foundation to the three-dimensional structure of a zzso but it also provides the required framework for functional zzso In this review, the statistical zzso linkage between protein stability, functional zzso and zzso binding is zzso
