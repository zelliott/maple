zzso tissue oxygen zzso zzso has shown promise as an early indicator of tissue zzso and as a risk zzso tool in various forms of zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if zzso would predict admission to an intensive zzso or progressive care unit in patients with early signs of zzso 

In this prospective zzso study, a rapid response team measured zzso levels in patients screening positive for zzso Using a zzso zzso model, the value of zzso as a predictor for zzso admission within 72 hours of the initial assessment was zzso 

The 31 zzso of 66 patients who required zzso admission within 72 hours of evaluation had a significantly lower zzso value zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso All patients with zzso less than zzso required zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso was associated with a zzso decrease in the odds of requiring zzso admission, and the area under the curve for zzso was zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Low zzso levels in patients screening positive for zzso are associated with an increased risk of zzso admission, but their reliability as a predictor is rather zzso An zzso below zzso might be an interesting zzso value for further zzso
