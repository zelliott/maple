We have calculated the electron density distribution of the zzso strain of zzso zzso by a maximum zzso zzso In the calculation we included native X-ray zzso zzso data extending to 3 A resolution in the zzso direction on 60 zzso that are resolved to 4 A in the equatorial direction, and lower resolution data from a single zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The electron density map indicates that the zzso protein zzso is a single, gently curved stretch of zzso with its axis at an angle of about 20 degrees to the axis of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso around the zzso axis by about zzso turn, and decreases from about 27 A radius to about 13 A radius in the zzso as the zzso acid sequence of the zzso runs from the N zzso to the C zzso zzso zzso zzso are about 10 A apart along their zzso and the axis of each zzso makes an unexpected negative angle with its nearest zzso in the zzso To confirm the zzso of the maximum zzso zzso we have varied the constraints on the zzso All variations result in either a map that is close to the original map or a map that cannot be interpreted in terms of secondary zzso we find only one map that makes structural zzso
