To evaluate image quality of zzso row zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso row zzso CT from zzso images and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients with diffuse lung diseases were scanned using both zzso row zzso CT zzso and zzso and zzso row zzso zzso Three blinded observers evaluated dislocation and zzso of normal structures on 3 zzso patterns zzso scan with zzso zzso scan with zzso and zzso zzso using a 3-point scale from 1 zzso zzso to 3 (no zzso They also evaluated zzso images of 2 scan patterns zzso with zzso and zzso using a zzso scale from 1 zzso to 5 zzso zzso analyses were performed with a post hoc test, zzso signed rank test, zzso U test, or the Kendall W zzso 

The zzso scans with the zzso zzso had significantly lower quality scores than the zzso scans with the zzso zzso and the zzso scans zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso scans had significantly lower quality scores than the zzso scans with zzso for zzso on the zzso window setting with zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences concerning total image quality of zzso images between the zzso scans with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

The overall image quality of zzso scans with the zzso zzso was almost comparable to that of the zzso scans on the lung window setting, but density zzso with zzso scans was inferior to that of the zzso scans with the zzso zzso on the zzso window setting with zzso
