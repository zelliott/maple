Recently, zzso learning has been widely exploited in pattern recognition, data analysis, and machine zzso This paper presents a novel zzso called zzso zzso learning zzso based on the assumption that the input zzso data lie on an zzso zzso zzso zzso The main idea is to formulate the zzso reduction problem as a classical problem in zzso zzso zzso how to construct coordinate charts for a given zzso zzso We implement the zzso normal coordinate chart, which has been the most widely used in zzso zzso for a set of zzso data zzso First, two input parameters (the neighborhood size k and the intrinsic dimension zzso are estimated based on an efficient zzso reconstruction of the underlying zzso Then, the normal coordinates are zzso to map the input zzso data into a zzso zzso zzso on synthetic data as well as real world images demonstrate that our zzso can learn intrinsic geometric structures of the data, preserve zzso zzso zzso and yield regular zzso
