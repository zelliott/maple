The developed zzso reported zzso referred to as zzso addresses the need to rapidly identify zzso peak locations in gas zzso zzso gas zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso data is such that at each point in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a complete mass spectrum is zzso zzso zzso this zzso structure to search for the location of a given spectrum of interest in a complete data set, or in a user selected portion of the complete data zzso The zzso returns a zzso plot indicating the location of zzso with the most similar mass zzso to the zzso of zzso A spectrum from the region indicated is then subjected to an automated mass spectral search to give immediate feedback on the accuracy of the zzso This zzso was investigated with a zzso zzso zzso human infant urine sample that contained organic acid zzso One hundred percent of 12 selected zzso zzso organic acid zzso in human infant urine were located with the zzso zzso A typical automated zzso analysis takes 30 s on a zzso zzso PC with zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso was located by zzso but also exhibited overlap with other organic zzso The presence of zzso acid zzso was confirmed by subjecting the appropriate zzso zzso zzso region to zzso signal zzso by zzso to yield pure component information suitable for subsequent zzso
