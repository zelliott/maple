In this paper a new zzso response function zzso is designed and proposed for zzso in the zzso zzso The function capability to represent the overall quality of a zzso obtained zzso was compared to the other two objective functions and proved to give more accurate and reliable zzso The new zzso has improved concept of separation and time term zzso It reflects all important defects of the zzso such as the appearance of zzso or overlapping zzso and prolonged zzso time and allows the appropriate weighting of each of zzso The zzso separation of zzso and its four zzso was evaluated through the central composite design experimental plan choosing the new zzso to be the only output of the zzso The function demonstrated the ability to judge the impact of the complex interactions of the selected zzso parameters zzso content in the mobile phase, sodium zzso zzso concentration in the water phase, pH of the mobile phase and column zzso on the mixture behavior and led to the determination of the optimal separation zzso The newly developed zzso proved to have the advanced performances and it presents the important step forward in the zzso of the zzso zzso
