Multiple particle tracking zzso has seen numerous applications in zzso imaging studies of zzso zzso zzso correspondence between particles in a sequence of frames with high particle density, particles merging and zzso particles entering and zzso the frame, temporary particle zzso and an zzso detection zzso is the most challenging part of zzso Here we propose a tracking method based on zzso assignment to address these zzso We combine an zzso Multiple Model zzso zzso zzso assignment, particle zzso zzso and zzso event detection in a single software analysis zzso The main advantage of a zzso assignment is that both spatial and zzso information can be used by using several later frames as zzso The zzso zzso which is used to maintain and predict the state of each track, contains several models which zzso to different types of biologically realistic zzso It works especially well with zzso assignment, because there tends to be a higher probability of correct particle association over zzso First the method generates many zzso zzso zzso hypotheses and zzso hypotheses within the framework of a sliding window over the frames of the image zzso Then it builds a zzso assignment problem zzso zzso The particle is tracked with zzso and merging and splitting events are then detected using the zzso zzso The tracking method is validated on both simulated tracks and zzso image zzso The results of these experiments show that the method is more accurate and robust than other zzso from detected zzso methods in dense particle zzso
