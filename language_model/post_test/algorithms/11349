zzso reconstruction has a wide spectrum of proven advantages in the field of conventional X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we report on an zzso zzso reconstruction technique for zzso differential zzso CT zzso Due to the differential nature of zzso projections, a differential operator and a smoothing operator are added to the zzso zzso compared to the one commonly used for zzso CT zzso This work comprises a zzso study of the zzso and its experimental zzso using a zzso measured at a zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso is easy to implement and allows for the extension to various zzso possibilities, we expect a significant impact of the method for improving future medical and industrial zzso zzso
