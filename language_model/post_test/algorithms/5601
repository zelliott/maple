zzso zzso allows three-dimensional zzso of cellular landscapes in molecular zzso zzso is a paramount stage for the interpretation of the reconstructed zzso Although several zzso approaches have been proposed, none has prevailed as a generic method and thus zzso through manual zzso is still a common zzso In this work we introduce a zzso method targeted at zzso which define the natural limits of compartments within biological zzso Our method is based on local differential structure and on a zzso membrane zzso First, it zzso information through zzso and finds potential zzso points at a local zzso Then, the structural information is integrated at a global scale to yield the zzso zzso We show and validate the performance of the zzso on a number of zzso under different experimental zzso
