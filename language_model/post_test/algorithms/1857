zzso image reconstruction of large cellular volumes by electron zzso zzso at high zzso 5 zzso resolution can now routinely resolve zzso and zzso membrane structures, protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, current image analysis methods for identifying in zzso zzso structures within the crowded zzso zzso landscape of a cell remain zzso zzso and prone to zzso and/or zzso This paper demonstrates the development and application of a zzso zzso zzso of the bilateral zzso zzso zzso for the rapid and accurate zzso of cellular zzso The performance of the zzso zzso filter has been tested on a range of synthetic and real biological data sets and validated against current leading zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The performance of the zzso zzso filter was found to be comparable to or better than that of both the zzso zzso and zzso filters while offering the significant advantage that it requires no zzso input or zzso Edge zzso as little as 2 zzso are zzso detected with signal intensity and zzso scale values as low as zzso above the mean of the background zzso The zzso zzso thus provides an efficient method for the automated zzso of complex cellular structures across multiple scales for further downstream processing, such as cellular zzso and zzso zzso and provides a valuable tool for the accurate and zzso identification and zzso of zzso structural complexity at the zzso level, as well as for mapping the spatial and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso within cellular zzso
