The appropriate sequencing of chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of advanced zzso cancer has not yet been zzso We sought to evaluate the outcome and adverse effects in patients with advanced stage zzso cancer treated with zzso chemotherapy and radiation to determine whether there was an advantage to a particular sequencing zzso 

A zzso retrospective analysis of patients with surgical stages III and IV zzso cancer from 1993 to 2007 was zzso zzso criteria were comprehensive staging procedure including zzso bilateral zzso zzso selective zzso zzso and treatment with zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso in zzso of adverse events were tested with zzso zzso test for comparing zzso zzso and zzso rates were calculated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were estimated from zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso 

One hundred and nine patients with advanced stage zzso cancer were identified who received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy followed by radiation and then further chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso radiation followed by chemotherapy zzso and zzso zzso chemotherapy followed by radiation zzso The median age was 62 years zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso underwent optimal zzso There was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects due to either chemotherapy zzso or zzso zzso dose modifications zzso or delays zzso between the various sequencing zzso There was a significant difference between zzso treatment groups for both zzso zzso rank zzso and zzso zzso rank zzso with those receiving zzso having a superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso After adjusting for stage, age, grade, race, zzso and zzso status the zzso zzso for therapy was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso compared to zzso zzso When the analysis was restricted to zzso zzso patients, those who were treated with zzso were at higher risk for disease progression zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and death zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso than patients who received sequential zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with improved survival in women with advanced stage disease compared to other sequencing zzso with a similar adverse effect zzso Future clinical trials are needed to zzso evaluate appropriate sequencing and types of zzso chemotherapy and zzso for the treatment of advanced stage zzso zzso
