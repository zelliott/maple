Bridge populations can play a central role in the spread of human zzso virus zzso by providing transmission links between higher and lower prevalence zzso While social network methods are well suited to the study of bridge zzso analyses tend to focus on zzso zzso risk between drug and/or sex zzso and ignore bridges between distinct zzso This study takes initial steps toward moving the analysis of sexual network linkages beyond individual and risk group levels to a community level in which Chicago's 77 community areas are examined as zzso for the purpose of identifying potential bridging zzso Of particular interest are zzso bridging zzso that is, areas with above-average levels of sexual ties with other areas but whose zzso AIDS prevalence may hide their potential importance for zzso zzso Data for this analysis came from the first wave of recruiting at the Chicago Sexual Acquisition and zzso of zzso Cooperative zzso Program zzso Between August 2005 through October 2006, zzso sampling was used to recruit users of heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, men who have sex with men regardless of drug use, the sex partners of these two groups, and sex partners of the sex zzso In this zzso study of the sexual transmission of zzso participants completed a zzso zzso self-administered interview, which included questions about the geographic locations of sexual contacts with up to six recent zzso zzso scores for each area were determined using a zzso representing Chicago's 77 community areas and were assessed using two zzso zzso ties and flow zzso zzso measures and acquired zzso syndrome zzso case prevalence rates were plotted for each community area on charts representing four conditions: zzso bridging and AIDS zzso zzso bridging and above-average AIDS zzso above-average bridging and AIDS zzso and above-average bridging and zzso AIDS prevalence zzso zzso The majority of the zzso study participants were male zzso African American zzso and very poor, and the median age was 44 zzso Most zzso were sexually active, and 725 provided zzso geographic information regarding zzso sexual partnerships that involved 57 Chicago community zzso Eight community areas met or came close to meeting the definition of hidden zzso Six areas were near the city's zzso and all eight areas likely had high inflows or outflows of low-income persons displaced by zzso The results suggest that further research on this method is warranted, and we propose a means for public health officials in other cities to duplicate the zzso
