Independent component analysis zzso has the potential of determining automatically the zzso signals which make up MR zzso However, the reliability with which this is accomplished and the optimal approach for investigating in zzso MRS have not been zzso Furthermore, the properties of zzso in brain zzso MRS with respect to zzso size and data quality have not been systematically zzso The two common techniques for applying zzso blind source separation zzso and feature extraction zzso were examined in this study using simulated data and the findings confirmed on patient zzso Short echo time zzso 30 zzso low and high field zzso and 3 zzso in zzso brain zzso MR zzso of childhood zzso zzso and zzso were generated by using a quantum mechanical simulator with ten zzso and zzso zzso Patient data zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso were acquired from children with brain zzso zzso of simulated data shows that individual zzso components can be extracted from a set of MRS zzso The zzso method generates independent components with a closer correlation to the original zzso and zzso components than the zzso method when the number of zzso in the zzso is zzso The experiments also show that stable results are achieved with 300 MRS at an zzso equal to zzso The zzso method is relatively insensitive to different ranges of full zzso at half maximum zzso (from 0 to 3 zzso whereas the zzso method degrades on increasing the range of zzso The peak frequency variations do not affect the results within the range of zzso zzso for the zzso method, and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso When the methods were applied to the patient zzso results consistent with the zzso experiments were zzso
