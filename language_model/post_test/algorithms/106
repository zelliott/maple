We present a variable zzso grating zzso for soft zzso that covers the zzso energy range between 130 and 650 zzso The optical design is based on the zzso principle and tailored to zzso studies of zzso biological zzso The zzso is able to record the entire spectral range in one shot, zzso without any mechanical motion, at a resolving power of 1200 or zzso Despite its zzso design, such a resolving power can be achieved for a source spot as large as (30 zzso zzso zzso which is important for keeping beam damage effects in zzso samples zzso The high zzso efficiency allows recording of comprehensive two-dimensional resonant zzso soft zzso scattering zzso maps with good statistics within several zzso This is zzso demonstrated for a zzso map of highly oriented zzso zzso which was taken within 10 zzso
