zzso zzso is the leading cause of mortality in type 1 zzso Thus study of zzso zzso and function during early stages of diabetes using modern zzso methods is of critical zzso zzso using zzso zzso we determined metric zzso volumes and zzso with calcium zzso in isolated zzso zzso at one week after induction of diabetes in zzso zzso volume analysis from zzso zzso scans was performed using an automated zzso detection zzso that took the actual shape of the zzso into zzso We showed a significant reduction in zzso volume in diabetic zzso We also showed a significant reduction in length and zzso but not in thickness of the zzso which suggests zzso reorganization of the structure of the heart tissue during short-term zzso From a functional point of view, we observed a significant decrease in cell zzso at a stimulation frequency of zzso zzso This was accompanied by a decrease in calcium transient zzso Together, these data suggest that impaired calcium handling is one of the factors that contributes to the observed decrease in zzso zzso during early stages of zzso diabetes in zzso
