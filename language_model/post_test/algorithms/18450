A new modification of evolutionary approach to sequence design of zzso has been zzso A model of zzso evolution of a zzso ( zzso zzso sequence has been studied by means of a zzso zzso Carlo zzso The conditions for accepting a change in the primary sequence depend on the spatial zzso of zzso zzso This leads to a zzso between sequence and zzso and to formation of zzso zzso and primary sequences (for some values of parameters of the zzso independently of initial sequence and/or zzso zzso theory describing these computer simulation observations is zzso
