An equilibrium isotope exchange technique was used to measure in an zzso system the zzso influence of zzso factor zzso 1 beta gamma on the zzso of zzso from the complex of zzso factor 1 zzso zzso in the presence of an excess of free zzso The kinetic data demonstrate that, in zzso to zzso zzso of zzso occurs via the formation of a transient zzso complex of zzso zzso beta zzso The rate zzso for the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and from the zzso complex zzso zzso beta gamma were found to be zzso zzso zzso and greater than or equal to zzso zzso zzso The equilibrium association zzso of zzso to zzso zzso beta gamma and of zzso beta gamma to zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Judged from the known zzso rate in zzso and kinetic zzso of zzso exchange, it was estimated that the recycling of zzso alpha may be a zzso step in zzso zzso As a model for zzso exchange, the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta gamma complex was also zzso It was observed that both an increase of the level of zzso and of temperature favored the zzso of this complex, thereby enabling zzso beta gamma to zzso as a zzso This behavior would explain the frequent occurrence of a heavy form of zzso factor 1 in extracts of the zzso zzso
