zzso doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were administered zzso to mice that were then tested for zzso in the 55 degrees C tail immersion zzso The zzso relations of each compound were used in calculations that permitted the construction of a three-dimensional plot of the expected additive effect zzso zzso against the zzso domain of dose pairs representing combinations administered zzso This additive response surface became the reference surface for viewing the actual effects produced by three different zzso combinations of the drugs that were used in our zzso Each combination produced effects significantly greater than indicated by the additive surface, thereby illustrating marked zzso and a method for zzso the zzso This zzso measured by the value of the interaction index zzso was found to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso the actual response surface could not be described by a single value of the index zzso Furthermore, we found that application of the common method of zzso gave estimates of the index that agreed well with those obtained from the more extensive surface zzso These results confirm earlier studies, which found zzso for these drugs while also providing surface views of zzso and zzso that form the basis of zzso zzso
