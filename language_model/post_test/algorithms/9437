To develop and evaluate an zzso for the automatic screening of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso recordings were recorded in zzso zzso zzso zzso of at least 60 zzso were detected based on their characteristic pattern in the zzso zzso an increase of its lower zzso The zzso was trained using five zzso recordings zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The evaluation of the zzso was based on eight different zzso recordings zzso by zzso zzso set observer 1) and an independent zzso zzso zzso set observer zzso 

The zzso agreement between zzso and 2 in interpreting zzso from the zzso recordings was high zzso zzso zzso After dividing the eight zzso recordings into zzso segments and zzso in zzso or zzso the zzso correlation zzso showed high correlations of the zzso with both test sets zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso showed in five recordings a sensitivity zzso or zzso zzso and approximately 1 false positive zzso per zzso However, the zzso showed in three recordings much lower zzso one recording showed zzso of extremely high zzso that were incorrectly classified by the zzso as zzso and two recordings suffered from low zzso zzso 

This study shows the feasibility of automatic zzso screening based on zzso signals and may facilitate in the zzso interpretation of zzso signals in clinical zzso
