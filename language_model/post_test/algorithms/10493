Most automatic spike detection systems in the scalp electroencephalogram zzso focused on the characteristics of zzso However, the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso have not been fully zzso In this paper, we proposed a system that contains a series of zzso to eliminate zzso and a template method to confirm zzso The system used large area context available on 49 channels from two common zzso The impact of zzso after spikes was taken into consideration, as well as the information from single channel, zzso and whole zzso Two types of zzso were identified in this zzso The ones from typical artifacts were identified by analysis of background zzso activities, and the ones from other zzso activities were declared by spatial and zzso characteristics of spike zzso Finally, a zzso template method was used to assess the performance of the proposed zzso The system was evaluated using 17 routine zzso zzso Spike activities were observed in six of zzso zzso zzso templates were extracted from four recordings containing frequent zzso The least selectivity was zzso and the most false positive rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso for elimination of zzso are also suitable for other zzso to enhance performance since most zzso can be identified while few true spikes are zzso
