zzso spontaneous and evoked zzso zzso currents were studied using the zzso zzso technique on zzso connected cultured zzso zzso at a holding potential of zzso zzso All experiments were done in zzso solution to exclude an action potential zzso zzso miniature zzso zzso currents were observed in zzso zzso The distribution of miniature zzso zzso currents was skewed to larger current zzso and could be fitted reliably by one zzso with the mean at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurring zzso spontaneous zzso zzso currents were recorded in zzso solution zzso 2 zzso The average zzso of spontaneously occurring currents depended on membrane potential and reversed at zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of spontaneous zzso zzso currents had one peak clearly zzso with the mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents arose in responses to gradual zzso of neurotransmitter release by direct zzso electrical stimulation of a single zzso zzso by short zzso zzso The zzso relation of the averaged zzso of evoked zzso zzso currents was linear and reversed at potential predicted by the zzso equation for corresponding zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso spontaneous and evoked zzso zzso currents was fitted by a sum of two zzso and their zzso were the same in the range of standard zzso The zzso zzso zzso currents zzso with regard to the discrete zzso values of their peak zzso in all the investigated zzso from a measurable minimum of about 8 zzso to 200 zzso The evoked zzso zzso currents were assumed as zzso of statistically independent zzso zzso Fitting zzso zzso of evoked zzso zzso currents with several zzso zzso resulted in zzso that were zzso with the mean space of 20 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 10), which was assumed as one quantum zzso zzso to construct the zzso zzso A possibility of simultaneous zzso release at single zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso was zzso
