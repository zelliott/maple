This research work is aimed toward the development of a zzso trainer for colon cancer zzso It enables the surgeons to zzso view and manipulate the concerned virtual zzso as during a real zzso First, we present a method for zzso the small zzso and the zzso (the tissue that connects it to the main zzso in zzso thus enabling user interaction through virtual surgical tools during the zzso We present a zzso approach for fast collision detection in highly zzso zzso zzso A simple and efficient response to zzso is also introduced in order to reduce the overall animation zzso Second, we describe a new method based on generalized zzso for fast rendering of the zzso An efficient zzso detection method, along with an zzso sampling algorithm, is zzso This approach, while providing improved zzso without the classical zzso problem, also allows for zzso rendering thanks to the new zzso zzso feature available in recent zzso The rendering zzso is also designed to ensure a guaranteed frame zzso Finally, we present the quantitative results of the simulations and describe the qualitative feedback obtained from the zzso
