One major unresolved issue in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification and zzso of gene regulatory zzso Several methods have been proposed for identifying gene regulatory networks, but these methods predominantly focus on the use of multiple zzso comparisons to identify the network zzso In this article, we describe a method for analyzing gene expression data to determine a regulatory structure consistent with an observed set of expression zzso Unlike other methods this method goes beyond zzso evaluations by using zzso statistical methods to obtain the network that is most consistent with the complete data zzso The proposed zzso performs accurately for zzso networks with most errors being minor additions of zzso However, the analysis also indicates that sample sizes may need to be increased to uniquely identify even zzso zzso The method is used to evaluate interactions between genes in the zzso signaling zzso in zzso coli using gene expression data where each gene in the network is zzso using plasmids zzso
