zzso heart rate zzso zzso is widely used to assess zzso nervous system zzso It requires accurate measurement of the zzso between successive zzso This can be achieved from recording the zzso zzso which is zzso and widely zzso However, zzso problems inherent in recording and analyzing zzso traces have motivated a search for alternative means of measuring the zzso between successive zzso Recording blood zzso zzso zzso is also convenient, zzso and widely available, and has been suggested as an effective alternative to zzso to derive zzso Moreover, it has been claimed that the pulse zzso produced by zzso may be more zzso than zzso intervals measured from the by zzso especially for ambulatory zzso We have therefore compared zzso with zzso recordings to measure zzso applying the same signal analysis techniques to zzso and zzso recordings made zzso zzso of 5 zzso recording epochs demonstrated a very high degree of zzso in zzso frequency zzso and zzso analysis, between zzso measures derived from the zzso and zzso However, we found that the zzso signal is especially vulnerable to motion artifacts when compared to the zzso preventing any zzso analysis at all in a significant minority of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that even though zzso provides accurate zzso intervals to measure heart rate zzso under ideal conditions, it is less reliable due to its vulnerability to motion zzso Therefore it is unlikely to prove a practical alternative to the zzso in ambulatory recordings or recordings made during other zzso
