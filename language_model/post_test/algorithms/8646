Edwin zzso zzso demonstrations zzso 1977, 1983, zzso are striking examples that the perceived zzso of objects are largely independent of the zzso of the light incident upon zzso Attempts to implement this independence in artificial vision systems have renewed interest in zzso constancy and contrast, and the explanation of these phenomena in the zzso zzso We use zzso matches to demonstrate that departures from zzso zzso are large and that it is possible to obtain the same zzso shifts when the complex zzso pattern is replaced by a homogeneous zzso field surrounding a test zzso A given patch has the same zzso when surrounded by the zzso as when set in a zzso background, provided that the zzso represents the zzso weighted average of the zzso Neither the zzso shifts nor the zzso of this neutral surround are correctly predicted by the zzso zzso The phenomenon of partial cancellation of physical zzso shifts with changes of zzso thus reduces to one of simultaneous contrast and adaptation where a zzso and zzso average over a zzso pattern is the same as for a zzso zzso zzso with simultaneous contrast demonstrate that spatial weighting factors need to be applied in zzso of the effect of the separate areas of a complex zzso zzso
