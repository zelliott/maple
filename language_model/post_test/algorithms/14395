zzso or loosening of zzso screws may impair fracture fixation or bone healing in locked zzso of zzso zzso zzso strength and bone holding power, two important design objectives of zzso screws, may conflict with each zzso The present study used zzso zzso with a genetic zzso to investigate the optimal designs with respect to these two zzso zzso finite element models for analyzing zzso strength and bone holding power of zzso screws were created zzso Through use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso two objective functions were developed by zzso zzso zzso Then, the zzso solutions between the two objectives known as zzso zzso were explored by a zzso zzso approach under geometric zzso The objective functions, reliably reflecting the finite element results, were valid for zzso zzso The zzso fronts of the screws with zzso and zzso outer diameters were zzso The zzso region of the zzso front, characterized by the fact that a small improvement in either objective will cause a large deterioration in the other objective, might be the favored choice of optimal zzso The commercially available zzso screws compared with the zzso zzso were found to be dominated designs and could be zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso with a genetic zzso was useful for zzso of zzso screw design with many variables and conflicting zzso Choosing an optimal design requires a thorough knowledge of the inherent zzso This method could reduce the time, cost, and labor associated with the screw development zzso
