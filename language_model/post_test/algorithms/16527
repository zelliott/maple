zzso the engineered zzso especially carbon zzso zzso have received considerable attention for application in tissue engineering zzso zzso are considered promising on behalf of their zzso properties, yet such zzso also have been associated with potentially hazardous effects on human zzso To gain insight into the toxicity aspects of zzso in zzso the present study presents a systematic review of zzso After screening of literature through defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and subsequent data zzso it can be concluded that pulmonary administered zzso have the capacity to induce toxicity in the lung zzso However, conclusions for other zzso or on systemic zzso are yet zzso In addition, the zzso potential of zzso is also still zzso because zzso results are zzso zzso factors, such as material zzso and associated distribution and zzso patterns influence the toxic potential of zzso Similarly, environmental factors such as the exposure route, zzso zzso pathological infections, or air zzso exposure are zzso Despite the many reports published zzso more studies will be required to gain full understanding of the toxic potential of zzso and especially the underlying zzso For this end, development of standardized protocols and reliable zzso techniques will form zzso
