In many popular texture analysis methods, second or higher order statistics on the relation between zzso gray level values are stored in zzso A high zzso zzso of zzso zzso features is then extracted from these zzso zzso a few consistently valuable features is important, as it improves zzso reliability and enhances our understanding of the phenomena that we are zzso Whatever sophisticated selection zzso we use, there is a risk of selecting purely coincidental zzso feature sets, especially if we have a large number of features to choose from and the available data set is zzso In a unified approach to statistical texture feature zzso we have used class distance and class difference zzso to obtain low zzso zzso feature zzso for texture zzso We have applied this approach to four relevant texture analysis zzso The new zzso features outperformed the classical features when applied to the most difficult set of 45 zzso texture zzso Class distance and difference zzso also clearly illustrated the difference in texture between cell nucleus images from two different zzso classes of early zzso zzso For each of the texture analysis methods, one zzso feature contained most of the zzso power of the zzso
