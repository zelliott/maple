In order to reduce the motion artifact caused by the patient in cerebral zzso images, a zzso registration method based on stretching transformation is presented in this zzso Unlike other traditional methods, it does not need zzso zzso which is rather time-consuming and even produce zzso zzso gray zzso By this method, the mask image is zzso to generate appropriate control zzso The Energy of zzso of zzso criterion is adopted as similarity zzso and the Powell zzso is zzso for zzso A forward stretching transformation is used to complete motion zzso and an inverse stretching transformation to generate target image by zzso mapping zzso This method is effective to maintain the zzso relationships of the gray value before and after the image zzso The mask image remains clear and accurate zzso and the quality of the zzso image after the registration is zzso This method can provide support for clinical treatment and diagnosis of cerebral zzso
