There is much controversy about the correlation between the degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical aggressiveness of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether partial volume corrected zzso zzso based on count recovery zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the clinical aggressiveness of NHL and improves diagnostic zzso 

zzso patients with NHL underwent zzso scans zzso aggressive zzso and 16 zzso zzso Count recovery curve was obtained using zzso 2001 body zzso zzso protocol and zzso parameters in the phantom study were the same as those in a clinical scan except for zzso zzso Relative recovery zzso zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso count of each hot zzso B, maximum zzso count of greatest zzso zzso volume corrected maximum count of standardized zzso value zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum count of zzso Three parameters zzso zzso and zzso between aggressive and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso differences were shown in all parameters between aggressive and zzso zzso Means zzso zzso of zzso zzso and size was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When an zzso of zzso was the zzso for aggressive zzso the zzso zzso analysis correctly identified 21 of 26 aggressive zzso zzso and specificity were zzso each, and the positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso When a zzso of zzso was the zzso the zzso analysis revealed zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and positive and negative zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso At a zzso for aggressive NHL of a size of 27 zzso the zzso analysis revealed 50% sensitivity, zzso zzso and positive and negative zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso The comparison of area under the curve in zzso analyses indicated that zzso showed the greatest diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso zzso zzso and size zzso 

zzso accuracy of zzso was inferior to that of zzso These results suggest that zzso which contains information on both size and zzso density, provides better differentiation between aggressive and zzso zzso than zzso
