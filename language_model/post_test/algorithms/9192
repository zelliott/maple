zzso images reconstructed from a small number of projections suffer from streak artifacts that are seen as noise, particularly in the spectral zzso zzso in projection space can reduce artifacts in the reconstructed zzso The reduction of background artifacts improves zzso zzso In this work, we compared the performances of angular zzso implemented using zzso cubic zzso and zzso zzso Line zzso maps were extracted from zzso zzso images of zzso using spectral fitting to evaluate each zzso method and its zzso to zzso zzso from experiment and simulation showed that the cubic zzso angular zzso was preferable to either zzso or linear zzso zzso
