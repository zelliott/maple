The present study has for the first time demonstrated the isolation of peptides from human plasma by zzso extraction zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, and zzso 3 migrated from 500 zzso of diluted zzso through a thin layer of zzso and zzso zzso zzso immobilized as a supported liquid membrane zzso in the pores of a porous hollow zzso and into a 25 zzso zzso zzso solution present inside the zzso of the zzso The driving force for the extraction was a 15 V potential difference applied across the zzso After only 10 zzso of zzso the peptides were isolated from diluted plasma zzso 3) with extraction zzso between 25 and zzso After zzso the extraction system was evaluated using spiked plasma samples of zzso zzso The evaluation was performed by liquid zzso zzso mass zzso showing zzso of zzso 2 in the range zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrate the possibility of zzso zzso peptides from plasma in only 10 zzso using zzso zzso The experimental findings are therefore promising with regard to future zzso zzso
