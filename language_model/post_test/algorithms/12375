zzso landmark zzso and anatomical structure tracing on zzso are two important ways to obtain the zzso zzso In order to zzso them in zzso a zzso approach is proposed to locate 262 zzso feature points, including 90 landmarks and zzso auxiliary zzso In model training, 12 landmarks are selected as reference points and used to divide every training shape to 10 regions according to the anatomical knowledge; principle components analysis is employed to characterize the region shape variations and the statistical zzso profile of every feature zzso zzso feature points on an input image is a zzso zzso First, we identify the reference landmarks by image processing and pattern matching techniques, so that the shape partition is performed on the input zzso Then, for each region, its feature points are located by a modified active shape zzso All zzso anatomical structures can be traced out by connecting the located points with subdivision zzso according to the prior zzso Users are permitted to modify the results zzso in many different zzso Experimental results show the advantage and reliability of the proposed zzso
