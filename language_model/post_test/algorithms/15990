The cone signal reaches the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell via several parallel circuits zzso cell types zzso zzso and zzso These circuits might convey different regions of the zzso zzso zzso To test this, I presented a step of light that zzso a transient zzso followed by a sustained zzso The contribution of bipolar cells to these response components was isolated by blocking action zzso with zzso and by blocking zzso synaptic zzso with zzso and zzso zzso fluctuation analysis of the sustained zzso gave the rate of zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso for small central cells and approximately 45,000 zzso zzso for large peripheral zzso zzso these rates for the vastly different numbers of bipolar zzso zzso per small cell vs 2000 per large zzso zzso rate was constant across the zzso approximately 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso fluctuation analysis gave the mean zzso zzso zzso approximately 240 zzso for the transient zzso and 30 zzso for the sustained zzso The zzso bipolar cell is known from noise analysis of the zzso zzso cell to have a zzso sustained release of only approximately two zzso zzso zzso This implies that the other bipolar types zzso and zzso contribute many more zzso to the sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso Type zzso probably contributes large zzso to the transient zzso Thus, bipolar cell types zzso and zzso apparently constitute parallel circuits that convey, respectively, high and low zzso
