At the current stage, a large number of single zzso zzso zzso have been deployed in searching for genes underlying complex zzso A powerful method is desirable for efficient analysis of zzso zzso Recently, a novel method for multiple zzso association test using a combination of zzso association zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso However, the power of this test has not been systematically zzso In this study, we conducted a simulation study to further evaluate the statistical power of the new zzso as well as of the influence of the zzso on its zzso The simulation examined the scenarios of multiple disease zzso among a candidate pool, assuming different parameters including zzso zzso and risk ratios, dominant, zzso and zzso genetic models, and the existence of zzso interactions and linkage zzso zzso We also evaluated the performance of this test in capturing real disease associated zzso when a significant global P value is zzso Our results suggest that this new procedure is more powerful than conventional zzso analyses with correction of multiple zzso However, inclusion of zzso reduces the power under most zzso We applied the novel association test procedure to a zzso study of zzso delivery zzso examining the effects of 96 candidate gene zzso zzso and detected a global P value of zzso by using zzso zzso as zzso statistics in the zzso In the following single point analysis, zzso on zzso zzso zzso Factor 5, and zzso genes were identified as possible risk factors in zzso
