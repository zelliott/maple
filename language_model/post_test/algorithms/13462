The inverse problem in the diffuse optical zzso is known to be zzso zzso and sometimes zzso requiring zzso to obtain meaningful results, with zzso zzso being the most popular zzso The choice of this zzso zzso dictates the reconstructed optical image quality and is typically chosen zzso or based on prior zzso An automated method for optimal selection of zzso zzso that is based on zzso minimal residual method zzso is proposed and is compared with the traditional generalized zzso zzso The results obtained using zzso and gelatin phantom data indicate that the zzso method is capable of providing the optimal zzso zzso
