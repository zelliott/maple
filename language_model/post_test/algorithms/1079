zzso zzso ensembles similar to those of purple bacteria zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso were advanced for the limiting values of zzso lifetime and quantum yield of zzso zzso in these zzso provided all reaction centers are in an active zzso It was demonstrated by mathematical modeling that these limiting values strictly depend on three parameters of molecular zzso the numbers of zzso molecules per reaction center, the values of rate zzso for zzso zzso in reaction centers, and zzso wasteful zzso in all zzso The zzso lifetime and quantum yield were proved to approach their limiting values as the rate zzso of zzso zzso migration zzso The closeness of experimental values for two above mentioned functions to their calculated limiting values proves the zzso type of the zzso unit investigated and a high efficiency of zzso zzso in its reaction zzso
