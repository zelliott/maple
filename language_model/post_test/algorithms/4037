zzso and specific interactions between proteins bound to the same DNA zzso can be dependent on the length of the DNA zzso that connects zzso zzso of the strength of this DNA zzso effect has been largely confined to short zzso between sites, and it is not clear how it contributes to long-range DNA looping zzso such as occur over zzso of tens to hundreds of zzso pairs in zzso Here, gene regulation experiments using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso combined with mathematical zzso were used to zzso DNA zzso inside zzso coli cells over the 250- to zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso loop DNA in distinct ways, zzso of the zzso effect were very similar for both zzso zzso strength decreased with increasing zzso but even at zzso to zzso zzso was able to increase contact probability zzso to zzso and drive efficient zzso zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso was measured for the same zzso zzso zzso using zzso particle motion, a single zzso technique, and was zzso to zzso weaker than in zzso over this zzso Thus, the enhancement of looping seen previously in zzso at zzso below 500 zzso extends to large zzso underlining the need to understand how in zzso factors aid DNA zzso Our analysis also suggests how efficient and specific looping could be achieved over very long DNA zzso such as what occurs between enhancers and promoters in zzso zzso
