This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of automated breast volume scanner zzso against handheld ultrasound in detecting and diagnosing breast zzso 

Eighty-one patients were subjected to both automated breast volume scanner and handheld ultrasound examination in the zzso zzso The number of zzso detected and the average scanning time (both zzso and zzso for each device were zzso The diagnostic zzso sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each zzso The maximum diameters of the zzso based on handheld ultrasound and zzso were compared with the final pathological zzso 

Of the 81 patients, both automated breast volume scanner and handheld ultrasound detected 95 breast zzso Compared with the pathological diagnosis in 35 zzso both zzso and handheld ultrasound exhibited high sensitivity (both zzso and high specificity zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso had a higher diagnostic accuracy zzso than handheld ultrasound zzso for breast zzso More importantly, zzso was capable of displaying the zzso phenomenon in zzso zzso All the invasive zzso zzso (12 zzso presented the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso (3 zzso and benign zzso did not display such zzso Thus, zzso phenomenon had a high specificity zzso and high sensitivity zzso in detecting breast cancer while it also had high accuracy zzso in determining zzso from benign zzso There was no significant difference in maximum diameters of pathology, zzso and zzso zzso however the correlation zzso revealed that zzso had better correlation with pathology zzso than zzso zzso The user scanning time for the zzso demonstrated no difference between two examiners zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso scanning time was longer for zzso than handheld ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso breast volume scanner provides advantages of high diagnostic zzso better zzso size zzso zzso and zzso of the whole zzso It is a promising zzso in breast zzso
