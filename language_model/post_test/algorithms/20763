zzso zzso is carried out by the zzso which identifies zzso and removes intervening zzso Alternative zzso in higher zzso results in the generation of multiple protein zzso from gene zzso The extensive alternative zzso observed implies a flexibility of the zzso to identify zzso within a given zzso To reach this flexibility, zzso selection in higher zzso has evolved to depend on multiple parameters such as zzso strength, zzso regulators, the zzso architecture, and the process of zzso synthesis zzso zzso secondary structures have also been proposed to influence alternative zzso as stable zzso secondary structures that mask zzso sites are expected to interfere with zzso zzso Using structural and functional zzso we identified zzso structure elements within the human zzso that associate with alternative zzso zzso Their frequent involvement with alternative zzso demonstrates that zzso structure formation is an important mechanism regulating gene expression and zzso
