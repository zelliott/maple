We present here a simple approach to identify domain boundaries in proteins of an unknown three-dimensional zzso Our method is based on the hypothesis that a zzso chain zzso of a region in a protein chain must be compensated by a zzso interaction energy within the region, which could correlate with a zzso part of the zzso that is, with a domain zzso For protein zzso this means that the domain boundary is zzso by zzso acid zzso with a small value of side chain zzso which zzso with the side chain zzso On the one hand, relatively high Ala and zzso content on the domain boundary results in high zzso zzso of the backbone chain between the zzso On the other hand, the presence of Pro zzso leads to the formation of hinges for a relative orientation of zzso The method was applied to zzso proteins with two zzso zzso extracted from the zzso database with a success rate of zzso We also report the prediction of domain boundaries for zzso targets obtained with the same zzso
