We describe the design and zzso of a fast zzso method for protein structure zzso The approach uses the zzso zzso representation of protein structure, aligning two structures using a common discovered pattern and generating measure of distance derived from an insert zzso Heavy use is made of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso that we have designed and described elsewhere zzso zzso (1999) zzso The comparison system is maintained at the European zzso Institute and is available over the Web at zzso Users submit a structure description in zzso Data Bank zzso format and can compare it with structures in the entire zzso or a representative subset of protein zzso receiving the results by zzso
