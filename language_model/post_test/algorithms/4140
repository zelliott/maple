zzso of zzso systems are often estimated to describe zzso zzso For instance, zzso zzso have been determined to assess the stability of the zzso system, zzso and, more recently, human gait and zzso However, the systematic evaluation of the accuracy and precision of these estimates is problematic because the proper values of the characteristics are typically zzso We fill this void with a set of standardized time series with zzso zzso characteristics that serve as a zzso Estimates ought to match these zzso at least to good zzso We outline a procedure to employ this generic benchmark test and illustrate its capacity by examining methods for zzso the maximum zzso zzso In particular, we discuss zzso by Wolf and co-workers and by zzso and co-workers and evaluate their performances as a function of signal length and zzso zzso In all scenarios, the precision of zzso zzso was found to be equal to or greater than zzso zzso The latter, however, appeared more accurate if reasonably large signal lengths are available and noise levels are sufficiently zzso Due to its zzso the presented benchmark test can be used to evaluate and tune any zzso method to perform zzso for arbitrary experimental zzso
