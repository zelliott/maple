A fast zzso based on the zzso zzso model for the zzso zzso is presented for the precise extraction of the characteristic points of these signals with baseline zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso the baseline wander is removed zzso In fact by the means of the zzso zzso zzso the resolution in the zzso domain can be zzso adjusted not only by the signal frequency but also by the signal instantaneous zzso and its zzso zzso which results in a better baseline wander zzso At the next step the parameters of the model are chosen to have the least square error with the original zzso zzso the precise position of the zzso of an zzso signal with baseline wander is complicated due to the varying zzso of its zzso the ambiguous and changing form of the complex and the unknown zzso A zzso approach handles these zzso therefore a method based on this concept has been developed and the zzso points are accurately detected using the center and spread parameters of zzso of the zzso zzso results show that the proposed method has an average sensitivity of zzso average detection accuracy of zzso and specificity of zzso
