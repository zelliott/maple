zzso function can be tuned using laboratory evolution, in which one rapidly searches through a library of proteins for the properties of zzso In zzso zzso zzso crossovers are chosen in an alignment of p parents to define a set of zzso + 1) zzso zzso These fragments are then assembled zzso to create a library of zzso zzso We have developed a zzso zzso to enrich these libraries in folded proteins while maintaining an appropriate level of diversity for zzso For a given set of parents, our zzso selects crossovers that minimize the average energy of the library, subject to constraints on the length of each zzso This problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path between zzso in a network, for which the global minimum can be found zzso Our zzso has a running time of zzso + zzso for a protein of length zzso zzso the constraints on zzso length generates a set of zzso libraries with varying degrees of zzso By comparing these zzso for different sets of parents, we rapidly determine which parents yield the lowest energy zzso
