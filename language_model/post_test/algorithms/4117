Does each cognitive task elicit a new cognitive network each time in the brain? Recent data suggest that pre-existing zzso of a much smaller number of zzso network components are selectively and zzso used to zzso new cognitive zzso To this end, we propose a novel method zzso that seeks to extract these zzso network components from a limited number of resting state spontaneous zzso zzso zzso a weighted mixture of source zzso zzso with different weighted edges by applying an independent component analysis on zzso brain networks represented as zzso We evaluated the zzso in our simulation study and identified 49 intrinsic zzso by applying it in the resting state zzso zzso Using the derived zzso zzso we zzso brain networks during specific tasks including motor activity, working memory exercises, and verb generation, and identified zzso associated with performance on these zzso We also analyzed sex differences in zzso of zzso which was useful in characterizing group zzso These results suggest that this method can effectively be zzso to identify zzso as well as zzso functional zzso Moreover, zzso can provide more direct information on the edge weights among brain regions working together as a network, which cannot be directly obtained through zzso spatial zzso
