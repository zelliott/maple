A zzso DNA positioning pattern is known to be one of the weakest zzso zzso zzso The alignment procedure that has been developed recently for the extraction of such a pattern is based on a statistical matching of the zzso and its success depends on the zzso ratio in the individual sequences and in the generated zzso The zzso nature of the method and distinctive properties of the pattern bring up the question of efficiency and sensitivity in the zzso This paper presents a method of zzso for this multiple sequence alignment zzso 

To verify the zzso of the multiple alignment approach, we constructed a set of sequences carrying the hidden zzso The pattern was presented by weak zzso zzso of zzso of AA and zzso zzso along otherwise random zzso Only a few zzso of any given 145 base long sequence would zzso to the zzso appearing in about the same phase within the simulated periodic zzso The novelty of our simulation approach is that we simulated a database as a whole, as opposed to simulating each sequence zzso The correlation between the hidden pattern and a sequence from the database is negligible on average, but our statistical zzso alignment procedure produced the pattern with attributes very close to the simulated zzso The accuracy of the procedure was tested and zzso The presence in a typical sequence of as little as three zzso corresponding to the signal is sufficient to generate zzso the pattern hidden in a collection of 204 zzso
