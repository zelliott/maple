Due to the requirements of the zzso Water zzso zzso and other legal regulations zzso national laws like the German Federal zzso Protection zzso but also due to the zzso of the new zzso chemicals management system zzso environmental monitoring will gain increasing importance for the surveillance of environmental quality as well as for the assessment of zzso Against this background, the Work Group on zzso zzso of the Division of zzso zzso and zzso within the German Chemical Society has compiled a position paper on zzso environmental zzso 

Core elements of this position paper are the definitions of important terms like monitoring, exposure monitoring, effect monitoring, and integrated zzso Moreover, zzso and spatial aspects zzso of spatial zzso trend monitoring, and retrospective zzso and their applications are zzso The main focus of this position paper is the coverage of aspects which have to be observed for the preparation and zzso of a monitoring zzso Essential is the clear zzso of the targets of the monitoring which determine the development of the monitoring concept and its zzso zzso if environmental media zzso or organisms are most appropriate as samples for the aim of the zzso Of course, also the properties of the target substances are important zzso zzso as zzso for an exposure monitoring with zzso Finally, the monitoring zzso of sample planning, zzso storage and transport of samples, selection of zzso methods, quality assurance measures as well as reporting are zzso 

An important issue for the future is to link the zzso of chemicals in environmental compartments zzso and pollution zzso more closely to the study of biological effects zzso zzso than has been the case up to zzso Furthermore, by inclusion of a spatial zzso a comprehensive evaluation of the state of an zzso can be obtained and the relevance of the results zzso zzso examples of monitoring studies which illustrate various aspects covered in this position paper will be presented in a series of publications by members of the Work Group in the following issues of this zzso
