This paper proposes a novel zzso online learning and tracking scheme for video objects on zzso zzso Although zzso visual object tracking is promising, large and fast zzso (or zzso pose changes and long-term partial zzso of zzso objects in video remain a challenge that limits the tracking zzso The proposed method tackles these problems with the main zzso on: 1) online zzso of object appearances on zzso zzso 2) optimal zzso zzso handling for online updating of object zzso 3) a zzso dynamic model for both the appearance basis zzso and its zzso and 4) zzso zzso separately for the tracking process and the online learning process, that are realized by employing two particle zzso one is on the zzso for generating appearance particles and another on the linear space for generating zzso box zzso Tracking and online updating are performed in an alternating fashion to mitigate the tracking zzso zzso using the proposed tracker on videos captured by a single zzso camera have shown robust tracking performance, particularly for scenarios when target objects contain significant zzso pose changes and long-term partial zzso Comparisons with eight existing zzso relevant zzso zzso with evaluations have provided further support to the proposed zzso
