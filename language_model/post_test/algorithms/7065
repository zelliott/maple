This paper considers some of the landscape problems encountered in matching molecules by simulated zzso Although the method is in theory zzso the global minimum in the objective function is not always zzso zzso inherent in the molecular data that lead the trajectory of the zzso away from its optimal route are zzso zzso comprised of the C alpha atoms of zzso zzso are used as test zzso The evolution of a reverse ordering landscape problem is examined in zzso Where such patterns in the data could lead to incorrect matches, the problem can in part be zzso by assigning an initial random ordering to the zzso
