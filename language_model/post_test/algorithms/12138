We address the problem of enhancement layer drift zzso for fine zzso zzso zzso An optimal zzso drift zzso zzso is zzso The zzso assumes that there is some zzso of the enhancement layer, which does not allow the enhancement layer reference to be properly zzso and the zzso zzso estimates the associated drift and chooses coding modes zzso The approach yields performance gains of about 1 zzso across low to medium zzso In addition, we investigate dual frame zzso for both base and enhancement layer, with zzso allocation in the base
