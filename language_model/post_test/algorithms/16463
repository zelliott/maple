In rapid scan zzso the magnetic field is scanned through the signal in a time that is short relative to electron spin relaxation zzso Previously it was shown that the zzso zzso could be recovered from triangular rapid scans by zzso zzso In this paper a general zzso zzso method is described and demonstrated to recover the zzso zzso from zzso rapid zzso Since an zzso expression for the zzso transform of the driving function for a zzso scan was not readily apparent, a zzso method was developed to do the zzso The slow scan zzso zzso recovered from rapid triangular and zzso scans are in excellent agreement for zzso zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The availability of a method to zzso zzso rapid scans makes it possible to scan faster than is feasible for triangular scans because of hardware limitations on triangular zzso
