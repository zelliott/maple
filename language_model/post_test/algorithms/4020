zzso zzso zzso which aims to reconstruct the three-dimensional zzso of white matter zzso fibers zzso is one of the most popular approaches for analyzing diffusion zzso imaging zzso data given its high zzso and zzso reliability and zzso zzso The major disadvantage of manual zzso zzso unfortunately, is that placing zzso for tract selection can be very zzso and zzso Although there are several methods that can identify specific zzso fiber zzso in an automated way, manual zzso zzso across multiple subjects performed by a trained zzso with zzso expertise are generally assumed to be more zzso However, for zzso zzso analyses it may still be beneficial to automate the zzso zzso across multiple time points, but then for each individual subject zzso Both the zzso and zzso automation in this situation are intended for subjects without gross zzso In this work, we propose such an automated zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso approach, and assessed whether zzso could preserve the same level of reliability as obtained with manual zzso zzso In addition, we compared zzso with an automated zzso zzso Based on zzso data sets from zzso ten healthy subjects that were scanned five times zzso zzso aged zzso at the first zzso and zzso one control subject that was scanned ten times zzso zzso zzso at the first zzso we demonstrate that the increased efficiency provided by zzso does not compromise the high degrees of precision and accuracy that can be achieved with manual zzso zzso Further automation for zzso zzso however, did not provide similarly accurate zzso zzso
