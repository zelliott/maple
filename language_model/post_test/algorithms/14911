We develop a minimal zzso model for zzso synaptic short-term plasticity that can account for both short-term depression and short-term zzso It is analyzed in the context of the spike response zzso zzso zzso expressions are derived for the synaptic strength as a function of previous spike arrival zzso These results are then used to investigate the behavior of large networks of highly interconnected zzso in the presence of short-term synaptic zzso We extend previous results so as to zzso the existence and stability of limit cycles with zzso firing zzso After the onset of an external zzso we have found complex transient network behavior that zzso itself as a sequence of different modes of coherent firing until a stable limit cycle is zzso
