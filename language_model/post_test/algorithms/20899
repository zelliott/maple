We evaluated the ability of a zzso zzso to identify zzso tuberculosis complex zzso from positive zzso zzso broth zzso A total of 107 zzso samples were processed and zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso At a growth index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso broth was removed, zzso and zzso with zzso zzso results were compared to those obtained by zzso identification methods, including the zzso zzso zzso The average times required to perform zzso and zzso were zzso Of the 107 broth cultures zzso 90 were zzso positive, while 91 were zzso positive for zzso Of particular interest were three contaminated zzso zzso broth cultures yielding zzso other than zzso zzso growth with a zzso that were successfully identified by zzso resulting in a mean time of 14 days to identify zzso before zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could be used as an alternative to the zzso test for the rapid identification of zzso in zzso zzso cultures, particularly in those that contained both zzso and zzso zzso
