An zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique, called generalized inverse imaging zzso is proposed, which combines inverse imaging with a phase zzso to a less zzso zzso zzso noise zzso A single zzso echo zzso imaging zzso zzso is sufficient to obtain the necessary zzso sensitivity information and reference images that are used to reconstruct standard images, so that standard analysis methods are zzso A moving dots stimulus paradigm was chosen to assess the performance of zzso We find that the spatial zzso of zzso for zzso is comparable to an zzso protocol and that maximum zzso increase zzso The high zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso and the acquisition of the phase information enable zzso sampling and zzso of zzso zzso Using the phase time courses obtained from the 32 channels of the receiver coils as nuisance zzso in a general linear model results in significant improvement of the functional zzso rendering the acquisition of external zzso signals zzso The proposed zzso noise correction can in principle be used for other zzso zzso such as simultaneous zzso acquisitions, which acquire the phase information sufficiently fast and sample zzso signals zzso
