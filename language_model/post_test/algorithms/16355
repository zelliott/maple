Using some theoretically simulated data constructed from known sets of the zzso energy distribution zzso zzso to follow the zzso distribution zzso in zzso where E is the zzso energy, zzso is the mean value of the zzso energy distribution, and zzso is the standard zzso of the zzso energy zzso and the frequency factor zzso a critical study of the use of the zzso integral method for the zzso of the kinetic parameters of the distributed zzso energy model has been performed from three zzso For all cases, the use of the zzso integral method leads to important errors in the zzso of zzso There are some differences between the assumed and calculated zzso energy zzso and the differences decrease with increasing the assumed zzso values (for Case 1), with increasing the assumed zzso values (for Case zzso and with decreasing the b values (for Case zzso
