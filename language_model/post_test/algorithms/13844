We evaluated the relative zzso of the displacement planes of the two eyes under various conditions: zzso of nearby targets, of far targets and targets presented zzso at optical zzso We show that disparity driven zzso is not always required to rotate the primary zzso We find that eye orientation during fixation of far targets is zzso We found a zzso distribution ranging from zzso to about 30 zzso of the relative zzso of the two primary zzso By contrast, the difference of primary zzso orientation of the two eyes was, for targets at optical zzso stable and similar across zzso However, the displacement planes of the two eyes did not zzso but were zzso by zzso zzso on average, even though horizontal zzso was close to zzso We discuss our results with reference to current models of zzso three-dimensional zzso
