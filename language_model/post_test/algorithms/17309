To determine the role of total skin electron beam therapy zzso and the prognosis of patients with zzso zzso 

From 1978 to 1996, 66 consecutive patients with zzso zzso received 30 zzso zzso delivered in 12 zzso over 40 days as treatment of their relapsed after topical zzso systemic zzso All patients were staged as zzso stage A, superficial zzso covering less than 50% of the body surface; stage B, superficial zzso covering more than 50% of the body surface; Stage zzso tumors involving the skin, zzso zzso and/or visceral zzso 

The median age was 50 years zzso from zzso zzso There were 39 males and 27 zzso The minimum follow-up was 12 months zzso zzso zzso There were 24 zzso stage A patients, 22 zzso stage B patients, and 20 zzso stage C zzso The overall survival at 5 years for our series was as zzso zzso for stage zzso zzso for stage B, and zzso for stage C disease zzso zzso zzso For the entire zzso the complete zzso rate was zzso the zzso survival zzso at 5 years and 10 years was 30 and zzso zzso For the group A, zzso was zzso at 5 years and zzso at 10 years; for group B, zzso was zzso at 5 zzso 

This study suggests that zzso gives good results for relapsed stage A zzso Total skin electron beam therapy combined with local fields zzso or other local treatment zzso or topical nitrogen zzso might further improve permanent complete response for stage B zzso The most advanced stages of zzso zzso are not controlled by zzso but the radiation therapy offers good zzso zzso
