The analysis of the food intake behavior has the potential to provide insights into the development of obesity and eating zzso As an elementary part of this analysis, chewing strokes have to be detected and zzso Our approach for food intake analysis is the evaluation of chewing sounds generated during the process of zzso These sounds were recorded by microphones applied to the outer ear canal of the zzso Eight different zzso for automated chew event detection were presented and evaluated on two zzso The first zzso contained food intake sounds from the consumption of six types of zzso The second zzso consisted of recordings of different environmental zzso These zzso contained zzso chew events in around 18 h recording zzso The results of the automated chew event detection were compared to manual zzso Precision and recall over zzso were achieved by most of the zzso A simple noise reduction zzso using spectral zzso was implemented for signal zzso Its benefit on the chew event detection performance was zzso A reduction of the number of false zzso by zzso on average was achieved by maintaining the detection zzso The system is able to be used for calculation of the chewing frequency in laboratory zzso
