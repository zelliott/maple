A zzso automated pattern recognition system for zzso data targeted to the zzso state and stage identification is zzso Five patterns were searched for: zzso and zzso wave predominance in the background zzso zzso zzso presence of sleep zzso in the zzso presence of rapid eye movements in an zzso and presence of muscle tone in an zzso The performance of the automated system was measured indirectly by evaluating sleep staging, based on the zzso accepted methodology, to relate the detected patterns in infants over four months of zzso zzso The set of zzso classes included zzso zzso sleep and zzso sleep stages I, II, and zzso Several noise and artifact rejection methods were zzso including zzso fuzzy quality zzso windows of variable sizes and detectors of limb movements and zzso Eleven zzso recordings of healthy infants were zzso The ages of the subjects ranged from 6 to 13 months zzso Six recordings counting zzso epochs were included in the training zzso zzso on a test set zzso epochs from five zzso show an overall agreement of zzso zzso zzso between the automated system and the human zzso These results show significant improvements compared with previous zzso
