This paper describes an zzso for producing pitch zzso using tones that each comprise a full harmonic series, and reports an experiment that demonstrates such zzso Banks of 12 tones zzso zzso were created, with zzso varying in zzso zzso For each scale, as zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso were reduced relative to the zzso ones by zzso zzso for each zzso zzso In consequence, the tone with the lowest zzso was heard as though displaced up an zzso In an experiment employing two such zzso all possible ordered tone pairs from each scale were zzso making 132 ordered tone pairs for each zzso Sixteen subjects judged for each tone pair whether the second tone was higher or lower than the zzso The data derived from these zzso comparisons were subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso and excellent zzso were zzso Individual differences in the subjects' judgments were also zzso The findings support the argument that musical pitch should be characterized as varying along two zzso the zzso dimension of pitch height and the circular dimension of pitch zzso
