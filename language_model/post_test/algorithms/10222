zzso or asexual reproduction through seeds, occurs in over 400 species of zzso Although zzso can favorably perpetuate desired zzso through successive seed generation, it may also bring about some difficulty for linkage analysis and quantitative trait locus zzso In this article, we explore the issue of how zzso affects the precision and power of linkage analysis with molecular zzso We derive a statistical model for zzso the linkage between different markers when some progeny are derived from zzso The model was constructed within the maximum likelihood framework and implemented with the zzso zzso A series of procedures are formulated to test the linkage of zzso the rate of zzso and the degree of genetic interference during zzso The model was examined and validated through simulation zzso The model will provide a tool for linkage mapping and evolutionary studies for plant species that undergo zzso
