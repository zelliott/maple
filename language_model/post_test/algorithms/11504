The development of a mathematical model of the knee ligaments in the zzso plane is zzso Essential features of the model are zzso the representation of selected cruciate ligament zzso as zzso links in a zzso mechanism that controls passive knee zzso and zzso the mapping of all other ligament zzso between attachments on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and tighten as the ligament attachment areas on the bones move relative to each zzso The model is used to study the shape and zzso length changes of the cruciate and collateral ligaments in response to passive zzso of the zzso The model ligament shape and zzso length changes compare well zzso with experimental results reported in the zzso The results suggest that when designing and zzso a ligament replacement with the aim of zzso the natural zzso strain patterns, the surgeon must not only implant through the natural attachment areas but must also maintain the natural zzso mapping and render all zzso just tight at the appropriate zzso zzso
