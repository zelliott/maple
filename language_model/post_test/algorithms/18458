An artificial neural network model is developed to predict the ratios of the zzso zzso of drugs in the brain to those in the blood zzso zzso from their molecular structural zzso These molecular structural parameters are the molecular volume zzso the sum of the absolute values of the net atomic charges of oxygen and nitrogen atoms which are zzso zzso zzso zzso and the sum of the net atomic charges of hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen or nitrogen atoms zzso For a training set of 56 compounds and a test set of 5 compounds, root mean squared errors zzso between experimental log zzso values and zzso log zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso These molecular structural parameters can be obtained easily from quantum chemical zzso The model is suitable for the rapid prediction of the zzso barrier penetration of zzso
