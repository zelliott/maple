Many patients in zzso and emergency care are under the influence of zzso In addition, some of the more common pathological conditions can introduce a zzso that can be mistaken to be related to alcohol zzso Fast quantitative determination of the breath alcohol concentration zzso in emergency patients zzso zzso and medical assessment, but shallow zzso performed by zzso patients reduce the measurement zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate if breath alcohol analysis in zzso patients can be improved with use of simultaneous measurement of the expired carbon dioxide zzso With prototypes of a handheld breath alcohol zzso based on infrared transmission zzso the alcohol and zzso concentration in expired breath from 37 cooperative and zzso patients were zzso The results show that enhanced breath sampling with use of a pump and zzso of the end zzso zzso with use of the ratio between the measured partial pressure of zzso zzso and a reference value of the zzso zzso provided adequate correlation with the blood alcohol concentration zzso This zzso study has shown that breath alcohol analysis in shallow zzso from zzso patients can be improved with use of zzso as a zzso zzso
