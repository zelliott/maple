A comparison was performed between the points measured using the zzso zzso scoring system in 60 zzso zzso displayed in both a standard format as well as a zzso magnified zzso zzso Fifty criteria (a maximum possibility of 31 points) were evaluated in each zzso The data indicate that in 50% of the zzso an identical number of points were zzso However, there was a single point difference in zzso 2 points in zzso and more than 2 points in zzso The differences were primarily because of points scored on the zzso but not on the standard zzso Thus, a systematic zzso of zzso size may occur when the zzso zzso score is measured manually from a standard zzso
