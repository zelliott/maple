zzso zzso initiatives aim to zzso representative zzso structures for the majority of protein families over the next decade, but many obstacles must be zzso The correct design of zzso is extremely important since many proteins will be too large or contain zzso regions and will not be amenable to zzso It is therefore essential to identify regions in protein sequences that are likely to be suitable for structural zzso zzso is a fast and simple method to identify zzso zzso in protein zzso zzso are compact units of protein structure and their correct zzso will aid structural zzso through a zzso zzso zzso predictions are based on the observed lengths and zzso of zzso from proteins with known zzso zzso The prediction method employs an zzso to identify sequence regions that form a zzso structure and those that are zzso On a test set of 173 proteins with consensus zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso has a sensitivity of 50% and an accuracy of zzso which is better than current state-of-the-art zzso The method does not rely on zzso searches and, therefore, can identify previously unknown zzso
