Most scoring functions for zzso zzso zzso are either zzso or zzso with the former being able to produce higher quality structures and latter more tolerant to zzso changes upon zzso Earlier, we developed the zzso zzso for zzso zzso predictions, with a scoring function that contained only zzso zzso Here we combine zzso zzso zzso with five zzso zzso published by other labs, as well as an zzso potential zzso that we published after zzso We simultaneously zzso the weights for selected combinations of terms in the scoring function, using zzso generated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed rigorous cross validation of the combinations using 96 test cases from a zzso zzso Judged by the zzso success rate of making 1000 predictions per complex, addition of zzso and the best zzso pair potential reduced the number of cases without a correct prediction by 38 and zzso relative to zzso and zzso zzso Thus combination of zzso and zzso zzso into a scoring function can improve performance for zzso zzso The resulting scoring function is called zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and is available at zzso
