In previous work we demonstrated the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso detectors with zzso zzso zzso capability based on zzso zzso A zzso resolution of 8 zzso zzso at zzso was obtained for 20 zzso long zzso zzso using a delayed charge integration linear zzso method zzso zzso zzso modify the pulse shape to allow continuous zzso information determination, but the relationship between pulse shape and zzso is zzso We are therefore interested in developing a sensitive and robust method to estimate the zzso Here, linear zzso analysis zzso was implemented to zzso the events based on information extracted from the pulse zzso zzso were acquired with zzso zzso zzso zzso at five zzso depths and characterized by their zzso values or zzso zzso These zzso were obtained by expanding the zzso on a zzso basis set and constituted a unique signature for each zzso The zzso of individual events was predicted using zzso based on zzso zzso zzso or zzso values zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to true zzso zzso zzso showed higher sensitivity and accuracy than zzso and zzso and was also more robust to predict the zzso of zzso with higher statistical noise due to low light levels zzso depths further from the zzso zzso This indicates that zzso may be more suitable to zzso zzso in smaller zzso where lower collected light levels are zzso This novel approach is promising for calculating zzso using pulse shape discrimination in zzso zzso zzso PET zzso
