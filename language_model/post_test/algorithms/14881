The zzso of zzso a newly developed zzso class zzso zzso was investigated in rats, zzso and dogs given intravenous and oral doses that have little effect on the zzso blood flow rate zzso the range of clinical zzso A zzso open model adequately described the plasma zzso profiles with respective elimination zzso of 18, 19, and 13 h after intravenous administration of zzso to rats, rabbits and zzso After oral administration, the zzso plasma zzso reached their zzso within zzso h in all the species tested, then decreased as in intravenous zzso The systemic availability was zzso for the rats, zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso From the zzso zzso values for these three species, we predicted human zzso of zzso after oral administration with an animal zzso zzso The area under the plasma zzso curve zzso after oral administration, as well as the total body clearance showed an excellent zzso relationship to body weight across the three zzso The oral zzso value for humans therefore could be predicted from this zzso The predicted value agreed well with the observed value in the clinical phase I zzso It was difficult to predict the plasma concentration profile of zzso for humans after oral administration because the zzso rate constant zzso that is essential for zzso of the maximum concentration exhibited no correlation across the species zzso But we approximately could simulate the plasma concentration profile of zzso for humans by using the zzso value for the rats or zzso
