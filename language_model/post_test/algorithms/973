Modern diagnostic methods such as zzso zzso zzso zzso allow zzso and evaluation of human zzso zzso which can be useful in diagnosing coronary artery zzso The objective of the present study is to obtain feasible diagnostic information to detect zzso plaque using zzso combined with zzso zzso 

An 830 zzso zzso sapphire laser pumped by an zzso laser provides zzso zzso A zzso zzso light scattered from zzso tissue and a zzso cooled zzso detects the zzso zzso A total of 111 zzso fragments were scanned and zzso results were compared with zzso Principal components analysis zzso and zzso distance zzso were used to model an zzso for tissue zzso into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso were randomly separated into training and prospective zzso 

It has been found that, for the zzso zzso the zzso has sensitivity of 84 and zzso and specificity of 91 and zzso for training and prospective groups, zzso For the NC tissue the zzso has sensitivity of 88 and zzso and specificity of 88 and zzso For the C tissue both sensitivity and specificity were zzso zzso 

An zzso using zzso and zzso analysis based on zzso has been developed and successfully applied to diagnose coronary artery disease by zzso obtaining good sensitivity and specificity for each tissue zzso
