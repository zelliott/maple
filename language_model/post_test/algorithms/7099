zzso imaging techniques with built-in or zzso smoothing feature for ensuring strain continuity are not intelligent enough to prevent distortion or zzso edge blurring while zzso This paper proposes a novel approach with built-in zzso edge preservation technique for high quality direct average strain zzso An edge detection zzso typically used in diffusion filtering is modified here for zzso edge zzso Based on the extracted edge information, zzso edges are preserved by zzso the strain determining cost function in the zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso demonstrates approximately zzso zzso improvement in terms of zzso zzso than the other reported zzso or average strain zzso techniques in zzso zzso simulation with almost no sacrifice in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of the proposed zzso is also tested for the experimental phantom data and in zzso breast zzso The results reveal that the proposed method can generate a high quality strain image zzso the zzso edge more clearly than the other reported strain zzso techniques that have been designed to ensure strain zzso The zzso cost, however, is little higher for the proposed method than the simpler zzso and considerably higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
