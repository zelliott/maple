To reveal the contribution of zzso and zzso imaging zzso to the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the zzso changes associated with this disease in the involved zzso areas using the apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

Ten patients who had undergone zzso and zzso analysis with a zzso of zzso disease, and who were subsequently diagnosed with ME in laboratory and/or genetic studies, were included in our zzso zzso values were compared with a control group composed of 20 patients of similar age with normal zzso zzso involved zzso made in 20 different areas determined on the zzso zzso The dominance or contribution of zzso zzso zzso to the conventional sequences was compared with the zzso 

In the first examination, an increase in both diffusion and zzso values was detected in six cases and diffusion restriction and a decrease in zzso values in three zzso While an increase in both diffusion and zzso values was demonstrated in four cases, there was diffusion restriction and a decrease in zzso values in three cases in the control zzso 

zzso provides information that zzso conventional zzso sequences in the diagnosis of zzso
