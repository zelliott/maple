Two new developments in speech pattern processing hearing aids will be zzso The first development is the use of compound speech pattern zzso Speech information which is invisible to the zzso was zzso in terms of three acoustic speech zzso the voice fundamental frequency pattern, coded as a zzso the presence of zzso zzso coded as a zzso noise, and the zzso zzso zzso coded by zzso zzso of the zzso and noise zzso Each element of the compound stimulus was individually matched in frequency and intensity to the zzso receptive zzso zzso speech receptive assessments in five profoundly zzso listeners were performed to examine the contributions of adding zzso and zzso information to the voice fundamental frequency pattern, and to compare these zzso to amplified zzso In both consonant recognition and connected discourse tracking zzso all five subjects showed an advantage from the addition of zzso information to the fundamental frequency zzso In consonant zzso all five subjects showed further improvements in performance when zzso speech zzso was additionally zzso together with zzso information, but this effect was not found in zzso The addition of zzso information to voice fundamental frequency information did not improve performance in the absence of zzso zzso Three of the subjects performed significantly better in at least one of the compound speech pattern conditions than with amplified speech, while the other two performed similarly with amplified speech and the best compound speech pattern zzso The three speech pattern elements zzso here may represent a zzso basis for an acoustic aid to zzso for this group of zzso The second development is the use of a trained zzso zzso pattern zzso zzso as the basis for a robust real-time voice fundamental frequency zzso This zzso runs on a zzso digital signal zzso which can be incorporated in a zzso hearing zzso Aided zzso for speech in noise was assessed in the same five profoundly zzso listeners to compare the benefits of conventional hearing aids with those of an aid which provided zzso fundamental frequency information together with zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern element aid gave significantly better performance in the reception of zzso zzso contrasts from speech in pink noise than that achieved with conventional amplification and consequently, it also gave better overall performance in zzso consonant zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
