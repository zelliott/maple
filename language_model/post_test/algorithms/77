A method for fast quantitative zzso mapping based on multiple zzso zzso imaging with correction for zzso magnetic field zzso is zzso using an exponential zzso zzso Field zzso maps are obtained from the phase information and zzso data are subsequently corrected, allowing for simple zzso zzso zzso zzso with long echo times suffering from major signal losses due to field zzso are excluded from the zzso The acquisition time for a zzso size of 256 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso resolution, and 2 zzso slice thickness amounts to 15 s per zzso An additional correction for zzso field zzso further improves zzso Phantom experiments show that the method provides accurate zzso values for field zzso up to 200 zzso for zzso up to 300 zzso errors do not exceed zzso In zzso zzso values acquired on healthy volunteers at zzso are in excellent agreement with results from the zzso
