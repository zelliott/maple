zzso zzso contains a specific binding site for zzso zzso approximately 100 zzso whereas zzso zzso is unaffected by identical zzso of zzso zzso Replacement of two unique zzso zzso E9 and zzso from the zzso zzso terminal domain of zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso from zzso eliminated the block by 2 zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso gating sensitivity, and reduced the zzso zzso of this zzso gap junction channel zzso The single point zzso zzso and zzso predominantly affected the residual zzso state zzso and zzso gating properties, zzso zzso pairing of zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells produced a strongly zzso gap junction reminiscent of the inward zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited reduced zzso sensitivity, but displayed much less zzso in zzso pairings with zzso negligible changes in the zzso channel zzso and remained insensitive to zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso may form a critical zzso zzso domain that serves as the zzso for zzso closure and block by zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso gap junctions involves other zzso acid zzso in addition to the E or K 9 and 13 zzso located on the zzso terminal domain of these two zzso
