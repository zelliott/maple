In zzso studies it is common that the number of zzso zzso the sample zzso is small and that the distribution of expression values differs from zzso In this situation, zzso and zzso tests may be appropriate for the identification of zzso expressed zzso However, unlike zzso tests, zzso tests are not suitable for very small sample sizes, such as three per zzso A variety of different zzso tests zzso For example, it is possible to adjust the data to have a common mean before the zzso samples are zzso For small significance levels, which can occur when a large number of genes is investigated, the original zzso test, as well as a zzso test suggested for the zzso problem, have no power in cases of very small sample zzso In contrast, the modified test based on adjusted data is zzso Using a zzso Carlo simulation study, we demonstrate that the difference in power can be zzso In addition, the different tests are illustrated using zzso zzso
