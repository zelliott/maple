A large number of computer vision zzso for finding intensity edges, computing motion, depth, and color, and recovering the three-dimensional shape of objects have been developed within the framework of minimizing an associated zzso or zzso zzso Particularly successful has been the introduction of zzso variables coding for zzso in intensity, optical flow field, depth, and other zzso allowing image zzso to occur in these zzso The associated zzso zzso zzso can be mapped onto zzso zzso networks, such that the stationary zzso distribution in the network zzso to a minimum of the zzso The performance of an experimental analog zzso integration zzso circuit implementing the zzso zzso network for the problem of two-dimensional surface zzso in the presence of zzso is zzso this circuit is implemented in complementary metal oxide semiconductor zzso
