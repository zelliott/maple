Local field zzso zzso that carry information about the zzso motor intention have the potential to serve as a complement or alternative to spike signals for zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study is to assess the utility of zzso for zzso by characterizing the largely unknown information coding properties of zzso zzso 

Two monkeys were zzso each with a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso reach region where both zzso and spikes are known to zzso the zzso intended reach zzso We examined how zzso zzso recorded during a reach task jointly carry reach target information, and compared the zzso performance to simultaneously recorded zzso zzso 

zzso yielded a higher number of channels that were zzso about reach targets than zzso Single channel zzso provided more accurate target information than single channel zzso However, zzso showed significantly larger signal and noise correlations across channels than zzso Reach target zzso performed worse when using zzso zzso than zzso zzso The underperformance of zzso zzso was mostly due to their larger noise correlation because noise zzso zzso zzso produced a decoding accuracy comparable to zzso zzso Despite the high noise zzso zzso using zzso in addition to spikes outperformed zzso using only zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso could effectively complement spikes for zzso applications by yielding more zzso zzso The utility of zzso zzso may be further zzso if their high noise correlation can be taken into account by zzso
