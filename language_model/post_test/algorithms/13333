From independently conducted zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso and receiver operating characteristic zzso experiments, to study zzso associations between three zzso the area under the alternative zzso zzso curve zzso from zzso data, the area under the zzso curve zzso from zzso highest rating data, and the area under the zzso curve zzso from zzso zzso 

Two hundred zzso 100 of which were zzso were processed by two zzso zzso and interpreted by four zzso under the zzso zzso From the zzso data, zzso data were zzso using the highest rating zzso zzso months afterwards, the images were interpreted by the same zzso under the conventional zzso zzso zzso data (in contrast to zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso curve, zzso zzso correlation was used to zzso the degree of association between the zzso zzso zzso and standard errors were zzso using the zzso zzso The magnitude of the correlations was assessed by comparison with zzso zzso fixed reader zzso 

Average zzso correlations (with zzso confidence intervals in square zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso data zzso estimates was zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was similar to the correlation between two zzso for a single reader using one zzso method, suggesting that the highest rating assumption might be zzso
