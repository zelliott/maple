A fast zzso methodology is presented for the analysis of three synthetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso sunset yellow zzso zzso and zzso zzso Seven soft drinks zzso from a local zzso were zzso filtered and injected into the zzso zzso Second order data were obtained by a rapid zzso separation and zzso zzso A comparative study of the performance of two second order zzso zzso and zzso applied to model the data, is zzso Interestingly, the data present time shift between different zzso and cannot be zzso corrected to determine the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This fact originates the lack of zzso that cannot be zzso zzso and can hardly be zzso by using zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso has shown to be an excellent tool for zzso this kind of data allowing to reach acceptable figures of zzso Recovery values ranged between zzso and zzso when analyzing artificial and real samples were indicative of the good performance of the zzso In contrast with the complete zzso which zzso 10 zzso of methanol and 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso the proposed fast zzso method requires only zzso zzso of methanol and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso analysis time could be reduced up to zzso of the necessary time to perform the complete separation allowing saving both zzso and time, which are related to a reduction of both the costs per analysis and environmental zzso
