Imaging studies and quantitative zzso have often, but not consistently, implicated the right zzso and the left prefrontal zzso in zzso To help clarify this picture, a spatial filter shown to be effective for enhancing differences between zzso populations was combined with an electrical zzso approach called zzso electromagnetic zzso and used to compare the zzso zzso from a group of 25 male subjects with depression and a group of 65 matched zzso To elicit differences, comparisons were made during resting conditions and during verbal and spatial cognitive challenges to the zzso Estimates of the zzso density were derived from zzso recordings of the zzso reduced to the zzso alpha and beta frequency zzso The depressed subjects were zzso and selected according to zzso IV zzso zzso of significantly increased current density in depression compared to controls were generally right zzso while regions of significantly decreased current density were generally frontal and left zzso A zzso comparison of the depressed subjects during the two cognitive challenges suggested a left anterior functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the two groups indicated that the spatial challenge best separated the groups irrespective of frequency zzso
