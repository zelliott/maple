A response surface methodology zzso involving a central composite design was applied to the zzso and zzso of a preparation of zzso carbon zzso in zzso of NO at 250 degrees C and the results were compared with the artificial neural network zzso predicted zzso The catalyst preparation zzso including metal loading zzso zzso temperature and zzso degree zzso zzso were selected as influence factors on catalyst zzso In the zzso model, the predicted values of NO conversion were found to be in good agreement with the experimental zzso zzso graphic analysis showed that all the chosen parameters and some of the interactions were effective on zzso The zzso results showed that maximum NO conversion was achieved at the optimum conditions: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loading and zzso at zzso degrees zzso The ANN model was developed by a zzso back propagation network with the zzso 3, 8 and 1 and a zzso training zzso The mean square error for the ANN and zzso models were zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso values were zzso and zzso respectively, indicating the superiority of ANN in capturing the zzso zzso of the system and being accurate in zzso the values of the NO zzso
