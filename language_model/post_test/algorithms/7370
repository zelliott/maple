We study the problem of sorting zzso under an evolutionary model that includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose an zzso zzso to improve any initial evolutionary trajectory between two zzso in terms of zzso Our zzso is based on a new zzso model, the trajectory zzso which models not only the final states of two zzso but also an existing evolutionary trajectory between zzso We show that redundant zzso in the trajectory zzso to certain cycles in the trajectory zzso and prove that our zzso zzso to an optimal trajectory for any initial trajectory involving only zzso
