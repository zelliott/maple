The zzso zzso that zzso the spatial dependence of zzso values in functional brain images is usually estimated zzso from the zzso Since this zzso is essential for the assessment of significant changes in brain activity, it is important to know zzso the zzso of its zzso and zzso how this zzso affects the results of the ensuing statistical zzso 

In this article, we derive an approximate expression for the zzso of the zzso zzso and investigate the effects of this zzso on assessing the significance of cerebral zzso in statistical zzso maps using a verbal zzso PET zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that, for p values around zzso the zzso in the p value zzso to zzso zzso is approximately zzso 

The effect of the assessment of the spatial dependency of the data is far from being zzso and this suggests a more comprehensive methodology for functional imaging than the one used so zzso This work provides a simple tool for taking into account this zzso
