This is Part II of the paper, zzso zzso zzso an Automatic zzso for zzso Image zzso zzso Part I of this paper introduced a new automatic contrast enhancement zzso zzso grouping zzso zzso is a general and powerful technique, which can be zzso applied to a broad variety of zzso images and zzso conventional contrast enhancement zzso However, the basic zzso method still has limitations and cannot enhance certain classes of zzso images well, zzso images with a noisy zzso The basic zzso also cannot fulfill certain special application purposes, zzso enhancing only part of an image which zzso to a certain segment of the image zzso In order to break through these limitations, this paper introduces an extension of the basic zzso algorithm, selective zzso grouping zzso which groups the zzso components in different segments of the zzso using different criteria and, zzso is able to enhance different parts of the zzso to various zzso This paper also introduces two new zzso methods to eliminate background noise in noisy zzso images so that such images can be properly enhanced by the zzso zzso The extension of zzso to color images is also discussed in this zzso zzso and its variations extend the capability of the basic zzso to a larger variety of zzso images, and can fulfill special application zzso zzso and its variations not only produce results superior to conventional contrast enhancement techniques, but are also fully automatic under most circumstances, and are zzso to a broad variety of zzso
