Trace or zzso files zzso zzso are produced by automatic zzso acid sequencing equipment or zzso Each file contains information which can be interpreted by zzso software to reveal the sequence zzso zzso This is done by the zzso proprietary software or publicly available zzso Depending on the size of a sequencing project the number of trace files can vary from just a few to thousands of zzso zzso quality assessment on various criteria is important at the stage preceding zzso and zzso zzso Two major publicly available zzso and zzso are used by zzso to perform sequence quality zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence processing pipeline has been developed for small to large scale automatic processing of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso Package zzso module and zzso program zzso are zzso in the pipeline, which produces detailed and zzso output that can be displayed with a web zzso zzso can be used successfully with very little previous experience, however options for zzso tuning are provided for advanced zzso zzso runs under zzso and zzso operating zzso It is available for downloading and will run as zzso zzso It can also be zzso on the Norwegian zzso Genome Project web site where zzso jobs can be run on the project zzso 

zzso is a tool allowing to perform quality assessment of sequences generated by automatic sequencing zzso zzso is flexible since both interactive jobs on the zzso server and the stand alone downloadable version are zzso Virtually no previous experience is necessary to run a default zzso job, on the other hand options for zzso tuning are zzso zzso zzso can be used as efficiently for just several trace files as for large scale sequence zzso
