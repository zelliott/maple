A new method for spike sorting is proposed which partly zzso the overlapping zzso Principal component analysis and zzso zzso techniques are used to estimate the number of zzso contributing to zzso zzso Spike templates zzso zzso are reconstructed according to the zzso zzso A zzso procedure is then zzso zzso all temporally displaced templates are compared with the spike event to find the zzso template that yields the minimum zzso zzso If the zzso passes the zzso the matching procedure stops and the spike event is classified as the zzso zzso Otherwise the spike event may be an overlapping zzso The procedure is then repeated with all possible combinations of two templates, three templates, zzso Once one combination is found, which yields the minimum zzso zzso among the combinations of the same number of component templates and makes the zzso pass the zzso the matching procedure zzso It is unnecessary to check the remaining combinations of more zzso zzso the zzso effort is reduced and the zzso problem can be partly zzso A simulated spike train was used to assess the performance of the proposed method, which was also applied to a real recording of chicken zzso zzso zzso
