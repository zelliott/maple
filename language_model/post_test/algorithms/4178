Local energy transfer from electrons generated in zzso that are exposed to zzso radiation is fundamental to cell zzso Our aim in this investigation was to zzso the probability of cell mortality associated with the damage by electrons and the repair processes in the cell nucleus, zzso a new interpretation of the cell surviving fraction zzso We introduced a zzso formula for cells exposed to X-rays, which is given as a linear combination of the zzso zzso about the number of zzso zzso per nucleus and their zzso zzso to show the zzso of log zzso as a function of zzso The model selection was rated by a statistical index, zzso information criterion zzso It was shown that the new formula is suitable for describing cell survival and explicitly takes account of the zzso in zzso pathways of the zzso
