zzso abnormalities are a key feature of Complex Regional zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso these changes in patients suffering from acute or chronic zzso I, we used zzso zzso Testing zzso in comparison to an age and gender matched control zzso 

61 patients presenting with zzso I of the upper zzso and 56 healthy subjects were zzso assessed using zzso The patients' warm and cold detection thresholds zzso zzso the heat and cold pain thresholds zzso zzso and the occurrence of paradoxical heat sensation zzso were zzso 

In acute zzso I, patients showed warm and cold zzso indicated by significant changes in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were significantly increased as well, indicating warm and cold zzso In chronic zzso zzso zzso declined, but zzso as well as zzso further zzso zzso patients with acute zzso displayed zzso To a minor degree, all zzso changes were also present on the zzso zzso 

We propose three zzso of zzso I, which follow a distinct time course: zzso zzso observed in acute zzso indicates an ongoing zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso as detected in acute and chronic zzso signals a zzso of zzso and zzso which further zzso in chronic zzso zzso in acute zzso I indicates that both inflammation and zzso are present, whilst in chronic zzso I, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the absence of zzso The zzso changes observed strongly suggest the involvement of the central nervous zzso
