Learning a class zzso from a set of zzso is an important challenge facing researchers in object zzso Although the problem is receiving growing interest, most approaches assume a zzso correspondence among local features, restricting their ability to learn true zzso of a zzso In this paper, we present a new technique for learning an abstract shape zzso from a set of zzso whose features are in zzso zzso Focusing on the domain of zzso shape, we represent a silhouette as a zzso axis graph whose zzso zzso to zzso defined by zzso branches and whose edges connect adjacent zzso Given a pair of zzso axis zzso we establish a zzso correspondence between their zzso to find zzso among articulating zzso Based on these zzso we recover the zzso zzso axis graph along with the zzso and zzso attributes associated with its zzso We evaluate the zzso prototypes in the context of a recognition zzso
