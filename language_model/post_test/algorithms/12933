We zzso demonstrate focusing and guiding electromagnetic zzso waves in a designer surface zzso zzso with deep zzso mode cross zzso Our experiments show that a metal grating with suitable zzso functioning as a designer surface zzso zzso can support deep zzso surface modes and the zzso of the modes can be squeezed also into deep zzso by tapering the zzso of the zzso The results provide a new insight into deep zzso zzso and zzso
