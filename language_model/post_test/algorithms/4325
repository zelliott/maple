Propulsion of zzso magnetic zzso powered by a rotating magnetic field is in the focus of the modern biomedical zzso This technology relies on strong interactions of dynamic and magnetic degrees of freedom of the zzso Here we study in detail various zzso observed regimes of the zzso zzso orientation and propulsion depending on the zzso frequency, and establish the relation of these two properties to the zzso zzso and geometry of the zzso zzso The theoretical predictions for the transition between the regimes and zzso orientation and propulsion speed are in excellent agreement with available experimental zzso The proposed theory offers a few simple guidelines towards the optimal design of the magnetic zzso
