zzso carpet zzso are usually used to hide an object beneath zzso In this paper we propose and demonstrate a carpet filter to hide objects and create illusions above the filter by using a zzso zzso zzso Instead of using transformation zzso we get electromagnetic parameters of the filter by optical transfer functions, which play the role of modulating the propagation of the scattering angular spectrum directly from an object above the zzso By further adding a functional layer onto the zzso we can even camouflage the object so that it appears to be a different zzso The zzso results are confirmed by zzso zzso Our method is completely different from the current coordinate transfer method and may provide another point of view to more clearly understand the mechanism of invisibility zzso
