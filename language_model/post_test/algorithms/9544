zzso display is a fast and economical way of visualizing zzso and comparing zzso which is based on the separation of DNA fragments in two steps, first according to their size and then to their sequence zzso In this article, we present an exhaustive study of the zzso issues associated with a model aimed at predicting the final absolute locations of DNA fragments in zzso display zzso We show that simple expressions for the mobility of DNA fragments in both dimensions allow one to reproduce experimental final absolute locations better than experimental zzso However, our simulations also point out that the results of zzso display experiments are not sufficient to determine the best set of parameters for the modeling of fragments separation in the second dimension and that additional detailed zzso of the mobility of a few sequences are necessary to achieve this zzso We hope that this work will help in establishing simulations as a powerful tool to zzso experimental conditions without having to perform a large number of preliminary experiments and to estimate whether zzso DNA display is suited to identify a zzso or a genetic difference that is expected to exist between the zzso of closely related zzso
