The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso zzso utility scores and zzso health state zzso zzso utility scores zzso from the zzso zzso Health zzso zzso by using a large European sample of patients with stable coronary heart zzso Special attention was given to zzso zzso 

Data from the zzso Action on Secondary and zzso Prevention by zzso to zzso Events III zzso zzso survey were zzso Patients hospitalized for a coronary artery bypass zzso zzso coronary intervention, acute zzso zzso or zzso zzso were interviewed and examined at least 6 months after their acute zzso zzso quality of life was assessed by using the zzso and the zzso zzso outcomes were converted to zzso utility values, allowing comparison between both zzso 

Both zzso and zzso results were available for zzso patients with coronary heart disease from 20 European zzso The measures were significantly correlated zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso however, large differences between the two measures zzso A total of zzso of the patients reported a ceiling effect on the zzso zzso whereas only zzso of the patients reported full health based on the zzso Especially the mental component does not seem to be completely captured by the zzso zzso Furthermore, patients with worse zzso outcomes were more likely to have better zzso results, whereas patients with better zzso outcomes were more likely to have worse zzso zzso 

Both measures are not zzso Whereas the main disadvantage of the zzso questionnaire is its ceiling effect, the potential advantages of zzso might disappear when converting the outcomes into an zzso utility, because of the small differences between zzso
