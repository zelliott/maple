Many applications of machine learning involve analysis of sparse zzso data, in which the number of input features is larger than the number of data zzso Standard zzso learning methods may not be sufficient for such data, and this provides motivation for zzso learning zzso This paper investigates a new learning methodology called learning through contradictions or zzso support zzso machine zzso zzso incorporates a zzso knowledge about application data, in the form of additional zzso samples, into the learning zzso This paper investigates possible advantages of zzso versus standard zzso and describes the practical conditions necessary for the effectiveness of the zzso These conditions are based on the analysis of the zzso zzso of projections of training samples onto the normal direction zzso of zzso zzso decision zzso Several empirical comparisons are presented to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed zzso
