In this work we propose a spatial point process zzso approach to improve the detection accuracy of clustered zzso zzso in mammogram zzso The conventional approach to zzso detection has been to first detect the individual zzso in an image zzso which are subsequently grouped into zzso Our proposed approach aims to exploit the spatial distribution among the different zzso in a mammogram image zzso zzso tend to appear in small zzso directly during the detection zzso We model the zzso by a marked point process zzso in which zzso neighboring zzso interact with each zzso The zzso are then simultaneously detected through maximum a zzso zzso zzso of the model parameters associated with the zzso zzso The proposed approach was evaluated with a zzso of 141 clinical zzso from 66 cases, and the results show that it could yield improved detection performance compared to a recently proposed support zzso machine zzso zzso In particular, the proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of about zzso with the zzso rate at around zzso clusters per image, compared to about zzso for the zzso the performance of the proposed approach was also demonstrated to be more stable over different compositions of the test zzso
