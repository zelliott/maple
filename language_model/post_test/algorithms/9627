zzso zzso registration is frequently used in computer assisted surgery to align corresponding points, or zzso in zzso and zzso zzso This alignment is mostly achieved by assuming the same homogeneous error distribution for all the points; however, due to the properties of the medical instruments used in measuring the point zzso the error distribution might be zzso and different for each zzso In this paper, in an effort to understand the effect of error distribution in the localized points on the performed zzso we derive a zzso solution relating the error distribution of each point with the performed registration zzso The solution uses maximum likelihood zzso to calculate the probability density function of registration error at each zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations are performed to validated the proposed zzso
