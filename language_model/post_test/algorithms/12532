The goal of linkage mapping is to find the true order of zzso from a zzso Since the number of possible orders is large even for a modest number of zzso the problem of finding the optimal solution is known as a zzso problem or traveling salesman problem zzso Although a number of zzso are available, many either are low in the accuracy of recovering the true order of zzso or require tremendous amounts of zzso resources, thus making them difficult to use for reconstructing a large-scale zzso We developed in this article a novel method called zzso growth zzso to help solve this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the linkage map on the basis of novel results about additive zzso It not only is fast but also has a very high accuracy in recovering the true order of zzso according to our simulation zzso Since the zzso method requires zzso cycles to estimate the ordering of zzso zzso it is particularly useful for zzso linkage maps consisting of hundreds or even thousands of linked zzso zzso on a zzso
