Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are currently used to zzso brain zzso The accuracy of source zzso depends on numerous factors, including the specific inverse approach and source model, fundamental differences in zzso and zzso data, and the accuracy of the volume conductor model of the head zzso the forward zzso Using zzso Carlo simulations, this study removes the effect of forward model errors and theoretically compares the use of zzso alone, zzso alone, and combined zzso data sets for source zzso Here, we use a linear zzso inverse approach with a distributed source model and a realistic forward head zzso We evaluated its accuracy using the zzso and point spread zzso The zzso metric for a specified location on the zzso describes the amount of activity incorrectly localized onto that location from other zzso The point spread metric provides the complementary zzso for that same location, the point spread describes the zzso of activity from that specified location to other locations in the zzso We also propose and examine the utility of a zzso sensitivity zzso inverse zzso Given our particular forward and inverse models, our results show that 1) surprisingly, zzso zzso is more accurate than zzso zzso for the same number of sensors averaged over many source locations and zzso 2) as expected, combining zzso with zzso produces the best accuracy for the same total number of zzso 3) the noise sensitivity zzso inverse operator improves the spatial resolution relative to the standard linear zzso zzso and 4) use of an a zzso zzso constraint universally reduces both zzso and point zzso
