Although a great deal is known about one gene or protein and its functions under different environmental conditions, little information is available about the complex zzso of biological networks subject to different environmental zzso Observing differential expressions of one or more genes between normal and abnormal cells has been a mainstream method of discovering pertinent genes in diseases and therefore valuable drug zzso However, to date, no such method exists for zzso and zzso the differential zzso zzso of genetic regulatory networks, which can have greater impact on zzso than individual zzso 

We propose to zzso the zzso by zzso the functional study of biological networks as a control problem of zzso zzso We developed mathematical methods to study the stability, the zzso and the zzso zzso as well as the transient responses of biological networks under different environmental zzso We applied our framework to three real-world zzso the zzso DNA repair network in zzso coli under different zzso of radiation, the zzso zzso cycle in mice lung exposed to either poisonous air or normal air, and the zzso zzso in zzso cell lines exposed to three types of zzso type I zzso a wild type and two zzso zzso and we found that the three genetic networks exhibited fundamentally different zzso properties in normal and abnormal zzso 

zzso in stability, relative stability, degrees of zzso and transient responses between normal and abnormal cells means considerable difference in zzso zzso and different functioning of zzso Therefore differential zzso properties can be a valuable tool in biomedical zzso
