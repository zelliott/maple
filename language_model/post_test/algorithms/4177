In zzso brain tumor surgery, zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a powerful tool for updating navigational information after brain shift, controlling the zzso of brain tumors, and evaluating zzso zzso zzso zzso scans occasionally generate a lot of noise, the reason for which is yet to be zzso This noise adversely affects the zzso zzso In this study, in order to improve the image quality of zzso images, we zzso and adapted an unbiased zzso means zzso filter to zzso zzso This noise appears to occur at a specific zzso zzso In order to adapt the zzso filter to the noise, we improved the zzso so that zzso can be performed at different noise levels that occur at different zzso zzso As a result, clinical zzso images can be zzso adequately while preserving crucial information, such as zzso The zzso filter preserved the edges more clearly than did other classical filters attached to an zzso diffusion zzso In addition, zzso zzso can improve the zzso ratio of clinical zzso images by more than 2 times zzso Although the zzso time of the zzso processing is very long, zzso of zzso filter images, for which the parameters were zzso can be performed during other zzso zzso zzso The zzso filter was more effective than increasing the number of signal zzso The zzso image quality was improved without extension of the MR scanning zzso zzso zzso in zzso is expected to improve the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
