Despite their importance in gene innovation and zzso variation, duplicated regions have remained largely intractable zzso to difficulties in accurately resolving their structure, copy number and sequence zzso We present an zzso zzso to zzso map next-generation sequence reads, which allows for the prediction of absolute zzso variation of duplicated segments and zzso We examine three human zzso and zzso validate zzso copy number zzso We estimate that, on average, zzso genes vary in copy number between any two individuals and find that these zzso differences overwhelmingly zzso to zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method can distinguish between different copies of highly identical zzso providing a more accurate assessment of gene content and insight into functional constraint without the limitations of zzso zzso
