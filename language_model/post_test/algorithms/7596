We are interested in developing zzso approaches for variable selection problems that incorporate external knowledge on a set of zzso of zzso In particular, we have developed an zzso zzso model uncertainty zzso method, which formally incorporates multiple sources of data via a second-stage zzso model on the probability that any predictor is associated with the outcome of zzso Using simulations, we demonstrate that zzso leads to an increase in power to detect true marginal associations over more commonly used variable selection techniques, such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and elastic zzso In addition, zzso leads to a more efficient model search zzso over the basic zzso method even when the zzso zzso are only modestly zzso The increase in power and efficiency of our method becomes more substantial as the zzso zzso become more zzso Finally, we demonstrate the power and flexibility of zzso for zzso both gene structure and functional zzso information into a candidate gene study investigating over 50 genes in the brain reward system and their role with smoking zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and Treatment zzso
