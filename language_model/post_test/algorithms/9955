We report on the development of a zzso zzso technique for measuring the momentum relaxation time of charge carriers in zzso semiconductor zzso Making use of the zzso model, our phase sensitive zzso technique directly provides the relaxation zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed on zzso zzso and show precise agreement with data obtained by electrical zzso The technique is well suited for studying novel materials where parameters such as the charge zzso effective mass or the carrier density are not known a zzso
