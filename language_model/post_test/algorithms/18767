We introduce a new method for automatic zzso of acoustic radiation force impulse zzso displacement profiles using what have been termed zzso methods for principal component analysis zzso and zzso Unlike classical approaches, the robust methods are less sensitive to high zzso zzso profiles and require no a zzso information regarding expected tissue response to zzso zzso We first validate our methods using synthetic data with additive noise and/or zzso zzso Second, the robust techniques are applied to zzso zzso displacement profiles acquired in an zzso familial zzso zzso pig zzso artery in zzso The zzso zzso results are compared with zzso zzso images showing peak induced displacement and time to zzso recovery and to zzso correlated zzso Our results support that robust techniques outperform conventional zzso and zzso approaches to zzso when zzso data are inclusive of low to relatively high noise levels (up to 5 zzso average zzso zzso to zzso but no zzso for example, zzso correct for robust techniques zzso zzso correct for the classical zzso The robust techniques also perform better than conventional approaches when zzso data are inclusive of moderately high noise levels (10 zzso average zzso to zzso in addition to a high concentration of zzso displacement profiles zzso zzso zzso for example, zzso correct for robust techniques zzso zzso correct for the classical zzso This work suggests that automatic identification of tissue structures exhibiting similar displacement responses to zzso zzso is possible, even in the context of zzso zzso Moreover, this work represents an important first step toward automatic correlation of zzso data to zzso matched zzso
