The magnitude of correlations between zzso responses of pairs of zzso can itself be stimulus zzso We examine how this dependence affects the information carried by neural populations about the stimuli that drive zzso zzso changes in correlations can both carry information directly and zzso the information separately carried by the firing rates and zzso We use Fisher information to zzso these effects and show that, although zzso correlations often carry little information directly, their zzso effects on the overall information can be zzso In particular, if the stimulus dependence is such that correlations increase with zzso firing rates, this can significantly enhance the information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined solely by the zzso However, in the presence of additional strong spatial zzso of zzso such stimulus dependence may have a negative zzso zzso relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing zzso
