Human movements show several prominent zzso movement duration is nearly independent of movement size (the zzso zzso instantaneous speed depends on movement zzso zzso by the 2/3 power zzso and complex movements are composed of simpler elements zzso zzso No existing theory can successfully account for all of these features, and the nature of the underlying motion zzso is still zzso Also unknown is how the brain selects movement zzso Here we present a new theory of movement timing based on geometrical zzso We propose that movement duration and zzso arise from cooperation among zzso zzso and full zzso zzso Each geometry posses a zzso measure of distance along curves, an zzso zzso zzso We suggest that for continuous movements, the actual movement duration reflects a particular zzso mixture of these zzso zzso Near geometrical zzso specific combinations are selected to compensate for time expansion or zzso in individual zzso The theory was zzso formulated using zzso moving frame zzso Its predictions were tested on three data zzso drawings of elliptical curves, locomotion and drawing zzso of complex zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso with varying ratios between the sizes of the large versus the small zzso Our theory accounted well for the zzso and zzso features of these movements, in most cases better than the constrained Minimum zzso model, even when taking into account the number of estimated free zzso During both drawing and locomotion zzso geometry was the most dominant zzso with zzso geometry second most important during zzso zzso geometry was second most important during zzso We further discuss the implications of this zzso the origin of the dominance of zzso zzso the possibility that the brain uses different zzso of these zzso to zzso movement duration and speed, and the zzso of such zzso
