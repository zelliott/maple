We present a novel method for identifying a zzso reaction network based on multiple sets of estimated reaction rates in the corresponding reaction rate equations arriving from various zzso zzso zzso The current method, unlike some of the zzso approaches proposed in the literature, uses the values of the experimental zzso only relative to the geometry of the zzso reactions under the assumption that the underlying reaction network is the same for all the zzso The proposed approach zzso zzso statistical methods in order to zzso the set of possible reactions so as to identify the most likely network structure, and is easily zzso to very complicated zzso systems involving a large number of species and zzso The method is illustrated with a zzso example of a hypothetical network arising from a zzso zzso zzso
