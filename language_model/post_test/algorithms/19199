zzso zzso plays a central role in contemporary magnetic zzso A general feature of zzso zzso is its inherent zzso nature, stemming from the zzso reliance on a series of independent acquisitions to sample the zzso evolutions throughout the indirect time zzso zzso this traditional feature, an acquisition scheme has recently been reported that enables the collection of complete of zzso zzso data sets within one single zzso zzso that the signals to be observed are sufficiently strong, this new zzso protocol can thus shorten the acquisition times of zzso zzso experiments by several orders of zzso This new methodology operates by departing from zzso zzso principles used since the advent of zzso zzso replacing them with a spatial zzso of the spin zzso zzso zzso operates in turn on the basis of novel zzso zzso and magnetic field zzso zzso zzso designed so as to impart on the sample a coherent spin zzso pattern that reflects the internal interactions to be zzso Given the central role played by this new kind of zzso zzso in zzso zzso we devote this review to surveying different zzso that have zzso been proposed for their zzso These include both discrete and continuous versions, zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso The principles underlying these various spatial zzso approaches are treated, their operation is zzso illustrated as well as formally derived within suitable theoretical zzso and an in-depth comparison of their line shape characteristics is zzso
