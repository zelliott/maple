zzso zzso zzso are localized in zzso zzso at zzso zzso and released in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors by zzso zzso may play an important role under zzso conditions and during zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors containing the zzso zzso with an zzso value in the low zzso concentration zzso Here we investigate at the single-channel level the mechanism of high affinity zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases the mean single-channel open duration and channel open probability determined in excised zzso patches, but has no effect on single-channel current zzso A parallel series of experiments demonstrates that lowering zzso pH zzso zzso zzso has a similar effect on zzso single-channel properties as zzso Fitting the sequence of single-channel events with kinetic models suggests that the association of zzso with its binding site enhances zzso zzso zzso further suggests that zzso channels are capable of opening but with a lower open probability than zzso zzso These data and analyses are consistent with zzso zzso of zzso receptors primarily reflecting enhancement of zzso zzso
