It is necessary to remove the noise in zzso before further zzso analysis and zzso For zzso is deeply masked in the noise background, it is very difficult to zzso zzso zzso zzso in this paper is a novel realistic head model based sparse decomposition zzso to zzso zzso which is an zzso procedure combining the zzso physiology of zzso generation into the zzso zzso In this algorithm, the lead field zzso dictionary is zzso calculated according to the realistic head model zzso and then the instantaneous zzso spatial potential is zzso into one sparse combination of atoms in the lead field zzso by matching zzso and the sparse combination of atoms is to be regarded as the zzso zzso zzso The realistic head based sparse decomposition was tested by the simulated noisy potential and a real zzso recording collected in an oddball stimulus experiment, the results consistently confirmed the new method removed the zzso noise in zzso zzso
