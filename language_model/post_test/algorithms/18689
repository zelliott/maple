zzso zzso produce many possible structures of a zzso zzso In most cases some of them resemble the correct structure within an zzso of zzso zzso A major challenge in the field of zzso is to extract the correct structure out of this pool, the so-called zzso Here, we introduce a new scoring function, which discriminates between the many wrong and few true zzso The scoring function is based on measuring the tightness of fit of the two zzso proteins at a predicted binding zzso The location of the binding interface is identified using the recently developed computer zzso zzso The new scoring function does not rely on energy zzso It is therefore tolerant to zzso descriptions of the zzso A linear relation between the score and the zzso relative to the zzso zzso is found in most of the cases zzso The function was tested on the zzso results of 21 complexes in their zzso zzso It was found to be successful in zzso of the examined cases, defining success as scoring a zzso result with a p value of better than zzso
