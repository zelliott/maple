zzso zzso enables one to track rapid pressure zzso We therefore examined whether it was possible to shorten the measurement time without sacrificing zzso We accelerated and zzso cuff zzso and determined zzso and zzso pressure values by the appearance and disappearance of zzso waves based on the zzso cuff zzso wave zzso zzso The accuracy of faster zzso was examined by comparing correlations between invasive zzso and zzso zzso pressure with either the conventional or the faster zzso in 23 patients zzso measurement zzso zzso zzso shortened the measurement time from zzso s to zzso zzso Neither pressure levels nor heart rate altered the time required for zzso zzso analysis indicated that mean and standard zzso of difference between zzso and invasive zzso pressure was comparable zzso zzso zzso faster, zzso zzso without correlations between difference and average of zzso zzso Similar differences zzso zzso zzso faster, zzso zzso and lack of correlations were also found for zzso zzso In conclusion, we succeeded in zzso the zzso measurement time to approximately zzso of the original time without sacrificing zzso This was achieved by acceleration and zzso of cuff zzso and by zzso of the relationship between cuff pressure and zzso wave zzso
