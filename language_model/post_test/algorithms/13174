We develop zzso theory for zzso zzso zzso shock zzso in the framework of the Gardner, or extended zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a generic mathematical model for zzso zzso and zzso zzso wave zzso when effects of higher order zzso become zzso Using a reduced version of the zzso integration method we derive the zzso zzso system in a zzso zzso form and show that it can be mapped onto the well-known zzso system for the zzso zzso zzso The transformation between the two counterpart zzso systems is, however, not zzso As a result, the study of the resolution of an initial zzso for the Gardner equation reveals a rich zzso of solutions which, along with the zzso simple zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waves, and composite solutions representing various combinations of the above zzso We construct full zzso maps of such solutions for both signs of the cubic zzso term in the Gardner zzso Our zzso is supported by zzso zzso
