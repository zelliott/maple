In this paper, a new zzso of the reconstruction problem of electrical zzso zzso zzso is zzso Instead of reconstructing a complete two-dimensional picture, a zzso representation of the gross anatomy is formulated, of which the optimal parameters are determined by minimizing a cost zzso The two great advantages of this method are that the number of unknown parameters of the inverse problem is drastically reduced and that quantitative information of interest zzso lung zzso is estimated directly from the data, without image zzso zzso The forward problem of zzso is to zzso the zzso at the zzso measuring electrodes, for a given set of current injection zzso and a given zzso zzso In this paper, it is proposed to use an improved boundary element method zzso technique to solve the forward problem, in which flat boundary elements are replaced by zzso zzso From a comparison with the zzso solution of the concentric circle model, it appears that the use of zzso elements greatly improves the accuracy of the zzso without increasing the zzso zzso In this zzso the inverse problem is a zzso zzso zzso problem with a limited number of zzso zzso of Powell's and the zzso method are used to minimize the cost zzso The zzso of this solution of the zzso problem was tested in a series of simulation zzso In these studies, zzso data were simulated using a standard conductor geometry and it was attempted to find back this geometry from random starting zzso In the inverse algorithm, different current injection and zzso measurement schemes and different cost functions were zzso In a simulation study, it was demonstrated that a systematic error in the assumed lung zzso results in a zzso error in the lung cross zzso zzso It appears that our zzso zzso of the inverse problem leads to a stable zzso problem, with a high zzso provided that the zzso ratio is about ten or zzso
