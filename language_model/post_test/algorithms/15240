zzso dose has raised significant concerns to patients and operators in modern X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso A simple and cost-effective means to perform a zzso CT scan is to lower the zzso zzso as low as reasonably achievable in data zzso However, the associated image quality with zzso scans (or zzso zzso will be unavoidably zzso due to the excessive data noise, if no adequate noise control is applied during image zzso For image reconstruction with zzso scans, zzso restoration zzso based on modeling the noise properties of measurement can produce an image with zzso artifact suppression, but they often suffer noticeable resolution zzso As an alternative technique, the zzso zzso via zzso image filtering can yield an image without noticeable resolution loss, but they often do not completely eliminate the zzso zzso With above zzso in this paper, we present a zzso restoration induced zzso means zzso image filtering zzso to retain the CT image quality by fully considering the advantages of the zzso restoration and image filtering zzso in zzso image zzso zzso experimental results show that the present zzso zzso zzso the existing methods in terms of cross profile, noise reduction, zzso measure, zzso zzso and receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso
