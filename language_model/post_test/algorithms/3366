A zzso program to analyze finite zzso of normal, zzso zzso or exponential zzso by a maximum likelihood zzso procedure is zzso The program is coded in zzso zzso Some theoretical and practical aspects of the compound zzso are discussed, mainly mathematical zzso fitting procedures and tests of zzso The statistical zzso which is a cluster analysis technique, is presented in a general context for applications in zzso In particular an ecological example is briefly zzso the age class structure resolution of a zzso deer zzso To improve the usefulness for zzso purposes, the link with zzso analysis is zzso For a successful analysis of finite mixture of zzso the need for a large sample size is zzso
