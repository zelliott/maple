zzso zzso for frequently reported compounds of plant essential oils on three different stationary zzso were zzso zzso linear regression, partial least squares, and support zzso machine combined with a new variable selection approach called zzso recently proposed by our group, were employed to model quantitative zzso zzso Internal and external zzso were performed to ensure the stability and zzso zzso All the three methods could obtain an acceptable model, and the optimal results by support zzso machine based on a small number of zzso zzso with the square of correlation zzso for cross zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso stationary phase, the zzso phase with zzso zzso groups, and the zzso stationary phase, zzso The performances of two variable selection approaches, zzso and genetic algorithm, are zzso The importance of the variables was found to be consistent when estimated from correlation zzso in zzso linear zzso equations and selection probability in model zzso
