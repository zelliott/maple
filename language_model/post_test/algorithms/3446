The aim of the present in zzso and in zzso studies was to compare the zzso and penetration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and penetration of two other zzso gels zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso gel zzso on excised human zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies were zzso The zzso studies utilizing zzso Franz diffusion cells allow the determination of the zzso zzso zzso whereas the penetration studies in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and in zzso permit setting up a zzso zzso For this purpose the zzso zzso of zzso from three different gels (each containing zzso zzso over a period of two days were determined at zzso human skin of different zzso The in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were comparable and the transport occurred for both by a factor of zzso faster than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In parallel to the zzso studies with zzso the zzso zzso of caffeine from an zzso was assessed using the skin zzso of the same donors as a quality zzso In a second part of the studies, the in zzso penetration of zzso from zzso was determined over a period of 3 h at three different skin zzso in comparison to a commercially available zzso zzso gel zzso As a main result a zzso profile for zzso and zzso could be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso penetrate to the same order of magnitude into the upper part of the zzso zzso whereas zzso stronger accumulates in the deeper layers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An additional in zzso penetration study was performed with zzso to set up an in zzso zzso zzso zzso Over a period of 3 zzso the amount of zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso being comparable to the in zzso zzso
