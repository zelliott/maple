A common cause for damage to the zzso brain is a shortage in the oxygen supply to the brain or zzso Neonatal zzso are the most frequent manifestation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings allow zzso zzso of seizure zzso 

We want to zzso determine the spatial distribution of the seizure on the zzso the location in time and order the dominant sources in the brain based on their zzso 

In this paper we combine a method based on higher order zzso with subsequent singular value decomposition zzso 

We illustrate the abilities of the method on simulated as well as on real zzso seizure zzso 

The proposed method provides reliable time and spatial information about the seizure, gives a clear overview of what is going on in the zzso and allows easy zzso
