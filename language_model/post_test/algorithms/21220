As more and more evidence has become available, the link between gene and emergent disease has been made including cancer, heart disease and zzso zzso the diseases and designing drugs with respect to the gene and protein level obviously help to find the underlying causes of the diseases, and to improve their rate of zzso The development of modern molecular biology, zzso data collection and analysis techniques provides the scientists with a large amount of gene zzso To draw a link between genes and their relation to disease outcomes and drug discovery is a big challenge: how to analyze large zzso and extract useful zzso Combining zzso with drug discovery is a promising method to tackle this zzso Most techniques of zzso are used in the first two zzso of drug discovery to extract interesting information and find important genes and/or proteins for speeding the process of drug discovery, enhancing the accuracy of analysis and reducing the zzso Gene identification is a very fundamental and important technique among zzso In this paper, we have reviewed gene identification zzso and discussed their zzso relationships and challenges in drug discovery and zzso
