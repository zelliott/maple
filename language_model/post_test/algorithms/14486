zzso rigid registration is the method of choice for aligning medical zzso in diagnostic and zzso surgery zzso The most clinically relevant zzso error measure is the Target Registration zzso zzso which is the distance between the zzso target and the corresponding target defined on another image or on the physical anatomy after zzso The zzso directly depends on the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso between the selected and the actual zzso zzso zzso Since the actual locations of targets usually cannot be measured after zzso the zzso is often estimated by the zzso Registration zzso zzso which is the zzso distance between the zzso in both zzso after zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso However, low zzso and zzso correlations have been reported in clinical practice and in theoretical zzso In this article, we show that for realistic zzso classes, the zzso and the zzso are zzso regardless of the target location and the number of zzso and their zzso and regardless of the zzso magnitude zzso We use a geometrical approach and classical zzso theory to model the zzso and derive its relation to the zzso and zzso zzso We show that, for these zzso classes, the zzso and zzso are also zzso Finally, we show with simulations on clinical data that the zzso correlation is low also in the neighborhood of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and contrary to common practice, the zzso and zzso may not always be used as surrogates for the zzso
