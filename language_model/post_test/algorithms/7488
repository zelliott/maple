zzso zzso zzso requires fast and accurate zzso of prostate in treatment zzso which is challenging due to low tissue contrast and large anatomical variations across zzso On the other hand, in zzso zzso a series of CT images is acquired from the same patient under treatment, which contains valuable zzso information yet is often neglected by previous zzso In this paper, we propose a novel learning zzso namely incremental learning with selective memory zzso to effectively learn the zzso appearance characteristics from these zzso zzso Specifically, starting with a zzso zzso appearance model, zzso aims to zzso the model to fit zzso appearance zzso zzso the model is personalized with two steps, backward pruning that zzso obsolete zzso knowledge, and forward learning that incorporates zzso zzso By effectively combining the zzso characteristics with the general population statistics, the zzso learned appearance model can zzso the prostate of the specific patient much more zzso zzso on a large zzso zzso CT zzso our method achieved high zzso accuracy zzso approximately zzso in 4 zzso
