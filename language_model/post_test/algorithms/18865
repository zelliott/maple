zzso zzso models are commonly employed to estimate zzso parameters related to blood transport and zzso zzso A zzso zzso addresses the question of whether the parameters in a model can be uniquely determined from a given zzso It has been previously shown that the one- and zzso distributed zzso zzso models are zzso from zzso zzso data obtained by zzso zzso In this correspondence, we show that both zzso models are a zzso identifiable from residual zzso data obtained by dynamic zzso zzso zzso We list the various parameters of the zzso models that can be uniquely estimated from zzso imaging data, and discuss this seemingly different outcome for zzso imaging experiments, as compared with the zzso sampling zzso
