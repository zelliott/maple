Independent component analysis zzso of zzso data generates zzso specific brain zzso maps without a zzso assumptions regarding the timing or pattern of the zzso zzso signal zzso However, because of a random zzso among output zzso zzso does not offer a straightforward solution for the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we present an independent zzso analysis zzso method to address the zzso problem during zzso group data zzso In comparison to zzso zzso offers an analysis of additional dependent zzso which were assigned for use in the automated grouping of dependent zzso patterns across zzso Upon testing using simulated zzso zzso data, our proposed method was applied to real zzso data employing both a zzso zzso zzso hand motor zzso and internal speech generation zzso and a zzso zzso zzso hand motor imagery zzso A generalized linear model zzso and the group zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were also applied to the same data set for comparison to zzso Compared to zzso zzso successfully captured zzso patterns even when the functional areas showed variable zzso responses that deviated from a hypothesized zzso We also showed that zzso effectively zzso zzso patterns of unknown origins without the requirement for a zzso stage (such as data zzso in zzso zzso zzso can be used as a potential alternative or an adjunct to current zzso zzso group processing zzso
