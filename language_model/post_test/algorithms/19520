In the zzso era, the zzso information for individual compounds, zzso reactions to be found within named organisms has become readily zzso The well-known zzso and zzso databases provide a comprehensive zzso for this information and have thereby substantially aided the scientific zzso Using these databases, the complement of zzso present in a given zzso can be determined and, in principle, used to reconstruct the zzso zzso However, such reconstructed networks contain numerous properties contradicting biological zzso The zzso networks for a number of organisms are reconstructed from zzso and zzso databases, and features of these networks are related to properties of their originating zzso
