Two separate groups of clinical investigators have provided new information and divergent approaches to the management of acute pulmonary embolism zzso In this position paper, investigators from both groups zzso Investigation of Pulmonary zzso Diagnosis zzso and Canadian study zzso have zzso the combined scientific database in order to zzso seemingly polarized diagnostic recommendations into a single practical zzso 

An in-depth review established the relative risks of deep zzso zzso zzso and the related accuracy of diagnostic zzso In zzso 640 of zzso patients at risk for zzso had either an intermediate probability zzso zzso scan or a zzso scan probability that was zzso with the prior estimate of probability by clinical zzso The risk of zzso in these patients was 16 to 88 percent zzso 34 zzso In this group, we calculated the probability of zzso assuming that tests for zzso had been performed and that 50 percent of patients with zzso have zzso zzso zzso By zzso 108 in 640 patients of whom the diagnosis of zzso was uncertain, would have shown zzso zzso In 239 of these 640 patients, tests for zzso would have been negative and the risks of zzso in these patients is calculated to be less than 10 zzso 

zzso we calculate that in 347 of 640 patients, confident recommendations for treatment or no treatment could have been given without pulmonary zzso zzso in the zzso study group of zzso patients, the need for pulmonary zzso would have been reduced from 640 zzso percent) to zzso patients zzso zzso 

In conclusion, a diagnostic strategy that includes the clinical zzso zzso zzso and evaluation for zzso would decrease the number of patients who require pulmonary zzso from 72 to 33 zzso
