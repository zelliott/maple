We present a novel method for ultrasound zzso image formation wherein lateral resolution of the target is obtained by using traveling zzso waves to zzso the lateral position of targets in the phase of the received zzso We demonstrate that the phase zzso as a function of zzso zzso can be expressed in terms of a zzso transform of the lateral component of the target zzso The inverse zzso obtained by zzso of the phase zzso over a range of zzso wave spatial zzso yields the lateral zzso zzso Range data are recovered from time of flight as in conventional zzso yielding a zzso zzso In contrast to conventional ultrasound imaging, where mechanical or electronic focusing is used and lateral resolution is determined by zzso size and zzso we demonstrate that lateral resolution using the proposed method is independent of the properties of the zzso zzso resolution of the target is achieved using a zzso zzso zzso zzso We present simulated images of targets of uniform and zzso zzso zzso Compounding for zzso reduction is zzso Finally, we demonstrate image formation with an zzso zzso in gelatin zzso of uniform zzso zzso
