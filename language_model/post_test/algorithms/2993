zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso requires thorough monitoring of zzso and oxygen zzso Our aim was to find out whether therapeutic guidance during and after zzso using an zzso based on advanced monitoring, influences zzso zzso and fluid management as well as the length of zzso zzso and hospital zzso 

Patients were zzso into two groups of zzso zzso the conventional monitoring zzso group zzso and the advanced monitoring zzso group zzso In the CM group, therapy was guided by central zzso pressure, mean zzso pressure zzso and heart rate zzso and in the AM group by the zzso blood volume index, zzso HR, central zzso oxygen zzso zzso and cardiac index zzso The zzso were performed before and during surgery, and at 2, 4 and 6 h zzso 

In the AM group, zzso and zzso were given more frequently and were accompanied by increments in zzso zzso and oxygen delivery compared with zzso The percentage of ephedrine administration was higher in the CM zzso The zzso guided by AM decreased time until achieving the status of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso hospital stay by zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso based on advanced zzso monitoring and continuous measurement of zzso zzso early detection and correction of zzso changes and influences the strategy for fluid therapy that can improve the course of zzso period after coronary artery bypass zzso on the beating zzso
