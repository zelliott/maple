zzso zzso is as a critical barrier in the treatment of type 1 diabetes zzso patients and may lead to zzso brain damage, or even zzso zzso zzso is used as a rescue drug to treat severe zzso zzso More recently, in a zzso zzso zzso control, zzso has been used zzso along with insulin for protection against zzso In this context, small doses of zzso are frequently zzso The efficacy and safety of such systems, however, require precise information on the zzso of the zzso transport from the administrative site to the zzso which is currently zzso The goal of this work is to address this need by developing and zzso a mathematical model of zzso zzso transport to the zzso 

Eight zzso models with various levels of complexity were fitted to nine clinical zzso An optimal model was chosen in two consecutive zzso At Step 1, all models were screened for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso At Step 2, the remaining models are compared based on zzso information zzso 

At Step 1, two models were removed for higher zzso fractional zzso Another three were discarded for location of their optimal parameters on the zzso search zzso At Step 2, an optimal model was selected based on the zzso information zzso It has a simple linear structure, assuming that zzso is injected into one zzso from where it enters a pool for a slower release into a third, plasma zzso In the first and third zzso zzso is cleared at a rate zzso to its zzso 

A linear kinetic model of zzso intervention has been developed and zzso It is expected to provide guidance for zzso delivery and the construction of zzso simulation testing zzso
