The placing of novel or zzso proteins on the market, appearing in genetically modified foods, certain zzso and some household products leads to human exposure to proteins that may elicit allergic zzso zzso methods to detect zzso are therefore necessary to ensure zzso zzso We demonstrate that it is possible to reach a new level of accuracy in zzso detection of zzso proteins by presenting a novel zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso extracts variable length zzso sequence fragments and employs modern machine learning techniques in the form of a support zzso zzso In particular, this new detector shows zzso zzso specificity when challenged to the zzso zzso without appreciable loss of zzso zzso is also the first reported detector that successfully discriminates between zzso and zzso occurring in protein families known to hold both zzso zzso assessment for specific protein sequences of interest using zzso is possible via zzso
