We propose a model for the control of zzso eye movements using zzso random zzso zzso eye movements produce random zzso of the retinal image to prevent zzso zzso First, we demonstrate that a transition from persistent to zzso correlations occurs in data recorded from a visual fixation zzso Second, we propose and investigate a delayed zzso model and get, by comparison of the transition points, an estimate of the zzso zzso zzso between horizontal and vertical components of eye movements are found which can be explained zzso Finally, we compare our zzso results with zzso zzso
