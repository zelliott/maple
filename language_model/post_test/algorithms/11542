Death in zzso zzso was related in the past to pulmonary zzso of the zzso zzso However, high zzso zzso tension on final collapse led to the suggestion that the heart and not the lung is the first organ that zzso We measured zzso flow, coronary flow, left zzso pressure, affluent and zzso zzso zzso and pH in the working heart excised from control and zzso zzso rats zzso zzso The oxygen consumption zzso of experimental hearts was not different from control, but mechanical power output zzso zzso from zzso zzso was reduced as a function of zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso indexes, zzso zzso and zzso time zzso of pressure, increased as a function of zzso exposure time, being below control values after 50 h and above control values after 60 zzso The individual slopes for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso rose as a function of exposure time from values below control after 50 h exposure to values above control after 60 zzso zzso efficiency zzso decreased as a function of zzso exposure time and points to possible heart failure in the intact zzso After 50 h zzso exposure the heart was energetically more efficient than the zzso zzso changes in the heart are zzso
