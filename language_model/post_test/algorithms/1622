Comprehensive two-dimensional gas zzso zzso mass zzso zzso has been used for zzso profiling in zzso However, there is still much experimental variation to be controlled including both zzso and zzso zzso For efficient analysis, an ideal peak alignment method to deal with such variations is in great zzso 

Using experimental data of a mixture of zzso standards, we demonstrated that our method has better performance than other existing method which is not zzso We then applied our method to the data generated from the plasma of a zzso which also demonstrates good performance of our zzso 

We developed a zzso peak alignment method to process both homogeneous and zzso experimental zzso The unique feature of our method is the only zzso peak alignment method coupled with zzso identification in an unified zzso Through the comparison with other existing method, we demonstrated that our method has better zzso Data are available at zzso The R source codes are available at zzso
