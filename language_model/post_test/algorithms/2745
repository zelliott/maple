Nowadays, the use of advanced control strategies in biotechnology is quite zzso A main reason is the lack of quality of the data, and the fact that more sophisticated control strategies must be based on a model of the dynamics of zzso The zzso of the zzso and the absence of cheap and reliable zzso require an enhanced modeling effort and identification strategies for the zzso The present work approaches modeling and control strategies for the zzso synthesis of zzso that is carried out inside a zzso zzso First, a zzso zzso model of this zzso is obtained by using a novel modeling procedure for zzso the bond graph zzso Second, a high gain observer is designed for the zzso of the imprecisely known zzso of the synthesis zzso Third, by combining an exact zzso control law with the zzso zzso zzso algorithm, a zzso zzso control law is zzso The case study discussed shows that a zzso feedback control strategy applied to the zzso synthesis zzso can cope with zzso noisy zzso and zzso zzso zzso simulations performed with zzso environment are included in order to test the behavior and the performances of the proposed zzso and control zzso
