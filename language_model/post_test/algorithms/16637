In a zzso zzso system using protected templates, a zzso zzso is the part of a protected template that can be directly zzso Each compared pair of zzso identifiers results in a decision testing whether both identifiers are derived from the same zzso zzso Compared to an unprotected system, most existing zzso template protection methods cause to a certain extent degradation in zzso zzso Fusion is therefore a promising way to enhance the zzso performance in zzso zzso zzso Compared to feature level fusion and score level fusion, decision level fusion has not only the least fusion complexity, but also the maximum zzso across different zzso features, template protection and recognition zzso templates formats, and comparison score zzso However, performance improvement via decision level fusion is not zzso It is influenced by both the dependency and the performance gap among the conducted tests for zzso We investigate in this paper several fusion scenarios zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso on the zzso decision level, and evaluate their zzso performance and fusion efficiency on a zzso fingerprint database with zzso zzso
