zzso parentage zzso depends on the distribution of a zzso zzso which, in most cases of interest, cannot be exactly determined, but only zzso by zzso Carlo zzso We provide zzso zzso for efficiently zzso very small tail probabilities in the distribution of the zzso zzso These zzso methods allow the zzso of small zzso rates and hence permit zzso zzso of parentage in large studies involving a great number of potential parents and many potential zzso We investigate the performance of these zzso zzso in the context of parentage zzso using zzso zzso zzso data and find that they may accelerate the zzso of tail probabilities zzso zzso We subsequently use the zzso zzso to calculate the power available with zzso for large-scale parentage studies, paying particular attention to the effect of zzso errors and the occurrence of related individuals among the members of the putative zzso zzso These simulations show that zzso zzso may allow accurate pedigree zzso even in situations involving thousands of potential mothers, fathers, and zzso In addition, we compare the power of zzso parentage zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is much more powerful under many zzso zzso zzso would require zzso more zzso zzso to achieve the same accuracy as the zzso approach in one common zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso are a powerful tool for parentage zzso in large managed and/or natural zzso
