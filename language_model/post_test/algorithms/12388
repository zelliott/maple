The inverse distance method, one of the commonly used methods for analyzing spatial variation of zzso is flexible if the order of distances in the method is zzso By applying the genetic zzso zzso the optimal order of distances can be found to minimize the difference between estimated and measured zzso zzso A case study of the zzso zzso watershed in Taiwan is described in the present zzso The results show that the zzso of the order of distances is small when the topography of zzso stations is zzso Moreover, when zzso characteristic is uniform, the horizontal distance between zzso stations and zzso locations is the major factor influencing the order of zzso The results also verify that the zzso inverse distance method is more suitable than the zzso average method and the zzso zzso method in describing the spatial variation of zzso The efficiency and reliability of zzso modeling and hence of general water resource management can be significantly improved by more accurate zzso data zzso by the zzso inverse distance zzso
