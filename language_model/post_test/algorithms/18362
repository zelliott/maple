zzso based finite element zzso are becoming increasingly popular in zzso zzso zzso to the demand for zzso that links organ function to zzso distributed properties at the zzso cell and tissue zzso We present a collection of zzso based finite element zzso of the zzso system and other zzso suitable for use in zzso zzso These zzso are derived from the widely used Visible Human zzso zzso and constitute a contribution to the world wide International Union of zzso Sciences zzso zzso Project zzso The method of mesh generation and fitting of zzso zzso volume zzso to a given zzso is illustrated using a zzso zzso that is modified with smoothing zzso constraints via the penalty method to account for sparse and scattered zzso A technique zzso zzso zzso based on zzso deformation zzso is used to zzso the fitted zzso zzso Lung zzso the zzso zzso muscle and the lower limb bones are used as examples to illustrate these zzso zzso of the lower zzso knee joint, zzso and neck are also zzso Finally, the issues and limitations of the methods are zzso
