zzso zzso is one of the most widely used techniques in diagnostic zzso It comprises at least one-third of all diagnostic zzso procedures in zzso However, in the picture archive and communication system, images are often stored with the projection and orientation unknown or zzso which causes inefficiency for zzso zzso To address this problem, an automatic hanging protocol for chest zzso is zzso The method targets the most effective region in a chest zzso and extracts a set of zzso zzso and zzso features from zzso Then, a well-trained zzso is used to recognize the zzso The orientation of the zzso is later identified by locating the neck, heart, and abdomen positions in the zzso zzso experiments are performed on the zzso collected from daily routine chest exams in hospitals and show promising zzso Using the presented zzso zzso of all cases could be hung correctly on projection view (without zzso zzso and zzso had correct orientation (without zzso zzso A zzso study on the protocol also demonstrates a significant improvement in efficiency for image zzso
