zzso zzso and identification of zzso in spinal imaging is crucial for the clinical tasks of diagnosis, surgical planning, and zzso zzso The main difficulties for automatic methods arise from the frequent presence of abnormal spine zzso small field of view, and image artifacts caused by surgical zzso Many previous methods rely on zzso models of appearance and shape whose performance can substantially degrade for pathological zzso We propose a robust zzso and identification zzso which builds upon supervised zzso forests and avoids an explicit zzso model of zzso We overcome the tedious requirement for dense zzso by a zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso zzso are transformed into dense zzso labels which capture the inherent identification zzso Using the dense labels, we learn a zzso zzso zzso based on local and contextual intensity features which is robust to typical characteristics of spinal zzso and image zzso zzso evaluation is performed on a challenging zzso of 224 spine CT scans of patients with varying zzso including high-grade zzso zzso and presence of surgical zzso Additionally, we test our method on a zzso zzso of another zzso mostly zzso zzso zzso evaluation is carried out with respect to zzso errors and identification rates, and compared to a recently proposed zzso Our approach is efficient and zzso state-of-the-art on pathological zzso
