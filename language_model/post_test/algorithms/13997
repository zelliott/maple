Most studies on zzso zzso resistance of human zzso virus zzso have been done on zzso B which only represent a limited proportion of infections zzso 

zzso baseline zzso to zzso in non-B zzso 

To explore in greater detail possible intrinsic resistance to zzso drugs in non-B zzso zzso resistance was tested in 35 non-B zzso D, zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso treatment zzso zzso The panel includes strains with an increasing number of minor zzso in the zzso gene and/or with zzso zzso at positions associated with resistance in zzso and zzso 

We detected zzso resistance zzso values equal or superior to biological test zzso zzso in 14 of the 35 zzso 4 strains had decreased in zzso zzso to more than one zzso However, it is important to note that in most cases the increased zzso were close to the zzso zzso resistance was observed against each of the three zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso could be associated with decreased in zzso zzso 1 of 3 strains only with zzso zzso in zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in reverse zzso Interestingly, the presence of an increasing number of minor zzso in the zzso gene was not associated with decreased in zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

It is necessary to continue zzso studies on zzso B strains to identify the role of all zzso present in zzso and zzso genes and to zzso interpretation zzso Data obtained from large, diverse populations of zzso infected individuals is critical for defining and zzso the zzso of resistance zzso and zzso zzso
