zzso is a complex zzso disorder with high zzso and an unclear zzso The identification of key genes related to zzso may zzso its zzso The current study provides an approach to predicting zzso zzso zzso Genes are first extracted from the biomedical literature, and some zzso zzso genes are then recognized as seeds by the prior zzso As candidates, the remaining genes are predicted by creating association rules between the seeds and zzso In an evaluated data set, 27 zzso zzso genes zzso zzso are extracted and 43 possible zzso zzso genes zzso zzso are zzso The sum of zzso and zzso genes accounts for zzso of the data set that are not contained in the typical database of zzso zzso zzso Our approach can effectively extract and predict zzso zzso genes from the biomedical zzso These predicted results complement the typical database of zzso zzso zzso The web portal for the predicted results, which is freely available at zzso can be a valuable resource in studies of diseases related to zzso
