The traditional Low Energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol is a zzso zzso The uneven selection of cluster heads results in premature death of cluster heads and premature blind zzso inside the zzso thus reducing the overall lifetime of the zzso With a full consideration of information on energy and distance distribution of neighboring zzso inside the zzso this paper proposes a new zzso zzso based on differential evolution zzso to improve the zzso zzso zzso To meet the requirements of monitoring applications in outdoor environments such as the zzso zzso and zzso ecological zzso the proposed zzso uses the simple and fast search features of DE to zzso the zzso selection of cluster heads and prevent blind zzso for improved energy efficiency and system zzso zzso results show that the proposed new zzso zzso zzso has better performance, effectively extends the working lifetime of the system, and improves the quality of the wireless sensor zzso
