Many patients have their hospital discharge delayed because their chest tube drainage is too high, despite the fact that there are no data to support the commonly used 250 zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with a prospective database and prospective zzso from one zzso All patients underwent zzso pulmonary zzso The last chest tube was removed if there was no air leak and zzso drainage of 450 zzso or zzso 

The study comprised zzso operations and zzso patients who underwent an zzso zzso pulmonary zzso via zzso by one general zzso surgeon over a 10-year zzso zzso patients went home with a chest tube zzso to air zzso The remaining 1988 patients were discharged without a chest zzso zzso of pulmonary zzso were wedge zzso in zzso patients, zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso The median day of discharge was zzso day zzso One hundred one zzso were readmitted to the hospital within 60 days of zzso The most common reason for zzso was zzso and zzso Only 11 zzso had zzso zzso to zzso symptomatic zzso and most were treated with zzso zzso zzso was zzso at 4 weeks and zzso at 8 zzso 

zzso tubes can be removed with up to 450 zzso of zzso drainage after pulmonary zzso and perhaps a higher volume could be zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso is zzso zzso and the practice of leaving the tube in longer for drainage less than 450 zzso is unsupported in the zzso
