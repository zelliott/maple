The main goal of this study was to study the performance of fuzzy logic controllers combined with simplified hybrid zzso zzso zzso to regulate muscle force via nerve electrical zzso The recruitment zzso with zzso and AM zzso were constructed for the calf muscles of zzso Integrated with the zzso methods, a zzso zzso and three fuzzy logic controllers were designed and applied for the electrical stimulation of zzso nerves to control the ankle zzso under zzso zzso The performance of the two zzso methods combined with the four controllers was compared when the ankle was fixed at three positions for both in zzso experiments and model simulations using a zzso muscle zzso For the animal experiments, zzso zzso performed better than AM zzso zzso The fuzzy zzso controller performed marginally better and was resistant to external noises, though it tended to have a larger zzso The performance of the controllers had a similar trend in the three different joint positions, and the simulation results with the zzso model matched the experimental results zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso improved controller performance, while the contribution of fuzzy logic was only zzso
