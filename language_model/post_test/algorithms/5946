The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented technological progress in the development of continuous zzso sensors, resulting in the first generation of commercial zzso zzso This has zzso the development of prototypes of a zzso system based on the combination of a continuous zzso a control algorithm, and an insulin zzso 

A review of zzso zzso approaches is zzso This is followed by a review of existing prototypes and associated zzso zzso A literature review was undertaken from 1960 to zzso 

Two main approaches zzso The zzso zzso approach employs subcutaneous zzso monitoring and subcutaneous insulin zzso The zzso zzso approach adopts intravenous sampling and zzso insulin zzso zzso of both solutions has been demonstrated in small-scale laboratory studies using either the classical zzso controller or a model zzso zzso Performance in the home setting has yet to be zzso 

The zzso monitor remains the main limiting factor in the development of a commercially viable zzso system, as presently available monitors fail to demonstrate satisfactory characteristics in terms of reliability and/or zzso Regulatory issues are the second limiting zzso zzso systems are likely to be used first by health-care professionals in controlled environments such as intensive care zzso
