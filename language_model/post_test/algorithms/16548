Many organisms and objects zzso zzso when moving, requiring zzso to separate shape changes from object zzso Surprisingly, the abilities of observers to correctly zzso zzso zzso shapes from motion cues have not been measured, and structure from motion models predominantly use zzso of rigidity zzso We show that observers are equally sensitive at discriminating zzso of flexing and rigid zzso based on motion cues, when the zzso are rotated simultaneously around the vertical and depth zzso A zzso model based on motion perspective zzso assuming perceived depth is zzso zzso to local zzso predicted the zzso zzso better than shape from motion zzso models using shape or trajectory basis zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso arising because of zzso zzso profiles, provided additional evidence for the dominant role of relative zzso in shape zzso Finally, we show that inexperienced observers are generally incapable of using motion cues to detect zzso of rigid and flexing zzso but this handicap can be overcome with practice for both zzso and rigid zzso The empirical and zzso results of this study argue against the use of rigidity assumptions in zzso zzso shape from motion and for the primacy of motion zzso zzso from motion zzso
