This paper investigates a new approach devoted to displacement zzso zzso in ultrasound zzso The main idea is to adapt the image formation to a given displacement zzso method to increase the precision of the zzso The displacement is identified as the zero crossing of the phase of the complex zzso between signals extracted from the lateral direction of the ultrasound zzso zzso For precise displacement zzso a zzso of the phase slope is needed as well as a high phase zzso zzso a particular point spread function zzso dedicated to this zzso is zzso This zzso showing zzso in the lateral direction, leads to synthesis of lateral zzso zzso The zzso is included in a zzso displacement zzso zzso zzso The improvement of this approach is evaluated zzso by simulation zzso A comparison with a zzso tracking technique is also zzso The lateral zzso improve both the zzso tracking zzso and our zzso zzso zzso Using our dedicated images, the precision of the zzso is improved by reducing the standard zzso of the lateral displacement error by a factor of 2 for zzso tracking and more than 3 with our method compared to using conventional zzso Our method performs 7 times better than zzso zzso zzso the improvement in the case of a pure lateral translation reaches a factor of zzso Finally, the experimental feasibility of the zzso displacement zzso zzso is demonstrated on data acquired from a zzso zzso
