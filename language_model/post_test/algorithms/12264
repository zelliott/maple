The compact zzso Algorithm zzso is an zzso of Distribution Algorithm that generates offspring population according to the estimated zzso model of the parent population instead of using traditional zzso and zzso zzso The zzso only needs a small amount of zzso therefore, it may be quite useful in zzso zzso This paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying the zzso from the convergence point of view in which, we model the zzso by a zzso process and approximate its behavior using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Then, we prove that the corresponding zzso zzso to local zzso and stays zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso will zzso to the local zzso of the function to be zzso
