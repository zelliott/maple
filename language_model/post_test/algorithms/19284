Mass zzso plays a crucial role in zzso detection zzso systems for the zzso of suspicious regions in zzso In this article we present a completely automated zzso system for the detection of masses in digitized zzso zzso The tool system we discuss consists in three processing zzso zzso Image zzso for the zzso of regions of interest zzso This step relies on an zzso zzso threshold zzso able to select zzso closed contours around gray level zzso of the zzso zzso zzso characterization by means of textural features zzso from the gray tone spatial dependence zzso zzso containing zzso spatial statistics information on the zzso gray level zzso As the images under study were recorded in different centers and with different machine settings, eight zzso features were selected so as to be zzso under zzso zzso In this way, the images do not need to be zzso as the adopted features depend on the texture only, rather than on the gray tone levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of a neural network, with supervision provided by the zzso zzso The zzso system was evaluated on a large database of zzso zzso images zzso negative, zzso pathological (or zzso containing at least one confirmed mass, as diagnosed by an expert zzso To assess the performance of the system, receiver operating characteristic zzso and zzso zzso analysis were zzso The area under the zzso curve was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso When evaluating the accuracy of the zzso against the zzso zzso zzso false zzso per image are found at zzso of mass zzso
