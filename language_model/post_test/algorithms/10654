Classical sorting by zzso uses the zzso model, that is, each reversal zzso an equal zzso This model limits the biological meaning of sorting by zzso zzso and his colleagues extended it by assigning a cost function zzso zzso zzso for all alpha zzso or zzso where zzso is the length of the reversed zzso In this paper, we extend their results by considering a model in which long zzso are zzso Using the same cost function above for permitted zzso we present tight or nearly tight bounds for the worst-case cost of sorting by zzso Then we develop zzso to approximate the optimal cost to sort a given zzso sequence as well as a given zzso Our proposed problems are more biologically meaningful and more zzso general and challenging than the problem considered by zzso et zzso Furthermore, our bounds are tight and nearly tight, whereas our zzso provide good approximation ratios compared to the optimal cost to sort zzso sequences or permutations by zzso
