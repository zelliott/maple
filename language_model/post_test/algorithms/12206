This work presents conditions for zzso and zzso zzso removal from zzso solutions using natural, zzso and zzso treated zzso of zzso A removal of zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso can be zzso The zzso material is characterized using scanning electron zzso energy zzso X-ray zzso infrared zzso zzso analysis, before and after the contact with the zzso containing zzso zzso The results obtained from the characterization techniques indicate that the metal zzso remains on the surface of the zzso zzso The percentage removal is found to depend on the initial zzso concentration and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso process is maximum at pH 4, using zzso of zzso per liter of zzso zzso The natural zzso of zzso showed a zzso zzso capacity that was adequately described by the zzso zzso zzso Finally, an actual mine drainage sample that contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ni and zzso was tested under optimal conditions for zzso removal and zzso of zzso was found to be a suitable zzso zzso The use of this waste material for the treatment of zzso zzso solutions as well as mine drainage is effective and zzso
