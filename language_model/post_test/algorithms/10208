zzso targeted zzso therapy requires zzso zzso of organ zzso The organ doses are estimated from quantitative nuclear medicine imaging studies, many of which involve zzso whole body zzso We have previously developed the quantitative zzso zzso processing method and demonstrated its ability to provide more accurate activity estimates than conventional zzso zzso zzso processing methods using physical phantom and simulation zzso The zzso method uses the maximum zzso zzso algorithm, zzso organ volume of interests zzso and rigorous models of physical image degrading factors to estimate organ zzso However, the zzso method requires alignment between the zzso organ zzso and the zzso zzso projections and assumes uniform activity distribution in each zzso This makes application to patients zzso As a result, in this paper we propose an extended zzso zzso method that provides zzso rigid registration and includes multiple background zzso We have validated this method using both zzso Carlo simulation and patient zzso In the simulation study, we evaluated the precision and accuracy of the method in comparison to the original zzso zzso For the patient studies, we compared organ activity estimates at 24 h after injection with those from conventional geometric zzso zzso zzso using a 24 h zzso quantitative zzso reconstruction as the gold zzso We also compared the goodness of fit of the measured and estimated projections obtained from the zzso method to those from the original method at four other time points where gold standard data were not zzso In the simulation study, more accurate activity estimates were provided by the zzso method for all the zzso at all the time points compared with the zzso zzso Based on the patient data, we concluded that the zzso method provided a substantial increase in accuracy of organ activity estimates from 24 h zzso images compared to the zzso using 24 h zzso as the golden zzso For other time points, where no golden standard is available, better agreement between estimated and measured projections was observed by using the zzso method compared to the zzso zzso This phenomenon is consistent with the improvement in goodness of fit seen in both simulation data and 24 h patient zzso zzso this indicates the improved reliability of organ activity estimates obtained though the zzso zzso
