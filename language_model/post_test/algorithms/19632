It has been generally agreed that changes in light transmission detected by zzso are not exclusively attributable to zzso changes, but also include a contribution from scattering by constituents of the brain zzso which is not transparent, but zzso If the light scattering is constant, light transmission can be zzso by an equation similar to zzso zzso However, upon brain zzso it is known that the blood flow invariably zzso We have shown that light scattering by blood per zzso increases zzso interfering with the measurement of the intrinsic signals from zzso I call this the flow zzso Here, in responses to zzso comments, I present additional evidence of the flow effect, which arises from zzso zzso and further point out the zzso of using zzso range zzso for the zzso of blood zzso even though their use is unavoidable in practice, because this wavelength range offers the best transmission through the zzso In zzso I believe that the zzso signal is a function of both flow zzso effect, which becomes the zzso contributor when blood flow zzso and metabolism zzso zzso change, which becomes accordingly a minor zzso If the contribution of the flow effect is unknown, any mathematical equation describing the zzso zzso is a zzso equation which has no zzso This does not mean that I deny the clinical usefulness of zzso which definitely provides an indication of some biological changes in the brain in response to zzso However, great care is needed in the interpretation of the zzso
