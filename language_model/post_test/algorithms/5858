The effect of zzso zzso concentration on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso onto cellulosic fibers with different charge profiles was zzso Surface zzso fibers were obtained by zzso zzso cellulose zzso onto the fiber surface and bulk zzso fibers were obtained by reacting the fibers with zzso zzso It was shown that zzso interactions do not exist between cellulose and zzso rather zzso interactions govern the zzso zzso zzso prevails under zzso conditions, whereas surface charge zzso occurs at higher zzso zzso It was shown that charge zzso prevails if the thickness of the electric double layer zzso was larger than the mean distance between the charges on the fiber surface, as predicted by zzso zzso theories, taking lateral correlation effects into zzso In a second set of experiments the zzso technique served to independently zzso the zzso zzso for determining the surface charge of cellulosic zzso Various molecular masses of zzso were zzso to zzso fibers having different charge zzso The zzso of low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed by zzso zzso was about 10 times higher than that of the high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the difference in accessibility of these two zzso to the fiber cell wall, zzso surface analysis zzso as expected, only slight differences between the two zzso This gives strong credibility to the idea that surface charge content of cellulosic fibers can be analyzed by means of zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso
