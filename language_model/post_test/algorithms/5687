zzso source zzso pollutants such as zzso zzso zzso and pesticides are the zzso sources of water contamination in many of the water bodies in the Midwestern agricultural zzso This problem is expected to increase in the future with the increasing demand to provide corn as grain or zzso for zzso zzso Best management practices zzso have been proven to effectively reduce the zzso zzso loads from agricultural zzso However, in a watershed with multiple farms and multiple zzso feasible for zzso it becomes a daunting task to choose a right combination of zzso that provide maximum pollution reduction for least zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of searching from a large number of solutions are required to meet the given watershed management zzso zzso zzso have been the most popular zzso zzso for the zzso selection and zzso However, previous zzso zzso models did not study zzso which is very commonly used in corn zzso Also, with corn zzso being projected as a viable alternative for zzso production there might be unintended consequences of the reduced zzso in the corn fields on water zzso zzso there is a need to study the impact of different levels of zzso management in combination with other zzso at a watershed zzso In this research the following zzso were selected for placement in the zzso zzso zzso management, zzso filter zzso zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso farming, and zzso zzso We present a novel method of combing different zzso pollutants into a single objective function, which, along with the net costs, were used as the two objective functions during zzso In this study we used zzso zzso a database that contains the pollution reduction and cost information of different zzso under consideration which provides zzso loads during zzso The zzso zzso was performed using a zzso based search zzso The model was tested for the selection and placement of zzso in zzso Creek Watershed, a corn dominated watershed located in zzso Indiana, to reduce zzso zzso zzso and zzso losses from the zzso The zzso optimal fronts zzso as zzso zzso generated between the zzso objective functions can be used to make management decisions to achieve desired water quality goals with minimum zzso zzso and maintenance cost for the zzso Also these solutions were geographically mapped to show the locations where various zzso should be zzso The solutions with larger pollution reduction consisted of buffer filter strips that lead to larger pollution reduction with greater costs compared to other zzso
