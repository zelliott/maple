The zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso is currently made via a fine needle aspiration zzso zzso It is estimated that somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 zzso zzso zzso are performed in the United States zzso However, a large percentage zzso zzso of these zzso turn out to be zzso Since the aggressive zzso management of zzso zzso is costly, quantitative risk assessment and zzso of a zzso zzso is of value in zzso and more appropriate zzso resources zzso In this paper, we introduce a new method for zzso the zzso zzso based on the ultrasound zzso zzso zzso Unlike approaches to assess the zzso of a zzso zzso by visually inspecting the zzso pattern in the strain image, we use a zzso zzso to zzso the zzso by using the power spectrum of strain rate zzso extracted from the US zzso image zzso zzso from the carotid artery was used to compress the zzso zzso zzso data previously acquired from 98 zzso zzso were used in this retrospective study to evaluate our zzso zzso A zzso was developed based on the linear zzso analysis zzso and used to differentiate the zzso zzso into two zzso zzso no zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using our method, 62 zzso were classified as type I, all of which were benign, while 36 zzso were classified as zzso 16 zzso and 20 benign, resulting in a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in detecting zzso zzso zzso This indicates that our zzso method based on US zzso has the potential to substantially reduce the number of zzso zzso zzso by detecting benign zzso and managing them via follow-up observations rather than an zzso zzso
