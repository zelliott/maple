Cancer is associated with specific cellular zzso changes, such as increased nuclear size and crowding from rapidly zzso zzso In zzso tissue imaging using fluorescent zzso may be useful for zzso detection of residual cancer in surgical tumor zzso We developed a zzso zzso structured zzso microscope zzso system with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resolution zzso zzso The objectives of this work were to measure the relationship between zzso pattern frequency and optical zzso strength and zzso ratio in zzso zzso zzso samples for selection of the optimum frequency, and to determine feasibility for detecting residual cancer on tumor zzso margins, using a genetically engineered primary mouse model of zzso The SIM system was tested in tissue mimicking solid zzso with various scattering levels to determine impact of both zzso and zzso frequency on two SIM zzso optical section thickness and zzso zzso To demonstrate zzso zzso ex zzso 50 zzso frozen sections and fresh intact thick tissue samples excised from a primary mouse model of zzso were stained with zzso orange, which zzso cell zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso The cell zzso were segmented using a zzso filter algorithm, which allowed zzso of nuclear zzso The results showed that the optimal zzso frequency was zzso zzso used in conjunction with a 4 zzso zzso zzso objective zzso This yielded an optical section thickness of 128 zzso and an zzso zzso contrast enhancement over uniform zzso We successfully demonstrated the ability to resolve cell zzso in zzso achieved via zzso which allowed zzso of zzso from zzso zzso in the presence of considerable background zzso Specifically, we demonstrate that optical zzso of fresh intact thick zzso performed zzso in regards to nuclear density zzso to physical frozen zzso and standard zzso
