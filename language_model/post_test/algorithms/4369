zzso with zzso tuberculosis zzso results in immune cell recruitment to the zzso forming zzso regions zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso The objective of this study was to accurately identify and characterize these regions from zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso The two target regions zzso and zzso zzso can be identified by their zzso zzso Their most zzso characteristic on zzso slides is cell zzso We developed a zzso zzso called zzso to detect and zzso high zzso regions in zzso zzso zzso employed a novel zzso zzso distance calculation and zzso zzso zzso to detect and zzso high zzso zzso Lung tissue slides of mice zzso infected with zzso were stained with zzso and zzso A total of 21 digital slides were used to develop and train the zzso zzso The performance of the framework was evaluated using two main outcome zzso correct detection of potential regions, and correct zzso of potential regions into zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided a detection accuracy of zzso while it correctly classified zzso of the detected regions for the images where the expert pathologist produced the same ground truth during the first and second round of zzso We showed that zzso could detect high zzso regions in a zzso cell environment with zzso tissue zzso
