zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso zzso software packages commercially available from Hewlett-Packard and zzso zzso zzso and various related compounds were chosen as the test mixture for the comparison of these zzso zzso data were collected on both systems using the same 10 mobile phase compositions, equally spaced across an zzso zzso The comparison focused on determining the performance of both packages with respect to the prediction of the mobile phase composition required to achieve an optimal zzso Both software systems are zzso with differing amounts of operator involvement required and employing slightly different approaches to zzso peak movements between the 10 sets of zzso The predicted optimal zzso compositions are evaluated in terms of the extent the information collected across the zzso plane was used by the various zzso in the two zzso Our results demonstrate the importance of zzso the component operations involved in and the limitations of any software package that is used in zzso zzso The operator should always remember that both systems are simply tools and design experiments appropriately, since the quality of the final result is highly dependent on a combination of the operator's objective, the capability of the system and the appropriateness of the data zzso
