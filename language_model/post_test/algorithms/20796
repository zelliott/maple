zzso zzso a class of short zzso zzso are emerging as important agents of post zzso gene regulation and integral components of gene zzso zzso have been strongly linked to stem cells, which have a remarkable dual role in zzso They can either continuously replenish themselves zzso or differentiate into cells that execute a limited number of specific actions zzso 

In order to identify novel zzso from narrow windows of development we carried out an in zzso search for zzso elements zzso in adult tissue zzso transcript zzso A plethora of previously unknown zzso candidates were revealed including zzso small zzso that are enriched in embryonic stem zzso cells over adult zzso zzso zzso of these novel candidates are zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells that are impaired in zzso zzso The zzso zzso candidates exhibit distinct and opposite expression trends from zzso (an abundant class in adult zzso during zzso acid zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of trends is found in both zzso and novel candidates in zzso zzso cells, which display loss of repression of zzso genes upon zzso 

Combining expression profile information with zzso target zzso we identified zzso pairs that correlate with zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso of these pairs in the zzso zzso zzso suggests a role for zzso in the core regulatory networks underlying zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso
