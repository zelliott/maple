We have used the program zzso which employs the zzso folding algorithm, to identify regions of stable secondary structure in three chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have found that use of reverse zzso to zzso a zzso template for amplification by the zzso chain reaction is successful only if the region chosen for amplification does not contain stem structures with calculated free energies less than zzso zzso
