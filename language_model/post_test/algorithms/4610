In the past, most design and zzso work on hybrid video zzso relied mainly on experimental zzso A proper theoretical model is always desirable, since this allows us to explain the phenomena of existing zzso and to design better zzso In this paper, we make use of the zzso zzso model to derive an zzso zzso zzso model for the zzso motion compensation frame difference zzso zzso A major assumption of our derivation is that the net deformation of zzso is zzso in general, rather than a uniform error distribution in a zzso We have also shown that the imperfect zzso motion compensation is significant to the theoretical study and the behavior of zzso zzso zzso of our experimental work show that the derived model can describe the statistical characteristics of the zzso signals zzso The model also shows that the zzso formulated zzso motion compensation can result in an incorrect zzso zzso function while, conversely, it can form a better zzso motion compensation zzso
