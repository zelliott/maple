To evaluate Off zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso echoes zzso for the zzso of left zzso zzso zzso and zzso function and compare it with the previously validated zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images were acquired with zzso and zzso in healthy volunteers zzso The zzso method was used to automatically estimate zzso zzso and zzso twist parameters from rotation of the zzso echo and zzso zzso about the middle of zzso subsequent to zzso zzso of user zzso 

There was no significant difference between measures obtained for zzso and zzso for mean peak twist zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso angle zzso versus zzso zzso twisting rate zzso versus zzso zzso zzso rate zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso versus zzso zzso and time of peak twist zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso also provided measures of duration of zzso zzso zzso and the ratio of rapid zzso to peak twist zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso twist data demonstrates excellent agreement with a bias of zzso and zzso confidence intervals of zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso method that provides a quick and quantitative assessment of zzso zzso and zzso twist and zzso zzso zzso zzso accrued during tagging preparation and zzso and visibly removes chemical shift from the tagging pattern, which zzso greater zzso to the derived quantitative zzso
