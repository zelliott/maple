In this contribution, we discuss a molecular representation mode for the generation of reduced descriptions of flexible molecules in various zzso The representations of the zzso zzso are constituted by zzso of zzso obtained through a zzso merging zzso which combines the location of zzso electron density zzso zzso with the decomposition of the molecular structures into zzso The representations are then aligned through the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The evaluation function of the alignment solutions is based on the local density values of the zzso and their zzso The applications show that the alignment of a given zzso onto itself, in a different zzso is successful when a zzso path length is considered in the evaluation function of the solution, while Cartesian distances are more adapted to the scoring for alignments of two different molecules in their zzso zzso zzso are compared with the available literature zzso
