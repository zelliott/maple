The goal of the work was to develop a zzso computer system providing a zzso integration of informational and software resources on the regulation of gene expression and navigation through zzso Rapid growth of the variety and volume of information accumulated in the databases on regulation of gene expression necessarily requires the development of computer systems for automated discovery of the knowledge that can be further used for analysis of regulatory zzso zzso 

The zzso system developed includes the following major informational and software zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains the databases on zzso regulatory regions of zzso genes and zzso zzso for data zzso zzso Site zzso zzso zzso the module for analysis of functional site activity and its zzso zzso Site zzso zzso which comprises zzso zzso system for detecting the zzso and zzso properties of DNA sites significant for their recognition, zzso Consensus and Weight zzso zzso and zzso zzso Factor zzso Sites zzso zzso systems for detecting conservative contextual regions of functional sites and their zzso zzso Gene Networks zzso which contains an zzso database accumulating the data on gene networks and signal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for exploration and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to analyze structural and contextual properties of zzso zzso regions zzso and predict their translation zzso zzso other program zzso designed to study the zzso organization of regulatory zzso sequences and regulatory zzso 

zzso is available at zzso zzso and the links to the mirror zzso can be found at zzso zzso
