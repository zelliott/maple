This work reports a zzso analysis zzso method with zzso zzso detection for the rapid zzso of the total zzso capacity zzso in zzso The method exploited the zzso zzso reaction of zzso with hydrogen zzso in alkaline zzso zzso of sample, hydrogen zzso catalyst zzso zzso and alkaline zzso were zzso zzso into the holding zzso of the zzso zzso Then, the flow was reversed and the stacked zones were directed to the zzso zzso As the zones zzso antioxidants in the samples scavenged a portion of hydrogen zzso and the decrease in the zzso intensity was monitored and related to the zzso The chemical and geometric conditions were studied and the method was validated in terms of zzso accuracy zzso and zzso zzso effects, signal zzso and zzso The zzso of the method zzso as the zzso % relative standard zzso was between zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso as the % recovery in wines spiked with zzso zzso was in the range zzso The sampling frequency was 60 samples zzso The proposed zzso method was compared with the zzso method and the zzso zzso method for the analysis of 25 wine zzso
