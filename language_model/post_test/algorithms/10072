Several studies have questioned the traditional belief that the zzso tract zzso arises exclusively from the zzso zzso and passes through the anterior half of the zzso limb of the internal capsule zzso in zzso however, no direct evidence existed from structural imaging, and zzso aspects of zzso origin have not been zzso We used diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso to test the hypotheses that zzso can originate from both zzso and zzso zzso and is located zzso in the zzso and we also determined how age, sex, or zzso affected these zzso 

zzso healthy children zzso years of zzso 20 zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso was performed on the basis of fiber assignment by continuous tracking zzso zzso and zzso force approach, with a fractional zzso zzso threshold of zzso and an angle threshold of zzso degrees zzso The zzso was isolated by using a zzso zzso approach, and its cortical origin and location on the zzso was zzso 

zzso revealed that the zzso originated from both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso only in zzso and from the zzso zzso only in zzso The overall distribution was similar in both zzso However, children with zzso originating from both zzso and zzso zzso were older zzso zzso years of zzso than those with zzso origin zzso zzso years of zzso or zzso origin zzso zzso years of zzso only zzso zzso zzso The center of the zzso was localized at zzso of the length (from its anterior zzso of the zzso and the zzso occupied zzso of its zzso zzso There was a significant positive correlation between age and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The volume of the zzso portion of the left zzso was significantly higher than that of its zzso portion zzso zzso zzso and that of the right zzso zzso zzso zzso The pattern of cortical origin of zzso its location at the level of zzso and its volume and zzso were unaffected by sex or zzso 

The zzso most frequently originates from both zzso and zzso zzso especially in older children, and is typically centered approximately two thirds of the distance from the anterior margin of the zzso and occupies about a quarter of its zzso zzso In young children, the zzso can often be seen originating exclusively from the zzso zzso by zzso
