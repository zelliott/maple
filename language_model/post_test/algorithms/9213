In zzso investigations by simulating zzso models of zzso processes play an important role in systems zzso If the parameters of a model are unknown, results from simulation studies can be zzso Such a scenario can be avoided by zzso the parameters before zzso the zzso Almost all approaches for zzso parameters in ordinary differential equations have either a small convergence region or suffer from an immense zzso zzso The method of multiple shooting can be situated in between of these zzso In spite of its good convergence and stability properties, the literature regarding the practical zzso and providing some theoretical background is rarely zzso All necessary information for a successful zzso is supplied here and the basic facts of the involved zzso are zzso To show the performance of the method, two illustrative examples are zzso
