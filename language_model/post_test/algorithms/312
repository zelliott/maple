Image zzso via twofold zzso Bragg reflection (a setup called the zzso zzso is a recently established technique allowing to achieve both zzso spatial resolution and phase contrast in X-ray zzso The present article extends a previously developed theoretical zzso to account for partially coherent zzso At a typical zzso setup zzso zzso is identified as the main influence of partial zzso and the implications on imaging characteristics are analyzed by zzso zzso We show that contrast decreases by about 50% when compared to the zzso case, while zzso spatial resolution is zzso The theoretical zzso is zzso verified by correctly describing the zzso interaction of the two zzso zzso zzso an effect that has to be taken into account for precise data zzso
