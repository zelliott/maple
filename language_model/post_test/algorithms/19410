Based on a detailed zzso zzso zzso of a zzso heart zzso we previously developed a zzso efficient, zzso inspired zzso zzso to zzso tuning the model to produce zzso bursting and alternating bursting when configured as a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso To find zzso density zzso that produce zzso zzso we implemented a genetic zzso automated zzso zzso With multiple searches, we found eight zzso sets that produced zzso bursting in the zzso zzso When these zzso sets were applied to the Full Model, all produced zzso zzso although when the simulation time was extended from 80 to 300 zzso only four zzso sets produced sustained bursting in the zzso zzso All zzso sets produced alternating zzso bursting in the zzso and Full Models throughout the entire 300 zzso When zzso zzso were systematically varied for each of the four sustained zzso sets, the effects on bursting activity zzso both for the same zzso set in the zzso and Full Models and for different zzso sets with the same level of zzso zzso This implies that zzso detail can affect burst activity and that these zzso sets may represent different mechanisms for burst generation and/or zzso We also tested the models with zzso variations that zzso to experimental zzso We conclude that, whereas similar output can be achieved with multiple different zzso sets, zzso such as zzso variations can highlight zzso Additionally, this work demonstrates both the utility and limitations of using simplified models to represent more zzso accurate zzso
