Recognizing direct relationships between variables connected in a network is a pervasive problem in zzso social and information sciences as zzso networks contain numerous indirect zzso Here we present a general method for zzso direct effects from an observed correlation zzso containing both direct and indirect zzso We formulate the problem as the inverse of network zzso and introduce an zzso that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a zzso solution by exploiting zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network zzso distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory zzso recognizing directly interacting zzso zzso for protein structure prediction from sequence zzso and distinguishing strong zzso in zzso social networks using connectivity information zzso In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph zzso zzso our results suggest network zzso is widely zzso for computing direct zzso in network science across diverse zzso
