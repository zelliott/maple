zzso class characterizes the overall folding type of a protein or its zzso A number of zzso methods have been proposed to predict structural class based on primary zzso however, the accuracy of these methods is strongly affected by sequence zzso This paper zzso an ensemble zzso method and a compact zzso sequence zzso This method improves prediction accuracy for the four main structural classes compared to competing methods, and provides highly accurate predictions for sequences of widely varying zzso The experimental evaluation of the proposed method shows superior results across sequences that are characterized by entire zzso spectrum, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso The error rates were reduced by over zzso when compared with using individual prediction methods and most commonly used composition zzso representation of protein zzso Comparisons with competing methods on three large benchmark zzso consistently show the superiority of the proposed zzso
