Medical image analysis is a very popular research area these days in which digital images are analyzed for the diagnosis and screening of different medical zzso zzso zzso zzso is an eye disease caused by the increase of insulin in blood and may cause zzso An automated system for early detection of DR can save a patient's vision and can also help the zzso in screening of zzso The background or zzso DR contains four types of zzso zzso zzso zzso hard zzso and soft zzso This paper presents a method for detection and zzso of zzso in colored retinal zzso We present a novel technique that uses filter banks to extract the candidate regions for possible zzso It eliminates the zzso zzso regions by removing the zzso disc zzso Then it applies a zzso zzso as a combination of zzso functions to detect zzso and zzso zzso The proposed system is evaluated and tested on publicly available retinal image databases using performance parameters such as sensitivity, zzso and zzso We further compare our system with already proposed and published methods to show the zzso of the proposed zzso
