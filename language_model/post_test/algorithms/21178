We have investigated zzso brain current density reconstruction zzso from zzso zzso zzso recordings by means of finite element method zzso The brain electrical sources are modeled by a current density distribution and estimated from the zzso signals with the aid of a weighted minimum norm zzso zzso A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of zzso by comparing with the scalp zzso based zzso zzso The present computer simulation results indicate that the zzso provides enhanced performance in zzso single zzso sources which are located in regions underneath the implanted zzso zzso grids, and in distinguishing and imaging multiple separate zzso sources, in comparison to the zzso results as obtained from the scalp zzso under the same zzso We have also demonstrated the zzso of the present zzso method to estimate zzso current density distribution from the zzso zzso recordings in a human zzso zzso Eleven zzso zzso spikes zzso from the frontal region and four from zzso zzso in an zzso patient undergoing surgical evaluation were zzso The present promising results indicate the feasibility and zzso of the developed zzso method of zzso brain sources from zzso electrical recordings, with detailed forward modeling using zzso
