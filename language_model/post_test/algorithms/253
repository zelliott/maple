zzso flow is zzso by numerous phase zzso and zzso leading to fast magnetic resonance signal zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In this paper, the zzso zzso pulse zzso with its potential for very short zzso times, is demonstrated as an ideal technique for studying such dynamic zzso It has been used to acquire liquid zzso and relative intensity maps of zzso zzso dispersed bubble flow in a horizontal pipe at a liquid Reynolds number of zzso The zzso were air and water and a turbulence grid was used to generate a dispersed bubble flow zzso The zzso technique shows promise for future research in zzso zzso
