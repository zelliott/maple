A methodology for testing the correlation between the sequence and structure distances of proteins is zzso zzso distances were derived by applying a forward growing zzso tree zzso on defined zzso and geometrical properties of the zzso The structure distance for every pair of proteins was defined as the number of intermediate zzso in the zzso zzso distances were derived using zzso sequence zzso Then, correlation between sequence distance zzso and sequence distance zzso was tested using a zzso Carlo zzso zzso The results were compared to those when the double dynamic structure alignment method zzso was zzso The methodology was applied to a data set of 74 proteins belonging to 14 zzso The zzso tree was able to identify the protein families (the zzso rate was zzso and a zzso structure distance zzso was zzso For every pair of protein sequences a zzso score was recorded and a sequence distance zzso was zzso The zzso Carlo zzso produced a correlation zzso zzso zzso The zzso method produced similar zzso The proposed methodology may assist in assessing whether protein sequence distances can be zzso of protein structure zzso
