zzso act in a prevalent and zzso zzso gene regulatory mechanism that impacts development, zzso and disease, yet biological functions for the vast majority of zzso remain zzso Given the power of zzso zzso to promote rapid evaluation of zzso function, recently expanded zzso identifications zzso zzso and the importance of assessing potential functional redundancies within and between species, we evaluated zzso sequence relationships by zzso end match and overall zzso criteria to compile a snapshot overview of zzso families within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that includes their identified human zzso This compilation expands literature documentation of both the number of families and the number of family members, within and between zzso and fly models, and highlights sequences zzso between species pairs or among zzso flies and zzso Themes that emerge include the substantial potential for functional zzso of zzso sequences within species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso share significant zzso with other zzso zzso by their respective zzso and the striking extent to which zzso are zzso across zzso half zzso zzso zzso zzso share sequence zzso with zzso zzso also in both fly and human zzso This summary analysis of mature zzso sequence relationships provides a quickly accessible resource that should facilitate functional and evolutionary analyses of zzso and zzso zzso
