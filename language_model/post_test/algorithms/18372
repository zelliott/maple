We report an automated procedure for zzso zzso resonance assignment for a protein of known structure, or of an zzso zzso Our zzso performs Nuclear zzso Replacement zzso by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso residual zzso zzso zzso and chemical shifts to a given a zzso zzso zzso structural zzso The zzso requires only uniform zzso of the zzso and processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sparse zzso zzso zzso zzso runs in minutes and efficiently assigns the zzso backbone zzso as well as the sparse zzso from the zzso zzso spectrum, in O zzso zzso The zzso is demonstrated on zzso data from a zzso zzso human zzso matched to four structures, including one zzso zzso determined either by X-ray zzso or by different zzso experiments (without zzso zzso achieves an average assignment accuracy of over zzso We further demonstrate the feasibility of our zzso for different and larger zzso using different combinations of real and simulated zzso data for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein G zzso zzso matched to a variety of zzso structural zzso
