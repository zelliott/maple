zzso of standard MR imaging examinations are usually normal in primary zzso These findings are now increasingly challenged by studies using advanced zzso techniques detecting abnormalities in brain areas that may be functionally involved in the zzso of zzso Our purpose was to evaluate zzso volumes in patients with CD at baseline and 5 years zzso 

We enrolled 19 patients zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso + zzso zzso 12 of whom were studied at baseline and again approximately 5 years zzso zzso healthy volunteers acted as controls zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso + zzso zzso The subjects were zzso with a zzso scanner by using a zzso zzso sequence on 150 zzso zzso zzso sections to apply zzso 

At entry, zzso analysis disclosed significantly lower zzso volumes in the left zzso head and zzso and in the zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso in patients than in zzso No correlation was found between decreased zzso volumes and patient age, severity of zzso or disease zzso At the zzso zzso zzso volumes in the left primary zzso zzso in patients had decreased significantly from zzso 

The findings obtained at entry and after a zzso follow-up consistently showed decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volumes in patients with CD, and they probably play a zzso role in zzso
