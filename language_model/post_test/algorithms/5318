Rotating spiral waves have been observed in numerous biological and physical zzso These spiral waves can be zzso zzso or even zzso into multiple unstable rotating zzso The zzso behavior of spiral waves has been extensively zzso by tracking spiral wave tip zzso However, the precise methodology of identifying the spiral wave tip and its influence on the specific patterns of behavior remains a largely unexplored topic of zzso Here we use a two-state variable zzso model to simulate stationary and meandering spiral waves and examine the zzso representation of the system's state variables in both the real zzso zzso and state zzso We show that mapping between these two spaces provides a method to zzso the spiral wave tip as the center of rotation of the solution to the underlying zzso partial differential zzso This approach leads to the simplest tip zzso by eliminating portions resulting from the zzso component of the spiral zzso
