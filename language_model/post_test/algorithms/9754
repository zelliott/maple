This contribution presents a quantitative procedure for landslide risk analysis and zoning considering zzso exposure (or value of elements at zzso and zzso The method provides the means to obtain landslide risk models zzso expected damage due to zzso on material elements and economic activities in monetary terms, according to different scenarios and zzso useful to identify areas where zzso efforts will be most cost zzso It allows identifying priority areas for the zzso of actions to reduce vulnerability zzso or hazard zzso The procedure proposed can also be used as a preventive zzso through its application to strategic environmental impact analysis zzso of land-use zzso The underlying hypothesis is that reliable predictions about hazard and risk can be made using models based on a detailed analysis of past landslide zzso in connection with conditioning factors and data on past zzso The results show that the approach proposed and the hypothesis formulated are essentially correct, providing estimates of the order of magnitude of expected losses for a given time zzso zzso strengths, and shortcomings of the procedure and results obtained are discussed and potential lines of research to improve the models are zzso Finally, comments and suggestions are provided to zzso this type of zzso
