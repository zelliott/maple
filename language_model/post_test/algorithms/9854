The direct enhancement of the zzso zzso signal of small molecules in solution through zzso dynamic nuclear polarization zzso has the potential to enable studies of systems where enhanced signal is needed but the current dissolution zzso approach is not zzso for instance if the sample does not tolerate a zzso process or if continuous flow or rapid zzso of the molecules is zzso We present systematic studies of the zzso zzso enhancement of zzso small molecules in zzso solution under ambient conditions, where we observe both zzso and zzso zzso We show the role of the zzso effects from enhanced zzso on zzso zzso through zzso experiments with and without broadband zzso decoupling and by comparing zzso results with zzso and zzso We conclude that the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso in small molecules strongly depends on the distance of closest approach between the electron and zzso nucleus, the presence of a zzso contribution to the zzso factor, and the magnitude of the zzso effect due to adjacent polarized zzso The enhancement appears to depend less on the zzso dynamics of the zzso small molecules and zzso
