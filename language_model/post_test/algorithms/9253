The aim of this study was to develop a zzso model to describe the zzso transfer of drugs, based on the human zzso zzso zzso The maternal and fetal sides of human zzso were zzso with salicylic acid together with zzso a passive diffusion zzso The drug concentration in the zzso tissue was determined at the end of zzso A compartment model consisting of maternal space, fetal zzso space, and zzso tissue was fitted to the observed concentration profiles of salicylic acid in the maternal and fetal zzso The developed model could adequately explain the concentration profiles of salicylic acid in the zzso with influx zzso from maternal and fetal zzso to zzso tissue of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate zzso from zzso tissue to maternal and fetal zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was adequately described by assuming rapid equilibrium between fetal zzso and zzso tissue zzso The influx plasma clearance from the maternal side zzso in humans was estimated by taking into account the protein zzso The zzso value of salicylic acid was zzso zzso zzso and was larger than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso transfer zzso of salicylic acid by human zzso zzso study with various zzso zzso Based on the data zzso we developed a zzso model, which should enable us to estimate the influx profile of drugs into zzso zzso blood from the maternal plasma concentration zzso
