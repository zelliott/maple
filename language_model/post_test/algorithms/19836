Genome assembly is considered to be a challenging problem in zzso biology, and has been studied extensively by many zzso It is extremely difficult to build a general assembler that is able to reconstruct the original sequence instead of many zzso However, we believe that creating specific zzso for solving specific cases, will be much more fruitful than creating general zzso 

In this paper, we present zzso a zzso assembly program dedicated to handling small zzso It provides only one zzso (along with the reverse complement of this zzso in many zzso Although zzso consist of a number of zzso the implemented zzso can detect all the zzso as we demonstrate for zzso zzso zzso The zzso program is based on the de zzso zzso We have implemented a very sophisticated and fast method to reconstruct the original sequence and neglect erroneous zzso The method explores the graph by using neither the shortest nor the longest path, but rather a specific and reliable path based on the coverage level or zzso zzso zzso uses short reads, and it was tested on raw data downloaded from the zzso Trace zzso 

Our findings show that the accuracy of the assembly was very high; the result was checked against the European zzso Institute zzso database using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The identity and the zzso coverage was more than zzso We also compared the efficiency of zzso with other well-known zzso In dealing with small zzso the accuracy of zzso is significantly higher than the accuracy of other zzso The assembly process is very fast and requires only a few zzso is available for free to the zzso The zzso files for zzso are available through zzso
