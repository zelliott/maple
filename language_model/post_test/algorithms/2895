zzso of organisms is widely observed although difficult to precisely zzso Performance can remain nearly constant within some neighborhood of the normal operating regime, leading to zzso but then abruptly break down with pathological consequences beyond this zzso Currently, there is no generic approach to identifying boundaries where local performance zzso zzso and this has hampered understanding of the molecular basis of biological zzso Here we introduce a generic approach for characterizing boundaries between operational regimes based on the zzso zzso representation of the system's zzso This conceptual framework allows us to define zzso zzso as the ratio between the normal value of a zzso and the value at such a zzso We illustrate the utility of this concept for a class of zzso cycles, which is a widespread module in zzso Our results show a region of zzso local performance surrounded by zzso zzso also, selection for improved local performance often pushes the operating values away from regime zzso thus increasing global zzso These predictions agree with experimental data from the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycle of human zzso
