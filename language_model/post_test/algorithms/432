In this paper, we introduce a new class of zzso neural networks zzso with zzso jumping parameters as well as zzso mixed time delays (both discrete and distributed time zzso Specifically, the parameters of the zzso are subject to the switching from one to another at different times according to a zzso chain, and the mixed time delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays that are dependent on the zzso jumping zzso We first deal with the stability analysis problem of the addressed neural zzso A special inequality is developed to account for the mixed time delays in the zzso setting, and a novel zzso functional is put forward to reflect the zzso time zzso zzso conditions are established in terms of linear zzso zzso zzso that guarantee the zzso zzso We then turn to the synchronization problem among an array of identical coupled zzso jumping neural networks with mixed zzso time zzso By utilizing the zzso stability theory and the zzso product, it is shown that the addressed synchronization problem is zzso if several zzso are zzso zzso different from the commonly used zzso norm theories (such as the zzso zzso a unified zzso approach is developed to solve the stability analysis and synchronization problems of the class of neural networks under investigation, where the zzso can be easily solved by using the available zzso zzso zzso Two zzso examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the main results zzso
