Aging is a fundamental biological zzso zzso of genetic and environmental factors that influence lifespan is a crucial step toward understanding the mechanisms of aging at the zzso zzso To capture the different effects of genetic and environmental factors on zzso appropriate statistical analyses are zzso 

We developed an online application for survival analysis zzso that helps conduct various novel statistical tasks involved in analyzing survival data in a zzso zzso zzso provides standard survival analysis results including zzso estimates and zzso survival time by taking censored survival zzso zzso also provides various statistical tests including comparison of mean survival time, overall survival curve, and survival rate at specific time zzso To zzso survival data, zzso generates survival and log cumulative hazard plots that enable researchers to easily interpret their experimental zzso Furthermore, we provide statistical methods that can analyze zzso among survival zzso In addition, users can analyze zzso effects of risk factors on zzso 

zzso provides a platform that is essential to facilitate efficient statistical analyses of survival data in the field of aging zzso Web application and a detailed description of zzso are accessible from zzso
