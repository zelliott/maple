To understand the workings of the living cell, we need to characterize protein zzso that constitute the cell (for example, the zzso zzso zzso and the nuclear pore zzso A reliable high-resolution structural characterization of these zzso is frequently beyond the reach of current experimental methods, such as X-ray zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso small angle X-ray zzso and zzso However, the information garnered from different methods can be combined and used to build models of the assembly structures that are consistent with all of the available zzso and therefore more accurate, precise, and zzso Here, we describe a protocol for this integration, zzso the information is converted to a set of spatial restraints and a variety of zzso procedures can be used to generate models that satisfy the restraints as well as zzso These generated models can then potentially inform about the precision and accuracy of structure determination, the accuracy of the input zzso and further data zzso We also demonstrate the zzso Modeling zzso zzso software, which provides the necessary zzso framework to implement this zzso and several applications for specific use zzso
