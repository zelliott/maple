zzso the large reaction networks found in biological systems is a daunting zzso One approach is to divide a network into more manageable smaller zzso thus simplifying the zzso This is a common strategy used in zzso However, the process of identifying biological zzso is still in its infancy and very little is understood about the range and capabilities of motif structures found in biological zzso In order to delineate these zzso a library of functional motifs has been generated via in zzso evolution zzso On the basis of their functional forms, networks were evolved from four broad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso systems and frequency zzso Some of these motifs were constructed from simple mass action zzso others were based on zzso zzso as found in zzso networks and the remainder were based on Hill equations as found in zzso interaction zzso The purpose of the study is to explore the capabilities of different network zzso and the rich variety of functional forms that can be zzso Ultimately, the library may be used to delineate functional motifs in real biological zzso
