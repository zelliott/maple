To evaluate the clinical outcome and zzso rates after zzso artery zzso and primary zzso using a zzso surveillance protocol that includes duplex zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso mean age 61 zzso 9 years, range zzso underwent zzso of 84 zzso systems for zzso zzso rest pain zzso tissue loss zzso or failing lower limb bypass graft zzso The surveillance zzso included zzso duplex scanning within 1 month and serial limb pressure zzso and zzso artery zzso analyses during zzso zzso systems with a peak zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso by duplex and/or symptomatic or zzso deterioration were considered failing and an indication for zzso 

During zzso follow-up ranging to 36 months zzso zzso life table primary, assisted primary, and secondary zzso rates for the treated zzso systems were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at 18 zzso Assisted primary zzso system zzso at 18 months was significantly worse in the 20 zzso limbs having an zzso bypass done with or prior to zzso zzso zzso versus zzso without zzso p zzso zzso zzso clinical indicators found 17 zzso suspected failing zzso systems, in which duplex imaging correctly identified 5 of 6 zzso zzso zzso and facilitated secondary zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso occurred in the treated zzso systems despite zzso 

Duplex surveillance after zzso zzso zzso failing inflow zzso zzso assisted zzso of the treated zzso system, and possesses greatest utility in patients with zzso zzso disease and zzso zzso
