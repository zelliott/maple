Analysis of complex samples with tandem mass zzso zzso has become routine in zzso zzso However, validation of database search results creates a bottleneck in zzso data zzso Recently, methods based on a zzso database have become popular for quality control of database search zzso However, a zzso problem is the ignorance of how to combine different database search scores to improve the sensitivity of zzso database zzso 

In this paper, a zzso zzso discriminate function zzso based on the zzso zzso density zzso technique was used to filter out zzso database search results with a predictable false positive rate zzso Application of this method to control zzso of different instruments zzso zzso and zzso yielded an estimated zzso close to the actual zzso As expected, the method was more sensitive when more features were zzso Furthermore, the new method was shown to be more sensitive than two commonly used methods on 3 complex sample zzso and 3 control zzso 

Using the zzso model, a more flexible zzso can be zzso resulting in improved sensitivity and good zzso zzso This zzso statistical technique is a powerful tool for tackling the complexity and diversity of zzso in shotgun zzso
