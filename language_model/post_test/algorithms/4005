There is increasing interest in the use of edited zzso magnetic resonance zzso for the detection of zzso in the human zzso At a recent meeting held at zzso University, a number of zzso groups met to discuss the zzso analysis and interpretation of zzso MR zzso This paper aims to set out the issues discussed at this meeting, reporting areas of consensus around parameters and procedures in the field and highlighting those areas where differences zzso It is hoped that this paper can fulfill two needs, providing a summary of the current zzso in the field of zzso MRS at zzso using zzso and a basic guide to help researchers new to the field to avoid some of the pitfalls inherent in the acquisition and processing of edited MRS for zzso
