Two zzso for assessing zzso status using daily urinary levels of zzso and zzso zzso have been applied to zzso zzso populations of zzso These relatively new methods for assessing zzso function have been used to assess the potential adverse effects of occupational and environmental zzso such as smoking, on the zzso health of zzso One zzso has been validated against serum hormone zzso and gives good sensitivity and specificity for zzso However, a gold standard is generally not available in zzso field studies in which these daily urine samples are zzso In this paper, we used zzso methods to zzso zzso the probability of occurrence of zzso zzso the sensitivity and specificity of the two zzso and zzso the association between zzso and smoking and other risk factors in the absence of a perfect zzso We evaluated the two published zzso for assessing zzso status, based on their zzso results applied to one randomly selected cycle from each woman in a sample of 338 employed zzso We first assumed that the zzso were independent, conditional on zzso zzso Then, we used a dependence model to allow for correlation between the results of the two zzso We implemented a zzso zzso zzso analysis that allowed the outcome measurement to be partially zzso We incorporated the zzso zzso for zzso accuracy obtained from the dependence model as prior zzso for this zzso zzso zzso Then, we compared the results with those obtained from a standard multiple zzso approach using the zzso determination of zzso status as if it were zzso Our results indicated that increasing physical activity was associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso and smokers had a zzso but not statistically zzso increased occurrence of zzso
