A zzso zzso model with zzso expansion of zzso cells is used to describe lung cancer mortality data from studies on French and Czech zzso with relatively low zzso to zzso The aim was to derive zzso lung cancer risk estimates zzso to different populations using a model description consistent with both cellular zzso zzso and previous model analyses of animal and human zzso zzso The significantly different baseline lung cancer risks for the two zzso that include the effects from the unknown smoking habits, are described with different background model zzso A uniform description of the effect of zzso for both zzso zzso is achieved by applying the same zzso effect for zzso on the background zzso rates in the zzso zzso the effects of decreased cellular proliferation at very advanced age improves the description of the baseline lung cancer risk, but does not lead to significant changes in the estimated radiation zzso Here, a zzso model demonstrates the possibility of transferring zzso lung cancer risks across zzso The inherent zzso zzso relationships in the model allow for zzso to lifelong zzso to residential zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso risks from continuous exposure to low-level zzso zzso were found to agree with the results of the zzso VI zzso
