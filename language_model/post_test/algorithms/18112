When a very thin zzso is inserted into a liquid, the liquid is sucked into it: this zzso process is controlled by a balance of zzso and drag forces which are hard to zzso zzso particularly considering flow on the zzso By computer experiments using a generic zzso model, it is shown that an analysis of zzso forced by a zzso external pressure independently zzso the zzso pressure and zzso zzso as relevant physical parameters governing the zzso zzso From the latter one may then zzso the effective pore zzso effective zzso dynamic contact angle and slip length of the fluid flowing into the zzso In determining all these parameters zzso the consistency of our analysis of such forced zzso processes is zzso
