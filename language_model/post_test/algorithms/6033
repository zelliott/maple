zzso deep inside the tissue of a thick biological sample often poses severe constraints on image zzso Standard restoration techniques zzso and zzso can then be very useful, allowing one to increase the zzso ratio and the resolution of the zzso In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining a good determination of the zzso function zzso of a zzso zzso a prerequisite for applying zzso to three-dimensional image stacks acquired with this zzso Because of scattering and optical distortion induced by the sample, the zzso has to be acquired anew for each zzso To tackle this problem, we used a screening approach to estimate the zzso zzso and automatically from the zzso Small zzso structures were detected in the images, and a theoretical zzso model reshaped to match the geometric characteristics of these zzso We used zzso experiments to zzso the sensitivity of our detection method, and we demonstrated its usefulness by zzso images of the hearing organ acquired in zzso and in zzso
