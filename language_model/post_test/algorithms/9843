In spatial updating grand zzso zzso zzso particle transfers are implemented by examining the local environment around a point in zzso In the present work, these zzso are extended to very high zzso by allowing the volume to zzso thus forming a great grand zzso zzso Since fluctuations are unbounded, a constraint must be zzso The constrained ensemble may be viewed as a zzso of either zzso or grand zzso zzso Each simulation of the constrained ensemble requires a set of weights that must be determined zzso The outcome of a single simulation is the density of states in terms of all its independent zzso Since all extensive variables zzso it is also possible to estimate absolute free energies and zzso from a single zzso The method is tested on a system of hard spheres and the transition from the fluid to a zzso cubic crystal is located with high zzso
