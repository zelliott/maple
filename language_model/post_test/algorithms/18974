Despite many recent efforts, in zzso identification of promoter regions is still in its zzso However, the accurate identification and zzso of promoter regions is important for several reasons, such as improving zzso zzso and devising experiments to study and understand zzso zzso Current methods to identify the core region of promoters require large amounts of high-quality training data and often behave like black box models that output predictions that are difficult to zzso Here, we present a novel approach for predicting promoters in zzso sequences by using large-scale structural properties of zzso Our technique requires no training, is zzso to many zzso zzso and performs extremely well in comparison with the best available promoter prediction zzso Moreover, it is fast, simple in design, and has no size constraints, and the results are easily zzso We compared our approach with 14 current state-of-the-art zzso using human gene and zzso start site data and analyzed the zzso region in more zzso We also validated our method on 12 additional zzso zzso including zzso zzso plants, zzso and zzso
