In zzso zzso fetal heart rate category 2 was associated with improved short-term survival compared to category 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery and zzso zzso were not zzso of survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival for infants born at 23 and 24 weeks was zzso and zzso zzso
