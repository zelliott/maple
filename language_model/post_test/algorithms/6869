zzso growth by the zzso reaction of zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso Teflon film bags under darkness in the presence of background seed zzso The zzso used were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To study acid catalyst effects on zzso zzso zzso one of the Teflon bags was initially filled with seed zzso composed of ammonium zzso zzso with zzso zzso These results were compared to particle growth reactions that contained only ammonium zzso as a background seed zzso The zzso zzso were then added to the Teflon zzso In selected experiments, zzso was also added to the Teflon bags with zzso to clarify particle growth via a zzso zzso formation in the zzso of an acid zzso The particle size distribution and growth were measured using a scanning mobility particle zzso zzso and the results were applied to predicting zzso growth and size distribution changes by zzso and zzso zzso zzso created from the zzso reactions of zzso were collected directly on an zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso disk zzso zzso in zzso by zzso The zzso disks were directly analyzed for product functional groups inthe zzso phase using a zzso transform infrared zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth by zzso zzso reactions proceeds via a zzso zzso process, and zzso formation from the reaction of zzso with zzso These zzso zzso reactions were accelerated in the presence of an acid zzso zzso and led to higher zzso yields than when zzso was not present in the seed zzso The zzso zzso obtained from the growing zzso also illustrated zzso group transformation in the particle phase as a function of the zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso which can be produced by atmospheric zzso zzso can significantly contribute on secondary zzso formation through zzso reactions in the presence of an acid zzso
