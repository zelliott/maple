zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory response to radiation therapy zzso We assessed the association between zzso and white blood cell zzso count, an established metric of systemic zzso after zzso for zzso cell lung zzso 

We zzso analyzed zzso patients with zzso cell lung cancer who received zzso zzso as definitive zzso The primary zzso was whether zzso count after zzso zzso as 2 weeks through 3 months after zzso zzso was associated with grade zzso or grade zzso zzso Median lung volume receiving zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso counts ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso clinical variables and zzso zzso counts with zzso were calculated via zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used to define optimal zzso zzso count cut zzso 

zzso zzso counts were significantly higher in patients with grade zzso zzso than without zzso zzso cut points for zzso zzso count were found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso for grade zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant associations between zzso zzso count and grade zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This association held in a zzso zzso zzso Of note, zzso was found to be significantly associated with grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toward significance for grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso counts were significantly and independently associated with zzso and have potential utility as a diagnostic or zzso marker for this zzso
