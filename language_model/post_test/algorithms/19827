The current study presents an application of near infrared zzso for identification and zzso of the fraudulent addition of barley in roasted and ground coffee zzso Nine different types of coffee including pure zzso zzso and zzso of them at different roasting degrees were blended with four types of zzso The blending degrees were between 2 and 20 zzso of zzso zzso design was applied to select 100 and 30 experiments to be used as zzso and test set, zzso zzso least squares zzso zzso was employed to build the models aimed at predicting the amounts of barley in coffee zzso In order to obtain simplified models, taking into account only zzso regions of the spectral profiles, a genetic zzso zzso was zzso A completely independent external set was also used to test the model zzso The models showed excellent zzso ability with root mean square errors zzso for the test and external set equal to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
