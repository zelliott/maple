This paper attempts to characterize medical time series using zzso zzso zzso zzso dimensions like box, information and correlation dimensions characterize the time series by measuring the rate at which the distribution of the time series changes when the length (or zzso of the box (or zzso is zzso However, the measured dimensions significantly vary when the box (or zzso position is changed zzso It happens because the data points just outside the box (or zzso are not accounted for, and all the data points inside the box or zzso are treated zzso To overcome these problems, the zzso is converted to a zzso and thus the hard boundary becomes zzso The zzso represents the fuzzy similarity between the neighbors and the point around which the zzso is zzso This concept of similarity is exploited to propose a fuzzy zzso zzso zzso The proposed dimension aims to capture the zzso of the time series in terms of how the fuzzy similarity scales zzso when the resolution of the time series is zzso zzso on intensive care unit zzso data sets show that the proposed dimension characterizes the time series better than the correlation zzso
