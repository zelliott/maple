In coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso low zzso of coronary zzso plaque is associated with zzso zzso However, an overlap in zzso units zzso between zzso and zzso plaque as well as an influence of zzso enhancement on plaque zzso was observed and may limit accurate detection of zzso plaques by zzso We sought to determine whether the quantitative zzso analysis improves accuracy of the detection of zzso plaque zzso in ex zzso hearts by validation against zzso zzso 

Human donor hearts were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso scanner using a standard coronary zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso plaque was defined in the zzso analysis as any zzso with a zzso core diameter of greater than 200 zzso and a circumference greater than 60 degrees as well as a cap thickness of less than 450 zzso In zzso zzso plaque was determined as a zzso region with diffuse borders in 2 zzso or zzso In zzso the boundaries of the zzso plaque were manually zzso The absolute and relative areas of low zzso plaque based on zzso with less than 30, less than 60, and less than 90 zzso were calculated using quantitative zzso zzso 

From 5 hearts, a total of zzso cross sections were zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso Overall, 55 zzso zzso were identified by the zzso zzso In zzso the absolute and relative areas of low zzso plaque less than 30, less than 60, and less than 90 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The low zzso plaque area correlated significantly with zzso zzso content zzso core size zzso square zzso and a portion of zzso core on the entire zzso at all thresholds but was the strongest at less than 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for the absolute and relative areas, zzso Using a threshold of zzso zzso or greater, the absolute plaque area of less than 60 zzso in zzso yielded zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity to detect zzso whereas sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso for using zzso or higher relative area less than 60 zzso The zzso ability of zzso for zzso was similar between the absolute and relative areas (the area under the curve, zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso the association of the low zzso plaque area in zzso with zzso was not altered by the zzso enhancement for the relative zzso zzso zzso but for the absolute measurement zzso zzso zzso Similar results were achieved when validated against zzso plaque by zzso in a subset of 285 cross zzso 

In ex zzso conditions, the relative area of coronary zzso plaque less than 60 zzso in zzso as derived from quantitative zzso analysis has good accuracy to detect zzso as compared with a zzso analysis independent of differences in zzso contrast zzso
