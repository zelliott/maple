To develop an image analysis method that can automatically find correlations between a set of plain zzso and continuous clinical or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso taken from the Baltimore zzso Study of Aging are used in this zzso The computer analysis method is based on the zzso image feature set filtered by using the zzso correlation of each feature with the continuous zzso and the estimated value is determined by a weighted nearest neighbor zzso 

Experimental results using 300 zzso show that the proposed method can correlate knee zzso with zzso indicators such as sex, age, zzso weight, and zzso For instance, the zzso correlation between the X-ray images and the height and weight were zzso and zzso zzso 

Using computer analysis, X-ray images can be correlated to continuous zzso variables that might not have a direct and straightforward link to the visual content of the zzso This approach of zzso image analysis can be used in population studies for detecting zzso and also in zzso association studies for studying the link between genes and zzso
