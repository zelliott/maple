The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso detection zzso in diagnosing early zzso cancer using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 30 zzso data sets for 30 early zzso zzso in 30 patients were zzso reviewed by three zzso After primary zzso a second reading was performed using zzso zzso The readers evaluated each zzso segment for the presence or absence of zzso cancer using five confidence rating zzso To compare the assessment results, the sensitivity and specificity with and without zzso were calculated on the basis of the confidence rating, and differences in these variables were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The average sensitivities for the detection without and with zzso for the three readers were zzso and zzso zzso Among the three readers, only one reader improved sensitivity with zzso compared to that zzso zzso decreased specificity in all three zzso zzso detected zzso of protruding zzso but only zzso of flat zzso On zzso analysis, the diagnostic performance of all three readers was decreased by use of zzso 

Currently available zzso with zzso does not improve diagnostic performance for detecting early zzso zzso An improved zzso zzso is required for detecting flat zzso and reducing the zzso zzso
