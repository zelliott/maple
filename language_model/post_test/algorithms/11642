An zzso is described for automated building of side chains in an zzso map once a zzso model is built and for alignment of the protein sequence to the zzso The procedure is based on a comparison of electron density at the expected zzso positions with zzso zzso The templates are constructed from average zzso zzso zzso in zzso refined protein zzso For each zzso segment of main chain, a zzso with entries corresponding to an estimate of the probability that each of the 20 zzso acids is located at each position of the zzso model is zzso The probability that this segment zzso to each possible alignment with the sequence of the protein is estimated using a zzso approach and zzso matches are zzso Once zzso identities are determined, the most probable zzso for each side chain is built into the zzso The automated procedure has been implemented in the zzso zzso Combined with automated zzso model building, the procedure produces a preliminary model suitable for refinement and extension by an experienced zzso
