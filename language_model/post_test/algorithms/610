The generally accepted indications for carotid zzso are the clinical picture and degree of per cent zzso of the carotid zzso Despite the fact that zzso measurement is zzso the methods vary zzso The correlation of particular methods, especially zzso and duplex zzso has been repeatedly zzso However, the correlation between any technique and true anatomical zzso as evaluated on the surgical zzso has been only zzso zzso 

During carotid zzso the zzso plaque was removed in one piece and subsequently stored and zzso zzso The zzso slides were evaluated under an optical zzso scanned and the slide with maximum zzso was determined using a zzso zzso Both the minimal zzso area and the area of the whole plaque were zzso The zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso On the maximum zzso zzso the minimal diameter and the diameter of the whole plaque were also zzso zzso images were scanned and the per cent zzso were zzso according to the zzso and zzso zzso In total, of 147 cases, all zzso parameters were zzso zzso zzso tests for paired samples were used to evaluate the zzso 

The zzso indicated significant differences between the per cent zzso as measured on the anatomical zzso and on the zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso measurement zzso the degree of zzso anatomical zzso The zzso was more marked the less the degree of zzso 

Our study finds that per cent zzso measurement obtained by zzso with zzso or zzso methods does not reliably reflect the anatomical degree of per cent zzso which makes questionable the rigorous following of percentage zzso using zzso as the sole indicator for carotid zzso in all zzso
