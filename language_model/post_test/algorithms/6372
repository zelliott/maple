The issue of copyright protection of digital multimedia data has attracted a lot of attention during the last zzso An efficient copyright protection method that has been gaining popularity is zzso zzso the embedding of a signature in a digital document that can be detected only by its rightful zzso zzso are usually blindly detected using zzso structures, which would be optimal in the case of zzso zzso However, in the case of zzso image zzso the data is more zzso and the zzso is clearly zzso zzso receivers have been shown to be particularly well suited for the detection of weak signals in zzso noise, as they are locally zzso This motivates the use of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the locally optimal zzso zzso for the detection of zzso in zzso transformed zzso We analyze the performance of these schemes theoretically and compare it to that of the traditionally used zzso zzso but also to the recently proposed generalized zzso zzso which zzso the zzso The theoretical analysis and the actual performance of these systems is assessed through experiments, which verify the theoretical analysis and also justify the use of zzso structures for zzso zzso The performance of the zzso and the zzso detectors in the presence of zzso is also zzso using results from zzso theory, and also verified zzso
