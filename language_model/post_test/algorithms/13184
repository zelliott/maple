zzso are used as cell factories to produce valuable compounds in zzso zzso and other industrial zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways into zzso hosts is a major strategy for obtaining these target zzso and improving zzso However, selecting appropriate zzso zzso pathways for a host zzso remains difficult zzso to the complexity of zzso zzso zzso zzso network design could benefit greatly from the availability of an in zzso platform for zzso zzso zzso 

We developed an zzso for finding feasible zzso pathways by which zzso target zzso are produced by host zzso using zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso Using this algorithm, we screened zzso pathways for the production of all possible zzso target zzso contained within zzso We then assessed the feasibility of the target productions using flux balance analysis, by which we could identify target zzso associated with maximum cellular growth zzso 

This in zzso platform, designed for targeted searching of zzso zzso zzso provides essential information for cell factory zzso
