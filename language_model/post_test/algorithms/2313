The zzso zzso zzso are determined not only by angular zzso but also by the presence of gravity and linear zzso This phenomenon was studied by measuring three-dimensional zzso eye movements, with implanted search zzso in six male zzso monkeys during eccentric zzso Monkeys were rotated in the dark at a constant zzso of 200 zzso zzso or 79 zzso off zzso with the axis of rotation always aligned with gravity and the spinal axis of the upright zzso The monkey's orientation zzso or zzso had a dramatic influence on the zzso These experiments show that: zzso the axis of eye rotation always shifted toward alignment with zzso zzso zzso the peak value of horizontal slow phase eye zzso was greater with the monkey zzso than with zzso and zzso the time constant of horizontal eye movement zzso was smaller with the monkey zzso than with zzso All of these findings were statistically significant and consistent across zzso In another set of tests, the same monkeys were rapidly zzso about their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 45 degrees and 90 degrees were maintained for 1 zzso Other than a zzso angular zzso during the angular zzso no consistent eye zzso response was observed during or following the tilt for any of the six zzso The absence of any eye movement response following tilt weighs against the possibility that zzso linear zzso responses are due to simple zzso filtering of the zzso zzso The zzso response during eccentric rotation was divided into the more familiar angular zzso and linear zzso zzso The angular component is known to depend upon semicircular canal dynamics and central zzso The linear component of the response zzso rapidly with a mean duration of only zzso zzso while the axis of eye rotation rapidly zzso zzso 10 zzso with zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the measurement of zzso force by the zzso zzso is resolved into central estimates of linear acceleration and gravity, such that the central estimate of zzso force minus the central estimate of linear acceleration approximately equals the zzso measurement of zzso zzso
