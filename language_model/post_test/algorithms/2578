The zzso behavior of the zzso zzso caused by the local zzso magnetic field of a zzso is zzso zzso the diffusion of the spins surrounding the zzso and the strength of the zzso difference between the zzso and the surrounding zzso it is possible to distinguish different zzso zzso Each zzso regime can be related to a certain characteristic form of the zzso zzso If the influence of the diffusion zzso the zzso exhibits a zzso zzso In the opposite case of dominating influence of the zzso effects, the zzso shows an zzso zzso It can be shown that the zzso process is closely related to the behavior of a zzso driven harmonic zzso
