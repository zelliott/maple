We propose motif zzso for discovering sequence motifs upstream of genes that undergo expression changes in a given zzso The method combines the advantages of zzso motif finding and zzso zzso zzso analysis, resulting in high sensitivity and zzso motif zzso is particularly effective in discovering zzso motifs of medium to long zzso with multiple zzso zzso When applied to zzso zzso motif zzso identified the zzso and zzso motifs from zzso and zzso zzso experiments, zzso predicted that zzso may have increased activity in zzso deletion zzso reported a group of motifs (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that may mediate the zzso response to zzso acid zzso and found all of the known zzso regulation motifs from 18 expression zzso over two cell zzso
