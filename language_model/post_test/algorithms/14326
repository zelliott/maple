zzso scattering theory for optical zzso zzso zzso is zzso The results are used to produce zzso to resolve three-dimensional object structure, taking into account the finite beam zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resolution normally achieved only in the focal plane of the zzso system is shown to be available for all illuminated depths in the object without moving the focal zzso zzso zzso resolution is verified with zzso simulations and indicates an improvement of the high-resolution zzso imaging capabilities of zzso
