The generalized linear least squares zzso zzso has been found useful in zzso zzso zzso for the generation of zzso images with zzso zzso zzso zzso as it is zzso efficient and statistically zzso However, the original zzso was designed for zzso zzso with zzso sampled instantaneous zzso When dynamic PET data are sampled with the optimal image sampling schedule zzso to reduce memory and storage space, only a few zzso image frames are zzso As a result, the direct application of zzso is no longer zzso In this paper, we extend the zzso zzso to a five zzso model for the study of human brain zzso which accounts for the effect of cerebral blood volume zzso using zzso sampled data, with as few as five zzso zzso The zzso for this new zzso zzso is developed, and its zzso efficiency and statistical reliability are investigated and validated using computer simulations and clinical PET zzso zzso zzso
