zzso signal zzso is a function of intrinsic tissue properties and illuminating electric zzso zzso zzso water is a preferred acoustic zzso medium for zzso because acoustic and electromagnetic waves zzso in zzso water with very little zzso We have designed a zzso zzso zzso a controlled electric field with respect to pulse shape, power, and zzso zzso zzso line sections permit measurement of incident, zzso and transmitted zzso Both zzso and zzso measurement show that the zzso distribution is relatively uniform in zzso Comparing baseline power zzso to those taken with a test object in place yields power loss in the object, which should correlate to zzso signal zzso Moreover, power zzso therefore zzso computerized zzso signal zzso sensitive to the orientation of the object to the polarization of the electric zzso This zzso will enable quantitative characterization of the zzso contrast mechanism in ex zzso tissue zzso
