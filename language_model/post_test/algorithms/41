Rotating zzso polarization imaging is a new technique that provides quantitative zzso of the polarization properties of scattering media, such as zzso which are free from surface zzso The technique is investigated using both experiments and zzso Carlo simulations of a polarizing target embedded within a scattering zzso The technique is sensitive to the polarization properties of the target up to a depth of 17 mean free zzso zzso images of bovine tendon, lamb tendon, chicken breast, and human skin are also zzso
