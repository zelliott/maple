zzso is generally compared to zzso zzso which has been considered the gold standard for sleep zzso The objective of the present study was to evaluate the zzso between zzso and two previously proposed zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1994) to analyze zzso zzso The zzso agreement rate was evaluated through calculation of sensitivity, zzso and zzso Regarding the sleep zzso the zzso was performed through the zzso and Altman zzso 

A night of adaptation to the sleep laboratory followed by simultaneous zzso and zzso recordings throughout the zzso 

21 healthy zzso 

A sleep laboratory 

zzso 

zzso percent of all zzso epochs were correctly identified by both zzso and this accuracy is reasonably zzso The zzso was a sensitive method, with values of zzso and zzso for Cole's and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso had a low zzso zzso and zzso for Cole's and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and Altman technique showed that zzso systematically overestimated Sleep zzso Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency while it underestimated zzso zzso 

The results of this study show the utility of zzso as a useful method for assessment of sleep, despite its limitations regarding identification of waking epochs during zzso The zzso and Altman zzso technique was revealed to be a powerful tool to evaluate how well zzso agreed with zzso This technique, combined with calculations of sensitivity and zzso appears to be the most adequate procedure for the assessment of zzso
