There is considerable need for new modeling approaches in the study of combined zzso zzso Current methods based on the zzso zzso and Bliss independence models are associated with implicit assumptions about the interacting zzso To circumvent these limitations, we propose an alternative approach to the zzso of zzso drug interaction zzso Pilot zzso studies were performed with zzso zzso of zzso zzso at baseline with zzso or zzso zzso The studies were repeated with 25 concentration combinations of zzso zzso to 64 zzso and zzso zzso to 32 zzso in a zzso zzso The data were modeled with a three-dimensional response surface using effect zzso as the basis of zzso zzso The interaction index zzso is defined as the ratio of the volumes under the planes zzso of the observed and expected zzso zzso zzso and antagonism are defined as zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso In all combinations, an enhanced killing effect was seen compared to that of either drug at the same zzso The most significant zzso was observed between 1 and 5 zzso of zzso and between 1 and 4 zzso of zzso seven out of nine combinations had a zzso drop compared to the more potent zzso The zzso was found to be zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for the concentration ranges of the zzso The results corroborate previous data indicating that zzso is synergistic with an zzso when used in combination against zzso zzso Our zzso approach to zzso zzso appears robust and warrants further zzso
