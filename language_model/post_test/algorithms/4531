A quantitative model was developed to predict the depletion percentage of zzso zzso compounds by gene expression programming zzso Each kind of compound was represented by several calculated structural zzso involving constitutional, zzso zzso zzso and zzso features of zzso The zzso method produced a zzso and zzso quantitative model with a mean error and a correlation zzso of zzso and zzso for the training set, zzso and zzso for the test set, zzso It is shown that the zzso predicted results are in good agreement with experimental ones, better than those of the zzso zzso
