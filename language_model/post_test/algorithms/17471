Although the methodology of molecular zzso has enormous potential, it is time consuming and labor zzso The techniques required to produce a three-dimensional zzso electron density map of a zzso structure normally require manual operation of an electron microscope by a skilled operator and manual supervision of the sometimes complex software needed for analysis and calculation of zzso zzso Systems to automate the process of data acquisition from an electron microscope are being developing and these systems are being integrated with zzso handling operations and post acquisition data zzso Here, the current performance of our existing systems and the future challenges involved in substantially improving both the sustained zzso and the yield of automated data collection and analysis are zzso
