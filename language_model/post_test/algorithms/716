We consider the problems of zzso zzso and hypothesis testing for the zzso correlation zzso in an zzso reliability study when both zzso and subjects are assumed to be randomly selected from populations of zzso and subjects, zzso We propose a novel approach for the confidence zzso zzso and hypothesis testing using the concepts of generalized confidence zzso zzso and generalized zzso A simulation study is conducted to investigate the coverage probabilities of the zzso approach relative to the modified large sample zzso zzso Both methods tend to provide somewhat conservative zzso Relative to the zzso approach, the zzso approach is closer to the correct zzso coverage for a zzso zzso but farther to the correct coverage for a zzso lower zzso Unlike the zzso approach, the zzso approach can also easily provide zzso The fact that the zzso approach is suitable for confidence zzso zzso and obtaining zzso makes the zzso approach a suitable candidate for making zzso about zzso zzso
