A method for refining the beginnings of genes and a search for shifts of the reading frame is zzso The method is based on a comparison of zzso and zzso acid sequences of zzso genes of related zzso The zzso is based on the fact that the rate of changes in the zzso regions of the zzso is substantially lower than that of zzso zzso A modification of the zzso zzso is proposed, which makes it possible to align the zzso acid sequences obtained by formal translation of the starting zzso sequences by taking into account a possible shift of the reading zzso The zzso has been implemented in the package of zzso zzso Testing the program showed that the approach enables one to detect a wrong zzso of the beginnings in zzso of genes (even in well-studied organisms such as zzso zzso and identify several zzso 10) shifts of the open reading zzso Thus, the zzso can be used at both the initial and final stages of analysis of the zzso
