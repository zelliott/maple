In general, the zzso determination of bacterial species is a tedious process and requires extensive manual zzso Novel technologies for bacterial detection and analysis can therefore help zzso in zzso their efforts in developing a number of zzso zzso 

We present a zzso standardized procedure for automated bacterial analysis that is based on the detection of patterns of protein masses by zzso mass zzso We particularly applied the approach for zzso and identifying strains in species of the zzso zzso Many species of this zzso are associated with disastrous plant diseases such as fire zzso Using our experimental zzso we created a general bacterial mass zzso database that currently contains zzso entries of bacteria of different zzso This database will be steadily zzso To support users with a feasible zzso method, we developed and tested comprehensive software tools that are demonstrated zzso Furthermore, to gain additional zzso accuracy and reliability in the analysis we used zzso of single zzso zzso by mass zzso to zzso determine closely related strains that are difficult to distinguish by only relying on protein mass pattern zzso 

With the method for bacterial analysis, we could identify fire blight pathogens from a variety of biological zzso The method can be used for a number of additional bacterial zzso Moreover, the mass zzso approach presented allows the integration of data from different biological levels such as the zzso and the zzso
