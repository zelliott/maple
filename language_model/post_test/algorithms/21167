Conventional Cartesian parallel zzso methods are limited to the sensitivity variations provided by the underlying receiver zzso array in the dimension in which the data reduction is carried out, zzso the zzso zzso However, in this work an acquisition strategy is presented that takes advantage of sensitivity variations in the zzso direction, thus improving the parallel imaging reconstruction zzso This is achieved by employing rapidly zzso zzso zzso during the actual zzso The benefit of this approach is demonstrated in zzso using various zzso zzso trajectory zzso It is shown that zzso type zzso in zzso to zzso zzso the appearance of zzso in zzso and zzso imaging, thereby utilizing additional sensitivity variations in the zzso direction directly resulting in improved parallel imaging reconstruction zzso
