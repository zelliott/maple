The partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso is a well-established performance measure to evaluate zzso combinations for disease zzso Because the zzso is defined as the area under the zzso curve within a restricted zzso of false positive rates, it enables practitioners to zzso sensitivity rates within zzso specificity zzso This issue is of considerable importance for the development of medical screening zzso Although many authors have highlighted the importance of zzso there exist only few methods that use the zzso as an objective function for finding optimal combinations of zzso In this paper, we introduce a boosting method for zzso marker combinations that is explicitly based on the zzso zzso The proposed method can be applied in zzso settings where the number of zzso exceeds the number of zzso Additionally, the proposed method incorporates a recently proposed variable selection technique zzso zzso that results in sparse prediction rules incorporating only those zzso that make relevant contributions to predicting the outcome of zzso Using both simulated data and real data, we demonstrate that our method performs well with respect to both variable selection and prediction zzso Specifically, if the focus is on a limited range of specificity values, the new method results in better predictions than other established techniques for disease zzso
