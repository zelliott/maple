Most recent advances in zzso zzso have focused on achieving spatial resolutions below the zzso zzso However, the inherent capability of zzso zzso to zzso resolve different zzso or physical environments in biological samples has not yet been formally zzso because an adequate and general theoretical framework is zzso Here, we develop a mathematical characterization of the zzso resolution in zzso detection with Fisher information zzso To improve the precision and the resolution of quantitative imaging methods, we demonstrate strategies for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as different zzso zzso We describe zzso imaging zzso provide zzso zzso and describe precision and resolving power in zzso imaging thanks to the analysis of the general properties of Fisher information in zzso zzso These strategies enable the optimal use of the information content available within the limited zzso typically available in zzso zzso This theoretical foundation leads to a generalized strategy for the zzso of zzso optical zzso and demonstrates how the parallel detection of all properties of zzso can maximize the zzso resolving power of zzso zzso an approach we term zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso Our work provides a theoretical framework for the description of the zzso resolution in zzso zzso irrespective of spatial resolution, and for the development of a new class of zzso that exploit zzso detection zzso
