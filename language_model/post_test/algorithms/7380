We initiate in zzso zzso studies of biological zzso and small zzso for protein zzso The goal is to determine if, and how, the interactions among neighboring cells and zzso affect the flexibility of a zzso in its zzso zzso We use experimental X-ray zzso data from the zzso Data Bank zzso The analysis relies on an zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed using new protein rigidity analysis tools available in the new release of our zzso server zzso 

We provide two types of zzso on biological zzso and on zzso We found that when only isolated zzso are considered, structural and functional information may be zzso Indeed, the rigidity of biological zzso is sometimes dependent on the count and placement of hydrogen bonds and other interactions among the individual zzso of the biological zzso Similarly, the rigidity of small zzso may be affected by the interactions between atoms belonging to different unit zzso 

The rigidity analysis of a single zzso unit may not accurately reflect the zzso behavior in the tightly packed crystal zzso Using our zzso software, we demonstrated that additional functional and rigidity information can be gained by analyzing a zzso biological assembly and/or crystal zzso However, performing a larger scale study would be zzso expensive zzso to the size of the molecules zzso zzso this limitation will require novel mathematical and zzso extensions to our zzso
