Human error is the most significant factor attributed to incompatible blood zzso A zzso approach to blood typing has been developed by examining the spectral slopes of dilute red blood cell zzso suspensions in zzso in the presence and absence of various zzso offering a technique for the quantitative determination of zzso intensity zzso zzso zzso We offer direct theoretical prediction of the observed change in slope in the zzso zzso range through the use of the zzso approach and zzso theory for light scattering by dilute zzso zzso Following a zzso simulation using the zzso code, we present a simplified sensing method for detecting zzso The sensor design has been zzso fully zzso and evaluated through a complete set of tests with over 60 zzso samples and compared with the full zzso zzso The LED and zzso pairs are found to successfully reproduce the zzso determination of red blood cell zzso
