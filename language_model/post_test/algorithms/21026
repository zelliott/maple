One of the greatest challenges facing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction is the issue of long reconstruction times due to the large number of zzso for 3-D mode as compared to zzso zzso A zzso projector has been developed that takes advantage of zzso in the geometry to zzso zzso projections to multiple zzso zzso in a zzso efficient zzso It is based upon the zzso zzso projector using the zzso method of zzso and it zzso the zzso rotator zzso for multiple projections to each zzso zzso zzso The projector is equally zzso to both conventional zzso projections and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso version models the location and orientation of the individual zzso zzso the zzso providing an ordinary zzso reconstruction zzso The projector was implemented in C with several zzso for speed, exploiting the vertical symmetry of the zzso projection process, depth zzso and array indexing schemes which maximize serial memory zzso The new projector was evaluated and compared to zzso and zzso projectors using both zzso and experimental zzso and zzso zzso reconstructions with each projector were also compared to zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In terms of spatial resolution, contrast, and background noise measures, 3-D zzso zzso reconstruction with the zzso projector performed as well as or better than the other zzso Total processing times, measured on a single zzso Linux zzso were approximately zzso faster for the zzso projector than for the other 3-D projectors zzso The new projector provided four zzso zzso zzso reconstruction in as little as 15 zzso the same time as zzso + zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso projector is a viable option for zzso zzso offering quality statistical reconstruction in times only marginally slower than zzso or zzso zzso
