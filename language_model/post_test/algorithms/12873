A variety of modifications have been employed to learning zzso zzso zzso zzso using either crisp or soft windows for selection of zzso Although these schemes have been shown in practice to improve performance, a theoretical study on the influence of windows has so far been zzso Here we rigorously analyze the influence of windows in a controlled environment of zzso zzso in high zzso Concepts from statistical physics and the theory of online learning allow an exact description of the training zzso yielding typical learning curves, convergence properties, and achievable zzso zzso We compare the performance and demonstrate the advantages of various zzso including zzso zzso generalized zzso zzso Learning from zzso zzso and zzso Soft zzso zzso We find that the selection of the window zzso highly influences the learning zzso but not, surprisingly, the zzso performances of zzso zzso and zzso Although the prototypes of zzso zzso exhibit divergent behavior, the resulting decision boundary zzso with the optimal decision boundary, thus yielding optimal zzso zzso
