Body segment masses and center of mass zzso locations are required to calculate zzso forces and net joint moments using inverse or forward dynamics zzso These zzso properties are estimated from methods involving zzso or living zzso The present clinical methods are limited to similar populations from which the zzso measures were zzso This study presented a simple force plate method that can be used to determine zzso segment masses and zzso locations and compared it to other well-known zzso The proposed method was tested in individuals with different body mass index zzso lean, normal, and zzso to verify its zzso All the zzso mass and zzso values obtained from the force plate method were within the range of those of the other methods for the entire zzso zzso differences were identified between the zzso groups in relative zzso masses at the upper arm and leg and foot, and zzso locations at the leg and foot and head and trunk as obtained from the force plate method zzso The proposed method involves direct procedures to determine zzso zzso masses and zzso zzso It is sensitive to detect differences between various zzso zzso
