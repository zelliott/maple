In inverse zzso planning, the traditional dose planning sequence is zzso This makes it possible to calculate the optimal incident beam profiles required to produce the desired dose distribution in the target volume by solving an integral equation with an zzso zzso The major advantage, compared with conventional treatment planning, is that the trial and error part is avoided, and replaced by a deterministic calculation of the optimal treatment zzso In the present paper this zzso is briefly described and compared with experimental results and an zzso inversion formula which is valid for a zzso zzso The experiments were performed with zzso beams shaped with zzso designed using the zzso The agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of the zzso are quite good, generally within about zzso The differences are caused by zzso noise due to the finite resolution of the calculation zzso imperfections in the experimental situation, and by the assumption of spatial zzso dose distribution zzso
