In this study, a reconstruction zzso for a zzso zzso electrical zzso zzso zzso system is developed, based on inversion of an zzso calculated sensitivity zzso The sensitivity zzso is calculated using zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso out of 16 zzso zzso zzso are designated as current injection zzso and the remaining eight zzso are designated as measurement zzso The sensitivity zzso is zzso therefore singular value decomposition zzso of the sensitivity zzso followed by zzso and without zzso used to reconstruct zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso Data from a saline filled tank and in zzso data during zzso and the cardiac cycle, acquired by using a Sheffield zzso system, are used to reconstruct zzso The effect of different zzso levels on the reconstructed images is zzso
