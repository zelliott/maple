High resolution, dynamic zzso images of zzso human breast tumors in zzso mice were analyzed at zzso zzso The analysis, based on a zzso model, was performed by applying a zzso zzso zzso using a color coded zzso The final output mapped at zzso resolution zzso zzso times surface area and fraction of zzso volume, for each tumor zzso In addition, the output included assessment of the fit to the model by determining the proportion of zzso zzso for each zzso The spatial variation in the zzso values served to identify regions where the zzso mechanism of enhancement was leakage from the zzso volume to the zzso volume zzso close to zzso In regions with low zzso other mechanisms of enhancement appear to be dominating presumably diffusion within the zzso zzso As expected, in zzso regions lacking zzso and identified by analyzing zzso images of the same tumors, the model failed to fit the dynamic contrast enhanced zzso The zzso distribution of the determined zzso features demonstrates the importance of recording and analyzing breast tumor images at high spatial zzso
