zzso is an open source software suite for image reconstruction in electrical zzso zzso and diffuse optical zzso designed to facilitate collaboration, testing and new research in these zzso This paper describes recent work to redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use and provide a uniform zzso permitting easier modification and zzso We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its zzso One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing zzso and the zzso ease with which subtle zzso bugs can be inadvertently zzso zzso helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and zzso of well-documented and zzso zzso On the other hand, since zzso is designed to facilitate use by zzso its use may inadvertently result in such zzso zzso In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as zzso may zzso Our hope is that such an overview may assist authors of software to avoid such zzso zzso
