zzso phase extraction is a key step in optical zzso While phase shifting technique is widely employed for zzso or zzso phase zzso it requires several images with known phase shifts at each zzso stage, thus is not suitable for dynamic phase zzso zzso transform offer a solution to extract phase information from a single fringe zzso However, a high frequency spatial carrier which is sometimes not easy to generate is required to solve the phase ambiguity zzso In this paper, we aim to propose an ideal solution for dynamic phase zzso Four images with known phase shift are captured at the reference stage to analyze the initial phase zzso After the object starts continuous zzso only one image is captured at each zzso zzso A zzso phase extraction method is then applied for deformation phase extraction utilizing the phase zzso effect within a small zzso This method works well for zzso image with low and medium fringe zzso When the fringe density is high, especially in the case of zzso zzso information zzso inherent with merely one zzso zzso image often results in poor quality wrapped phase map with plenty of phase zzso which make phase zzso a difficult zzso In the light of this zzso a zzso transform based phase filtering method is proposed for fringe frequency analysis and zzso zzso and effectively removes most of the phase zzso to reconstruct a high quality wrapped phase zzso Several real experiments based on zzso are zzso zzso between the proposed solution and standard phase evaluation methods is also zzso The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated dynamic phase extraction zzso
