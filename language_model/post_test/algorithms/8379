A method is needed to identify zzso zzso coronary plaques that are likely to cause acute coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide information on the chemical composition of zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso can identify plaque composition and features associated with plaque vulnerability in human zzso zzso plaques obtained at the time of zzso 

A total of 199 samples from 5 human zzso specimens were analyzed by zzso zzso Features of plaque vulnerability were defined by zzso as presence of zzso pool, thin zzso cap zzso zzso by zzso zzso and inflammatory cell zzso An zzso 500 zzso was zzso zzso zzso values were obtained as log zzso data from zzso to zzso zzso at zzso zzso Principal component zzso was used for zzso An zzso was constructed with 50% of the samples used as a reference set; blinded predictions of plaque composition were then performed on the remaining zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso features of plaque vulnerability were zzso and zzso for zzso pool, zzso and zzso for thin cap, and zzso and zzso for inflammatory cells, zzso 

zzso zzso can identify plaque composition and features associated with plaque vulnerability in zzso human zzso zzso These results support efforts to develop an zzso zzso zzso system to detect vulnerable coronary plaques in living zzso
