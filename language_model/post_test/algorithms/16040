zzso adverse side effects after using zzso zzso zzso repellent products appear to be the result of significant zzso of zzso through human zzso The overall objective was to develop zzso of zzso with significantly reduced zzso using the basic principles and model of skin zzso based on zzso laws of diffusion at steady zzso zzso phase zzso of zzso with water and zzso zzso ethanol, PG and zzso 400, showed an increase in the zzso zzso of zzso This resulted in a linear decline in zzso PC with an increase in the concentration of the zzso zzso of zzso across human skin was studied from vehicles containing various amounts of PG and zzso 400 using an infinite dose technique and Franz diffusion zzso zzso flux reduced with increasing PG concentration and the flux from zzso PG was zzso zzso zzso zzso lower than flux of pure zzso control, zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso from zzso zzso 400 solution, and zzso of zzso was totally prevented from zzso zzso 400 which was very zzso However, a combination of zzso zzso 400 with zzso PG not only reduced zzso zzso but was suitable as a vehicle for zzso The decrease in flux and zzso of zzso with increasing concentration of zzso appeared to be a direct result of decrease in zzso PC and zzso zzso This study clearly demonstrates that alternative zzso can be developed for zzso aimed at reduced zzso and toxicity unlike the current zzso some of which contain ethanol which has been shown to enhance zzso of zzso A similar approach can be used for developing zzso of other industrial and occupational agents to prevent their skin zzso when a user may be exposed to zzso
