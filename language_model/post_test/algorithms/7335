zzso repair of the zzso arch is often unsatisfactory due to poor zzso conformity and inadequate landing zzso 

To study the anatomical characteristics of the zzso arch and provide basic information for the development of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso models were reconstructed in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of 120 elderly Asian patients, by manual zzso The zzso of each zzso zzso model was calculated using a repulsive force field zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso branches were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso A three-dimensional statistical zzso arch model was built using principal component zzso 

The mean diameters of the ascending and descending zzso and the origins of the zzso left common zzso and left zzso artery were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The length of the ascending zzso zzso to left common carotid artery, and left common carotid to left zzso artery were zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso The mean angle of zzso was zzso zzso Principal component analysis of the three-dimensional zzso derived 3 main modes of variation, which account for zzso of the overall shape zzso 

zzso arch anatomical information from an elderly Asian population can be useful for the development of future zzso zzso
