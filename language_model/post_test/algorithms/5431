An important step in unveiling the relation between network structure and dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods have been developed separately to identify community structure in different classes of networks, such as zzso networks, zzso networks, and directed zzso Here, we show that the finding of communities in such networks can be unified in a general zzso of community structure in zzso zzso Moreover, we propose an evolutionary method for efficiently identifying communities in zzso zzso To this end, we show that both zzso and directed networks can be represented as zzso networks, and their zzso is completely consistent with that for zzso networks, the detection of modular structure on which can be reformulated as zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso we develop a modified zzso genetic zzso zzso which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure zzso The high efficiency of the zzso is based on the following three improvements we zzso First, we introduce a different measure for the zzso of a locus instead of the standard zzso which can exactly determine which zzso zzso This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the current population and the uniform distribution of the zzso zzso the zzso divergence between zzso Second, we develop a zzso technique for zzso the zzso state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial zzso Third, we present a modified zzso rule which by incorporating related operations can guarantee the convergence of the zzso to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence zzso Experimental results show that the zzso zzso existing methods in terms of zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso
