zzso and zzso zzso of heart beats is primordial in many applications requiring long-term monitoring of the cardiac zzso Several zzso models able to cope with the strong class zzso and a large variety of feature sets have been proposed for this zzso In practice, over 200 features are often considered, and the features retained in the final model are either chosen using domain knowledge or an exhaustive search in the feature sets without evaluating the relevance of each individual feature included in the zzso As a consequence, the results obtained by these models can be zzso and difficult to zzso In this work, feature selection techniques are considered to extract optimal feature zzso for state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso The performances are evaluated on real ambulatory recordings and compared to previously reported feature choices using the same zzso zzso indicate that a small number of individual features actually serve the zzso and that better performances can be achieved by removing useless zzso
