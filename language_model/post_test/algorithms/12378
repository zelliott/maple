We present a method for the real time prediction of punctuate events in neural activity, based on the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso both to continuous processes like local field zzso zzso as well as to spike zzso We test it on recordings of zzso and zzso activity acquired previously from the lateral zzso area zzso of zzso monkeys performing a zzso zzso In contrast to earlier work, where trials with known start times were zzso our method detects and zzso trials directly from the zzso It provides a means to zzso compare and contrast the content of zzso signals and spike zzso we find that the detector performance based on the zzso matches the performance based on spike zzso The method should find application in the development of neural zzso based on the zzso zzso Our approach uses a new feature zzso which we call the zzso zzso
