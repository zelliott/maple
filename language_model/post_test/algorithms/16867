The zzso drugs that inhibit human zzso virus zzso entry to the target cells are already in different zzso of clinical zzso They prevent viral entry and have a highly specific mechanism of action with a low toxicity zzso Few zzso studies have been performed on this group of zzso This study was performed to develop a quantitative zzso relationship zzso model of the biological activity of zzso zzso derivatives as zzso of the interaction between zzso zzso zzso and host cell zzso zzso Forty different zzso zzso derivatives were selected as a sample set and zzso zzso using zzso zzso Different combinations of multiple linear zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso and artificial neural networks zzso were then zzso to construct the zzso zzso These models were also zzso to select the most efficient zzso of zzso in a zzso procedure for zzso log zzso zzso The results that were obtained using zzso were compared with zzso and zzso zzso A high zzso ability was observed for the zzso zzso and zzso models, with root mean sum square errors zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively (N zzso zzso In zzso machine learning methods were highly effective in designing zzso models when compared to statistical zzso
