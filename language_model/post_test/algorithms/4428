zzso technology has generated vast amounts of gene expression data with distinct zzso Based on the premise that genes of correlated functions tend to exhibit similar expression patterns, various machine learning methods have been applied to capture these specific patterns in zzso zzso However, the zzso between the rich expression profiles and the limited knowledge of gene functions has been a major hurdle to the understanding of cellular zzso To bridge this gap so as to properly comprehend and interpret expression data, we introduce zzso Feedback to zzso analysis and propose an interactive learning framework to incorporate the expert knowledge into the decision zzso In order to find a good learning method and solve two intrinsic problems in zzso data, high zzso and small sample size, we also propose a zzso learning zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso efficiently zzso a large set of zzso data to compensate for the zzso of a small set of labeled data and it extends the linear zzso in zzso zzso to a kernel zzso to handle zzso zzso data in a lower zzso zzso The zzso Feedback technique and zzso together construct an efficient and effective interactive zzso learning framework for zzso zzso zzso experiments on the zzso cell cycle regulation data set and zzso zzso red blood cell cycle data set show the promise of this zzso
