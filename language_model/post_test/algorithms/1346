The new program zzso zzso Algorithm for zzso zzso for efficient calculation of three-dimensional protein and zzso acid structures from distance constraints and zzso angle constraints collected by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso experiments performs simulated zzso by molecular dynamics in zzso angle space and uses a fast zzso zzso to integrate the equations of zzso zzso angle dynamics can be more efficient than molecular dynamics in Cartesian coordinate space because of the reduced number of degrees of freedom and the zzso absence of zzso bond and angle zzso which allows for the use of longer zzso and/or higher temperatures in the structure zzso It also represents a significant advance over the variable target function method in zzso angle space with the zzso strategy used by the predecessor program zzso zzso zzso times per accepted zzso in the zzso used to represent the zzso structure compare favorably with those of other presently available structure calculation zzso and are of the order of 160 seconds for a protein of 165 zzso acid zzso when using a zzso Alpha zzso zzso zzso Test calculations starting from zzso with random zzso angle values further showed that zzso is capable of efficient calculation of high-quality protein structures with up to 400 zzso acid zzso and of zzso acid zzso
