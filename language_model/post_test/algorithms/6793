The development and operational evaluation of a zzso gas generator for the analysis of volatile or zzso compounds zzso in air is zzso Details of the construction, as well as of the evaluation of the apparatus are presented zzso The performance of the test gas generator is validated both by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gas produced and by zzso analysis of zzso samples taken from the generated zzso zzso Both, active and passive sampling have been used, and the results demonstrate the excellent accuracy and precision of the generated test gas zzso For the 11 investigated organic compounds zzso and zzso zzso the found values were in most cases within zzso of the target value with a zzso of better than zzso zzso (as determined by the analysis of the sampled zzso zzso Custom made zzso tubes were used for active and passive sampling and in both cases were zzso by zzso zzso Particularly the combination of passive sampling and zzso analysis offers significant advantages over the commonly used active sampling on activated zzso followed by zzso zzso in terms of avoidance of hazardous zzso potential for automation and improved detection zzso Both sampling techniques are capable for monitoring zzso at zzso and under conditions relevant for workplace zzso
