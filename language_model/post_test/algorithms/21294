To evaluate in the zzso kidney the effect of maneuvers thought to alter zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso water flow was measured in isolated zzso rabbit cortical collecting zzso zzso exposed to either varying bath zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The development of the response to VP (20 zzso was enhanced zzso by lowering zzso from zzso to zzso zzso but was not altered by increasing zzso from zzso to zzso zzso When measured in the same zzso the maintenance phase of a previously established hormone response was inhibited by acutely raising zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 65 zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso the development of the response to VP compared with that observed in zzso bathed in zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and low zzso zzso added during the maintenance phase enhanced the VP response by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the development of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso decreased by zzso the maintenance phase of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A longer exposure to the zzso was required to inhibit the development and maintenance zzso of the response to zzso M zzso These results are consistent with the view that transient changes in zzso zzso may be required for the development of the hormone response but that sustained increases in zzso zzso levels inhibit the development as well as the maintenance phase of the zzso response to VP or zzso in zzso
