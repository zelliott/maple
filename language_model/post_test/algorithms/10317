Computer systems play an important role in clinical zzso and are a routine part of finding clinical diagnoses but make it difficult to fully exploit information derived from facial zzso So far, automated syndrome diagnosis based on digital, facial photographs has been demonstrated under study conditions but has not been applied in clinical zzso We have therefore investigated how well statistical zzso trained on study data zzso 202 individuals affected by one of 14 syndromes could zzso a set of 91 patients for whom pictures were taken under regular, less controlled conditions in clinical zzso We found a zzso accuracy of zzso percent in the clinical sample representing a ratio of zzso over a random zzso This contrasts with a zzso accuracy or zzso ratio in the training zzso Producing average images in both groups from sets of pictures for each syndrome demonstrates that the groups exhibit large zzso differences explaining discrepancies in zzso A broadening of the data set is suggested in order to improve accuracy in clinical zzso In order to further this goal, a software package is made available that allows application of the procedures and contributions toward an improved data zzso
