This chapter covers gene expression analysis by zzso to study and characterize stem zzso In a zzso scenario, we describe basic zzso zzso used to answer common questions in zzso experiments involving one or more stem cell zzso Service providers or zzso core labs usually carry out sample preparation, zzso and scanning of zzso zzso in this chapter, we focus on the state-of-the-art data analysis that avoids common pitfalls and introduces the reader to important controls that yield robust biologically relevant zzso We describe evaluation of zzso expressed zzso zzso methods, zzso enrichment analysis, and gene network discovery methods that can be used to formulate meaningful biological insights as well as suggest new wet lab zzso
