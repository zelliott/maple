zzso zzso drug delivery systems zzso to increase zzso of zzso basic drugs by extending their transit time is a promising zzso zzso systems were evaluated for this zzso Such systems demonstrate dual mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso requires maintaining its dimensions, which demands diffusion as a zzso mechanism of release zzso In this work, zzso a zzso basic drug, together with various grades of zzso zzso and different zzso were evaluated for release and swelling zzso zzso data were analyzed by curve fitting to various models to estimate zzso release zzso It was found that zzso containing a zzso zzso like zzso cellulose demonstrated predominantly zzso mechanism of release, whereas soluble zzso zzso and zzso contributed to a mixed mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso increased the swelling and zzso whereas sodium zzso altered the erosion zzso A correlation between zzso weight loss and drug release was zzso which further consolidated the zzso zzso for the soluble zzso was zzso whereas that for the zzso zzso was zzso zzso predominance of zzso release mechanism for the zzso zzso the selection of zzso can influence zzso zzso and release zzso which can be used for developing zzso
