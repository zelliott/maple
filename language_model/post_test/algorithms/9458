Finding zzso zzso descriptions is an important task in the analysis of complex, zzso models of gene regulatory zzso This task involves zzso identifying zzso that best describe the state of these complex systems and zzso characterizing the dynamics of the zzso In a previous paper zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the authors assumed that good zzso were known a zzso and presented an zzso approach to approximate zzso quantities zzso effective drift and diffusion zzso that characterize the long-time behavior of the zzso Here we use diffusion maps zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso zzso to extract appropriate zzso zzso zzso in an automated zzso these involve the leading zzso of a weighted zzso on a graph constructed from network simulation zzso We present lifting and restriction procedures for translating between physical variables and these zzso zzso These procedures allow us to perform zzso zzso zzso characterizing the long-term dynamics through the design and processing of short bursts of zzso simulation zzso at appropriate values of the zzso zzso
