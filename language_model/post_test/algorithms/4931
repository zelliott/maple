The analysis of zzso gene expression data with respect to sets of genes rather than individual genes has many zzso A variety of methods have been developed for assessing the enrichment of sets of genes with respect to differential zzso In this paper we provide a comparative study of four of these zzso zzso exact test, Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso zzso zzso and Gene List Analysis with zzso zzso zzso The first three methods use zzso statistics, while the fourth uses zzso zzso We first compare all four methods on simulated data sets to verify that zzso exact test is markedly worse than the other three zzso We then validate the other three methods on seven real data sets with known genetic zzso and then compare the methods on two cancer data sets where our a zzso knowledge is zzso 

The simulation study highlights that none of the three method zzso all others zzso zzso and zzso are able to detect weak signals of deregulation and they perform differently when genes in a gene set are both zzso up and down zzso zzso is more conservative and large differences between the two zzso are required to allow the method to detect differential deregulation in gene zzso This is due to the fact that the enrichment statistic in zzso is prediction error which is a stronger criteria than classical two sample statistic as used in zzso and zzso This was reflected in the analysis on real data sets as zzso and zzso were seen to be significant for particular gene sets while zzso was not, suggesting a small effect zzso We find that the rank of gene set enrichment induced by zzso is more similar to zzso than zzso More importantly, the rankings of the three methods share significant zzso 

The three methods considered in our study recover relevant gene sets known to be zzso in the experimental conditions and zzso zzso There are differences between the three methods and zzso seems to be more consistent in finding enriched gene sets, although no method zzso dominates over all data zzso Our analysis highlights the deep difference existing between zzso and zzso methods for detecting enrichment and the use of both to better interpret results of zzso zzso We close with suggestions for users of gene set zzso
