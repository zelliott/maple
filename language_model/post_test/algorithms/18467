A hybrid approach for solving the zzso zzso equation zzso is zzso Under this approach, the zzso potential is separated into zzso a linear component satisfying the linear zzso and solved using a fast boundary element method and zzso a correction term accounting for zzso effects and zzso the presence of an zzso zzso Because the correction potential contains no zzso (in particular, it is smooth at charge zzso it can be accurately and efficiently solved using a finite difference zzso The motivation for and zzso of such a decomposition are presented together with the zzso method for calculating the linear and correction zzso For comparison, we also develop an integral equation representation of the solution to the zzso zzso When implemented upon regular lattice grids, the hybrid scheme is found to outperform the integral equation method when treating zzso zzso zzso zzso are presented for a zzso cavity containing a central charge, where the objective is to compare zzso zzso zzso zzso solutions against ones obtained with alternate zzso solution zzso This is followed by examination of the zzso properties of zzso acid zzso
