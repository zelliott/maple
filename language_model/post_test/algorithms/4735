The dynamics of proteins are important for understanding their zzso In recent years, the simple zzso zzso Network Model zzso has been fairly successful in interpreting zzso zzso However, the model clearly ignores the contribution of the rigid body motions and the effect of crystal zzso The model cannot explain the fact that the same protein may have significantly different zzso under different crystal packing zzso In this work, we propose a new zzso called zzso which takes into account both the contribution of the rigid body motions and the effect of crystal zzso by allowing the zzso of the internal modes to be zzso It zzso that the effect of crystal packing should cause some modes to be amplified and others to become less zzso In doing so, zzso is able to resolve the apparent zzso in experimental zzso among structures of the same protein but with different crystal packing conditions, which zzso cannot zzso With a small number of zzso zzso is able to reproduce experimental zzso for a large set of proteins with significantly better correlations zzso a mean value of zzso as compared to zzso by zzso The results of applying zzso also show that the rigid body motions account for nearly zzso of the total zzso in good agreement with previous zzso
