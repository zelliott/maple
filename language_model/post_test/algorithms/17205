zzso for an island model where zzso maintains a zzso neutral zzso at a single locus on each island is zzso The likelihood of an observed sample type zzso is obtained by applying a zzso zzso analogous to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 46 (1994), zzso This allows the zzso of sampling zzso in an island model and investigation of their zzso Given a sample type zzso the maximum likelihood estimate of the migration zzso is obtained by simulating independently the likelihood at a grid of points and, also, using a surface simulation zzso The latter method generates the whole likelihood trajectory in a single application of the simulation zzso An estimate of zzso of the estimate of the migration zzso is obtained using the likelihood zzso A comparison of the maximum likelihood estimates of the gene flow between zzso is made with those obtained by using Wright's zzso zzso
