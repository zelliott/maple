zzso of zzso target sites in promoters remains difficult due to the short length and zzso of the target zzso Although the use of zzso sequences and zzso zzso approaches may help in the recognition of zzso and potentially functional zzso correct alignment of the short zzso binding sites can be problematic for established zzso especially when aligning more divergent zzso Here, we report a novel zzso zzso approach, zzso that uses biologically relevant information, that is, potential zzso binding sites as represented by zzso weight zzso to establish anchors between zzso sequences and to guide promoter sequence zzso zzso of the performance of zzso with the global alignment programs zzso and zzso using a reference data set, shows that zzso performs equally well for closely related species like zzso and human, and has a clear added value for aligning promoter elements of more divergent species like human and fish, as it identifies zzso zzso binding sites that are not found by other zzso zzso is accessible via a Web interface at zzso
