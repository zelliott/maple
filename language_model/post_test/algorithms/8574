The complexity, zzso and zzso of the cardiovascular system typically defy comprehensive and deterministic mathematical zzso except from a statistical zzso Living systems are governed by numerous, continuously changing, interacting variables in the presence of zzso zzso signals can be shown to be zzso zzso between deterministic zzso and zzso pauses zzso zzso One promising approach for assessing such zzso complexity is recurrence zzso analysis zzso As reviewed in this paper, strategies implementing zzso of zzso have been successful in diagnosing changes in zzso cardiac signals not easily detected by traditional zzso It is concluded that recurrence zzso analysis is a powerful zzso tool which, when properly applied to cardiac signals, can provide objectivity regarding the degree of determinism characterizing the system, state changes, as well as degrees of complexity and/or zzso
