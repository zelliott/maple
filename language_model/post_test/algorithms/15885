The paper extends on the traditional methodology used to zzso DNA evidence in zzso or identification zzso By extending we imply that there are more than two alternatives to choose zzso In a standard zzso case the two competing explanations zzso zzso zzso is the father of the child and zzso zzso random man is the father of the child, are typically zzso A zzso index of zzso implies that the data is zzso more likely assuming hypothesis zzso rather than zzso If zzso is replaced by zzso brother of John zzso is the zzso the zzso may change zzso The main topic of this paper is to determine the most probable pedigree given a certain set of data including DNA zzso In the previous example this zzso to determining the most likely relation between John zzso and the zzso Based on DNA obtained from victims of a fire, bodies found in an ancient grave or from individuals seeking to confirm their anticipated family relations, we would like to determine the most probable zzso The approach we present provides the possibility to combine zzso evidence, say age of individuals, and DNA zzso The program zzso zzso as zzso from zzso delivers the probabilities for the various family zzso More precisely, the information (if zzso prior to DNA is combined with the zzso in a zzso manner to deliver the zzso zzso We exemplify using the well published zzso data where the accepted solution emerges among zzso possibilities zzso Various other applications based on forensic case work are zzso In addition we have simulated data to resemble an zzso zzso Since the true family relation is known in this case, we may evaluate the zzso
