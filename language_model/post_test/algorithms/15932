The purposes of this project were to prepare zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to study the zzso of zzso of the prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso was formed and characterized in zzso in the sample chamber of a differential scanning zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a variable temperature zzso powder zzso zzso It has a glass transition temperature of 56 degrees C and it is a relatively strong glass with a strength zzso of zzso The zzso of its zzso were followed by zzso zzso under a controlled water vapor pressure of 23 zzso The zzso zzso are best described by the three-dimensional nuclear growth model with rate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 45, 50, and 55 degrees C, zzso When the zzso equation was used, the zzso energy of zzso was calculated to be 74 zzso in the presence of water vapor zzso zzso On the basis of the Kissinger plot, the zzso energy of zzso in the absence of water vapor zzso zzso water vapor zzso was determined to be 157 zzso zzso of the zzso is a novel method to prepare zzso zzso in comparison with other methods, it is a relatively gentle and effective zzso
