zzso zzso zzso is a zzso technique to evaluate liver zzso We compared the performance of TE with liver biopsy zzso in patients with human zzso virus zzso and zzso B virus zzso zzso Patients zzso underwent TE and zzso The diagnosis accuracy of TE was calculated using receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso for different stages of fibrosis, and optimal zzso values were zzso A sequential zzso combining TE with zzso score zzso is zzso zzso patients had both TE and LB zzso time: 3 zzso and two with proven zzso only zzso zzso zzso were under zzso therapy with zzso drugs in zzso and 19 zzso had elevated zzso zzso zzso A significant correlation was observed between liver zzso measurement zzso and zzso zzso stages zzso zzso zzso Patients with elevated zzso tended to have higher zzso than those with normal zzso The areas under the zzso zzso were zzso for significant zzso zzso zzso zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso Using a zzso of zzso zzso for F zzso 2 and zzso zzso for F zzso 3, the diagnosis accuracy was zzso and zzso zzso With an zzso combining TE and zzso zzso of patients were well classified for significant zzso Using this algorithm, the need for LB can be reduced by zzso In zzso patients, most of them with normal zzso under zzso treatment including zzso active drugs, TE was zzso in discriminating moderate to severe zzso from minimal liver zzso
