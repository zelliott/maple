In the detection of particles using digital zzso zzso measurement accuracy is substantially influenced by the zzso processing zzso In particular, a number of methods have been proposed to determine the zzso particle depth zzso zzso However, due to the lack of consistent uncertainty zzso it has been unclear which method is best suited to a given measurement zzso In this work, depth determination zzso of seven particle detection methods, including a recently proposed hybrid method, are systematically investigated in terms of relative depth measurement errors and zzso Both synthetic and experimental zzso of particle fields are considered at conditions relevant to particle zzso and zzso While all methods display a range of particle conditions where they are most accurate, in general the hybrid method is shown to be the most robust with depth uncertainty less than twice the particle diameter over a wide range of particle field zzso
