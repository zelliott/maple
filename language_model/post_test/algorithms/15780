Any zzso zzso may be regarded as a zzso fuzzy zzso zzso information about a particular sequence may not be available in certain zzso The investigator will be confronted with imprecise zzso yet want to make comparisons of zzso zzso zzso can be compared by using geometrical interpretation of fuzzy sets as points in a zzso 

We introduce the space of fuzzy zzso and a means of measuring zzso between zzso We establish mathematical principles to measure zzso between fuzzy zzso and present several examples in this metric zzso We calculate the zzso of the zzso at the three base sites of a zzso in the coding sequences of zzso coli K-12 and zzso tuberculosis zzso and consider them as points in that fuzzy zzso We zzso the distance between the zzso of zzso and zzso
