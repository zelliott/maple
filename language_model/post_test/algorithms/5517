Numerous studies have contributed to efforts to boost the accuracy of the credit scoring zzso Especially interesting are recent studies which have successfully developed the hybrid approach, which advances zzso accuracy by combining different machine learning zzso However, to achieve better credit decisions, it is not enough merely to increase the accuracy of the credit scoring zzso It is necessary to conduct meaningful supplementary analyses in order to obtain knowledge of zzso relations, particularly in terms of significant conceptual patterns or structures involving attributes used in the credit scoring zzso This paper proposes a solution of zzso data zzso strategies and the zzso network zzso with the tree zzso zzso zzso search algorithm, in order to improve zzso accuracy and to obtain improved knowledge of zzso patterns, thus enhancing the zzso of credit zzso
