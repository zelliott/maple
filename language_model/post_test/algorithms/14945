zzso data on childhood leukemia in Los Angeles County were zzso with residential magnetic fields predicted from the wiring zzso of nearby transmission and distribution zzso As described in a companion paper, the zzso means of the magnetic field's magnitude in subjects' homes were predicted by a physically based zzso model that had been fitted to zzso zzso and wiring zzso In addition, magnetic field zzso were adjusted for the most likely form of exposure assessment zzso classic errors for the zzso zzso and zzso errors for the predictions from wire zzso Although the measured fields had no association with childhood leukemia zzso for zzso the risks were significant for predicted magnetic fields above zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso and a significant zzso was seen zzso for zzso When zzso were determined by a combination of predictions and zzso that zzso for zzso the odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso and the trend zzso zzso showed somewhat greater zzso These findings support the hypothesis that magnetic fields from electrical lines are zzso related to childhood leukemia but that this association has been inconsistent among zzso studies due to different types of exposure assessment zzso In these data, the leukemia risks from a child's residential magnetic field exposure appears to be better assessed by wire zzso than by zzso area zzso However, the predicted fields only partially account for the effect of the zzso wire code in a zzso analysis and do not completely explain why these wire codes have been so often associated with childhood zzso The most plausible explanation for our findings is that the zzso factor is another magnetic field exposure metric correlated to both wire code and the field's zzso zzso
