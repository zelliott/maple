To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso for the detection and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso by using digital zzso zzso zzso as zzso 

zzso patients (12 male, 17 zzso mean age: 62 zzso with 41 zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso at zzso each underwent zzso zzso examination without contrast and then a zzso zzso zzso examination with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso images were used to evaluate zzso features that impact the risk of zzso and the selection of a zzso Almost half zzso of zzso were located in the internal carotid artery, 7 in the anterior zzso artery, 9 in the middle cerebral artery and 4 in the zzso zzso zzso All patients also underwent zzso before or after the MR zzso 

The zzso results were in all cases consistent with the zzso zzso No differences were noted between zzso zzso and zzso concerning the detection and location of the 41 zzso or zzso of the parental zzso zzso were apparent concerning the zzso of zzso features, especially for large zzso zzso zzso An irregular zzso shape was demonstrated for 21 zzso on zzso but only zzso zzso on zzso zzso Likewise, zzso permitted zzso of an zzso neck and calculation of the zzso ratio for all 34 zzso with a neck demonstrated at zzso zzso a neck was visible for only zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso detected 15 zzso with branches originating from the zzso and/or neck, whereas branches were recognized in only zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

For evaluation of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso is superior to zzso zzso for assessment of zzso shape, detection of zzso neck, and zzso of branches originating from the zzso or neck itself, if the size of the aneurysm is greater than 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso is as accurate and effective as zzso for the evaluation of zzso
