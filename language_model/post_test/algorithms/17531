zzso zzso often contain islands, such as temperate zzso or zzso islands, delivered by zzso zzso zzso usually occurs within a zzso or zzso zzso splitting the zzso yet sequences within the island restore the disrupted zzso The zzso zzso gene and the displaced zzso of that gene thus mark the zzso of the zzso We applied this principle to search for islands in zzso DNA zzso Our zzso generates a list of zzso and zzso zzso uses each as the query for a zzso search of the starting DNA and removes unlikely hits through a series of zzso A search for islands in 106 whole bacterial zzso produced 143 candidates, with the search itself providing an estimate of three false candidates among zzso zzso zzso analysis of the associated zzso reduced this set to 89 cases of independently evolved site zzso which showed strong bias for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso presents the candidate islands in zzso files and zzso zzso zzso with site zzso
