A zzso zzso kinetic model of zzso zzso zzso which includes zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso has been zzso Data for analysis were obtained from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso which were incubated in buffer containing zzso frozen, extracted with zzso and separated on zzso zzso Solutions of the equations of the model were fit to the data by means of zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso is adequately described by a single reaction so that the model reduces to eight zzso The in zzso rate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso are very similar to prior in zzso zzso The zzso rate constant is similar to zzso so zzso zzso slowly accumulate and gradually assume larger relative importance as other compounds disappear more zzso Rate zzso for zzso slices from zzso and zzso are similar, while zzso slices have smaller tissue transport zzso and larger zzso zzso The rate equation for zzso zzso of this model is relatively insensitive to uncertainties regarding the rate zzso Including later zzso components in kinetic models improves the calculations of zzso zzso with long isotope zzso
