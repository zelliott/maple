With the zzso calculation of the spectrum of single bubble zzso we find that when the maximum temperature inside a dimly zzso bubble is relatively low, the spectral lines are zzso As the maximum temperature of the bubble increases, the line spectrum from the bright bubble zzso or even fades away relative to the background zzso The calculations in this paper effectively interpret the observed phenomena, indicating that the calculated results, which are closely related to the spectrum profile, such as temperature and pressure, should be zzso The present calculation tends to zzso the existence of a hot plasma core inside a zzso zzso
