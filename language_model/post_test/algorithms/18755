In the present study a systematic approach was used to model the zzso zzso activity of a series of zzso containing zzso belonging to four chemical families with a wide structural zzso The proposed mode of action implies the reduction of the zzso zzso however, the zzso mechanism underlying the zzso zzso activity is still zzso For structural representation two types of zzso were zzso quantum chemical zzso global zzso and properties coded by zzso distribution function zzso Both types of zzso point to the relevance of electronic zzso The zzso zzso identified an zzso center at zzso A from the oxygen atom of the zzso zzso although other properties are required to explain the biological zzso While the mode of action of zzso containing zzso is still unknown, the results obtained here strengthen the importance of the zzso character of the zzso and the possible participation of the zzso in a reduction zzso The ability of these zzso to distinguish among activity classes was assessed using zzso neural networks, and the best zzso zzso were later used for model zzso Different learning zzso were used for model development, and zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the performance of each zzso The best results were obtained using zzso neighbors zzso and decision tree zzso methods combined with global zzso Since zzso methods are easily translated into zzso rules, the zzso model is a useful tool in the de zzso construction of new zzso containing zzso lead zzso
