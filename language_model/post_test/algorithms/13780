A zzso zzso zzso for suppressing lateral noise sources was implemented in real-time and tested with normal and zzso zzso With this algorithm, frequency bands with zzso time and zzso differences characteristic for the zzso direction of the desired speech sound reach both ears without any zzso However, frequency bands with an zzso time and zzso difference zzso from these desired values are zzso Speech quality assessments as well as speech zzso tests demonstrate a significant noise reduction of up to about 5 zzso in zzso ratio for a zzso recorded zzso zzso in an zzso zzso For two additional zzso situations, however, the zzso speech quality from the zzso degrades with increasing zzso while the output from a real-time zzso zzso was ranked higher with increasing zzso The results with zzso listeners suggest a combination of both zzso while stressing the importance of zzso listening and zzso hearing aids for the rehabilitation of impaired listeners in noisy zzso
