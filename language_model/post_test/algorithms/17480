We have used a serial MR image analysis technique previously developed for studies of cerebral zzso in zzso zzso and applied it to a study of zzso zzso patients with images acquired using a different scanner and scan zzso zzso and zzso tests showed that with only small changes to key analysis parameters the technique can successfully be applied to previously untested data with dissimilar image zzso The overall accuracy in zzso of cerebral zzso using the technique was determined to be between 2 and 4 zzso zzso depending on the conditions during image zzso By comparing the results of alternative registration techniques we demonstrate the potential of using of fully automated 9 zzso image registration as an effective and efficient means of correcting for scanner zzso size variations, even in the presence of significant cerebral zzso zzso to the zzso zzso study, patients were found to have significantly increased mean zzso rates zzso compared to zzso In general the analysis technique is shown to be a zzso accurate and zzso tool of potential value for future studies of zzso and related zzso zzso
