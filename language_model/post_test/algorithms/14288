Recently a new technique for the combined acquisition of zzso images, termed zzso zzso was zzso In combo acquisitions, the three concepts of 1) variable acquisition zzso 2) zzso data sharing, and 3) zzso imaging are systematically integrated to reduce zzso scan time and improve data zzso in a clinical zzso In this study, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso combo acquisition protocols that were designed and zzso in simulation experiments were implemented on a zzso T clinical zzso Phantom and human brain data from volunteers and patients were zzso zzso time reductions of zzso were achieved compared to standard acquisitions, largely confirming the simulation zzso We evaluated the resulting images by zzso analyzing the preservation of contrast and the zzso ratio zzso In addition, data sets for 10 clinical cases obtained with zzso combo and corresponding standard acquisitions were graded by two experienced zzso in terms of the level of artifacts and image quality for zzso Only minor image degradation with the combo scans was observed, indicating an inherent zzso between scan time reduction and image zzso The specific aspects of combo acquisitions with respect to motion, flow, and zzso data weighting are zzso
