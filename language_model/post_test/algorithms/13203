zzso of set and zzso zzso of zzso investments were zzso A gas zzso was used to measure the volumes, and hence the zzso of fine zzso and porous zzso zzso of set and zzso zzso were then obtained from these data for zzso zzso and dry set zzso by a zzso simulation method, subsequently leading on to the estimated compositions of conventional and zzso investments used in this zzso Excess water content in the zzso investment compact was evaluated as a function of setting time elapsed from the start of zzso zzso were about zzso for set zzso and zzso for zzso zzso which well agreed with the zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that the functional composition of investment powder needed to achieve the optimal zzso as well as process parameters such as zzso zzso ratio and keeping time of mixed investment casting slurry before heat treatment could be determined using the zzso simulation method developed in this zzso
