This paper presents a new zzso which can be used to register images of the same or different zzso zzso images with multiple channels, such as X-rays, temperature or zzso or simply images of different spectral zzso In particular, a zzso scheme is used, but instead of gray values, it zzso numbers formulated by different combinations of the extracted local Walsh zzso of the zzso Each image patch is expanded in terms of Walsh basis zzso Each Walsh basis function can be thought of as measuring a different aspect of local structure, zzso horizontal edge, corner, zzso The zzso of the expansion, therefore, can be thought of as dense local features, zzso at each point the degree of presence of, for example, a horizontal edge, a corner with contrast of a certain type, zzso These zzso are zzso and used as digits in a chosen number system which allows one to create a unique number for each type of local zzso The choice of the basis of the number system allows one to give different emphasis to different types of local feature zzso corners versus zzso and, thus, the method we present forms a unified framework in terms of which several feature matching methods may be zzso The zzso is compared with zzso and zzso based approaches, using simulated and real zzso The two images are assumed to differ from each other by a rotation and a translation zzso
