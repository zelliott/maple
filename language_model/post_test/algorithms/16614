With recent advances in zzso cardiac imaging, a number of methods exist for the zzso assessment of zzso zzso Although zzso row zzso zzso zzso remains the gold standard for zzso zzso there are a number of limitations including radiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an alternative to zzso for providing accurate zzso assessment of zzso root and ascending zzso zzso 

To determine the accuracy of two-dimensional zzso zzso for determining zzso zzso in comparison to zzso a retrospective study of individuals with varying zzso root and ascending zzso dimensions was zzso 

There were 116 patients zzso zzso mean age 49 zzso 12 zzso in zzso The maximum zzso diameters by zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The maximum zzso diameters by zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was good to excellent correlation between zzso zzso and zzso at all four levels of the zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso ST zzso r zzso zzso ascending zzso r zzso zzso There was a consistent zzso of zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso when compared to zzso 

zzso is a zzso accurate, and zzso method for the zzso assessment of zzso zzso diameters as compared to zzso
