The goal of this research is to promote zzso methods for anatomical averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration zzso This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous zzso where linear averaging is not zzso or in the elastic zzso The theory behind this novel zzso building zzso is similar to the traditional zzso registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average zzso These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the zzso that moves an image toward the mean shape zzso This model gives large deformation zzso that are optimal with respect to the shape zzso as defined by the data and the image registration zzso We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation zzso zzso Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length zzso shape zzso The zzso zzso creation zzso is zzso compared to the zzso anatomical average to zzso the need for zzso zzso The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct zzso
