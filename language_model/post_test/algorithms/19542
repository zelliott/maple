zzso properties of volatile agents against lung zzso are well zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to alter the lung mechanics in the absence of an airway tone and during zzso zzso zzso 

zzso pulmonary zzso data zzso were collected from isolated, zzso rat lungs under baseline conditions and following the injection of zzso zzso zzso into the pulmonary zzso zzso were performed without the administration of any zzso agent in the first phase of the experiments and during inhalation without any volatile agent zzso group, zzso zzso 6) or during inhalation of Hal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso 8) at 1 minimum zzso concentration zzso The airway resistance zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were estimated from the zzso data by model zzso 

Under baseline conditions, the basic value of Raw was significantly decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration, whereas Hal and zzso did not have a statistically significant effect on Raw zzso zzso zzso zzso and - zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, all four inhalation zzso prevented the increase in Raw following zzso administration, the findings ranging between - zzso zzso zzso for Hal and - zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Our results on a zzso isolated zzso lung model demonstrate the potential of zzso and zzso to decrease the zzso airway tone, whereas zzso and Hal are ineffective in this zzso All of these volatile agents markedly protect against zzso zzso
