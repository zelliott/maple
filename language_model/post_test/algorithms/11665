Brain tissue oxygen monitoring zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed in addition to standard zzso pressure zzso and cerebral zzso pressure zzso monitoring in seven patients with severe zzso damage of zzso zzso The correlation between zzso changes and zzso fluctuations during periods of 30 minutes were zzso when zzso was above 70 zzso and lower than 100 zzso A new ratio, the zzso zzso index was calculated as zzso zzso zzso zzso The patient zzso values were compared to those found in the brain of six zzso zzso zzso The analysis was performed to determine the significance of zzso fluctuations of zzso and zzso when zzso is above the lower threshold of zzso The correlation between zzso variations and zzso variations was found to be strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients and was weak in the zzso animals zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in patients and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In the injured brain of our patients, we observed an unexpectedly close correlation between zzso and zzso variations when zzso levels were within a zzso targeted range zzso to 100 zzso In a zzso model, we could not find this relationship in the zzso zzso We speculate that an increased zzso might be indicative for an impaired local pressure zzso The preliminary data suggest that zzso values above zzso might be zzso However, the reported sample sizes are too small to provide sufficient statistical power to justify zzso statistical zzso As such, results are presented with descriptive statistics only, and should be regarded as a zzso
