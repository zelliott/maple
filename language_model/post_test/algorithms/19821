The paper presents an zzso for zzso a pedestrian location in an urban zzso The zzso is based on the particle filter and uses different data zzso a zzso receiver, zzso sensors, probability maps and a stereo zzso zzso sensors are used to estimate a relative displacement of a zzso A zzso estimates a change in the heading zzso An zzso is used to count a zzso steps and their zzso The so-called probability maps help to limit zzso inaccuracy by imposing constraints on pedestrian zzso zzso it is assumed that a pedestrian cannot cross buildings, fences zzso This limits position inaccuracy to zzso 10 zzso zzso of depth estimates derived from a stereo camera that are compared to the zzso model of an environment has enabled further reduction of positioning zzso As a result, for zzso of the time, the zzso is able to estimate a pedestrian location with an error smaller than 2 zzso compared to an error of zzso m for a navigation based solely on zzso
