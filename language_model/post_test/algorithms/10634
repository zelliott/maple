In this work, an integral equation approach to investigate the zzso polystyrene zzso melt based on zzso reference interaction site model zzso theory is zzso The zzso structure factors, required as input to zzso theory, are obtained from the zzso chain zzso With a novel zzso procedure and the zzso zzso zzso simulations for zzso the parameters needed for the zzso model are obtained by using an automatic zzso zzso These parameters can be used to describe the structure and zzso properties of the complex zzso melt and good agreement is obtained between the theory and MD zzso The proposed integral equation approach provides a basis for describing the structure and properties of zzso zzso where the application of molecular simulation is zzso
