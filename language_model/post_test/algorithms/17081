The three-dimensional zzso problem solved here for zzso zzso is to estimate the zzso intensity zzso where zzso zzso zzso given a series of zzso counting process zzso zzso zzso 1, each with intensity zzso see zzso with zzso see zzso being the point spread of the zzso focused to the zzso plane and zzso the detection probability for detector point y at focal depth zzso A maximum a zzso reconstruction generated by inducing a prior distribution on the space of images via zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso penalty zzso see zzso It is proven that the sequence of zzso that is generated by using the expectation zzso zzso is zzso increasing in zzso zzso with stable points of the iteration satisfying the necessary zzso conditions of the maximum a zzso zzso The zzso were implemented on the zzso a 64 zzso 64 parallel processor, running at zzso 2 zzso 3-D zzso zzso are demonstrated from simulated as well as zzso and zzso zzso We study performance comparisons of the zzso for the zzso problems corresponding to fast data collection for rapid motion studies in which every other focal plane is removed and for imaging with limited detector areas and zzso
