zzso zzso zzso identification is highly important to modern zzso The state-of-the-art method for zzso identification is based on comparative zzso in which evolutionary zzso of sequences and secondary structures provide important evidence for zzso zzso For zzso with low sequence conservation but high structural zzso conventional local alignment tools such as zzso yield low zzso Thus, there is a need for zzso search methods that can incorporate both sequence and structural zzso We introduce zzso a zzso structural alignment tool that can effectively locate zzso zzso zzso elements with low sequence zzso In zzso zzso structures are extracted from dot plots generated by an efficient zzso zzso Then, we formulate stem alignment as an extended zzso chain problem and employ existing chain zzso zzso is tested on a data set containing zzso zzso zzso and is applied to novel zzso search in a zzso data zzso The experimental results show that zzso has better zzso between sensitivity and false positive rate in zzso prediction than conventional sequence similarity search tools and is more time efficient than structural alignment zzso The source codes of zzso can be downloaded at zzso or at zzso
