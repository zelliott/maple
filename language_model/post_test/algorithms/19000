Models have been developed for the analysis of dynamic zzso zzso zzso data that do not require direct zzso of the zzso input zzso such methods are referred to as reference region zzso These models typically return estimates of the volume transfer constant zzso and the zzso zzso volume fraction zzso To date such models have assumed a linear relationship between the measured zzso ( identical with zzso and the concentration of contrast agent, a transformation referred to as the fast exchange limit, but this assumption is not valid for all zzso of an zzso A theory for zzso reference region models which accounts for water exchange is zzso evaluated in simulations, and applied in zzso zzso Using reasonable zzso values, simulations show that the assumption of fast exchange can underestimate zzso and zzso by up to zzso and zzso zzso By analyzing a large region of interest and a single zzso the new model can return parameters within approximately zzso and zzso respectively, of their true zzso Analysis of experimental data shows that the new approach returns zzso and zzso values that are up to zzso and zzso respectively, greater than conventional fast exchange zzso
