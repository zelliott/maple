Using zzso zzso particle zzso the motion of a lobe pump under load was simulated in order to predict the level of zzso stress experienced by a protein zzso By varying the gap size between the zzso and pump housing, variations in pump efficiency and zzso stress were zzso The simulations indicated that pump zzso was dependent on gap size, with zzso stress levels zzso zzso zzso with those estimated in previous zzso zzso As gap size increased, the number of fluid particles experiencing low zzso zzso zzso increased, whereas those experiencing high zzso zzso zzso showed a decreasing zzso The pump efficiency, however, decreased with gap size, requiring more lobe revolutions to pass a unit zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that lobe pumps operated with increased gaps between the zzso and the housing result in larger number of particles within the fluid experiencing zzso zzso Moreover, the simulations indicate that it is best to use larger lobe pumps operated at high efficiency to transfer zzso zzso
