Over the past two decades, zzso ultrasound zzso image zzso has remained a challenge for researchers while the use of this imaging zzso is rapidly growing in zzso procedures and in research zzso zzso provides zzso zzso images of the zzso wall and the extent of zzso plaques with high spatial resolution in real zzso In this paper, we review recently developed image processing methods for the detection of zzso and zzso borders in zzso images acquired with different zzso operating at zzso ranging from 20 to 45 zzso We discuss zzso challenges, lack of diversity in reported zzso and weaknesses of zzso metrics that make zzso zzso still an open problem despite all zzso In conclusion, we call for a common reference database, validation zzso and zzso definition with which new and existing zzso could be zzso
