A zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequence is introduced to address the challenges of diffusion zzso of laser polarized zzso and zzso zzso zzso polarization enhances the zzso sensitivity of these noble gases by zzso but creates an zzso zzso polarization that is not readily zzso A new method is presented which permits parallel acquisition of the several zzso required to determine a zzso zzso zzso The zzso characterization of a zzso diffusion behavior can be accomplished in a single zzso using only a single polarization zzso As a demonstration, the diffusion zzso of a sample of zzso zzso gas is measured via this zzso
