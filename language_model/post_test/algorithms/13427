zzso zzso rejects zzso light from the object by scanning a pinhole through the image and reconstructing the image point by zzso Volume holographic imaging systems with zzso zzso have been proposed as an alternative to conventional zzso zzso that does not require scanning of a pinhole or a zzso However, due to zzso zzso of the zzso the high Bragg selectivity of the volume zzso is not zzso and system performance is not zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a means to remove the zzso and improve optical zzso in these zzso In prior work, two versions of this system were zzso the first version had a separate zzso and imaging grating and the second used a single grating to disperse the incident light and to separate zzso in the imaging zzso The initial illustration of the zzso system has limited depth resolution due to the low selectivity of the zzso zzso The initial illustration of the zzso system has high depth resolution but does not allow zzso of the zzso path and requires high optical quality of the holographic zzso In this paper we consider the design and tolerance requirements of the zzso system for high depth resolution and demonstrate the results with an experimental zzso An experimental system with two zzso zzso thick zzso zzso achieved a depth resolution of 7 zzso with a field of view of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso matching tolerance of zzso
