Visual processing is a complex task which is best investigated using sensitive zzso analysis methods that can capture zzso brain activity over both time and zzso In this study, we applied a zzso decoding zzso to zzso data of subjects engaged in passive viewing of images of faces, scenes, bodies and zzso We used reconstructed zzso time courses as input to the zzso in order to zzso brain regions involved in optimal image zzso zzso this method to the zzso of 115 to 315 zzso after stimulus zzso we show a focal zzso of zzso zzso in the inferior zzso middle zzso and zzso zzso that drive decoding of the different perceived image zzso zzso accuracy was highest (over zzso correctly classified trials, compared to a chance level accuracy of zzso when zzso the perception of faces from perception of other object zzso Furthermore, we applied this method to each single time point to extract the zzso evolution of visual zzso This allowed for the detection of differences in visual category perception as early as 85 zzso after stimulus zzso Furthermore, zzso the corresponding zzso zzso of each time point allowed us to capture the zzso dynamics of visual category zzso This revealed initial involvement of sources in the inferior zzso inferior zzso and superior zzso zzso During sustained stimulation additional sources in the anterior inferior zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso became zzso We conclude that decoding of zzso zzso data provides a suitable method to investigate the zzso dynamics of ongoing cognitive zzso
