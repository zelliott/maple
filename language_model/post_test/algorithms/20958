zzso zzso elements present unique opportunities for computing and information zzso in biological zzso They provide distinct zzso states that are zzso into the DNA sequence itself, allowing us to overcome limitations posed by other biological memory or logic gate zzso Further, it is in theory possible to create complex sequential zzso by careful positioning of zzso recognition sites in the zzso 

In this work, we describe the design and synthesis of an inversion switch using the zzso and zzso inversion zzso systems to create a zzso sequential memory zzso We have integrated the two inversion systems in an overlapping manner, creating a switch that can have multiple zzso The switch is capable of transitioning from state to state in a manner analogous to a finite state machine, while zzso the state information into zzso This switch does not require protein expression to maintain its state, and zzso its state even upon cell zzso We were able to demonstrate transition into three out of the five possible states showing the feasibility of such a zzso 

We demonstrate that a zzso memory system that encodes its state into DNA is possible, and that inversion zzso system could be a starting point for more complex memory zzso Although the circuit did not fully behave as expected, we showed that a zzso zzso memory is zzso
