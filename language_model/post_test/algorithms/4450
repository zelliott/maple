Few zzso regulatory networks have been described in zzso zzso In zzso zzso seminal aspects of zzso are zzso controlled, however, little is known about zzso regulatory networks that effect gene expression in this zzso We used expression data from two zzso experiments, zzso motif zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso regulatory patterns in zzso zzso Our zzso identified promoter motifs that accurately predicted the gene expression level of zzso of genes under zzso zzso We identified a promoter motif zzso associated with high gene zzso which is highly enriched in promoters of zzso protein genes and zzso zzso Additionally, we identified three promoter motifs zzso zzso and zzso associated with low gene zzso The promoters of a large gene family were highly enriched for these zzso and in these genes the presence of zzso motifs predicted low baseline gene expression and zzso zzso by heat zzso We demonstrate that zzso nuclear zzso bind specifically to four of the motifs identified zzso Our analysis suggests that zzso regulatory networks can be identified using limited expression zzso Thus, this approach is zzso to the multitude of systems for which zzso and zzso sequence data are zzso
