In the present study, activated carbon zzso simply derived from zzso zzso and characterized using different techniques such as zzso and BET zzso This new zzso was used for zzso blue zzso zzso Fitting the experimental equilibrium data to various zzso models shows the suitability and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso mechanism and rate of processes was investigated by analyzing time dependency data to conventional kinetic models and it was found that zzso follow the zzso kinetic zzso zzso component analysis zzso has been used for zzso of input data and genetic zzso zzso have been used for prediction of zzso of zzso blue using activated carbon derived from zzso zzso In our laboratory various activated carbon as sole zzso or loaded with various zzso was used for removal of many pollutants zzso et zzso zzso These results indicate that the small amount of proposed zzso zzso is zzso for successful removal of zzso zzso in short time zzso with high zzso capacity zzso
