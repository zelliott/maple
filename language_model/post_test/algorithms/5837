We present a novel enhancement to zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso from multiple precursor zzso are acquired into the same spectrum without employing a timed zzso gate to zzso each parent zzso zzso zzso are matched to their corresponding precursor zzso by comparing zzso acquired at slightly different zzso electric zzso By measuring the difference in zzso zzso between the two zzso for each fragment, it is possible to calculate the mass of the zzso zzso and its zzso This new zzso zzso technique reduces analysis time and zzso less sample than conventional zzso which requires an zzso gate for serial zzso of precursor zzso
