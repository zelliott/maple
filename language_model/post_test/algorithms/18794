Identification of zzso zzso interactions is important for drug design and the treatment of zzso zzso in detecting these interactions using zzso experimental techniques motivate the development of zzso prediction zzso We propose a novel zzso algorithm, zzso which generates accurate local zzso interface alignments and zzso various statistical scores and experimental binding data to predict interactions within zzso zzso zzso uses a profile of secondary structure and zzso accessibility predictions with zzso contact maps to guide and zzso zzso Using a decision tree zzso and zzso experimental data for training, it combines information zzso from statistical interaction zzso energy functions, correlated zzso and zzso zzso pairs to predict zzso We apply our method to zzso which play a central role in the development of many diseases including cancer and inflammatory and zzso zzso We tested our approach on two representative families from different structural classes zzso and zzso zzso of zzso In comparison with the state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso generates on average zzso more accurate alignments of interacting zzso Furthermore, in zzso tests, zzso correctly predicts zzso confirmed interactions for a common binding mode within the zzso zzso zzso family with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity with zzso gain in sensitivity compared to zzso For the zzso family our method achieves zzso sensitivity with zzso specificity with zzso gain in zzso zzso combines information from multiple complex templates when such data are zzso When only one solved structure is available, a localized zzso approach also zzso standard zzso methods with zzso improvements in zzso
