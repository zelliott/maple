To assess the zzso of zzso channel block with local zzso by the change of external zzso concentration zzso we examined the block by zzso at different zzso using the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the degree of zzso block of the zzso zzso zzso The external zzso dependence of the zzso current block was caused by the interaction of zzso with the activated zzso channel, but not with the zzso zzso In zzso channel current recordings at a reduced zzso of 70 zzso zzso shortened the mean open time of the channels zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the drug, P zzso zzso without changes in the zzso current zzso whereas the drug did not affect mean open time at a zzso of 140 zzso Moreover, the open time zzso during drug exposure at the reduced zzso were better fitted to a double exponential than to a single exponential in four out of six zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso two zzso zzso the native open state and a state representing the first step of open channel zzso The transition from the former to the latter is dependent on zzso suggesting an zzso interaction of external zzso with zzso
