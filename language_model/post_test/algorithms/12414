A major problem for current peak detection zzso is that noise in mass zzso zzso zzso gives rise to a high rate of false zzso The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting zzso with low zzso Usually, various baseline correction zzso and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak zzso This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline zzso which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, zzso and analysis zzso 

Most peak detection zzso simply identify zzso based on zzso ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the zzso in a zzso In our experience, zzso zzso have characteristic shapes, and providing a zzso function that provides a zzso of zzso zzso should provide a more robust peak identification zzso Based on these zzso a continuous zzso transform zzso peak detection zzso has been devised that identifies zzso with different scales and zzso By transforming the spectrum into zzso space, the zzso problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored zzso This zzso with the additional information provided by the zzso zzso zzso can greatly enhance the effective zzso zzso Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing zzso steps are required before peak zzso and this improves the zzso of peak detection under a variety of zzso The zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso with known zzso zzso Comparisons with two other popular zzso were zzso The results show the zzso zzso can identify both strong and weak zzso while keeping false positive rate zzso 

The zzso is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the zzso zzso
