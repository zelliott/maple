The branching patterns of zzso trees often disagree even when they have been constructed using different portions of the same zzso This zzso discord zzso can be explained by real differences in evolutionary process or history, but also may be due simply to random chance or sampling zzso zzso for measuring and testing the significance of zzso zzso are used widely in systematic biology, and are necessary when considering zzso zzso composed of multiple genes that may or may not have different zzso They are also zzso wherever tree zzso are used for ordering and interpreting data zzso DNA zzso Here, I review the different zzso tests and use them to test the zzso discord of a potentially mobile genetic element (the widespread colonization zzso in the zzso I then consider how zzso tests may be used as a starting point for zzso analysis that accounts for horizontal transfer and zzso events as explanations for zzso
