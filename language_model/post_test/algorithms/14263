We describe a zzso image reconstruction zzso that is based on the zzso solution to the zzso wave equation in the frequency zzso Our reconstruction approach is an zzso Newton method coupled with combined zzso and zzso zzso that can extract the spatial distribution of zzso property in zzso zzso We demonstrate this zzso by using phantom and chicken bone zzso from a circular scanning zzso zzso zzso The results obtained show that zzso phantom objects and chicken bones and/or zzso can be clearly detected using our zzso zzso zzso zzso
