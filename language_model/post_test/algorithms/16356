Gulf War Illness zzso is a complex disorder affecting nervous, zzso and immune zzso zzso we propose that zzso presents with a distinct pattern of immune zzso To explore this we compared interaction patterns linking immune markers and their evolution during zzso Blood was collected from 9 zzso and 11 control subjects prior to a zzso zzso Test zzso zzso at peak effort zzso and 4 h zzso zzso zzso cortisol and zzso serum or culture zzso were analyzed for zzso of zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso cell populations were surface stained for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mutual information zzso networks linking these immune markers were generated in each group at each time zzso zzso theory was used to describe the evolution of each network's structure and identify potential zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso networks had more abundant connections but were less zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were better integrated in the zzso network at zzso Under effort zzso these differences were replaced by significant restructuring around zzso for zzso B cell population, zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso This pattern subsided zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso and zzso zzso strongly influenced this characteristic zzso of B and T cell network zzso This potentially heightened zzso and zzso axis responsiveness to zzso stimulation in the context of a mixed zzso immune signature supports an zzso component in zzso zzso
