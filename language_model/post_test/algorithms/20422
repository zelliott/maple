The theoretical explanation of the limits of an array zzso to zzso large zzso zzso 

A theoretical model is used to illustrate the focal limitations of a zzso zzso array designed for the treatment of deep seated zzso zzso zzso The design zzso the acoustic dose as a function of the focal depth and available acoustic zzso with the goal of zzso large volumes in a single zzso zzso A quantitative measure of the possible region of focal necrosis is modeled as a function of array parameters with the limiting criteria being near field heating and patient zzso 

zzso simulations show that the maximum distance to produce continuous necrosis between zzso in a multiple focus pattern and in a temporally zzso pattern is approximately 50% larger than the distance needed between sequential zzso 

Multiple focus patterns or rapidly scanned single zzso are significantly advantageous to sequential zzso of a single focus zzso
