zzso zzso parameters for zzso were estimated in a three-month infant following an accidental overdose of intravenous zzso Fitting of zzso data was performed using zzso zzso with zzso A mixed order elimination model was superior to a first order zzso zzso estimates were standardized to a 70 zzso human using an zzso power zzso zzso estimates zzso were: maximum rate of metabolism zzso 71 zzso zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso volume of distribution zzso zzso zzso This zzso constant is lower than that reported for adults and consequently zzso elimination will occur at lower plasma zzso in infants than in zzso zzso clearance has traditionally been reported as directly zzso to body zzso This per zzso model gives an erroneous impression that clearance is greatest in early childhood and then decreases with age until adult rates are reached in late zzso zzso clearance values reported in the literature were reviewed using an zzso 3/4 power zzso This size model demonstrates that clearance increases in infancy and reaches adult rates in the first one to two years of zzso
