zzso sequences obtained through zzso sequencing are not zzso distributed across the zzso For example, sequencing data of total zzso DNA show zzso yet unexpected zzso on promoters and zzso This systematic bias is a particular problem for techniques such as zzso zzso where the signal for a target factor is plotted across zzso zzso We have focused on data obtained from zzso Genome zzso platform, where at least three factors contribute to sequence zzso zzso content, zzso of sequencing reads, and regional biases that might be generated by local zzso We show that relying on input control as a zzso is not generally appropriate due to sample to sample variation in zzso To correct sequence bias, we present zzso zzso elimination zzso for deep zzso a simple three-step zzso scheme that successfully zzso real binding patterns in zzso zzso We suggest that this procedure be done routinely prior to data interpretation and downstream zzso
