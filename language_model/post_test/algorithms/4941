In this paper, we propose a novel face zzso synthesis and recognition method using a zzso zzso Random Fields zzso zzso Our system has three zzso 1) given a face zzso zzso a sketch zzso 2) given a face sketch drawing, zzso a zzso and 3) searching for face photos in the database based on a query sketch drawn by an zzso It has useful applications for both digital entertainment and law zzso We assume that faces to be studied are in a frontal pose, with normal lighting and neutral zzso and have no zzso To zzso zzso images, the face region is divided into overlapping patches for zzso The size of the patches decides the scale of local face structures to be zzso From a training set which contains zzso pairs, the joint zzso model is learned at multiple scales using a zzso zzso zzso By transforming a face photo to a sketch (or transforming a sketch to a zzso the difference between photos and sketches is significantly reduced, thus allowing effective matching between the two in face sketch zzso After the zzso zzso in principle, most of the proposed face photo recognition approaches can be applied to face sketch recognition in a straightforward zzso zzso experiments are conducted on a face sketch database including 606 faces, which can be downloaded from our Web site zzso
