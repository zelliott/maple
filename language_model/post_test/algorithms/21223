Different zzso properties require individual targets in zzso zzso These requirements are mostly scheduled on the basis of zzso diagnosis, but, however, performed using zzso appliances, which refer to zzso angles and not to zzso zzso The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between zzso zzso angles, zzso zzso and skeletal zzso findings in zzso ideal zzso subjects with natural zzso compensation of skeletal variation, in order to link the field of zzso assessment of zzso inclination with that of contemporary zzso zzso inclination zzso This study zzso lateral zzso and corresponding dental casts of 69 zzso Caucasians (21 males and 48 females between 12 and 35 years of zzso with neutral zzso Class I) zzso and canine relationships and an zzso relationship that was zzso and vertically considered as ideal by three zzso zzso well supported by the zzso teeth and without the need for either deep or open bite zzso Upper zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso inclinations were assessed with reference to the zzso lines zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and vertical skeletal relationships were classified using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso angles zzso and zzso were derived from direct dental cast zzso using an zzso zzso zzso The relationships between zzso and zzso zzso evaluated by calculating zzso zzso correlation zzso (a zzso zzso showed strong correlations between zzso zzso inclination data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso data, but no significant relationship between zzso findings and zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used for zzso inclination zzso angle designated as the independent zzso and for zzso data zzso zzso zzso and zzso designated as independent zzso Based on the correlations found in this study, a novel method for defining targets in upper and lower zzso zzso correction according to natural standards is zzso As a consequence, zzso movements can be adapted to zzso diagnosis with enhanced zzso
