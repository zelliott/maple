In individually zzso zzso designs, each biological sample is zzso on two different zzso once with zzso and once with zzso While this strategy ensures an automatic correction of the zzso zzso bias, it also zzso zzso between zzso zzso that must be taken into account in the statistical zzso 

We present two original statistical procedures for the statistical analysis of individually balanced zzso These procedures are compared with the usual zzso and zzso mixed model procedures proposed in most statistical zzso on both simulated and real zzso 

The UP procedure we propose as an alternative to usual mixed model procedures is more efficient and significantly faster to zzso This result provides some useful guidelines for the analysis of complex zzso
