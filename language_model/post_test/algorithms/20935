zzso modeling of bacterial zzso systems has been influential and zzso in helping to understand experimental zzso We provide here a comprehensive overview of the range of mathematical approaches used for zzso within a single zzso zzso processes caused by changes to external zzso in its zzso zzso areas of the bacterial system which have been studied and modeled are discussed in detail, including the modeling of adaptation in response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and spatial modeling of zzso protein signal zzso The importance of producing robust models that address adaptation, gain, and sensitivity are also zzso This review highlights that while mathematical modeling has aided in understanding bacterial zzso on the individual cell scale and guiding experimental design, no single model succeeds in robustly describing all of the basic elements of the zzso We conclude by discussing the importance of this and the future of modeling in this zzso
