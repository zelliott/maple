In zzso various factors may act as variables influencing the result of zzso Among them, zzso DNA, which has been used as a repetitive zzso agent, may become an zzso factor in zzso zzso To identify the effect of zzso DNA on zzso experiments, zzso DNA was labeled directly and zzso experiments were zzso The results confirmed that zzso which zzso more completely with zzso DNA had a higher sequence similarity to the zzso zzso Further, in the zzso zzso experiments, the variation and intensity in the fluorescent signal were reduced in the high intensity probe group in which zzso were better zzso with zzso zzso Otherwise, those of the low intensity probe group showed no zzso regardless of zzso zzso These results confirmed by in zzso methods that zzso DNA could block repetitive sequences in zzso and zzso In addition, it was confirmed biologically that the blocking effect of zzso DNA could be presented via its repetitive zzso especially zzso zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso zzso the use of zzso DNA is advantageous in controlling experimental variation in zzso
