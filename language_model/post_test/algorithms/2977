VS is a simple system consisting of several techniques for various zzso zzso Based on the marching cubes algorithm, it operates with one space sweep through the zzso and extracts all zzso information: detection of all zzso zzso the data into connected components on the basis of surface zzso and association of surfaces with any internal surfaces to arbitrary levels of zzso VS extends Baker's zzso zzso method by zzso zzso cavities with their outer surface, and by using efficient data structures for the zzso zzso and for the connected component zzso Its zzso on average, is only about zzso more than the zzso marching cubes zzso VS operates on the original zzso without using the zzso tree required by other zzso Using zzso zzso VS zzso a data structure which can be zzso for any zzso or zzso of zzso An accurate estimate of each zzso volume is based on the volume enclosed by the outer surface, minus the volume of any internal zzso VS enables noise reduction by eliminating components (and zzso with a small zzso Different components can be rendered with different visual zzso and cutaway views by arbitrary zzso are displayed as if the objects were solid, without adding any new surface patches to match the zzso
