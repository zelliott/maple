We present a zzso approach to analyze the cellular organization during the zzso process of the zzso zzso First, we selected a set of mathematical zzso to zzso cell geometry and cell neighborhood within the external zzso layer of the zzso the zzso Second, we established a hybrid image zzso zzso and analyzed the extracted features with statistical tools to describe and compare the zzso dynamics of cellular organization within this zzso The main results indicated that the average geometry and neighborhood of the zzso cells are relatively stable from a sampling position to another and from a stage of development to zzso Further, their zzso axes are randomly zzso The cellular organization fits the zzso zzso Moreover, no zzso structures or zzso regular point patterns are found inside the studied cell zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso observed in zzso is not due to the geometrical change of cell shape but might be the consequence of cell addition associated with peculiar plans of cell division or zzso
