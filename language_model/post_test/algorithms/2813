The zzso zzso is valid only when elementary zzso beams are small enough compared to the lateral zzso of a zzso which is not always true in actual zzso with zzso and zzso This work addresses a solution for the zzso We found approximate zzso of zzso zzso with which zzso beams can split into zzso and deflecting daughter beams when their sizes have zzso lateral zzso in the zzso zzso The effectiveness was assessed in a zzso beam experiment in the presence of steep range compensation, where the splitting calculation reproduced a zzso effect amounting to about zzso in dose or as large as the lateral particle zzso zzso The efficiency was analyzed in calculations for zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso phantom model, where the beam splitting increased computing times by factors of zzso and zzso The present method generally improves the accuracy of the zzso zzso without severe zzso It will therefore be useful for treatment planning and potentially other demanding zzso
