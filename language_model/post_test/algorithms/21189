Data collection and its analysis in the field of nuclear safety is an important task in the sense that it powers the improvement of safety as well as reliability of the zzso Thus, occupational exposure data analysis is presented to measure the safety or reliability of radiation protection of a given zzso It also is required as a basic input in making decisions on radiation protection regulations and zzso A common practice in radiation protection is to record a zero for observation below minimum detection limit zzso doses, which leads to an zzso of true doses and zzso of the zzso zzso Exposure data (both external and zzso are collected by monitoring each individual and this kind of monitoring generally is graded as low-level zzso So, in such low-level monitoring, the occurrence of exposure below zzso invites statistical complications for zzso mean and zzso because the data are generally censored, zzso observations below zzso are zzso In Type I zzso the point of zzso zzso the detection zzso is zzso a zzso for all observations and the number of the censored observations zzso In Type II zzso the number of censored observations is fixed a zzso and the point of zzso zzso The methodology generally followed in zzso mean and zzso with these censored data was the replacement of missing dose by half the zzso In this paper, authors have used the maximum likelihood zzso zzso approach for the zzso of mean and standard zzso A computer code zzso has been developed in which all these zzso advanced zzso are zzso In addition to the zzso method, an expectation zzso zzso has also been zzso The code is written using Visual zzso zzso The paper describes the details of the zzso adopted for handling such censored data to estimate bias free mean and standard zzso
