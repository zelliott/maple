Medical imaging technologies have allowed for in zzso exploration and evaluation of the human musculoskeletal zzso zzso bone models generated using zzso techniques provide a means to zzso individualized orthopedic surgical procedures using engineering zzso However, many of the current zzso techniques are not clinically practical due to the required time and human zzso As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the use of an expectation zzso zzso zzso to segment the hand phalanx bones, and zzso that this zzso technique will improve the efficiency while providing similar definitions as compared to a manual zzso Our results show a relative overlap of the zzso middle, and zzso phalanx bones of zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso technique when compared to validated manual zzso The zzso zzso were also compared to zzso surface scans of the zzso zzso which resulted in distance maps showing an average distance for the zzso middle, and zzso phalanx bones of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso improved on the zzso speed of the manual techniques by a factor of zzso Overall, the manual zzso had greater relative overlap metric values, which suggests that the manual zzso are a better fit to the actual surface of the zzso As shown by the comparison to the bone surface scans, the zzso technique provides a similar representation of the zzso structure and offers an increase in efficiency that could help to reduce the time needed for defining anatomical structures from CT zzso
