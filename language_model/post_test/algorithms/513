Animal cooperation has puzzled biologists for a long time as its existence seems to contravene the basic notion of evolutionary biology that natural selection zzso zzso genes that promote only their own zzso zzso game theory has shown that zzso can prosper in populations of selfish individuals if they occur in zzso interacting more frequently with each other than with the zzso Here we show that social networks of primates possess the necessary social structure to promote the emergence of zzso By simulating evolutionary dynamics of cooperative zzso on interaction networks of 70 zzso groups, we found that for most groups network zzso zzso the fixation probability for zzso The variation in the strength of this effect can be partly explained by the groups' community zzso network measure for the groups' zzso Thus, given selective update and partner choice mechanisms, network zzso has the potential to explain socially learned forms of cooperation in zzso zzso
