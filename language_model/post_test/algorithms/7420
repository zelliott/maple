zzso protein complexes is crucial to understanding principles of cellular organization and functional zzso As many zzso have indicated that the zzso with high density or with high zzso in zzso network usually zzso to protein complexes, protein complexes detection methods based on zzso network focused on zzso density or its zzso in zzso zzso However, dense zzso may have low zzso and zzso with high zzso may have low density, which results that protein complexes may be zzso with low zzso or with low density in the zzso zzso As the zzso methods are difficult to mine protein complexes with low density, and the zzso methods are difficult to mine protein complexes with low zzso both two methods have limitation for identifying protein complexes with various density and zzso 

To identify protein complexes with various density and zzso including those have low density but high zzso and those have low zzso but high density, we define a novel zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and propose a novel algorithm, named zzso to identify protein complexes by expanding seed edges to zzso with the local maximum fitness zzso Experimental results of zzso in zzso show that compared with the results of fitness equal to density zzso zzso 1) or equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso identifies known protein complexes more effectively when the fitness value is decided by both density and zzso zzso Compared with the results of seven competing protein complex detection methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso other seven methods in terms of matching with known complexes and functional zzso Moreover, zzso has better performance in identifying protein complexes with low density or with low zzso 

By considering both the density and the zzso zzso zzso other protein complexes detection methods that only consider density or zzso especially in identifying known protein complexes with low density or low zzso
