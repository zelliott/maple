Stroke is the third major cause of death worldwide behind heart disease and zzso zzso zzso is the most frequent cause of zzso zzso Early diagnosis of carotid plaque and serial monitoring of its size with the help of imaging zzso can help to prevent the zzso zzso The main difficulty is inevitable zzso of patient's head positions during image zzso The time series registration of carotid images helps to improve the monitoring, zzso and zzso of the disease by suppressing the global movements of the zzso In this work, a novel hybrid registration technique has been proposed and evaluated for registration of carotid ultrasound images taken at different zzso The proposed hybrid method bridges the gap between the zzso and zzso registration zzso The zzso zzso closest point zzso is used to provide a coarse registration which is subsequently refined by the zzso zzso The proposed framework uses rigid transformation model coupled with mutual information zzso similarity measure and Powell zzso For quantitative zzso different registration approaches have been compared using four error zzso visual information zzso structural similarity index, correlation zzso and zzso zzso evaluation has also been done using the visual examination of the registered image zzso
