zzso zzso arising from multiple cell types, is a major zzso factor in experiments that focus on studying cell types, zzso their expression profiles, in zzso Although sample zzso can be addressed by manual zzso prior to conducting experiments, zzso treatment on zzso zzso have become a reliable alternative to perform this zzso in zzso zzso zzso over manual zzso has its advantages, such as time consumption, measuring responses of multiple cell types zzso keeping samples intact of external zzso and zzso yield of molecular zzso 

We formalize a zzso model, zzso and show with simulations as well as with real zzso data that zzso attains increased modeling accuracy in terms of zzso zzso zzso proportions of zzso tissue samples, zzso zzso replication zzso and zzso identifying differential expression across cell types under various experimental zzso As our reference we use the corresponding linear zzso model, which mirrors the performance of the majority of current zzso modeling zzso zzso AND zzso All codes are written in zzso and are freely available upon request as well as at the project web page zzso Furthermore, a zzso for zzso exists at zzso
