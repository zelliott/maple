zzso are widely sought to detect and identify sea zzso This issue is characterized by complicated mine shapes and underwater light propagation zzso In a preliminary study we use a zzso step for zzso underwater images before applying the zzso for mine zzso Once a mine is zzso the protocol for identifying it is zzso Among many correlation zzso we have focused our attention on the zzso segmented zzso filter for zzso the recognition rate because it allows us to significantly increase the number of reference images in the fabrication of this zzso Yet they are not entirely satisfactory in terms of recognition rate and the obtained images revealed to be of low zzso In this report, we propose a way to improve upon this preliminary study by using a single wavelength zzso camera in order to zzso the zzso This permits us to enhance images and improve depth zzso We present illustrative results using in zzso polarization imaging of a target through a zzso mixture and demonstrate that our challenging objective of increasing the detection rate and decreasing the false alarm rate has been zzso
