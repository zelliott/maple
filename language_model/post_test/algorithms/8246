The electric fish zzso zzso zzso a zzso electric organ discharge zzso sensed by specialized zzso zzso distributed across the zzso zzso zzso such as prey increase the zzso of the zzso over the underlying skin and thus cause an increase in zzso zzso The resulting localized intensity increase is called the electric image and is detected by its effect on the zzso population; the electric image peak value and the extent to its spreads are cues zzso by these fish to estimate the location and size of its zzso zzso project zzso to three zzso maps in the zzso lateral line lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso In a companion paper I have calculated the receptive fields zzso in these zzso zzso were small in zzso and very large in zzso with intermediate values in zzso Here I use zzso data to create a simple model of the zzso structure within the three zzso maps and to zzso the response of these model maps to simulated zzso The Fisher information zzso method was used to zzso the optimal estimates possible for prey zzso across the three zzso The zzso predictions were compared with behavioral studies on prey zzso These comparisons were used to frame alternative hypotheses on the functions of the three maps and on the constraints that zzso size and synaptic strength impose on weak signal detection and zzso
