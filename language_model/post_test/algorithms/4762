Recently, we have presented and zzso validated a unique zzso solver of the coupled zzso transfer equations zzso for rapidly computing zzso zzso and fluorescent light propagation in small animal zzso zzso we present a zzso zzso Carlo zzso to validate the forward zzso solver and investigate the impact of physical parameters upon zzso zzso in order to best direct the development of the zzso solver for optical zzso zzso the zzso Carlo simulations for both zzso and zzso zzso are validated using frequency domain zzso migration zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso solutions containing 1 zzso zzso green in a 49 zzso zzso phantom corresponding to the small volume employed in small animal zzso The comparisons between zzso Carlo simulations and the zzso solutions result in mean percent error in zzso and the phase shift less than zzso and zzso degrees, respectively, at zzso and zzso zzso for varying zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Carlo simulations indicate that the accuracy of the forward model is enhanced using zzso suitable source models of zzso delivery, zzso accurate zzso factors, and zzso accurate acceptance angles of collected zzso zzso Carlo simulations also show that the accuracy of the diffusion approximation in the small phantom depends upon zzso the ratio zzso where zzso is the phantom diameter and zzso is the transport mean free zzso and zzso the zzso factor of the zzso The zzso Carlo simulations zzso and guides the future development of an appropriate zzso solver for deployment in small animal optical zzso
