While medical researchers formulate new hypotheses to test, they need to identify connections to their work from other parts of the medical zzso However, the current volume of information has become a great barrier for this zzso Recently, many zzso discovery zzso systems have been developed to help researchers identify new knowledge that bridges gaps across distinct sections of the medical zzso Each zzso system uses different methods for mining the connections from text and ranking the identified connections, but none of the currently available zzso evaluation approaches can be used to compare the effectiveness of these zzso In this paper, we present an evaluation methodology for zzso systems that allows comparisons across different zzso We demonstrate the abilities of our evaluation methodology by using it to compare the performance of different zzso and ranking approaches used by existing zzso zzso This evaluation methodology should help other researchers compare approaches, make informed zzso choices, and ultimately help to improve the performance of zzso systems zzso
