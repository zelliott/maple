In patients presenting with cerebral zzso injury, the outcome of injured brain tissue zzso as decreased apparent diffusion zzso zzso may depend on associated zzso in cerebral blood zzso zzso This study proposes a zzso method to zzso associations between zzso and zzso in newborns with global or focal cerebral zzso The study population consisted of nine zzso zzso 0 to 3 zzso presenting with clinical and imaging evidence of zzso zzso with global hypoxic zzso and two with focal zzso zzso zzso with decreased zzso Six newborns without diffusion abnormalities on magnetic resonance zzso imaging served as a comparative cohort zzso 0 days to 4 zzso All patients underwent MR imaging including diffusion weighted imaging zzso to determine zzso and zzso zzso spin labeling zzso to determine zzso An zzso was developed that uses the zzso volume from the zzso raw data as a reference, zzso the zzso and zzso data to the zzso generates mask zzso and finally performs a statistical analysis to automatically select regions of interest zzso with zzso or zzso values that zzso significantly from the rest of the zzso If zzso are identified in this analysis, the zzso then evaluates correlation based on zzso location and zzso A significant correlation was found between decreased zzso and elevated zzso with regions of elevated zzso typically larger than the corresponding zzso zzso The association between decreased zzso and increased zzso suggests that, for this zzso cerebral zzso is associated with zzso
