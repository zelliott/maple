The acoustic zzso technique for zzso detection of zzso boundaries currently provides continuous left zzso area or volume signals and zzso ejection zzso However, the distortion of individual zzso by noise results in a wide zzso zzso in these zzso We developed an automated zzso for the evaluation of left zzso function by averaging acoustic zzso zzso zzso and zzso area, stroke area, and fractional area change are measured directly from the average zzso Peak ejection and peak filling rates and time to peak filling rate are obtained from its time zzso Area signals obtained from eight normal subjects were used to evaluate the performance of this zzso zzso of left zzso function obtained with the automated zzso were highly consistent and in excellent agreement with those obtained by repeated manual zzso zzso This zzso provides a fast and easy method for noise reduction in acoustic zzso signals, which significantly improves the zzso assessment of left zzso zzso
