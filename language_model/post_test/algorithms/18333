The zzso zzso in zzso rats was used to test the in zzso effectiveness of zzso zzso and its analog zzso zzso as zzso zzso after their zzso administration at low zzso The results indicate that both compounds administered repeatedly at nontoxic zzso zzso zzso body zzso in combination with moderate fractional doses of zzso zzso zzso enhance the radiation effect on zzso The local control of tumors on the zzso day in all experimental groups has been higher than in the control zzso In the case of zzso administered in the zzso dose, the zzso in local control is statistically significant zzso less than zzso The regrowth delay has also been longer after treatment with zzso In the course of treatment we did not observe any symptoms of zzso of the zzso The mean body weight of rats during the administration of compounds remained on the level of control rats whose tumors were zzso zzso
