zzso of functional outcome immediately after stroke onset can guide optimal zzso Most zzso grading scales to date, however, have been based on established global metrics such as total zzso score, admission zzso volume, or zzso zzso on zzso Our purpose was to construct a more focused, zzso zzso model for the prediction of early zzso improvement, based not only on traditional clinical and imaging zzso but also on zzso zzso correlation specific to the clinical deficit, using CT zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with zzso due to first-time zzso stroke of the left zzso were zzso Language function was assessed on the basis of the patients admission and discharge zzso scores and clinical zzso All patients had brain zzso and zzso within 9 hours of symptom zzso For image analysis, all zzso were automatically zzso to zzso brain space and zzso into mirrored cortical and zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis was used to find independent imaging and clinical zzso of language zzso 

By the time of zzso 21 zzso patients demonstrated improvement of zzso Independent factors predicting improvement in language included zzso of the angular zzso zzso zzso zzso and the lower third of the insular zzso zzso cerebral artery zzso on admission zzso and zzso score on the admission zzso zzso Using these 4 zzso we developed a zzso zzso zzso model that could estimate the probability of early improvement in zzso and predict functional outcome with zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso model was developed to predict early language improvement of patients with zzso by using admission data collected within 9 hours of stroke zzso This pilot model should be validated in a larger, prospective study; however, the zzso zzso analysis of brain zzso along with the statistical approach, could be generalized for prediction of other outcome measures in patients with zzso
