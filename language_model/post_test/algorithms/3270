We report a novel coherent zzso phenomenon in a zzso network of coupled zzso zzso It is demonstrated that zzso zzso in the network can play a constructive role to bring on coherent zzso The zzso factor as the function of zzso time zzso represents a zzso phenomenon which is a fingerprint of zzso zzso We call this resonant behavior caused by zzso wiring changes the zzso zzso zzso The mechanism can be understood by the effective noise played by the zzso zzso
