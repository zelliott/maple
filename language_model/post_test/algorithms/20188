In this paper, we investigate monitoring of zzso changes evoked by fatigue in running using zzso zzso Movement data were recorded with zzso zzso zzso is the zzso Orientation zzso a customized zzso measurement unit for zzso monitoring of human zzso We perform two real-world experiments, in which 21 runners of different skill levels zzso The real-world experiments capture two exhausting zzso zzso one on a treadmill and one on a conventional outdoor zzso We describe and evaluate zzso to extract zzso parameters from the sensor zzso We identified parameters that change with fatigue for all zzso ones that change for runners of distinct skill levels, and ones that are dependent on an zzso running zzso Overall, we found that observations from treadmill running are not always zzso to outdoor zzso zzso thus, argue for using zzso technology to provide athletes and trainers with zzso quantitative objective zzso of running zzso These could be used to further gain insight into the complex relationship of running zzso injury risk, fatigue, and running zzso
