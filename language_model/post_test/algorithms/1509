zzso zzso is no longer thought to reflect orifice area in zzso zzso valves, but no satisfactory alternative method has been zzso zzso orifice area by the continuity equation is theoretically zzso However, we have shown no correlation against zzso area in a clinical study of 40 zzso mechanical zzso zzso resistance is useful in native zzso zzso but virtually no work exists for replacement zzso We have shown no correlation against zzso area in the same 40 mechanical zzso The zzso zzso surface area method based on the continuity equation can only be applied using the zzso zzso it is therefore not zzso Imaging and zzso flow provide good qualitative or zzso information, and together with continuous wave zzso allow detection of obstruction for clinical zzso An adequate quantitative method for research use has not yet been zzso
