zzso zzso three-dimensional reconstructions of human brain gray and white matter structures can be characterized to zzso aspects of their shape, volume and zzso zzso In particular, methods based on zzso analysis have been applied in zzso studies to zzso the structural complexity of the brain in both healthy and impaired zzso The usefulness of such measures for characterizing individual differences in brain structure critically depends on their zzso zzso in order to allow the robust detection of zzso zzso This study analyzes key zzso parameters of three zzso methods that rely on the zzso zzso with the aim to maximize zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of different brain objects, including the zzso surface, the cortical ribbon volume, the white matter volume and the gray zzso matter zzso Two separate zzso originating from different imaging centers were zzso zzso 50 subjects with three and 24 subjects with four successive scanning sessions per subject, zzso The zzso of zzso measures was statistically assessed by computing their zzso zzso zzso reveal differences between different zzso zzso and allow the identification of several parameters that are critical for high zzso zzso zzso with zzso correlations in the range of zzso is achieved with the correlation zzso Further analyses of the zzso dimensions of zzso cortical and zzso gray matter regions suggest robustly estimated and zzso patterns of individual zzso These results are valuable for defining appropriate zzso zzso when studying changes in zzso zzso of human brain structure, for instance in studies of neurological diseases that do not allow repeated zzso or for zzso zzso zzso
