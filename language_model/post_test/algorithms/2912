Face recognition applications commonly suffer from three main zzso a reduced training set, information lying in zzso zzso and the need to incorporate new people to zzso In the recent literature, the extension of a face zzso in order to include new people in the model has been solved using online feature extraction zzso The most successful approaches of those are the extensions of the principal component analysis or the linear zzso zzso In the current paper, a new online boosting zzso is zzso a face recognition method that extends a zzso zzso by adding new classes while avoiding the need of retraining the zzso each time a new person joins the zzso The zzso is learned using the zzso learning principle where multiple zzso tasks are trained together sharing the same feature zzso The new classes are added taking advantage of the structure learned zzso being the addition of new classes not zzso zzso The present proposal has been zzso validated with two different facial data sets by comparing our approach with the current state-of-the-art zzso The results show that the proposed online boosting zzso fares better in terms of final zzso In addition, the global performance does not decrease drastically even when the number of classes of the base problem is multiplied by zzso
