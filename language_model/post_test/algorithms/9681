The zzso of artificial ventilation schemes is necessary when zzso zzso One approach involves the application of high frequency zzso ventilation zzso to the respiratory zzso zzso zzso in the upper zzso tree can be characterized by Reynolds numbers as high as zzso zzso the flow presents turbulent zzso In this study, transitional and turbulent flow within an zzso zzso model of the upper airway during zzso are studied using large zzso simulation zzso zzso The flow, characterized by a peak Reynolds number of zzso is zzso using a validated LES model of a three-dimensional branching zzso The pressures, zzso and zzso within the flow are presented and compared with prior models for branching flow zzso The results demonstrate how zzso occurs at zzso branches within the respiratory zzso These results may be useful in zzso treatments using zzso zzso
