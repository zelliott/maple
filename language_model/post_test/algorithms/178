Active response of a zzso is characterized by its resonance behavior where the zzso might zzso after the zzso zzso has been turned zzso We investigate in this paper an zzso approach based on this resonance phenomenon using zzso The technique, called zzso zzso consists in zzso a first zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of increasing frequency with time, and a second zzso zzso the zzso zzso that is a replica of the first zzso but time reversed with a sweep of decreasing frequency with zzso zzso using a modified zzso equation were carried out to determine bubble response to zzso zzso In addition, optical observations and zzso zzso were carried out to corroborate the theoretical zzso zzso of simulations show differences between zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso mainly for transmitted center zzso above the zzso resonance zzso Bubbles that are at resonance or far away from resonance zzso identical zzso From the optical data, the larger bubbles showed different dynamics when zzso or zzso zzso were zzso Smaller bubbles zzso 2 zzso zzso appear to be less sensitive to frequency sweep at zzso zzso center zzso However, driven at a higher center frequency, smaller bubbles tend to be more zzso These results were confirmed through the zzso zzso We concluded that simulations and experimental data show that significant differences might be observed between zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate in this study that, for an optimal use of zzso zzso the transmit frequency should be higher than the resonance frequency of the contrast zzso
