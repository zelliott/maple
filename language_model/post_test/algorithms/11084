To propose a novel zzso predicting zzso bleeding on the basis of generalized equivalent uniform doses zzso after zzso prostate zzso combined with external beam radiation therapy and to assess the zzso value of this zzso 

To account for differences among radiation treatment zzso and zzso schedules, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing combined therapy retrieved from corresponding treatment planning systems were converted to equivalent zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso were calculated from these converted zzso The total zzso zzso was determined by a zzso of the zzso and zzso radiation therapy zzso 

zzso patients zzso developed grade zzso zzso zzso The grade zzso zzso bleeding rate increased as the zzso zzso zzso (2 of 102 zzso for zzso zzso zzso (15 of 145 zzso for zzso zzso zzso (12 of 76 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso (9 of 46 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified age zzso and zzso zzso as risk factors for grade zzso zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate zzso to be a potential zzso factor for grade zzso late zzso bleeding after combined therapy for prostate zzso
