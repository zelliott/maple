zzso tracking zzso is often the zzso step in zzso imaging studies of zzso zzso Here we present a tracking zzso that addresses the principal challenges of zzso namely high particle density, particle motion zzso temporary particle zzso and particle merging and zzso The zzso first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete zzso Both steps are formulated as global zzso zzso problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle zzso throughout a zzso Using this approach, we show that the zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso of long- and short-lived zzso structures and that the motion of zzso receptors along zzso linear tracks increases their zzso zzso Both applications indicate the requirement for robust and complete tracking of dense particle fields to dissect the mechanisms of zzso organization at the level of the plasma zzso
