zzso fractures among the elderly are a worldwide zzso The objective of this study was zzso to confirm whether or not differences in bone strength are reflected in the zzso zzso finite element zzso model constructed from CT images of healthy subjects and osteoporosis patients, and zzso to investigate the effect of loading angle direction on bone zzso The results from comparison of bone strength between the fracture group, fragile group zzso patients with no fracture after zzso and healthy group showed that differences in bone strength were definitely reflected in this zzso zzso Furthermore, the relationship between the loading direction and fracture load value was significant in all groups in the zzso general linear model, and the model made from the zzso fracture patients was more sensitive to loading direction than those from cervical neck zzso No significant differences were observed in the zzso comparison of zzso Neck zzso zzso zzso and total zzso in these two zzso The difference in the zzso zzso showed a trend of low bone density in the zzso fracture zzso There is thus a possibility that the bone density at this location is implicated in the fragility under certain loading zzso
