To determine zzso zzso zzso prevalence using zzso administrative data, and to estimate the error associated with case zzso approaches when using these zzso 

Cases were zzso using physician billing and hospitalization data from the province of Manitoba zzso zzso zzso Focusing on the population age zzso years, we compared 3 different case definition zzso and also used statistical methods that accounted for imperfect case zzso to estimate the prevalence and the properties of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso class zzso model was developed that also allowed us to assess differences across patient demographics zzso and region of zzso 

Using methods that account for the imperfect nature of both billing and hospitalization databases, we estimated the prevalence of zzso in women age zzso years to be lower in urban areas zzso zzso zzso credible zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with rural areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This regional trend was also seen in men age zzso years, where the prevalence was estimated at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in urban areas and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rural zzso zzso data appeared more sensitive in zzso cases than hospitalization data, and a large proportion of diagnoses was made by physicians other than zzso 

These data suggest a higher prevalence of zzso in rural versus urban zzso Our approach demonstrates the usefulness of methods that adjust for the imperfect nature of multiple information sources, which also allow for zzso of the sensitivity of different case zzso zzso
