One of the major challenges of passive optical networks is to achieve a fair zzso mechanism that will prevent possible zzso from occurring at the upstream channel when multiple users attempt to access the common fiber at the same zzso zzso in this study we mainly focus on fair bandwidth allocation among users, and present a hybrid zzso zzso Division zzso Division zzso architecture with a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme that provides satisfying service qualities to the users depending on their varying bandwidth zzso zzso delays in zzso schemes occurring during bandwidth assignment stage are eliminated by utilizing a decentralized zzso Instead of sending bandwidth demands to the optical line terminal zzso which is the only competent authority, each optical network unit zzso runs the same bandwidth demand determination zzso zzso inform each other via signaling channel about the status of their zzso This information is fed to the bandwidth determination zzso which is run by each zzso in a distributed zzso Furthermore, Light zzso zzso which is a phenomenon in optical communications, is zzso by limiting the amount of bandwidth that an zzso can zzso
