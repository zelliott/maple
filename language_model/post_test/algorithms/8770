Traditional clinical scores for assessment of zzso resulting from stroke are inherently zzso and limited by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, robotic technologies provide objective, highly zzso tools for zzso of motor performance of stroke zzso Although use of robotic technologies has been widely suggested in the literature, they are not an established tool and their relationship to traditional clinical scales for stroke diagnosis and prognosis is mostly zzso In this study we propose the application of two zzso system identification methods, Parallel Cascade Identification and Fast zzso zzso for prediction of zzso clinical scores using zzso zzso We show the suitability of these two methods for prediction of both diagnostic and zzso zzso We compare our results with a previously applied approach based on linear zzso and show the superiority of our modeling zzso Our results also underscore the importance of zzso zzso deficits in the prediction of zzso prognosis zzso
