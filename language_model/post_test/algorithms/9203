Little is known of the variations of the heart rate during spontaneous zzso zzso zzso Their knowledge has both academic and practical implications for the zzso of rate drop response zzso pacing zzso 

We describe variations of the rhythm occurring during 48 zzso episodes documented by zzso loop zzso The zzso phase of 18 s zzso range zzso was characterized by a fall in heart rate from 83 zzso 20 zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso pauses which lasted a median of 19 s zzso The recovery phase lasted 22 s zzso The total duration of the zzso zzso was 85 s zzso We then calculated the potential increase in benefit that an zzso programmed drop rate detection could provide compared with a reference Lower Rate zzso Compared with Lower Rate detection zzso as two consecutive beats at 40 zzso drop rate detection zzso to be drop size zzso 20 zzso detection window zzso 1 zzso and drop rate zzso 50 zzso would have been able to introduce intervention zzso a median of zzso s zzso range zzso zzso earlier in 28 cases zzso 

zzso zzso zzso varies widely from a few seconds to some zzso In our data the total duration was zzso zzso zzso zzso programming, being potentially able to anticipate the detection of the zzso zzso by a few seconds, could provide an increase in benefit for cardiac pacing therapy in prevention of zzso
