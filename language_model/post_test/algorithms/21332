A zzso theory for the development of selectivity and zzso dominance in visual zzso has been generalized to incorporate more realistic neural networks that approximate the actual anatomy of small regions of zzso In particular, we have analyzed a network consisting of zzso and zzso cells, both of which may receive information from the lateral zzso nucleus zzso and then interact through zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Our investigation of the evolution of a cell in this zzso network indicates that many of the results on existence and stability of fixed points that have been obtained previously in the zzso theory can be successfully generalized zzso We can, in addition, make explicit further statements concerning the independent effects of zzso and zzso zzso on selectivity and zzso zzso For example, shutting off zzso cells zzso selectivity and alters zzso dominance zzso zzso These zzso cells may be selective, but there is no theoretical necessity that they be zzso Further, the zzso zzso zzso do not have to be very responsive to visual zzso Most of the learning process can occur among the zzso zzso zzso
