While the popular DNA sequence alignment tools incorporate powerful zzso to allow for fast and accurate alignment of DNA, most of them still zzso the classical zzso zzso scoring zzso The development of novel scoring schemes is often hampered by the difficulty of finding an zzso zzso for each zzso zzso In this paper we define the broad class of rectangle scoring schemes, and describe an zzso and tool that can align two sequences with an arbitrary rectangle scoring scheme in zzso zzso zzso scoring schemes zzso some of the popular alignment scoring metrics currently in use, as well as many other zzso We investigate a novel scoring function based on minimizing the expected number of random zzso observed with the given scores and show that it rivals the zzso and zzso zzso without using any biological or evolutionary zzso The zzso program, freely available at zzso gives zzso researchers the ability to quickly compare the performance of other complex scoring formulas without having to implement new zzso to zzso zzso
