This study investigated the role of zzso in the respiratory responses to zzso loading in zzso Adult zzso were zzso zzso zzso a constant chemical drive to zzso zzso circuits assessed the respiratory muscle pressure zzso and controlled the relationship between zzso and the respiratory volume zzso Respiratory volume changes similar to those achieved by zzso unloading or loading were produced by the zzso imposing a zzso resistance zzso When zzso was doubled zzso rate of volume change, zzso zzso zzso tidal volume zzso measured by whole body zzso decreased significantly zzso while zzso volume zzso measured by respiratory zzso zzso did not zzso When RV was quadrupled zzso zzso 4) VT and zzso decreased significantly zzso and zzso zzso zzso RV to one half the normal value zzso zzso 5) did not affect these zzso zzso time and zzso were not significantly altered at any zzso It is concluded that, at constant chemical drive, zzso play a minimal role in maintaining tidal volume during zzso breathing in zzso Comparative differences which may explain these results are zzso
