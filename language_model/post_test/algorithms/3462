Rapid and accurate discrimination of single units from zzso recordings is a fundamental process for the analysis and interpretation of zzso zzso We present an zzso that performs zzso zzso discrimination, and analysis of action zzso from zzso recording zzso The program was entirely written in zzso (National zzso and requires no external hardware devices or a zzso information about action potential zzso zzso events are detected by scanning the digital record for zzso that exceed a zzso zzso zzso events are characterized to determine nine different time and zzso levels for each zzso Various zzso combinations of these zzso features are used as axis choices for zzso Cartesian plots of zzso The user selects axis choices that generate distinct zzso Multiple clusters may be defined as action zzso by manually generating boundaries of arbitrary zzso Events defined as action zzso are validated by visual inspection of zzso zzso zzso relationships may be identified by selecting any recorded channel for comparison to continuous and average cycle zzso of zzso unit zzso The zzso includes novel aspects of feature analysis and zzso including higher acquisition rates for zzso data compared to other zzso The program confirms that zzso data may be zzso with high-speed and efficiency using zzso combinations of zzso features derived from high-speed digital zzso
