zzso screening zzso of zzso zzso has recently emerged as an important tool of drug zzso The analysis and modeling of zzso zzso zzso images, however, is particularly zzso In this paper we present a novel zzso for extraction and zzso of zzso segments from zzso zzso zzso The zzso is designed to be able to detect and link zzso even with complex zzso structures and of poor imaging zzso Our proposed zzso automatically detects initial seed points on a set of grid lines and estimates the ending points of the zzso by zzso tracing the zzso points along the line path representing the zzso zzso The zzso method is then applied to link the seed points and the corresponding ending points using dynamic programming techniques, thus enabling the extraction of the zzso of the zzso segments accurately and robustly against noise, zzso and other image zzso A fast zzso of our zzso using dynamic programming is also provided in the zzso Any thin zzso and its segments with low intensity contrast can be well preserved by detecting the starting and ending points of the zzso All these properties make the proposed zzso attractive for zzso screening of zzso zzso
