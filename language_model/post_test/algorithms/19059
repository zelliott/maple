This study evaluates the application of zzso zzso methods zzso watershed zzso zzso brain surface zzso zzso and zzso tool zzso and zzso bias correction zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso bias field zzso zzso and zzso automated zzso tool zzso as zzso pipelines for the technique of zzso zzso zzso using statistical zzso mapping zzso zzso The pipelines were evaluated using a zzso zzso and those that performed consistently were further assessed using zzso masks applied to 10 healthy controls compared to the original zzso scans, and finally, 20 Alzheimer's disease zzso patients versus 23 zzso In each case, pipelines were compared to each other and to those from default zzso zzso The zzso pipeline was found to produce the least zzso to template induced by real zzso and performed consistently better than the other methods for the above zzso Occasionally, the clusters of significant differences located close to the boundary were dragged out of the zzso projections -- this could be corrected by adding background noise to zzso zzso in the zzso matter zzso This method was confirmed in a one-dimensional simulation and was preferable to threshold and explicit zzso masking which excluded true zzso
