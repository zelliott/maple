zzso dependent broadening of the zzso point spread function due to zzso in the zzso media, and zzso for zzso zzso have been previously described for both time domain and frequency domain optical zzso zzso We show that homogeneous media zzso artifacts disappear when frequency domain samples are acquired with uniform spacing in circular zzso as opposed to uniform sampling in optical zzso We further zzso the source of this point spread broadening and simulate its magnitude in zzso zzso We zzso demonstrate media zzso compensation in high zzso glass by choosing sample zzso at equal intervals of media index of refraction divided by vacuum zzso and we recover zzso reflections without an additional zzso zzso
