The analysis of a zzso volume holographic zzso is presented in zzso The zzso is based on a zzso beam volume zzso followed by a zzso lens and a zzso It is shown that the zzso is not sensitive to the incident angle of the input beam for the practical range of zzso A holographic zzso based on the conventional zzso is also zzso and the results are used to compare the performance of the proposed method with the conventional zzso The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical zzso It is also shown that the zzso volume holographic zzso zzso three elements (the entrance zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso of the conventional zzso into one zzso beam volume zzso Based on the unique features of the zzso volume holographic zzso we believe it is a good candidate for portable zzso for environmental and biological zzso
