The search for zzso zzso of disease from zzso mass zzso zzso data requires a complex analysis zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso starting from raw zzso to set up a zzso zzso based on a shortlist of candidate zzso As a zzso problem, zzso profiling on zzso data needs caution like the zzso zzso The risk of zzso and of selection bias effects is zzso not only potential features easily zzso samples by zzso times, but it is easy to neglect zzso effects during zzso from zzso to zzso The aim of this review is to explain how to build a general purpose design analysis protocol zzso for zzso zzso zzso we show how to limit leakage due to zzso tuning and how to organize zzso and ranking on large numbers of replicate versions of the original data to avoid selection zzso The zzso can be used with alternative zzso zzso with different zzso methods zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Support zzso zzso zzso or feature ranking methods zzso feature elimination or zzso A procedure for assessing stability and zzso value of the resulting zzso list is also zzso The approach is exemplified with experiments on synthetic zzso (from the Cromwell zzso zzso and with publicly available zzso from cancer zzso
