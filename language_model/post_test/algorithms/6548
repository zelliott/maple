Currently, new bacterial zzso are being published on a monthly zzso With the growing amount of zzso sequence data, there is a demand for a flexible and zzso structure for storing sequence data and results from zzso zzso More than 150 zzso bacterial zzso are now available, and comparisons of properties for zzso similar organisms are not readily available to many zzso In addition to the most basic information, such as AT content, zzso zzso zzso count and zzso count, a large number of more complex calculations are needed to perform detailed comparative zzso DNA structural calculations like zzso and stacking energy, DNA compositions like base zzso zzso zzso and repeats at the local and global level are just a few of the analysis that are presented on the CBS Genome zzso Web zzso Complex analysis, changing methods and frequent addition of new models are factors that require a dynamic database zzso Using basic tools like the zzso Make system, zzso zzso and zzso we have created a flexible database environment for storing and maintaining such results for a collection of complete microbial zzso Currently, these results counts to more than 220 pieces of zzso The backbone of this solution consists of a program package written in zzso which enables administrators to zzso and update the database zzso The zzso database has been connected to the CBS zzso via zzso to present a dynamic web content for users outside the zzso This solution is tightly fitted to existing server infrastructure and the solutions proposed here can perhaps serve as a template for other research groups to solve database zzso 

A web based user interface which is zzso linked to the Genome zzso Database can be zzso via zzso 

This paper has a supplemental information page which links to the examples zzso zzso
