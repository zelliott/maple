We have shown that the molecular zzso of a protein at an interface can be zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, by varying the penetration depth of the zzso field, zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allow us to monitor how zzso intensity and zzso zzso vary normal to an interface as a function of time after zzso We have applied this technique to the study of bovine serum zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso varies as a function of the penetration depth of the zzso wave in a manner that indicates a zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso normal to the zzso zzso of the fluorescent zzso motion also occurs as a function of distance normal to the zzso The results are consistent with a model of partial protein zzso at the surface, an zzso zzso zzso zzso thus zzso zzso interactions and the number of points of attachment to the zzso Further away, normal to the surface, the protein zzso maintains its coiled zzso
