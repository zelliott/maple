zzso sequencing technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify rare zzso zzso It is not yet financially feasible to perform zzso sequencing on a large number of subjects, and a zzso design has been advocated to be a practical zzso In stage I, zzso are discovered by sequencing the whole zzso of a small number of carefully selected zzso In stage II, the discovered zzso of a large number of individuals are zzso to assess zzso zzso with extreme zzso are typically selected in stage zzso Using simulated data for unrelated individuals, we explore two important aspects of this zzso zzso the efficiency of discovering common and rare zzso zzso zzso in stage I and the impact of incomplete zzso discovery in stage I on the power of testing associations in stage zzso We applied a sum test and a sum of squared score test for zzso association analyses evaluating the power of the zzso zzso We obtained the following results from extensive simulation studies and analysis of the zzso zzso When individuals with trait values more extreme than the zzso zzso were included in stage I, the zzso design could achieve the same power as or even higher than the zzso design if the rare zzso zzso had large effect zzso In such design, fewer than half of the total zzso including more than half of the zzso zzso were discovered, which included nearly all zzso with minor zzso zzso zzso zzso more than half of the zzso with zzso between zzso and zzso and fewer than half of the zzso with zzso zzso Although a zzso design may be preferable to identify multiple rare zzso having small to moderate effect sizes, our observations support using the zzso design as a cost-effective option for next-generation sequencing zzso
