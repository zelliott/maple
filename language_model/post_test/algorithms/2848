zzso and analysis of patterns or shapes in the digital plane are of utmost importance in various problems of computer vision and pattern zzso A digital point set is such a pattern that zzso to an object in the digital zzso Although there exist several data structures that can be employed for Approximate Point Set zzso zzso zzso in the real domain, they require substantial modification to support zzso in the digital zzso To bridge this zzso a novel data structure called zzso zzso is proposed, targeting an efficient and zzso circular range query in the digital zzso The farthest pair of points may be used as the starting correspondence between the pattern set and the background zzso Several classical discrete structures and zzso of zzso zzso as well as some zzso features of zzso in digital zzso have been used in tandem, for successful realization of the proposed zzso zzso in the digital zzso The zzso zzso based on the angular tree has been implemented and tested on various point sets and the reported results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the new data structure for supporting zzso zzso
