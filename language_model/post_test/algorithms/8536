A new zzso that examines DNA databases for proteins that have a particular structure, as opposed to a particular zzso represents a novel zzso approach to gene zzso The zzso has successfully identified new zzso zzso which have a characteristic zzso structure, from the zzso zzso zzso In particular, it has revealed novel families of odor receptors and taste zzso which had long eluded identification by other zzso The two new gene families, the Or and zzso zzso are expressed in zzso of zzso and taste zzso and are highly divergent from all other known zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso should allow identification of other classes of zzso zzso
