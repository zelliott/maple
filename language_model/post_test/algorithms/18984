A zzso intelligent system that models the human cognitive abilities may promise significant performance in problem learning because human is effective in learning and problem zzso zzso zzso the human cognitive abilities not only avoids the details of the underlying neural mechanisms performing the tasks, but also reduces the complexity of the zzso The complementary learning mechanism is responsible for human pattern recognition, zzso human attends to positive and negative samples when making zzso Furthermore, human concept learning is organized in a zzso zzso Such zzso organization allows the zzso approach to the zzso Thus, zzso the functional models of zzso organization and complementary learning can potentially improve the performance in pattern zzso zzso complementary learning zzso exhibits many of the desirable features of pattern zzso It is further supported by the experimental results that verify the rationale of the integration and that the zzso system is a promising pattern recognition zzso
