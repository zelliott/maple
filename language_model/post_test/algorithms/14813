Better insights into bird migration can be a tool for assessing the spread of avian borne infections or zzso issues reflected in zzso migration zzso This paper evaluates whether low budget permanent cameras such as zzso can offer a valuable contribution to the reporting of migratory zzso An experimental design was set up to study the detection capability using objects of different size, color and zzso The results of the experiment revealed the minimum size, maximum zzso and contrast of the objects required for detection by a standard zzso Furthermore, a modular processing scheme was proposed to track and follow migratory birds in zzso zzso zzso such as motion detection by background zzso stereo vision and lens distortion were combined to form the foundation of the bird tracking zzso Additional research to integrate zzso networks, however, is needed and future research should enforce the potential of the processing scheme by exploring and testing alternatives of each individual module or processing zzso
