zzso biology requires quantitative zzso No zzso technologies exist capable of obtaining several hundred independent kinetic binding zzso in a single zzso We present an integrated zzso device zzso for the simultaneous kinetic characterization of 768 zzso zzso We applied zzso to the kinetic analysis of zzso factor zzso zzso measuring the detailed kinetic landscapes of the mouse zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrated the integrated nature of zzso by zzso zzso and characterizing 27 additional zzso zzso factors in parallel on a single zzso Overall, we obtained zzso association and zzso zzso of 223 unique molecular interactions with equilibrium zzso zzso ranging from 2 zzso zzso M to 2 zzso zzso M, and zzso rate zzso of approximately 6 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Association rate zzso were uniform across 3 zzso families, ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and are well below the diffusion zzso We expect that zzso will contribute to our quantitative understanding of biological systems and accelerate the development and characterization of engineered zzso
