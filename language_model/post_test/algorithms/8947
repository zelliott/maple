The common spatial pattern analysis zzso a frequently zzso feature extraction method in zzso applications, is believed to be zzso and sensitive to noises, mainly due to an inherent shortcoming of purely relying on spatial zzso zzso zzso filtering which can be very effective to counteract the zzso influence of noises is usually used as a zzso This work zzso the zzso spatial filters with complex zzso finite impulse response zzso filters in a natural and intuitive zzso Each hybrid zzso filter is of zzso zzso and is unique to its corresponding zzso They are derived by introducing multiple time delays and zzso into conventional zzso The general framework of the method follows that of zzso but performs better, as proven in zzso zzso tasks like zzso potential detection and motor zzso
