In this paper, a digital zzso model which allows for zzso in three dimensions and interactive manipulation is explored as a tool to help us understand the structural zzso and zzso the functions of zzso structures of fragile zzso which defy live zzso We developed a zzso generic zzso model of zzso anchor of zzso zzso that can subsequently be zzso into different desired anchor shapes by using direct manipulation deformation zzso We used point zzso to construct the zzso building blocks to develop our zzso zzso zzso Point zzso are manually marked on a zzso illustration of an anchor on a Cartesian graph paper and a set of Cartesian coordinates for each point primitive is manually extracted from the graph zzso A Python script is then written in zzso to construct zzso zzso building blocks based on the Cartesian zzso The zzso building blocks are stacked on top or by the side of each other following their respective Cartesian coordinates of point zzso More point zzso are added at the sites in the zzso model where more structural variations are likely to occur, in order to generate complex anchor zzso We used zzso subdivision surface modifier to zzso the surface and edge of the generic zzso model to obtain a zzso and more natural zzso shape and zzso option to reduce the jagged edges of the zzso zzso This zzso generic zzso model can be zzso into different desired zzso anchor shapes through direct manipulation deformation technique by aligning the zzso zzso points) of the newly developed zzso generic zzso model onto the zzso illustrations of the desired shapes and moving the zzso until the desire zzso shapes are zzso In this generic zzso model all the zzso present are deployed for displacement during zzso
