We tested one zzso of a new zzso including the zzso the implemented zzso and fitting platform in a small group of selected patients with mixed zzso due to earlier bilateral radical zzso It was effective to compensate the zzso and the zzso components of those zzso zzso regarding the energy, frequency and other requirements of the output zzso make it possible to develop a suitable zzso with the available zzso zzso technology to substitute the conventional zzso of the zzso 

The objectives were: a) to evaluate the effectiveness of the whole fitting system, and b) to obtain information about the required energy to design the zzso zzso 

The experiments were conducted with the A zzso of the zzso equipped with an output zzso coupled to the oval zzso Two zzso and three cases were zzso 

The zzso with the implemented zzso zzso zzso paradigm zzso and the fitting system were shown to be adequate for clinical zzso zzso parameters were: pure tone average gains zzso zzso gap closure zzso zzso speech reception thresholds improvement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients considered the results very zzso
