zzso and strain rate imaging have been shown to be useful techniques for the assessment of cardiac zzso However, one of the major problems of these techniques is their angle zzso In order to overcome this problem, a new method for zzso the strain zzso zzso had previously been proposed by our zzso The aim of this study was to validate this methodology in a phantom zzso A zzso zzso zzso phantom was fixed in a water zzso zzso the zzso pressure resulted in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain was calculated from the zzso zzso estimates, obtained from zzso radio frequency zzso tracking using a zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso were implanted on the outer and inner walls of the tube in order to give an independent measurement of the instantaneous wall zzso The two methods were compared by means of linear regression, the correlation zzso and zzso zzso As expected, the strain estimates dominated by the zzso zzso component were less accurate than the ones dominated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be r zzso zzso for the former estimates and r zzso zzso was found for the zzso Given that the overall shape and timing of the zzso deformation were very accurate zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso these results were within acceptable limits for clinical zzso The zzso zzso using a zzso kernel thus allows for zzso and therefore zzso strain zzso
