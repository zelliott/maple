An approach to zzso mapping in optical zzso zzso zzso using comparison of correlation stability of zzso obtained intensity zzso images of the studied strained tissue is zzso The basic idea is that for stiffer regions, the zzso image is distorted to a smaller zzso zzso zzso maps obtained with compensation of trivial zzso motion of the image parts using a sliding correlation window can represent the spatial distribution of the relative tissue zzso An important advantage of the proposed approach is that it allows one to avoid the stage of zzso reconstruction via zzso zzso differentiation of zzso determined zzso Another advantage is that the correlation stability zzso approach zzso implies that for zzso zzso tissue regions, zzso should already be strongly decreased in contrast to the approaches based on initial reconstruction of zzso This feature determines a much wider strain range of zzso than the proposed approach and is favorable for its zzso zzso using the zzso probe itself to zzso the zzso The zzso approach can be implemented using either the image elements reflecting zzso structure of the tissue or performing the zzso zzso Examples of zzso simulations and experimental demonstrations using both phantom samples and in zzso obtained zzso images are zzso
