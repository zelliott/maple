zzso zzso motion of a charged particle through a zzso zzso is studied by solving the coupled system of the zzso equations for fluid flow and the zzso equation for electrical field with an arbitrary zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso electric field is induced in the zzso section, which gives rise to a direct current zzso zzso force in addition to the zzso force acting on the charged zzso As a zzso the symmetry of the particle zzso and trajectory with respect to the throat is zzso We demonstrate that the predicted particle trajectory shifts due to zzso show quantitative agreements with the existing experimental zzso Although zzso zzso can be used for super fast zzso due to the enhancement of the local electric field, it is shown that large particles may be blocked due to the induced zzso force, which thus must be taken into account in the study of zzso in zzso devices where zzso electric fields are zzso
