zzso silver hollow spheres are first prepared via a zzso approach with zzso zzso as the outer diameter, 3-5 zzso as the wall zzso and zzso zzso as the diameter of the inner zzso The presence of hollow spheres is confirmed by electron zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by X-ray zzso with a zzso analysis to characterize the zzso zzso In addition to the hollow zzso massive silver zzso of similar size zzso diameter of zzso zzso are gained via zzso Based on the similarity of experimental conditions and the resulting particle size, zzso silver hollow spheres and massive zzso are used to compare their optical properties and zzso zzso In contrast to reducing the diameter of massive zzso zzso of silver zzso leads to a zzso of the zzso zzso With a red shift of about 33 zzso in the case of the hollow zzso a zzso effect is indeed observed and in accordance with the thin sphere zzso
