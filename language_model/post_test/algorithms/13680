An outstanding question in human zzso has been the degree to which adaptation occurs from standing genetic variation or from de zzso zzso Here, we combine several common statistics used to detect selection in an Approximate zzso zzso (ABC) zzso with the goal of discriminating between models of selection and providing estimates of the age of selected zzso and the selection zzso acting on zzso We use simulations to assess the power and accuracy of our method and apply it to seven of the strongest sweeps currently known in zzso We identify two zzso zzso and zzso that are most likely affected by selection on standing zzso and we find three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which the zzso zzso seem to have swept from a new zzso We also confirm evidence of selection for one further zzso zzso In one zzso zzso neither neutral models nor models of selective sweeps fit the data, presumably because this locus has been subject to balancing zzso
