zzso ultrasound zzso therapy relies on temperature monitoring for treatment guidance and assurance of targeting and dose zzso One potential approach is to monitor temperature change through zzso signal zzso The current approach involves the detection of echo zzso based on zzso processing from segmented zzso zzso zzso In this study, we propose a novel zzso zzso approach that detects changes in instantaneous frequency along the imaging beam zzso zzso ultrasound was used as the heating source, and the zzso zzso zzso signals provided from an ultrasound zzso were used to verify the proposed zzso for temperature change zzso For comparison, a conventional zzso technique was also zzso zzso experiments testing zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso muscles were zzso The results showed that temperature can be well estimated by the proposed zzso in the temperature range, where the relationship of sound speed versus temperature is zzso Compared with the zzso algorithm, the proposed new zzso yields a zzso increase in zzso efficiency, along with comparable zzso ability and zzso This new zzso may serve as an alternative method for implementing temperature zzso into a clinical ultrasound zzso for zzso therapy zzso
