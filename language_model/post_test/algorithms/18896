We report the first demonstration of resonant zzso zzso zzso for element specific imaging of buried structures with a zzso resolution of approximately 15 zzso by exploiting the abrupt change in the scattering cross section near electronic zzso We performed zzso and quantitative imaging of buried zzso structures inside a zzso crystal by directly phasing coherent zzso zzso patterns acquired below and above the zzso zzso zzso We anticipate that resonant zzso zzso zzso will be applied to element and chemical state specific imaging of a broad range of systems including magnetic materials, zzso organic materials, zzso and biological zzso
