A collection of nine zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso characteristics relevant to applications in cell biology and single zzso detection were analyzed in zzso zzso at the aromatic system covering the zzso series and zzso in the zzso chain were investigated with respect to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantum yields, and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso chain increased the zzso energy dissipation of the excited zzso state and decreased the zzso quantum yield, relative to the zzso zzso For zzso at the aromatic rings the zzso quantum yield zzso zzso with the position of the zzso in the zzso series zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid groups or zzso atoms attached to the zzso systems had the highest zzso quantum zzso The compound zzso had nearly zzso of the quantum yield of zzso and comparable zzso The free zzso acid of zzso was attached to peptides in high yield and purity by established procedures of zzso zzso The zzso peptides did not zzso or bind to tissue culture cells and proteins zzso The zzso dye zzso is therefore an attractive new zzso for in zzso and zzso detection of zzso zzso interaction at zzso zzso by flow zzso zzso correlation zzso and laser scanning zzso
