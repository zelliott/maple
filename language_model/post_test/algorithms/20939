This work studies two mathematical models for describing the motion of zzso bacteria, zzso bacteria that move toward zzso Based on experimental zzso we conjecture that the motion of the colony toward light depends on certain group zzso These group dynamics are hypothesized to be coordinated through an individual property of each zzso which we refer to as zzso The zzso of each individual zzso is assumed to change based on the zzso of the neighboring zzso Under these zzso we propose a zzso cellular zzso model and derive an analogous zzso model for describing the evolution in time of the location of bacteria, the zzso of individual bacteria, and a surface memory zzso We provide simulation results and discuss in detail the role of the various model parameters in controlling the emerging zzso
