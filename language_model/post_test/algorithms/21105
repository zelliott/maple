Electronic and zzso gas phase zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their clusters with water are zzso Mass selective zzso double resonance zzso confirm the formation of zzso clusters and are compared to calculated zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso He, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, 2004, zzso 94 we are able to detect zzso and their water clusters via resonant zzso delayed zzso under careful control of the applied zzso zzso The zzso dark electronic state of zzso and zzso detected by delayed zzso survives zzso and the zzso of zzso cannot be attributed solely to zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicate that the zzso state population is probably small compared to the zzso zzso and/or hot electronic ground state zzso zzso zzso theory shows that zzso of zzso by water does not lead to a substantial modification of the electronic relaxation and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways via zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and barriers have been identified, but are not significantly altered by zzso
