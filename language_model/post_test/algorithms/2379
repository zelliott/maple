Many interesting proteins possess defined sequence stretches containing zzso charged zzso zzso At present, experimental methods zzso zzso zzso have failed to provide structural data for many of these sequence zzso We have applied the zzso probability zzso Carlo zzso zzso search zzso to a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that represent zzso regions in a number of important zzso such as zzso zzso the sodium channel zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The atomic charges were estimated from charge zzso and the zzso and van der zzso parameters are from zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso groups was treated using sodium zzso for each charged side chain (one zzso for zzso two Na for zzso plus a zzso zzso zzso constant, zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso to simulate zzso zzso The structures of these zzso zzso were obtained by the zzso zzso search with zzso 0 zzso 10, followed by calculation of zzso energies for the lowest energy zzso using the protein zzso zzso method of zzso These calculations predict a correlation between zzso acid sequence and global folded zzso zzso zzso zzso our structural zzso exhibited a preference for right-handed zzso zzso zzso which zzso experimental observations of zzso zzso in zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso all zzso exhibited a low preference for right-handed zzso formation zzso or zzso zzso but a significant percentage zzso zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were found in all three sequence zzso zzso zzso forms zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features a nearly zzso ratio of zzso zzso preferences, with very little preference for zzso structure, and possesses short regions of strand and turn combinations that give rise to a collapsed bend or hairpin zzso zzso zzso features a zzso ratio of zzso and gives rise to a zzso or zzso zzso
