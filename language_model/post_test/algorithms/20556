In this paper, a number of existing and novel techniques are considered for ordering cloned extracts from the zzso of an zzso based on zzso zzso A metric is defined for comparing the quality of the clone order for each zzso zzso zzso is used in combination with several different objective zzso zzso results with many simulated data sets for which the correct solution is known indicate that a simple greedy zzso with some subsequent zzso zzso provides the best zzso Other techniques that attempt to weight comparisons between nonadjacent clones bias the ordering and give worse zzso We show that this finding is not surprising since without detailed attempts to reconcile the data into a detailed map, only approximate maps can be zzso Making zzso pieces of data from zzso of N clones cannot improve the zzso
