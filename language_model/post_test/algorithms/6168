We present theoretical calculations, based on a random zzso sum model, which show that the optical zzso zzso zzso contrast ratio is dependent on the local density of scattering particles in a sample, provided that the effective number of zzso in the zzso volume is less than about zzso We confirm these theoretical predictions zzso using suspensions of zzso in zzso The observed contrast ratios vary in value from the zzso limit of zzso to in excess of 2, suggesting that the contrast ratio could be useful in optical zzso zzso particularly when imaging in zzso zzso
