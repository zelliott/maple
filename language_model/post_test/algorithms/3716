The zzso of clusters of related zzso are now being zzso at an increasing rate, creating a need for accurate, low-cost zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and direct sequencing based on predicted gene structures satisfy this need, at least for zzso zzso The zzso gene prediction zzso was adapted for the zzso pathogen zzso zzso by using a precise model of zzso lengths in combination with zzso alignments between the zzso sequences of the two closely related zzso zzso This approach resulted in approximately zzso of known genes being predicted exactly right at every coding base and zzso zzso When previously zzso zzso predictions were tested by zzso and direct sequencing, zzso of targets spanning two predicted zzso were amplified and produced high-quality zzso When targets spanning the complete predicted open reading frame were tested, zzso of them amplified and produced high-quality zzso We conclude that sequencing a small number of expressed sequence tags zzso to provide training data, running zzso on an entire zzso and then performing zzso and direct sequencing on all of its predictions would be a cost-effective method for obtaining an zzso verified zzso zzso
