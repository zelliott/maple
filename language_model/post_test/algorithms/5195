zzso are the main cause of zzso but various zzso zzso zzso are often isolated from abnormal zzso The correct identification of the zzso agent of nail infections is necessary in order to recommend appropriate zzso 

To evaluate a rapid zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso for zzso identification in nails on a large number of samples in comparison with zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso using zzso in 410 nail samples in which zzso elements were observed in zzso by direct zzso examination zzso zzso The results were compared with those previously obtained by culture of zzso on zzso zzso from the same nail zzso 

zzso identification of zzso in nails allowed validation of the results obtained in culture when zzso zzso grew from infected zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso could be identified with certainty as the infectious agents in zzso and zzso from zzso as well as from transient zzso The specificity of the culture results relative to zzso appeared to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, grew on zzso zzso It was also possible to identify the infectious agent when direct nail zzso examination showed zzso zzso but negative results were obtained from zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity for the detection of zzso in nails was obtained using the zzso zzso Rapid and reliable molecular identification of the infectious fungus can be used routinely and presents several important advantages compared with culture in expediting the choice of appropriate zzso zzso
