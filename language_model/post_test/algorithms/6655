The zzso versus zzso measures of zzso causality were zzso zzso causality in the application to zzso zzso time series has the meaning of the information flow between zzso It was shown by means of simulations and by the example of experimental electroencephalogram signals that zzso estimates of zzso in case of mutually zzso channels give erroneous results, therefore zzso measures such as directed transfer function should be used for determination of the information zzso
