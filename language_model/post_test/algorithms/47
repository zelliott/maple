Current zzso for characterizing zzso membrane zzso motion are usually limited to either average acoustic estimates zzso or zzso or zzso mobility zzso neither of which zzso to characterize the detailed mechanical response of the TM to zzso Furthermore, while acoustic and zzso zzso may aid in diagnosing some zzso disorders, they are not always zzso zzso of the motion of the entire TM surface can provide more information than these other techniques and may be superior for diagnosing zzso We present advances in our development of a new compact zzso holographic zzso zzso system for full zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso of the TM surface at video zzso The zzso system consists of a fiber zzso zzso a compact zzso head, and a high-speed image processing computer with advanced software for recording and processing holographic images coupled to a computer-controlled zzso and recording zzso A zzso zzso system is in use in a medical research environment to address basic science questions regarding TM zzso The zzso provides real-time observation of zzso TM displacement patterns over a broad frequency zzso Representative zzso and zzso holographic zzso results in animals and human zzso samples are zzso and their potential utility is zzso
