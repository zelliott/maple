The aim of the present work was to zzso assess the minimum number of zzso that would lead to equivalent growth parameters estimates to those obtained with a high number of zzso The zzso from two previous works on 30 zzso zzso zzso and 62 zzso zzso zzso were used for this zzso First, the zzso were used to produce a global zzso of growth parameters zzso zzso rate, zzso and zzso zzso to visible growth, zzso under the different experimental conditions, providing also a zzso confidence zzso Second, a zzso zzso was developed in order to obtain an zzso of the growth parameters that one would obtain using a lower number of zzso and/or zzso using a zzso procedure with zzso zzso The result of this zzso was the probability that the obtained zzso falls in the zzso confidence zzso previously produced using all sample zzso Third, the zzso was zzso applied to obtain these probabilities for all possible combinations of zzso and zzso Finally, these results were used to determine the minimum number of zzso and replicates needed to obtain a reasonable zzso zzso inside the confidence zzso with a probability of zzso zzso and zzso The results revealed that increasing the number of zzso may be more effective than increasing the number of zzso in terms of increasing the zzso In particular, zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to the same growth parameters as the total 30 zzso zzso zzso or 9 zzso with p zzso zzso by contrast, zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to the same growth parameters as the total 62 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with p zzso zzso As far as we know, this is the first study that provides a systematic evaluation of the number of zzso and replicates needed when designing an experiment involving zzso zzso responses to environmental factors, and may serve to support decision making in this kind of studies or other similar zzso
