The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso and its main zzso zzso after oral administration of zzso in rabbits with or without zzso zzso The area under the plasma zzso curve zzso of zzso was significantly elevated in rabbits zzso with zzso suggesting that the oral zzso an index of intrinsic zzso may be decreased by the zzso zzso zzso with the increased zzso by the treatment, peak plasma concentration zzso for zzso was also zzso zzso volume of distribution zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso increased significantly in rabbits zzso with zzso zzso Taken together with the fact that the first pass metabolism for zzso is the primary zzso for the oral zzso these observations indicate that increases in the oral clearance and zzso may be a manifestation of the decreased first pass zzso zzso with the hypothesis, the zzso of zzso was significantly decreased in rabbits with zzso zzso zzso of zzso to total zzso in the plasma was significantly decreased in rabbits with zzso zzso These observations suggested that the metabolism of zzso to zzso was reduced by zzso treatment and that the dosage of zzso should be adjusted when the drug is zzso chronically with zzso in a clinical zzso
