An zzso for generating zzso images of molecules is presented that uses zzso operations to solve the zzso zzso The zzso makes certain assumptions: that the size and zzso of each atom are determined only by its type and are unaffected by the zzso position, and that an intersection table comprised of entries for all pairs of atoms whose zzso intersect is zzso For speed, zzso of shaded and colored atom disks are zzso The atoms are projected from back to zzso zzso zzso are explicitly calculated and used to generate mask zzso that are then used to zzso the zzso zzso leaving the visible portions of the atom zzso
