zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso signaling in zzso processes regulates synaptic transmission and local blood flow essential for brain zzso However, because of difficulties in imaging zzso zzso the zzso spatial organization of zzso zzso signaling is not well characterized and its regulatory mechanism remains zzso Using genetically zzso zzso zzso we showed that despite global stimulation by an zzso zzso zzso processes zzso exhibited a marked enrichment of zzso zzso zzso indicated that these polarized zzso responses could be attributed to increased density of surface zzso on processes relative to the zzso zzso tracking of surface zzso dynamics revealed a membrane barrier that blocked the movement of zzso between the processes and the zzso zzso of zzso or expression of its zzso zzso enabled diffusion of zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso the polarization of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate an zzso diffusion barrier between processes and zzso that zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso and may allow control of synaptic and vascular activity in specific zzso zzso
