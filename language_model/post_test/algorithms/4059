In this paper, an zzso zzso conversion system is introduced for measuring the zzso intervals of the zzso zzso zzso The system contains a modified zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso for detecting the zzso from the zzso sampled data in a compressed volume of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the proposed system delivers an average detection accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a positive prediction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso technology with a zzso supply zzso the overall system zzso zzso with core area of zzso zzso which make it suitable for zzso wireless zzso sensors in zzso zzso
