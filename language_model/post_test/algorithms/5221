This note analyzes two methods for calculating missing values of an incomplete zzso fuzzy preference zzso The first method by zzso appeared in the zzso Transactions on Systems, Man, and zzso B: zzso zzso 37, zzso 1 zzso zzso while the second one by zzso and zzso appeared later in the European Journal of zzso Research zzso 183 zzso zzso The underlying concept driving both methods is the additive consistency zzso We show that both methods, although different, are very zzso Both methods derive the same estimated values for the zzso case, while they differ in the zzso zzso However, it is shown that a modification of the first method zzso with the second zzso Regarding the total reconstruction of an incomplete preference zzso it is true that the second method performs worse than the first zzso When zzso 's method is zzso zzso method is as zzso However, in those cases when zzso method cannot guarantee the successful reconstruction of an incomplete preference zzso we have that zzso 's method zzso These results lead us to claim that both methods should be seen as complementary rather than competitors in their application, and as such, we propose a reconstruction policy of incomplete fuzzy preference relations using both zzso By doing this, the only unsuccessful reconstruction case is when there is a chain of missing zzso comparisons involving each one of the feasible alternatives at least zzso
