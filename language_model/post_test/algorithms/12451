zzso of evolution periods in zzso experiments is a very promising approach that has recently attracted much attention for its substantial savings in measurement zzso Another novel concept, which has already proved useful in many types of zzso applications is zzso zzso The zzso tool described here addresses the combination of these two modern tools in protein zzso The following properties of this approach are described and zzso zzso similar information to what would be found in a corresponding zzso spectrum is extracted from a set of projected zzso All experimental zzso are used zzso avoiding sensitivity loss associated with individual examination of the zzso zzso caused by the linear combinations of individual shifts in the projected zzso is automatically zzso allowing for better resolution due to smaller spectral zzso zzso of various zzso zzso including the corresponding zzso spectrum become zzso zzso overlap is efficiently zzso The capabilities of zzso are illustrated for a 14 zzso zzso for which 12 projections of a zzso spectrum with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso
