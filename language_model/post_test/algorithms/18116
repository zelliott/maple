The constitutional zzso of single zzso molecules zzso on the surfaces of zzso and zzso between their zzso and zzso is induced and investigated by means of a low temperature scanning zzso zzso On both zzso similar zzso thresholds are found indicating that the zzso mechanism of this reaction does not depend significantly on the underlying zzso The zzso threshold zzso of zzso zzso 7) zzso most likely zzso to zzso of a zzso stretch mode whose zzso energies we calculated zzso zzso to lie at 174 and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Though the reaction is found to be localized on the zzso scale, it depends heavily on the second zzso both in terms of zzso energy and reaction zzso
