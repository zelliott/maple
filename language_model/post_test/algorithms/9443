Studies examining dual adaptation to opposing novel environments have yielded contradictory results, with previous evidence supporting both successful dual adaptation and interference leading to poorer zzso zzso Whether or not interference is observed during dual adaptation appears to be dependent on the method used to allow the performer of the task to distinguish between two novel zzso This experiment tested if zzso cues, a separation in zzso and presentation schedule, could be used to distinguish between two opposing zzso zzso and enable dual zzso Through the use of a purpose designed zzso each zzso rotation was either presented in the same region of zzso and associated with zzso cues zzso 1), different regions of zzso in addition to zzso cues zzso 2 and 3) or different regions of zzso only zzso 4 and zzso We also assessed the effectiveness of the zzso separation with both zzso and alternating presentation schedules zzso 4 and zzso The results indicated that zzso cues were not effective at enabling dual adaptation when each of the zzso zzso was associated with the same region of zzso When associated with different regions of zzso however, dual adaptation to the opposing zzso was successful regardless of whether zzso cues were present or the type of presentation zzso
