zzso zzso approaches based on zzso are limited to the studies of molecular systems with few degrees of freedom, typically less than zzso Recently, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 131 zzso zzso have introduced the zzso scheme zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso which considerably reduces the size of the zzso This approach has pushed back the present calculation limits on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we have developed an extension of the standard zzso scheme in which this scheme is combined with zzso grids, such as zzso to obtain new sparse zzso This scheme has been applied to the study of the zzso energy levels of methanol in full zzso zzso
