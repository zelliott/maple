zzso magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter zzso The diffusion zzso is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a zzso However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct zzso A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple zzso fitting, zzso and zzso zzso However, each of these has inherent zzso In this study, we propose a novel method for zzso the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution zzso MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations zzso We assume that all white matter fiber zzso in the brain share identical diffusion zzso thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion zzso to partial volume zzso The zzso signal zzso measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the zzso over the sphere of a response function (the zzso zzso profile for a typical fiber zzso with the fiber orientation density function zzso The fiber zzso (the distribution of fiber zzso within the zzso can therefore be obtained using zzso zzso The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard zzso clinical zzso The technique can recover the fiber zzso in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as zzso
