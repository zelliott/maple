zzso zzso are common in natural populations and are believed to be involved in many important evolutionary phenomena, including zzso the evolution of sex zzso and local zzso While recent advances in sequencing and zzso methods are leading to rapidly increasing amounts of zzso sequence data that reveal interesting patterns of genetic variation within zzso regions, efficient simulation methods to study these patterns are largely zzso In this work, we extend the sequential zzso zzso an approximation to the zzso with zzso to include the effects of zzso zzso on patterns of zzso zzso show that our zzso is fast, zzso and accurate, making it feasible to simulate large zzso in large populations for the first zzso The zzso zzso enables studies of patterns of genetic variation (for example, linkage zzso and tests of hypotheses zzso zzso zzso that were previously zzso
