While zzso is a highly sensitive method for detecting breast zzso its ability to differentiate between zzso and benign zzso is low, which may result in as many as zzso of unnecessary zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a highly specific zzso diagnosis zzso to improve zzso of zzso zzso A zzso based on the likelihood ratio was developed to accommodate cases with missing zzso Data for development included zzso biopsy cases zzso zzso with zzso zzso Sixteen features based on the zzso lexicon and patient history had been recorded for the cases, with zzso zzso zzso missing feature values per zzso zzso evaluation methods included receiver operating characteristic and zzso zzso zzso The zzso achieved zzso specificity at zzso sensitivity on the zzso cases with 16 features that had missing zzso zzso just the seven features present for all cases resulted in decreased performance at zzso sensitivity with average zzso zzso No cases and no feature data were omitted during zzso development, showing that it is more beneficial to zzso cases with missing values than to discard incomplete cases that cannot be handled by many zzso zzso of zzso masses was commendable at high sensitivity levels, indicating that benign cases could be potentially spared from zzso
