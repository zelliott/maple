Pulmonary disease has become one of the major health zzso 

To investigate the regulation mechanism of zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease zzso on gene expression and zzso zzso 

We mapped the zzso expressed genes to a regulation network and zzso using zzso profiles and regulation zzso We constructed a zzso gene regulation network, zzso regulation network, and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso played an important role in COPD through participating in a number of zzso Although these related pathways all have been demonstrated associated with COPD in previous reports, the detail mechanism may be not very zzso 

Our results may help to further understanding the mechanism of zzso And zzso multiple pathways will also provide novel avenues in the treatment of zzso
