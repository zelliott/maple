The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the positioning of upper zzso and gliding distance of the median nerve during passive and active motion of the wrist and zzso The zzso gliding of the zzso nerve in the zzso was measured in 34 healthy subjects by zzso dynamic zzso Those images were analyzed in a zzso zzso advocated by zzso et zzso zzso In this experiment, passive extension of the wrist and fingers was applied manually by an examiner in four positions zzso zzso and extension with zzso zzso and elbow zzso and extension with zzso zzso two types of active finger motions zzso and zzso were performed by the zzso The zzso oriented median nerve gliding ranged from zzso (in elbow extension with zzso zzso to zzso (in elbow zzso with zzso zzso during passive extension of the wrist and zzso There was a statistically significant difference in nerve gliding between the positions zzso During active digital movement, the zzso oriented nerve gliding was observed from zzso (in the zzso to zzso (in the zzso There was a significant difference in nerve gliding between the two ways of active finger motions zzso On the basis of the data obtained from this study, it is concluded that zzso zzso is the preferred position for the passive median nerve gliding exercise because of large zzso oriented nerve zzso The active digital motion with full finger grip may be an effective procedure to produce zzso oriented median nerve zzso
