The contrast provided by zzso magnetic resonance offers the promise of improved tumor zzso in zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso of zzso were performed in zzso in patients undergoing radical zzso and later, ex zzso in the same patients' zzso zzso The imaging data were zzso to zzso sections of the zzso zzso thereby enabling zzso characterization of diffusion parameters in zzso and benign zzso Increased zzso and hence decreased zzso spaces, in peripheral zone zzso led to approximately zzso and 50% apparent diffusion policy zzso decrease compared with benign peripheral zone zzso in zzso and ex zzso zzso In contrast, no significant diffusion zzso differences were observed between the zzso and zzso peripheral zone zzso However, the dense zzso zzso in zzso such as zzso zzso in benign zzso zzso in central zzso exhibited high diffusion zzso A tissue zzso method is proposed to combine zzso and zzso image contrasts that may provide improved specificity of zzso detection over zzso imaging zzso zzso identified in volume rendered MR images zzso zzso well with zzso determined zzso zzso
