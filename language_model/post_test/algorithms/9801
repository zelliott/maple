This article presents the results of two zzso Carlo simulation studies of the recovery of weak factor zzso in the context of zzso factor analysis, for models that do not exactly hold in the zzso This issue has not been examined in previous zzso Model error was introduced using a procedure that allows for specifying a zzso structure with a specified zzso in the zzso The effects of sample size, zzso method zzso likelihood zzso zzso least zzso and factor correlation were also zzso The first simulation study examined recovery for models correctly specified with the known number of factors, and the second investigated recovery for models incorrectly specified by zzso The results showed that recovery was not affected by model zzso for the correctly specified models but was affected for the incorrectly specified zzso Recovery improved in both studies when factors were zzso and zzso least squares performed better than maximum likelihood in recovering the weak factor zzso
