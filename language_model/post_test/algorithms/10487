The International zzso of Sleep Disorders lists 90 zzso zzso such as zzso are important signs in the diagnosis of the zzso Sleep zzso zzso they are also socially zzso 

The aim of this paper was to present and evaluate a computerized tool that automatically identifies zzso and highlights the importance of establishing the duration of each zzso event in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso electrical signal that indicates zzso was measured during zzso The zzso sound of 31 patients was automatically classified by the zzso The Kappa approach was applied to measure agreement between the automatic detection software and a trained zzso zzso T test was applied to evaluate differences in the duration of zzso episodes among simple zzso and zzso zzso 

Of a total zzso zzso episodes, the software sensitivity was zzso zzso the specificity was zzso zzso and Kappa was zzso zzso We found a statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso in the duration of zzso episodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This computer software makes it easier to generate quantitative reports of zzso thereby reducing manual zzso
