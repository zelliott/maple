A zzso zzso passive acoustic array is used to obtain ranges and depths of zzso active zzso zzso in the Gulf of Mexico in June 2004, by extending a technique previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to explicitly account for zzso effects arising from a zzso sound speed zzso Under this expanded approach, three quantities are measured from an impulsive zzso the time difference between zzso arrivals on a forward and rear zzso the time difference between the direct and zzso paths on the rear zzso and the acoustic bearing measured on the rear zzso These zzso combined with independent zzso of zzso depths and cable zzso are converted into zzso position fixes by implementing an efficient zzso procedure that uses a zzso code to account for zzso effects caused by zzso sound speed zzso Analytic expressions that assume a constant zzso sound speed are also zzso zzso depths of various zzso zzso over 10 days in June, 2004 are estimated using the zzso zzso
