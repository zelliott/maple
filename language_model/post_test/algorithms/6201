Two essential properties of a signal zzso method are the zzso rate and the distance between the original signal and the reconstruction from the compressed zzso These two properties are used to assess the performance and quality of the zzso In a recent work zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Notes in Computer zzso and Information Sciences, volume zzso chapter Signal zzso Using Growing Cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003, zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso system zzso is presented which defines the performance of the system as a function of the system complexity, system sensitivity and data zzso For a zzso method, it is desirable to formulate the performance of the system as a function of the system complexity and sensitivity to zzso the performance of the zzso It would be further desirable to express the reconstruction quality in terms of the same system parameters so as to know up front what zzso rate to end up with for a specific reconstruction zzso In this work, we modify zzso such that the modified zzso zzso estimates the reconstruction quality for a given system complexity and zzso Once this relation is identified it is possible to zzso either zzso rate or reconstruction quality with respect to system sensitivity and system complexity while limiting the other zzso
