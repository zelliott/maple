The zzso of the zzso axis of a shape under zzso have long been recognized as a major obstacle to its use in recognition and other zzso These zzso or zzso occur when the structure of the zzso axis graph changes abruptly under zzso of zzso The recent zzso of these transitions in zzso for the zzso axis and for the shock graph was a key factor in the development of an object recognition system where the classified zzso were zzso to represent deformation zzso The zzso of generic transitions of the zzso zzso axis could likewise potentially lead to a similar representation in zzso In this paper, these transitions are classified by examining the order of contact of spheres with the surface, leading to an zzso of possible transitions which are then examined on a case-by-case zzso Some cases are ruled out as never occurring in any family of zzso while others are shown to be zzso in a zzso family of zzso Finally, the remaining cases are shown to be viable by developing a specific example for zzso Our work is inspired by that of zzso who obtained the transitions as part of an investigation of zzso solutions of zzso zzso Our contribution is to give a more down-to-earth approach, bringing this work to the attention of the computer vision community, and to provide explicit constructions for the various transitions using simple zzso We believe that the zzso of these transitions is vital to the successful zzso of the zzso axis in its use in real zzso
