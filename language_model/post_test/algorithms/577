The structural and functional organization of the human zzso zzso is an ongoing zzso however, human imaging studies continue to use the zzso zzso concept of a two region zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso model was proposed based on zzso circuitry, and functional imaging zzso It encompasses the anterior cingulate, zzso zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the first time, this study performs zzso zzso of 15 neurotransmitter zzso zzso and zzso statistics on human whole brain zzso samples covering the entire zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso of zzso duality concept and of the zzso model using a zzso zzso analysis of zzso binding according to the degree of similarity of each area's zzso zzso We could not find support for zzso dual zzso concept, because the anterior part of his area 24 has significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but lower zzso and zzso binding site zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis distinguished zzso zzso zzso and zzso as independent zzso The zzso has highest zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but lowest zzso zzso The zzso has lowest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Area 25 in zzso is similar in zzso to zzso particularly the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso differ in the higher zzso and zzso but lower zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso supports the zzso zzso model of the zzso zzso
