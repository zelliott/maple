zzso of brain functioning requires the investigation of activated cortical networks, in particular the detection of interactions between different cortical zzso zzso zzso and correlation are used to describe zzso between zzso zzso However, on this basis, no statements on causality or the direction of their zzso are zzso zzso between two signals may be expressed in terms of upgrading the predictability of one signal by the knowledge of the immediate past of the other zzso The best-established approach in this context is the so-called zzso zzso The classical zzso of zzso causality requires the zzso of the zzso In this way, transient pathways of information transfer stay zzso The study presents an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrate the usefulness of the zzso zzso causality for detecting dynamic zzso relations within time intervals of less than 100 zzso The zzso zzso causality is applied to zzso data from the zzso zzso It was shown that conflict situations generate dense zzso of interactions directed from zzso to anterior cortical zzso The web of directed interactions occurs mainly 400 zzso after the stimulus onset and lasts up to the end of the zzso
