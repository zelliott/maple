zzso zzso have recently emerged as significant human zzso Identification of these species is important, both for zzso purposes and for patient management, but conventional identification based on zzso traits is hindered by major zzso zzso In this study, 62 zzso or zzso belonging to nine zzso species were subjected to both molecular identification zzso gene sequencing and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso Following stringent zzso the zzso method appeared to be both zzso and zzso Mass spectral analysis by comparison with a database, built in this study, of the most frequently isolated species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correctly identified 57 zzso As expected, the four species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not represented in the database were not zzso zzso from mass zzso and molecular identification agreed in five of the six cases in which results from zzso and molecular identification were not in zzso zzso yielded results within 1 zzso making it a valuable tool for identifying clinical zzso zzso at the species zzso zzso species must now be added to the zzso zzso may also prove useful for identifying other clinically important zzso
