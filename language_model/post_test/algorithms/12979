Many zzso novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with zzso and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza zzso zzso is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained zzso zzso Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial zzso within the human zzso We present zzso expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence zzso Furthermore, we derive general zzso results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak zzso We compare our zzso results with a zzso model, which has previously been studied zzso Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial zzso has only a weak effect on outbreak size zzso and on the risk of emergence per zzso For example, if zzso zzso zzso or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, zzso just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size zzso We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well zzso For plausible zzso zzso the effects of spatial zzso are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host zzso We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging zzso
