Our previous kinetic analyses have shown that the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso differs from that involved in its zzso zzso Although organic zzso transporting zzso are now known to be responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso mechanism has not been clarified zzso In the present study, the involvement of rat organic zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso indicates the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells exhibited specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 60 zzso for zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in kidney slices with zzso values of 69 and 11 zzso zzso The difference in the potency of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by kidney slices suggests that different zzso are responsible for their zzso zzso This was also supported by the difference in the degree of zzso by zzso a relatively selective inhibitor of zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso by kidney zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are mainly responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
