Although public reporting of hospital and physician performance is a cornerstone of the effort to improve health care quality, the optimal approach to risk adjustment is zzso 

We sought to assess hospital quality using a matching zzso based on a generalized distance metric and to compare this approach to the more traditional zzso zzso zzso DATA zzso This was a retrospective study using the New York State zzso zzso zzso zzso Surgery Reporting System zzso focusing on all patients undergoing isolated zzso surgery in NYS who were discharged in 1999 zzso zzso Patients from specific hospital were matched to a control group using the zzso zzso The hospitals' expected mortality rate was calculated in 2 ways: zzso as the mortality rate of the control group or zzso as the mortality rate predicted by the NYS zzso zzso zzso whose observed mortality rate was significantly different from their expected mortality rate zzso zzso were defined as quality zzso 

The 2 zzso zzso disagreed on the zzso status of 4 of the 33 zzso Kappa analysis demonstrated substantial agreement between these 2 methods for identifying quality zzso zzso zzso zzso There was excellent agreement between the point estimates of the zzso difference obtained using these 2 risk adjustment zzso 

Basing outcome assessment on either matching or zzso modeling yielded similar findings on hospital ranking but only moderate level of agreement on hospital zzso The use of matching may enhance the transparency and acceptance of outcome report cards by hospitals and zzso
