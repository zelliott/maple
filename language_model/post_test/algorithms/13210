zzso imaging zzso and the introduction of the zzso incoherent motion zzso model have provided a unique method for evaluating zzso and diffusion within a tissue without the need for a contrast zzso Despite its zzso cardiac zzso has thus far been limited by low b values because of signal loss induced by zzso zzso The goal of this study was to develop a methodology for zzso zzso parameters of in zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using an efficient zzso acquisition zzso This was achieved by investigating various acquisition strategies zzso component analysis zzso filtering and zzso maximum intensity projection zzso and single trigger delay zzso and fitting zzso 

zzso were performed on a synthetic zzso of zzso signal intensity zzso to determine the fitting method that would yield zzso parameters with the greatest zzso The required number of b values to correctly estimate zzso parameters was also zzso zzso zzso scans were performed for 12 volunteers to collect several TD values during zzso Thirteen b values ranging from 0 to 550 zzso were zzso The zzso parameters derived using the data from all the acquired zzso zzso zzso were compared with those derived using a single acquisition performed at an zzso zzso time point zzso 

The main result of this study was that zzso when combined with a fitting model that accounted for zzso and zzso relaxation, provided zzso parameters with less zzso However, an acquisition performed with 1 zzso zzso TD provided results that were as good as those provided using zzso if the zzso zzso during the acquisition was sufficiently low zzso zzso Furthermore, the use of only 9 b values zzso could be acquired in 2 zzso instead of 13 b values zzso 3 zzso was sufficient to determine the zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso is technically feasible in zzso and reports for the first time the zzso zzso zzso and the diffusion zzso D and zzso for the cardiac zzso of healthy zzso zzso signal loss, which is the main problem associated with cardiac zzso could be avoided with the combined use of sliding acquisition during the cardiac cycle and image zzso with the zzso zzso This study provides new perspectives for zzso imaging without a contrast agent and demonstrates that zzso parameters can act as promising tools to further characterize zzso abnormalities or zzso
