We developed a new zzso surgical simulation system able to predict both zzso correction and zzso repositioning in three zzso This system uniquely zzso the real motion of the dental cast model with the virtual motion of the reconstructed zzso zzso The skeletal change of the zzso zzso is simulated on the PC monitor while the zzso change is confirmed by checking the cast model on the zzso The simulation process is easily repeated and the operator can make several attempts to determine the final zzso zzso The zzso relationship at the simulated zzso posture is registered and the zzso zzso zzso which ensures zzso zzso is zzso on the zzso This surgical simulation system appears to satisfy clinical demands well and is an important zzso of communication between zzso and zzso Here, we outline the system and apply it to a demonstration case of zzso zzso
