Severe zzso in humans may be related to an underlying profound immune zzso zzso We investigated the link between gene expression of immune regulatory zzso and the range of illness severity in patients with infection and severe zzso 

A prospective zzso study included 54 zzso patients with severe zzso 53 patients with infection without organ failure, and 20 healthy zzso Gene expression in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso was measured using real-time zzso chain zzso 

zzso differed from health by decreased expression of the zzso and zzso and greater expression of zzso and zzso Severe zzso differed from infection by having decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso , and zzso zzso gene zzso An zzso zzso zzso copy number for zzso zzso , zzso zzso , zzso zzso and zzso accurately distinguished zzso from severe zzso with a receiver operator characteristic value of zzso Gene expression was similar with zzso and zzso infection and was similar following medical and surgical severe zzso zzso of organ failure was associated with serum zzso protein levels but not with any index of zzso gene expression in zzso 

zzso regulatory zzso gene expression in zzso provides a robust method of zzso patients' response to zzso
