Modeling by zzso is the most accurate zzso method for translating an zzso acid sequence into a protein zzso zzso modeling can be divided into two zzso placing the zzso backbone and adding zzso We present a method for rapidly predicting the zzso of protein zzso starting from zzso coordinates zzso The method involves using fewer than ten zzso per zzso from a zzso zzso library and a search to remove zzso zzso The method is initially tested on 299 high resolution crystal structures by rebuilding zzso onto the zzso determined backbone zzso A total of zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso + 2) zzso angles are predicted within 40 degrees of their crystal structure zzso We then tested the method on the entire database of known structures in the zzso Data zzso The zzso accuracy of the zzso was strongly correlated with the resolution of the zzso In an effort to simulate a realistic zzso modeling problem, zzso zzso models were created using three different modeling zzso For prediction purposes, pairs of structures were identified which shared between zzso and zzso sequence zzso One strategy results in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso + 2) zzso angles predicted within 40 degrees of the target crystal structure values, suggesting that movements of the backbone associated with this degree of sequence identity are not large enough to disrupt the zzso ability of our method for non-native zzso These results compared favorably with existing methods over a comprehensive data zzso
