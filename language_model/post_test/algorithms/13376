There is increasing interest in the contribution of the quality of nursing care to patient zzso Due to different zzso and risk profiles, zzso for administrative health data that identify zzso outcomes in adult zzso patients may not be zzso to zzso zzso The study purpose was to test adult zzso in a zzso hospital population and make amendments to increase the accuracy of identification of hospital acquired zzso The study also aimed to determine whether the use of linked hospital records improved the likelihood of correctly identifying patient outcomes as nursing sensitive rather than being related to their zzso zzso 

Using zzso developed by zzso et zzso (2001), proportions and rates of records that identified zzso outcomes for pressure ulcers, pneumonia and surgical wound infections were determined from administrative zzso data for all zzso patients discharged from a zzso zzso hospital in Western Australia between July 1999 and June zzso The effects of changes to inclusion and exclusion criteria for each zzso on the calculated proportion or rate in the zzso population were zzso Linked records were used to identify zzso conditions that increased zzso outcome zzso Rates were calculated using zzso revised for zzso zzso 

Linked records of zzso hospital zzso for zzso children were zzso Identification of zzso conditions was enhanced through access to prior and/or subsequent zzso records zzso of children with pressure zzso had a form of paralysis recorded only on a previous zzso zzso with a surgical wound infection were identified for 103 zzso surgical zzso using linked zzso After amendment of each zzso for zzso patients, rates of pressure zzso and pneumonia reduced by zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso per 10,000 patient zzso respectively, and an zzso increase in the proportion of surgical wound infection (from zzso to zzso per 1,000 zzso 

zzso for zzso outcomes used in adult populations have to be amended before application to zzso zzso Using zzso individual zzso records to estimate rates of zzso outcomes is likely to result in inaccurate zzso
