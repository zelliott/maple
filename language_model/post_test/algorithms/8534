zzso disorder zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by significant disturbances in social, zzso and behavioral zzso A zzso zzso screen analysis of 99 families with zzso revealed suggestive evidence for linkage to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso at 198 zzso In addition, analysis of linkage zzso for zzso showed an zzso P value of zzso Recently, linkage to the same region of zzso was reported in an independent zzso zzso This evidence for linkage increased when analysis was restricted to the subset of patients with zzso who had delayed onset zzso zzso of phrase speech zzso We similarly classified our data set of 82 zzso pairs with zzso identifying 45 families with zzso and zzso Analysis of this zzso subset increased our support for linkage to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for marker zzso These data support evidence for a gene on zzso 2 contributing to risk of zzso and they suggest that zzso zzso increases the power to find zzso genes for zzso
