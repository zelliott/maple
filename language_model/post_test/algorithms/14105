zzso between zzso zzso make possible zzso explorations of physical mechanisms that can contribute to protein and zzso organization at a variety of zzso zzso Recent studies of mobile zzso sandwiched between zzso zzso zzso have shown that strong zzso zzso and protein mobility alone are sufficient to drive zzso proteins into zzso patterns of dense and sparse zzso Though the length scale of these patterns was suspected to be related to membrane zzso a quantitative understanding has so far been zzso We introduce data showing zzso structured protein patterns that also demonstrate zzso zzso We then provide a simple model that relates the spectrum of membrane fluctuations to the observed protein zzso in brief, only membrane modes that are slow enough to couple to the protein mobility drive zzso protein zzso
