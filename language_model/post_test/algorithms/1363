The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso effects of endurance training on zzso function in athletes with spectral analysis of cardiovascular zzso zzso Continuous zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and respiratory signals were recorded from 15 athletes zzso zzso 55 zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso during 10 zzso at sitting zzso zzso function was assessed by low frequency power zzso zzso zzso zzso and high frequency power zzso zzso the region of the respiratory frequency based on respiratory zzso obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso and zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso The spontaneous zzso sensitivity was evaluated by the zzso zzso and zzso of the transfer function between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The resting zzso in athletes was significantly lower than that in zzso The zzso power, an index of zzso activity, in zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in athletes than in zzso Meanwhile, the zzso power (an indicator of sympathetic activities contributing to zzso zzso and of zzso zzso showed no significant difference between both groups, although that of athletes was slightly less than that of zzso Also, zzso and zzso were not significantly different between athletes and zzso These results indicate that endurance training results in the enhanced zzso activities in athletes, which may contribute in part to the resting zzso
