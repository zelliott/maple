Due to zzso demand, elements of genetic correlation zzso may have been estimated separately and then combined together into a single correlation zzso at a later zzso Because these zzso should be positive zzso zzso a statistical method commonly known as zzso is used to make them positive zzso The conventional zzso method ignores the reliability of different correlations and may subject any of them to change in order to make a positive zzso correlation zzso A simple method to obtain a weighted zzso zzso to be used in animal breeding applications is proposed, and the zzso of the method is demonstrated by an zzso
