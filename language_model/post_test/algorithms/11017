zzso onset detection with minimum zzso has a key role in improving the therapy studies of zzso In this article, an zzso seizure onset detection zzso based on general zzso zzso analysis is proposed to detect the seizure through zzso signals with smallest delay before the development of clinical zzso In this algorithm, seizure and zzso zzso signal epochs are exhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Then, to reduce feature space, projection zzso are extracted from zzso zzso signal by general zzso zzso zzso In this strategy, the zzso information in the training zzso is preserved that it is a benefit in comparison with common feature space reduction zzso such as principal component analysis and zzso zzso zzso The proposed seizure onset detection zzso is evaluated on 44 zzso patients from 2 standard zzso and recognizes zzso of zzso with average delay of zzso zzso The obtained results show efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed zzso in comparison with other zzso
