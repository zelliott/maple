We have compared the pacing rate responses during zzso exercise testing in 11 patients zzso 59 years, six zzso with implanted zzso sensing rate zzso zzso who were randomly programmed to zzso periods in the linear and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Exercise testing was performed at the end of each month block and symptoms were scored with the zzso zzso With exercise, the time to a 10 zzso zzso in rate was significantly less with the zzso compared to the linear zzso zzso zzso vs 255 zzso P zzso zzso but there were no significant differences in exercise zzso the peak pacing rate, the peak zzso the zzso at the zzso threshold or the mean correlation zzso of the pacing rate zzso zzso Rate zzso occurred in seven patients in the linear zzso and in two patients in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pacing rate at the onset of exercise occurred in seven patients in the linear zzso and in four patients in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is associated with a faster response time during exercise and fewer instances of rate zzso However, it has not overcome the problem of a dip in the pacing rate at the beginning of zzso The major difference in the function of the two zzso is faster initial acceleration with the zzso zzso This is explained by the significantly higher values of the slope setting at the lower rate limit for the zzso versus the linear zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso
