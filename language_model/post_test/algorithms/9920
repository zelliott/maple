The aim of this preliminary study performed on volunteers was to assess whether a standardized zzso measurement of the gastric zzso zzso area in a single section of the stomach could discriminate between gastric contents after 12 h zzso zzso zzso and gastric contents 2 h after zzso of zzso liquids or a solid zzso 

In this crossover study, zzso zzso of the zzso area were performed in the morning in healthy volunteers in three situations in zzso order: after 12 h zzso 2 h after a solid meal of 300 zzso and 2 h after zzso of 200 zzso of zzso zzso These zzso were performed by a physician blinded to the zzso status, according to a standardized method, using the abdominal zzso and the left lobe of the liver as internal zzso zzso areas were compared among the three sessions, and performance of the test was assessed by plotting receiver operating characteristic zzso and calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso for the diagnosis of zzso gastric zzso 

Twenty-two volunteers were included, and 65 measures were zzso zzso area was significantly smaller in zzso than in zzso zzso The receiver operating characteristic zzso showed an excellent performance of zzso measurement of zzso area for discriminating gastric contents in zzso session from gastric contents in zzso zzso 

zzso of this preliminary study should be zzso in further zzso However, one can suppose that zzso measurement of the zzso zzso area could be of interest for the diagnosis of zzso gastric zzso
