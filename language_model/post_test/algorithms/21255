zzso zzso was previously shown to accelerate the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso III zzso primarily by promoting the initial binding of zzso and AT in a zzso zzso complex intermediate without significantly influencing the subsequent product formation step zzso zzso zzso and Shore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso interactions which contribute to the assembly of the zzso complex intermediate and their linkage were zzso by equilibrium binding and zzso kinetic studies at pH zzso I zzso 25 degrees C, using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso binding studies of the zzso and zzso zzso complex interactions monitored by the zzso enhancement in AT zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso fluorescence, respectively, indicated a zzso greater affinity of AT for zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this large difference in zzso rapid kinetic studies indicated that assembly of the zzso complex occurred predominantly as a zzso association between the zzso zzso complex and free zzso Thus, under zzso order conditions zzso zzso much greater than zzso much less than zzso the observed zzso zzso rate constant zzso exhibited a zzso dependence on zzso or zzso when zzso much less than zzso reflecting a zzso zzso zzso similar to that directly determined by equilibrium zzso Moreover, competitive zzso of the reaction by zzso zzso complexes was indicated from the zzso decrease in zzso produced by zzso with either high or low affinity for AT or zzso blocked zzso at zzso comparable to zzso This behavior was consistent with values of zzso zzso zzso similar to those determined directly from equilibrium binding zzso zzso of the affinities of the zzso zzso interactions with the affinity of zzso for zzso complex in the zzso complex measured zzso indicated that the affinity of either protein for zzso was enhanced about zzso by the prior binding of the other protein to zzso This linkage of the zzso interactions implies that the zzso complex will be assembled at zzso zzso and zzso zzso considerably lower than those predicted from previous reaction models which fail to account for this zzso
