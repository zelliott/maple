The precision of zzso zzso zzso zzso depends certainly upon the way we choose to align zzso and to get zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso based on assigning automatically the required number of zzso along with applying a proper zzso alignment approach is the purpose of this zzso The structure of the proposed method mainly consists of seven zzso zzso zzso events zzso alignment of cycles, zzso template zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by getting feedback from zzso quality zzso The proposed method is examined in two zzso First, some artificially generated zzso with zzso zzso patterns and qualities are analyzed in order to regulate the parameters of the method to achieve the maximum zzso Finally, the method is applied to zzso in zzso Challenge 2008 zzso In this stage, the achieved accuracy is about zzso zzso which shows marginal improvement in the area of zzso zzso
