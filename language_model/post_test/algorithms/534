zzso energy zzso electricity from people during daily zzso a promising alternative to batteries for powering increasingly sophisticated portable zzso We recently developed a zzso zzso energy harvesting device that generated electricity during human zzso In this zzso paper, we explain the zzso principles that guided our design process and present a detailed description of our device design with an emphasis on new zzso 

zzso harvesting energy from walking requires a small lightweight device that efficiently converts zzso zzso low speed and high zzso mechanical power to electricity, and selectively engages power generation to assist muscles in performing negative mechanical zzso To achieve this, our device used a one-way clutch to transmit only knee extension motions, a spur gear transmission to amplify the angular speed, a zzso DC rotary magnetic generator to convert the mechanical power into electrical power, a control system to determine when to open and close the power generation circuit based on zzso of knee angle, and a customized zzso knee brace to distribute the device reaction zzso over a large leg surface zzso 

The device selectively engaged power generation towards the end of swing extension, assisting knee zzso muscles by producing substantial zzso zzso zzso zzso and efficiently converted the input mechanical power into electricity zzso zzso six subjects walking at zzso zzso generated zzso zzso zzso W of electrical power with only a zzso zzso 21 W increase in zzso zzso 

zzso energy harvesting is capable of generating substantial amounts of electrical power from walking with little additional user effort making future versions of this technology particularly promising for charging portable medical zzso
