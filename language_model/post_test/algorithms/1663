zzso chemical reaction systems are frequently used in zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso systems are often large zzso of tens or even hundreds of ordinary differential zzso and poorly zzso zzso to noisy measurement data and a small number of data points and zzso zzso it is often difficult to establish the existence of zzso steady states or to determine whether more complicated phenomena such as zzso zzso If, however, the steady state ideal of the system is a zzso ideal, then we show that these questions can be answered zzso The focus of this work is on systems with this property, and we say that such systems have zzso steady zzso Our main result gives sufficient conditions for a chemical reaction system to have zzso steady zzso Furthermore, we analyze the capacity of such a system to exhibit positive steady states and zzso Examples of systems with zzso steady states include zzso zzso chemical reaction zzso An important application of our work concerns the networks that describe the zzso zzso of a protein by a zzso pair in a sequential and zzso zzso
