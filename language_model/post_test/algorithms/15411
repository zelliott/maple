We investigated the extent of zzso ventilation zzso contributing to the observed lung clearance index values in adult zzso zzso patients, as the result of two simulated scenarios, either 1) a fixed part of the lungs becoming increasingly less zzso or 2) an increasingly greater part of the lung being less zzso In 25 zzso zzso patients and 25 matched controls, we zzso the lung clearance index and also zzso zzso of the zzso concentration curve, where zzso is equal to 0 zzso in zzso zzso reflects homogeneous ventilation and zzso equal to 1 zzso to the presence of an zzso slowly zzso lung zzso In the zzso zzso group zzso zzso volume in 1 s zzso zzso lung clearance index and zzso zzso values were zzso and zzso respectively, and were significantly different from control values zzso and zzso both zzso lung clearance index and zzso were also correlated (R zzso zzso zzso The average zzso value in the zzso zzso group was found to be compatible with a cumulative volume of zzso lung of zzso depending on the simulation scenario zzso The degree of zzso zzso observed here indicates that a major zzso of the abnormal lung clearance index values observed in adult zzso zzso patients is ventilation zzso generated between zzso lung units, while the remainder of lung clearance index zzso with respect to normal controls potentially represents the small airways within these lung zzso
