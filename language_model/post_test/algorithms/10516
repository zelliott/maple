zzso neck zzso zzso is an important zzso factor in zzso zzso We developed a scoring system for use in prediction of lateral neck zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso In this study, 161 consecutive patients were included in the training data zzso This scoring system, named the zzso zzso Value zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer, was developed on the basis of results from zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso clinical and zzso zzso Sixty eight consecutive patients were included for testing of the zzso of the scoring zzso The equation for prediction of lateral neck zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso or more, the probability of lateral neck zzso zzso was zzso with sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso in the training zzso When fine needle aspiration biopsy for suspicious lateral neck zzso is not possible, or the results are zzso our scoring system for prediction of lateral neck zzso zzso can be helpful in zzso of the surgical extent for each zzso
