zzso control zzso have received increased attention during the last zzso These zzso increasingly use signals coming directly from humans since there is a strong necessity for simple and natural control zzso In this paper, zzso zzso signals from the muscles of the human upper limb are used as the control interface between the user and a robot zzso A switching regime model is used to decode the zzso activity of 11 muscles to a continuous representation of arm motion in the 3-D zzso The switching regime model is used to overcome the main difficulties of the zzso control systems, zzso the zzso of the relationship between the zzso recordings and the arm motion, as well as the zzso of zzso signals with respect to zzso The proposed interface allows the user to control in real time an zzso robot arm in the 3-D zzso The efficiency of the method is assessed through real-time experiments of four persons performing random arm zzso
