zzso interaction zzso zzso is commonly used to separate protein zzso and zzso species in the zzso of protein zzso Despite being used zzso the zzso separation mechanism is quite complex and not well zzso In this paper, we examined the separation of a zzso and zzso protein mixture using zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms of protein zzso zzso and diffusion of the two species were evaluated using several experimental approaches to determine which processes controlled the zzso A zzso model, which used homogeneous diffusion (to describe mass zzso and a competitive zzso zzso zzso (to describe protein zzso and zzso was formulated and used to predict the separation of the zzso and zzso zzso The experimental studies showed a fraction of the zzso species bound zzso to the zzso which was a major factor governing the separation of the zzso The model predictions showed inclusion of irreversible binding in the zzso mechanism greatly improved the model predictions over a range of operating zzso The model successfully predicted the separation performance of the zzso with the examined zzso
