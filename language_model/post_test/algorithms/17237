In a previous publication we showed that zzso analysis can extract zzso changes of brain electrical activity prior to zzso zzso Here we describe a new method to analyze this long-term zzso in the zzso by a measure of zzso similarity between different parts of the time zzso We apply this method to the study of a group of patients with zzso lobe zzso recorded zzso during transitions to zzso We show that the method, which can be implemented on a personal computer, can track in real time zzso changes in brain dynamics several minutes prior to zzso
