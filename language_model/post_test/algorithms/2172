The authors assessed the impact of zzso dissection on zzso systemic therapy recommendations in patients with breast zzso 

With increasing use of systemic therapy in zzso women and the desire to reduce treatment morbidity and cost, the need for zzso dissection in clinically zzso patients with breast cancer has been zzso 

Two hundred zzso women with clinically negative zzso were analyzed using a model treatment zzso zzso therapy was assigned with and without data from zzso zzso Treatment shifts based on zzso dissection data were zzso 

zzso percent of clinically zzso women had zzso positive zzso Eight percent of zzso and zzso of zzso tumors had positive zzso and would have been zzso without zzso zzso Seven percent of zzso women with tumors zzso 1 zzso and zzso with tumors zzso or zzso 1 zzso had treatment changed by zzso zzso For women 50 to 60 years of age, zzso with tumors zzso 1 zzso zzso with tumors 1 to 2 zzso with positive zzso features, and zzso with poor zzso features had significant treatment shifts after zzso zzso For clinically zzso women older than 60 years of age not eligible for chemotherapy, only zzso of those with tumors zzso 1 zzso and none of those with tumors zzso or zzso 1 zzso had their treatment changed by findings at zzso zzso Treatment shifts based on zzso dissection were larger if the treatment zzso allowed for more varied or more aggressive treatment zzso 

Data obtained from zzso dissection will alter zzso systemic therapy regimen in a significant number of clinically zzso women younger than 60 years of age and for older women eligible to receive zzso
