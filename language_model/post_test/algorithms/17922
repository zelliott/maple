The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of diffusion zzso imaging zzso of the prostate and to determine zzso fractional zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso values of healthy prostate with a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Thirty volunteers with a mean age of 28 zzso years were scanned with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Philips, The zzso system using a zzso phased array zzso Initially, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the prostate were zzso In two subjects, a zzso zzso signal change was detected in the peripheral zones on zzso zzso zzso These two subjects were excluded from the zzso zzso with zzso zzso imaging zzso was performed in the remaining 28 zzso zzso and zzso values were measured using the manufacturer supplied software by positioning zzso zzso on each zzso zzso between parameters of the central and peripheral zones were zzso Mean zzso value of the central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly lower when compared with the peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso of the central zzso was significantly higher zzso compared with the peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study shows the feasibility of prostate zzso with a zzso MR system and the zzso zzso and zzso values of peripheral and central zones of the normal zzso The results are compatible with the zzso organization of the zzso
