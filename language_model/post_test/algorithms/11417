The goal of this study was to examine and predict zzso zzso Although zzso peptides hold great potential in zzso drug discovery, little is done in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that a zzso model using random forests outperform in distinguishing zzso zzso On the experimental zzso our zzso model aided with zzso and secondary structural features reaches zzso accuracy and zzso zzso correlation zzso which exceeds the previous zzso The results suggest that zzso could be an important feature for identifying zzso zzso In addition, our analysis reveals the characteristics of the zzso peptides such as the importance of zzso and the abundance of zzso secondary zzso
