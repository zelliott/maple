zzso chemical reactions are common in biological systems and they also occur in artificial zzso zzso Generally, these reactions are subject to random fluctuations in environmental conditions which translate into fluctuations in the values of physical zzso for example, zzso We formulate a mathematical model for a zzso minimal chemical zzso containing a single negative feedback loop and study zzso the effects of zzso fluctuations in temperature in the absence of any deterministic limit cycle or periodic zzso We show that noise in temperature can induce sustained limit cycle zzso with a relatively narrow frequency distribution and some characteristic zzso These properties differ significantly depending on the noise zzso Here, we have explored white and colored zzso zzso A plot of the characteristic frequency of the noise induced zzso as a function of the correlation zzso shows a zzso therefore indicating the existence of autonomous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
