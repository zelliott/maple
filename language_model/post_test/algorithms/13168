We demonstrate that zzso embedded on surfaces are a powerful and practical tool to zzso to zzso and to simulate networks with a broad range of zzso Any network can be embedded on a surface with sufficiently high zzso and therefore the study of zzso embedded zzso is zzso We show that the local properties of the network are affected by the surface zzso which determines the average degree, which influences the degree distribution, and which controls the zzso zzso The global properties of the graph are also strongly affected by the surface zzso which is constraining the degree of zzso changing the zzso properties of the network from zzso kind zzso zzso to small- and zzso kind zzso zzso Two elementary moves allow the exploration of all networks zzso on a given surface and naturally introduce a tool to develop a statistical mechanics description for these zzso Within such a zzso we study the properties of zzso embedded zzso which zzso tend to lower their energy towards a ground state with a given reference degree zzso We show that the cooling dynamics between high and low zzso is strongly affected by the surface zzso with the manifestation of a zzso transition occurring when the distance from the reference distribution is zzso We zzso with examples, that zzso embedded zzso can be built in a way to contain arbitrary complex networks as zzso This method opens a new avenue to build zzso embedded networks on zzso zzso
