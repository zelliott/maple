To investigate the effect of the zzso of zzso on target registration error zzso and test the accuracy of theoretical model of zzso prediction in zzso zzso zzso 

A skull zzso was prepared with 20 titanium zzso placed at defined locations and scanned with a zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso These markers were separated into a registration zzso group and a target zzso zzso An optical tracking system was used to perform zzso registration zzso zzso to each zzso the zzso was calculated by the navigation zzso Each zzso registration was performed 50 times and the average was regarded as zzso of the zzso The zzso prediction was also calculated for each zzso 

The zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Relatively smaller values of zzso may be achieved by placing a majority of zzso on the zzso zzso in proximity to the target and placing a small number on the zzso zzso The zzso values are always larger than the corresponding zzso prediction but there is a high correlation between zzso 

The zzso of zzso is an important factor in minimizing zzso and the zzso prediction is a good guide for zzso marker zzso
