zzso hollow cylinder zzso magnets of a low or relatively low aspect ratio attract considerable attention due to their applications, among others, in compact zzso and zzso systems for investigating small zzso However, a complete mathematical framework for the analysis of magnetic fields in these magnets has been developed only for their infinitely long zzso In such a case the analysis is reduced to zzso zzso The paper details the analysis of the zzso magnetic field in the zzso zzso zzso of a finite zzso The analysis is based on three equations in which the components of the magnetic flux density zzso By and zzso are expanded to infinite power series of the zzso coordinate zzso The zzso term in the series zzso to a homogeneous magnetic field zzso which is zzso by the higher order terms due to a finite magnet zzso This set of equations is supplemented with an equation for the field profile zzso along the magnet zzso presented for the first zzso It is demonstrated that the geometrical factors in the zzso of particular powers of zzso defined by intricate zzso are the zzso of the Taylor expansion of the zzso profile zzso As a consequence, the components of B can be easily calculated with an arbitrary zzso In order to describe zzso of the field due to zzso two additional equations are borrowed from the zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso approach to the zzso generated by the zzso can be applied to the zzso zzso structures unless r is not too close to the inner radius of the cylinder zzso The mathematical framework presented in the paper was verified with great precision by zzso of B by a highly accurate integration of the zzso zzso law and zzso to analyze the zzso of the magnetic field in the magnet with the accuracy better than 1 zzso
