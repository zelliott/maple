In this paper, we present a new zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso surface zzso The model zzso under defined force zzso Internal forces are calculated from local model zzso using a robust method by a zzso error zzso approximation to the zzso zzso External forces are calculated by applying a step expansion and restoration filter zzso to the image zzso A solution for one of the most common problems associated with zzso models, zzso has been proposed in this zzso We use a principal axis analysis and zzso of the zzso model, followed by zzso of the zzso to remedy zzso We use zzso zzso zzso zzso and refinement of the mesh grid to improve the quality of the model zzso which leads to better zzso Examples of the model application to different cases zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso computerized zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso are zzso showing diversity and flexibility of the zzso
