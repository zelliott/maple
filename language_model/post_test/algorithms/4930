The zzso Impact zzso zzso is a commonly used instrument in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso Over the last 18 years, since the publication of the original zzso several deficiencies have become apparent and the cumbersome scoring zzso has been a barrier to widespread clinical zzso The aim of this paper is to describe and validate a revised version of the zzso the zzso 

The zzso was developed in response to known deficiencies of the zzso with the help of a patient focus zzso The zzso has the same 3 zzso as the zzso zzso is, function, overall impact and zzso It differs from the zzso in having modified function questions and the inclusion of questions on memory, zzso balance and environmental zzso All questions are graded on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was administered online and the results were compared to the same patient's online responses to the zzso Short Form Health zzso zzso and the original zzso

The zzso is an updated version of the zzso that has good zzso properties, can be completed in less than 2 minutes and is easy to zzso It has scoring characteristics comparable to the original zzso making it possible to compare past zzso results with future zzso zzso
