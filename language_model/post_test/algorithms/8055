In this paper we propose a novel hybrid three-dimensional zzso algorithm, which we refer to here as the three-dimensional zzso avoiding zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso combines the advantages and avoids the drawbacks of two well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso technique and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The hybrid technique presented here is more robust than its predecessors since it not only follows a discrete zzso path depending on a zzso quality map, but it also avoids any zzso zzso that may occur in the zzso zzso zzso and experimental results have shown that the proposed zzso zzso its parent techniques in terms of reliability and zzso
