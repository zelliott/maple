The large-scale sequencing of zzso cap enriched zzso promises to reveal the diversity of zzso initiation across entire zzso The process of zzso is zzso and there is often no single, exact start zzso This creates the need for a fast and simple method of identifying zzso start zzso based on this type of zzso Due to both biological and technical noise, many of the zzso seen are not real zzso initiation zzso zzso of the observed zzso is an essential filtering step in the discovery of genuine initiation zzso 

We develop a zzso approach consisting of a fast and simple zzso based on a sliding window with zzso zzso distribution for detecting the zzso locations of peaks, followed by a linear support zzso machine zzso to distinguish between zzso which represent the initiation of zzso and zzso that do zzso zzso of zzso performance to the best existing method based on whole zzso zzso showed comparable precision and improved zzso Internal features, which are intrinsic to the data and require no further experiments, had high precision and recall zzso zzso of pooled external data or matched zzso sequencing data resulted in gains of recall with equivalent zzso 

The zzso sliding window model is an effective and fast way of taking the peak zzso into account, and finding statistically significant zzso over a range of transcript expression zzso It is orders of magnitude faster than doing whole zzso zzso The support zzso zzso scheme has better precision and recall than existing zzso zzso additional zzso is shown to provide minor gains in recall, in comparison to using only the zzso zzso
