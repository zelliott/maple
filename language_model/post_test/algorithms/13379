zzso corresponding genes zzso in different species is an important step in zzso comparative zzso In particular, zzso zzso between genes in different species greatly simplify certain problems such as transfer of function zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are the direct descendants of a single ancestral gene in the most recent common zzso and by definition form zzso zzso 

In this work, we present a simple yet effective method zzso for the identification of zzso zzso from the comparative analysis of two zzso Our zzso method zzso sequence similarity and gene context similarity in order to get more accurate zzso zzso Specifically, zzso applies the zzso best hit zzso to a combination of sequence similarity and gene context similarity zzso 

We applied our method to the human, zzso and rat zzso and found that zzso produced the best results when using both sequence and gene context information zzso Compared to the state-of-the-art zzso such as zzso zzso is able to identify more zzso zzso with fewer false zzso
