A computer system, based on zzso PC, was designed for the zzso zzso model zzso The zzso pressure zzso zzso registered during the zzso infusion test is analyzed by means of the spectral analysis zzso in order to measure precisely the pulse wave zzso The zzso and the mean zzso level, calculated zzso within the period of about 8 seconds, are stored on the disk and form the basis for further model zzso Three different methods of identification were zzso They enable one to estimate the fundamental model zzso such zzso resistance to the zzso fluid zzso zzso index, baseline pressure, rate of formation of the zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the results of the infusion test analysis obtained by means of the system described in two groups of zzso patients zzso and zzso is zzso
