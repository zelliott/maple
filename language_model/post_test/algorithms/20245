In this paper a method of zzso data volume for left zzso zzso is zzso This method enables zzso discs to store the zzso with an equivalent recording density to that of HDTV zzso while preserving the quality of the original zzso The data volume of the zzso is compressed by zzso function and storing its zzso With this method, each zzso frame is first zzso into three zzso the inner part, the inner wall, and the background zzso a statistical method previously reported by the zzso Each region is then compressed by means of a difference operation and an zzso approximation with smooth zzso Performance is tested on 20 cases using actual zzso The specifications were verified for a spatial resolution of 1000 TV lines, a dynamic range of 60 zzso an zzso of 40 zzso zzso volume zzso to zzso of the original volume, and zzso zzso for decoding on a zzso zzso zzso
