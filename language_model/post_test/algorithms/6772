zzso fragmentation of zzso generated zzso in an zzso zzso traps can be problematic in many zzso Of special interest here is zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso trap external to a zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso zzso used in zzso zzso In this work, we identified the experimental parameters that determine the efficiency of zzso zzso We have found that under the pressure conditions used in this study there is a specific combination of the zzso and zzso potential well depths that determines the fragmentation zzso This combination of zzso and zzso fields appears to be universal for zzso of different zzso ratios, molecular zzso and charge zzso Such zzso allows the fragmentation efficiency of the trapped zzso in the course of zzso liquid zzso zzso separation studied to be controlled and can increase the useful duty cycle and dynamic range of a zzso mass zzso equipped with an external zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso
