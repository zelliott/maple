While zzso levels have found broad application throughout zzso they are also in much contention on zzso and empirical zzso Here, we use a new generation of data and theory to examine long-standing questions about zzso limits and degrees of zzso The data include food zzso of the zzso Bay, zzso the island of Saint Martin, a zzso zzso and a Florida zzso community, which appear to be the most zzso complete food zzso available in the primary literature due to their inclusion of zzso and zzso derived estimates of the relative energetic contributions of each zzso zzso We show that most zzso of the 212 species in the four food zzso can be zzso assigned to a discrete zzso zzso zzso among the remaining species appears to be quite zzso as judged by the standard zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This allows simple zzso based on zzso food zzso without energetic details to yield surprisingly accurate estimates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso While maximum zzso levels may zzso exceed historically asserted limits, our analyses contradict both recent empirical claims that these limits are exceeded and recent theoretical claims that rampant zzso eliminates the scientific utility of the zzso zzso
