The zzso of blood obtained by using a zzso zzso decreases with the time elapsed from the beginning of measurement until it reaches a constant value determined by the magnitude of zzso zzso It is not possible to obtain an initial value of zzso at time zzso zzso 0 that is considered to exhibit an intrinsic property of the fluid by this zzso zzso we devised a new method by which one can obtain the zzso of various zzso that are not affected by both the time elapsed from the beginning of measurement and the magnitude of zzso rate by considering the balance of the forces acting on a solid zzso particle freely falling in a zzso viscous zzso By using the new method, we studied the zzso behavior of corn zzso zzso zzso and human zzso and compared the results with those obtained with a zzso zzso It was found that in the case of corn zzso and washed red cell suspensions in which no red cell zzso zzso was formed, the zzso obtained with the two different methods were almost the zzso In contrast to this, in the case of the whole blood in which massive zzso were formed, the zzso obtained with a zzso zzso was much larger than that obtained with a zzso zzso
