The linear free energy of solution zzso relationship zzso for compounds of different carbon atoms zzso in the same zzso series is expanded and modified to cover compounds with two different hydrocarbon side zzso The expanded equation is successfully used to predict the retention times zzso of standard zzso of long chain alcohols and fatty acids of different chain lengths in both zzso and zzso gas zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 125 predicted zzso values have a difference of less than zzso from the actual zzso and the highest difference is zzso Two different temperature zzso in zzso are zzso The expanded equation can be used to forecast the zzso of zzso with good zzso The highest difference is zzso and zzso for the temperature zzso of 2 degrees C and 4 degrees zzso zzso However, the increments in free energy per carbon atom zzso of the alcohol and acid are approximately equal but have slightly different temperature zzso zzso it is very difficult to separate zzso of different acid and alcohol chain length but with the same total carbon zzso Furthermore, the difference in temperature sensitivities for the acid and alcohol side chains renders them to be zzso zzso at different zzso
