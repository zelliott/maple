With zzso zzso we decompose a three-dimensional point spread function zzso zzso into two-dimensional zzso zzso and further into one-dimensional zzso zzso Based on the observation of the location zzso of a step edge under zzso we propose a zzso procedure to automatically establish the zzso function from a blurred edge zzso The ID zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso function, which is determined by zzso blurring a zzso function into a spread edge zzso A plastic solid ball zzso approximately 6 zzso is used to provide double-edged zzso functions along zzso passing through the ball zzso and zzso the reconstructed digital volume provides the blurred zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso system, we demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso By repositioning the ball phantom in the object support space, we measure the system's spatial zzso in terms of zzso zzso of the local zzso Specifically, we obtained the zzso for three specific locations at zzso 0, zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso and zzso 0, 40 zzso which are given by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
