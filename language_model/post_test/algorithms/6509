Assessment of clinic and site specific margins are essential for the effective use of three-dimensional and intensity modulated radiation zzso An electronic portal imaging device zzso based methodology is introduced which allows individual and population based zzso margins to be determined and compared with traditional margins prescribed during zzso This method was applied to a patient cohort receiving external beam head and neck zzso under an zzso approved zzso Although the full study involved the use of an zzso method to assess the impact of zzso simulation technique, zzso zzso and zzso surgical intervention on zzso and zzso variations of individual and zzso zzso margins, the focus of the paper is on the zzso As an zzso the methodology is zzso to examine the influence of two zzso devices, the zzso zzso mask and the zzso zzso neck shoulder zzso system on zzso Daily through port images were acquired for selected fields for each patient with an zzso To analyze these images, simulation films or digitally reconstructed zzso zzso were imported into the zzso zzso Up to five anatomical landmarks were identified and outlined by the zzso and up to three of these structures were matched for each reference zzso Once the individual based errors were zzso the patient results were grouped into populations by matched anatomical structures and zzso zzso The variation within the zzso was zzso by calculating the systematic and random errors zzso and zzso Individual patient margins were zzso as zzso times the zzso random error and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso for fields matched on skull and cervical structures, and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso margins ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso were calculated for the corresponding zzso field and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso for the zzso fields, zzso The reported zzso margins are comparable to a value zzso zzso based on traditional Mayo margins, but in some cases exceed the default values established in zzso Head and Neck zzso The data suggests that the zzso margins provide sufficient coverage for the majority of the zzso However, the zzso margins are excessive for some patients and insufficient for others, suggesting that a zzso of current treatment margins for individual patients is zzso Finally, this methodology provides direct evidence of treatment variation and thus can demonstrate with confidence, the superiority of one technique over zzso
