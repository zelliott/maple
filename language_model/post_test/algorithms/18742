zzso tissue methods to estimate zzso binding are not zzso to zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso because there is no suitable zzso reference zzso We evaluated a new method to estimate, without using zzso data or a zzso reference region, a zzso zzso called the zzso distribution volume, zzso using a region containing receptors as the input zzso zzso is defined as zzso zzso volume zzso zzso by zzso of the input zzso We used a zzso zzso reference tissue model zzso to generate zzso images of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso PET data of healthy aged subjects (10 with zzso zzso zzso zzso and nine without zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso By zzso kinetic analysis zzso with zzso plasma data, zzso was previously reported as higher in the zzso zzso The noise magnitude of zzso zzso and zzso images were nearly identical to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso was not different between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso were higher by 38 and zzso than those zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The statistical significance for zzso zzso was lower than that for zzso zzso due to the higher zzso zzso of zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso allows detection of group differences in zzso binding without zzso blood or a zzso reference zzso
