zzso model fitting essentially requires the application of two zzso The first is an zzso for the values of the model zzso The second is an zzso for the scale of the noise in the zzso zzso Indeed, we propose two novel robust zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Sample Consensus zzso zzso zzso applies zzso density zzso and density zzso zzso techniques, to robustly estimate the scale of the zzso The zzso zzso combines Random Sample Consensus zzso and zzso using a modified objective function that depends upon both the number of zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso is very robust to zzso signals and data with multiple structures, being able to tolerate more than 80 percent zzso The main advantage of zzso over zzso is that prior knowledge about the scale of zzso is not zzso zzso can simultaneously estimate the parameters of a model and the scale of the zzso belonging to that zzso zzso on synthetic data show that zzso has better zzso to heavily corrupted data than zzso Median zzso zzso zzso Consensus zzso and zzso zzso zzso order zzso zzso We also apply zzso to two fundamental computer vision tasks: range image zzso and robust fundamental zzso zzso zzso show very promising zzso
