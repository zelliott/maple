zzso structure and kinship are widespread zzso factors in zzso association studies zzso It has been standard practice to include principal components of the zzso in a zzso model in order to account for population zzso More recently, the linear mixed model zzso has emerged as a powerful method for simultaneously accounting for population structure and zzso The statistical theory underlying the differences in empirical performance between modeling principal components as fixed versus random effects has not been thoroughly zzso We undertake an analysis to formalize the relationship between these widely used methods and zzso the statistical properties of zzso Moreover, we introduce a new zzso effective degrees of freedom, that serves as a metric of model complexity and a novel low rank linear mixed model zzso to learn the zzso of the correction for population structure and zzso and we assess its performance through zzso A comparison of the results of zzso and a standard zzso analysis applied to zzso data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso illustrates how our theoretical results translate into empirical properties of the mixed zzso Finally, the analysis demonstrates the ability of the zzso to substantially boost the strength of an association for HDL cholesterol in zzso
