This article focuses on zzso zzso zzso that use either a common zzso learning rate for all weights or an individual zzso learning rate for each weight and apply the zzso line zzso The zzso adaptation is based on descent techniques and estimates of the local zzso constant that are obtained without additional error function and zzso zzso The proposed zzso improve the zzso training in terms of both convergence rate and convergence zzso such as stable learning and zzso to zzso zzso are conducted to compare and evaluate the convergence behavior of these zzso training zzso with several popular training zzso
