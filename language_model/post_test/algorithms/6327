A zzso zzso zzso featuring a narrow angular zzso is developed for zzso zzso imaging of blood zzso An integrated optical fiber enables zzso detection of zzso zzso By using the zzso between the signals detected by the two rings, the angular zzso of the sensor is reduced by a factor of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso images could be obtained in a manner analogous to the ultrasound zzso zzso Next, the cross section of artificial blood vessels is zzso by reconstruction of the absorbed energy zzso Finally, in zzso imaging and the subsequent reconstruction of the absorbed energy distribution is demonstrated for superficial blood vessels in the human zzso
