From experimental data on the zzso zzso of zzso acids obtained by differential scanning zzso under zzso conditions, zzso relaxation time zzso d and zzso zzso zzso occupied by water molecules in zzso shells of natural DNA and model zzso were zzso In addition, systems consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and water clusters of various sizes (from 20 to 400 water zzso were studied by zzso Carlo computer zzso It was shown that, as water content in systems increases, the dynamic characteristics of bound water obtained with both methods approached the values for bulk zzso
