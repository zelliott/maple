The time zzso method is the most basic tool for capturing a time dependent rate of zzso zzso Generally in the zzso literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the fit of the time zzso to the underlying spike rate has been zzso selected by individual zzso Here, we propose a method for zzso selecting the bin size from the spike count statistics alone, so that the resulting bar or line graph time zzso best represents the unknown underlying spike zzso For a small number of spike sequences generated from a modestly fluctuating rate, the optimal bin size may zzso indicating that any time zzso is likely to capture a zzso zzso Given a paucity of data, the method presented here can nevertheless suggest how many experimental trials should be added in order to obtain a meaningful zzso zzso with the required zzso
