The number of incident infections of syphilis and zzso have increased over the past decade across Australia, particularly among gay zzso In other zzso settings, syphilis zzso have also zzso coincidentally with increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso infections zzso are a biologically plausible zzso for increasing zzso zzso We pose the question: could strategies purely targeting syphilis also have an indirect impact on zzso zzso 

We developed an zzso computer model that simulates the transmission and disease progression of zzso and syphilis among a population of sexually active gay men, zzso to reflect the zzso in Victoria, zzso The model was informed by detailed zzso data from a variety of sources and was used to investigate the potential zzso impact of different public health zzso 

Assuming that syphilis could act as a biological zzso for zzso transmission, from no effect to increasing risk by zzso our model indicates that if Australia's syphilis action plan is effectively implemented then the number of zzso infections could decrease by up to zzso over the next decade in the absence of any specific zzso zzso 

It is plausible that effective zzso of interventions targeting syphilis zzso can have an indirect effect of zzso the spread of zzso The possible effects of zzso should be considered in the design, zzso and evaluation of public health strategies and zzso
