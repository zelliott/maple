zzso detection of airway obstruction in adults requires separate zzso zzso for each ethnicity and sex for percentage of zzso zzso and percentage of zzso zzso the major zzso for defining airway zzso 

To eliminate the need for multiple zzso for black, Latin, and white men and women by developing single zzso with less zzso than current zzso for zzso and zzso 

Data from nearly 6,000 healthy zzso zzso zzso of age in the Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso were reevaluated zzso and zzso based on the preliminary hypothesis that zzso normal zzso and zzso ratios could be calculated from the age and zzso alone, without considering ethnicity, sex, or zzso Current and new zzso were zzso first considering the population as consisting of 36 equally weighted zzso (6 decades zzso 3 zzso zzso 2 zzso and then weighting each individual zzso 

For each year of age, the slope of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso the slope of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso After trial and error zzso the optimal zzso were zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso years - zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso years - zzso zzso zzso 

These two new predicting zzso for zzso and zzso which require only age and zzso as zzso approximate actual values closer than previously published separate zzso for each ethnicity and zzso With zzso confidence limits, they should allow better discrimination between zzso and airway obstruction in adults of at least these three zzso
