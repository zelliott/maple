A novel digital zzso computer technique was developed to measure zzso wear after total hip zzso The new method zzso zzso the margins of the component by evaluating zzso of zzso intensity on digitized images of the zzso Compared with previous methods for measurement of wear, digital edge detection substantially reduces observer zzso The technique was validated directly by measuring wear artificially produced by zzso milling of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Under such conditions, digital edge detection proved zzso times more accurate and zzso times more zzso than manual measurement with conventional circular zzso In addition, clinical application of the new digital imaging technique was illustrated in a series of zzso patients in whom a zzso zzso cup had been inserted with zzso A zzso prediction zzso was invoked to estimate long-term wear zzso late rate of wear for the zzso zzso zzso per year at a mean of 118 months after the zzso on the basis of zzso of short-term wear zzso early rate of wear for the zzso zzso zzso per year at a mean of zzso zzso
