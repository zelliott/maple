We present a technique to solve zzso the zzso zzso integral by representing a given complex function as a finite zzso of complex zzso Once an accurate representation of these functions is zzso it is possible to find zzso its zzso zzso There are two useful consequences of this zzso first, the zzso results may be used for further theoretical studies and second, it may be used as a versatile and accurate zzso zzso zzso The use of the technique is illustrated by calculating the intensity distribution in a vicinity of the focal region of an zzso zzso zzso wave emerging from a circular zzso
