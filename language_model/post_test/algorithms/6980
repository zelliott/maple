Our intent was to evolve a zzso that would predict the likelihood that an electrical shock would restore a zzso zzso Such a zzso was to be based on conventional zzso signals but without constraints caused by artifacts resulting from zzso zzso The adverse effects of zzso zzso intervals for rhythm analyses would therefore be zzso Such a zzso was further intended to reduce the number of electrical shocks and the total energy delivered and thereby minimize zzso zzso zzso

zzso zzso was induced in an established zzso model of cardiac zzso zzso of zzso lead 2 over the frequency range of zzso zzso were zzso The area under the curve representing the zzso and frequency was defined as the zzso spectrum area zzso 

A derivation group of 55 animals yielded a threshold value of zzso that zzso predicted successful zzso A separate group of 10 animals, a validation group, confirmed that an zzso value of 21 zzso predicted restoration of zzso rhythm after 7 of 8 electrical shocks and failure of electrical conversion in 21 of 23 electrical shocks, yielding sensitivity and specificity of about zzso The negative zzso value of zzso was zzso and statistically equivalent to that of coronary zzso pressure, mean zzso and median zzso The positive zzso value that would prompt continuation of zzso resuscitation without interruption for an unsuccessful zzso attempt was greatly improved with zzso zzso as compared with coronary zzso pressure zzso mean zzso zzso and median frequency zzso 

zzso has the potential for guiding more optimal timing of zzso without adverse interruption of zzso resuscitation or the delivery of unsuccessful high energy electrical shocks that contribute to zzso zzso zzso
