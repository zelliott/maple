The performance of a new diagnostic test is frequently evaluated by comparison to a perfect reference test zzso a gold zzso In many instances, however, a reference test is less than zzso In this paper, we review methods for zzso of the accuracy of a diagnostic test when an imperfect reference test with known zzso errors is zzso Furthermore, we focus our presentation on available methods of zzso of test characteristics when the sensitivity and specificity of both tests are zzso We present some of the available statistical methods for zzso of the accuracy of diagnostic tests when a reference test does not exist (including maximum likelihood zzso and zzso zzso We illustrate the application of the described methods using data from an evaluation of a zzso zzso chain reaction and microscopic examination of kidney imprints for detection of zzso zzso in rainbow zzso
