With advance of age, zzso in bone quality, quantity and zzso render zzso zzso bone become more sensitive to local zzso The aims of the present study were to clarify the extent to which the distribution of zzso stresses and strains was affected by structural changes and the extent to which zzso zzso zzso bone was damaged at small zzso 

Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso analyses were performed to calculate the zzso strains and stresses for each element in the zzso bone of one zzso zzso at small strains to zzso the zzso damage zzso and mechanical zzso 

In zzso plots of the zzso maximum principal zzso zzso high zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were observed in the zzso zzso bone at small apparent strains from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso apparent zzso curve showed typical zzso behavior and zzso zzso reduction with increasing zzso The zzso curve suggested that zzso began at zzso apparent strain in the zzso zzso bone and increased sharply, although very few zzso zzso The zzso of the maximum principal zzso zzso minimum principal zzso strains and Von zzso stresses increased zzso For the zzso range of the Von zzso zzso a leap occurred at small strains ranging from zzso to zzso while zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was primarily responsible for the large loss in apparent mechanical properties that occurred in the zzso bone of the zzso zzso at small zzso With increasing apparent zzso continuous zzso increments of zzso strains and stresses resulted in zzso that zzso throughout the zzso with very few zzso
