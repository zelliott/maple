To maximize the zzso benefit of cardiac zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is routinely performed, zzso by zzso zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso of the basic pacing rate, however, is largely empirical in these zzso zzso the present study aimed to systematically evaluate the impact of basic pacing rate on zzso parameters in zzso patients with zzso zzso 

We included 70 consecutive patients with moderate to severe heart failure, zzso ejection fraction zzso left bundle branch block or a zzso duration zzso zzso combined with zzso evidence of zzso zzso All patients were on optimal heart failure medication, with zzso devices implanted at least 6 months before inclusion into the zzso All patients were in zzso rhythm with a spontaneous heart rate zzso zzso In all patients, cardiac output zzso and stroke volume zzso were determined using electrical zzso zzso zzso zzso Medical, Berlin, zzso zzso provides a new zzso to calculate CO based on variations in zzso electrical zzso which has been recently zzso zzso zzso were performed at four different pacing rates ranging from 40 to 70 zzso A zzso increase in CO was encountered with increasing heart rates, reaching statistical significance when comparing 70 with 40 zzso zzso remained unchanged throughout all pacing zzso 

In the range between 40 and 70 zzso an increase in basic pacing rate enhances CO without reducing zzso According to this pilot study, a basic pacing rate between 60 and 70 zzso would appear zzso
