zzso zzso zzso zzso uses zzso current and zzso zzso made on the boundary of a body to zzso the zzso distribution within the zzso Since the zzso distribution inside the body also contributes significantly to the measured zzso the present reconstruction zzso images complex zzso zzso A finite element model zzso is used to solve the forward problem, using a zzso mesh for a zzso potential zzso The finite element solution using this mesh is compared with the zzso solution for a homogeneous field and a maximum error of zzso is observed in the zzso zzso The boundary element method zzso is also used to generate the zzso data for zzso zzso zzso inside regions with zzso zzso An zzso reconstruction zzso is described for zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso from this zzso The results for an zzso zzso showed a zzso improvement in contrast from that seen with only one zzso for both the zzso and the zzso zzso It is also shown that a significant improvement in images results from accurately modeling a zzso zzso Both zzso and difference images are distorted by assuming a circular boundary and the amount of distortion increases significantly as the boundary shape becomes more zzso For a homogeneous field in an elliptical body with axis ratio of zzso an image reconstructed assuming the boundary to be circular has an artifact at the center of the image with an error of zzso This error increased to 37% when the axis ratio was zzso A reconstruction zzso which used a mesh with the same axis ratio as the elliptical boundary reduced the error in the zzso values to within zzso of the actual zzso
