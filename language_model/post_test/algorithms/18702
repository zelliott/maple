zzso protein identification in mass zzso is predominantly achieved by first identifying zzso peptides by a database search and then by combining the zzso hits for protein zzso One of the popular tools used for the database search is zzso zzso identification is carried out by selecting zzso hits above a specified zzso the value of which is typically chosen zzso in an attempt to separate true identifications from false zzso These zzso scores are not zzso with respect to the zzso length and other parameters of the zzso Furthermore, there is no rigorous reliability estimate assigned to the protein identifications derived from these zzso zzso the interpretation of zzso hits generally requires human involvement, making it difficult to scale up the identification process for zzso zzso To overcome these limitations, we have developed a method, which combines a neural network and a statistical model, for zzso zzso scores, and also for providing a reliability estimate for each zzso zzso This method improves the sensitivity and specificity of zzso identification compared to the standard filtering procedure used in the zzso package, and provides a basis for zzso the reliability of protein zzso
