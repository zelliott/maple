We use the Born approximation of the zzso transport equation to recover simultaneously the zzso and scattering zzso in a single layer of a zzso tissue sample from zzso zzso This method reduces the zzso of both optical properties to a single zzso zzso zzso It is valid over length scales smaller than a transport mean free path and hence is useful for zzso tissue zzso We demonstrate the accuracy of this method by using zzso resolved zzso data zzso with zzso Carlo zzso
