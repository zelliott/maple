A rigid domain, defined here as a zzso structure common to two or more different protein zzso can be identified zzso from atomic coordinates by finding sets of zzso one in each zzso such that the distance between any two zzso within the set belonging to one zzso is the same as the distance between the two structurally equivalent zzso within the set belonging to any other zzso The distance between two zzso is taken to be the distance between their respective alpha carbon zzso With the methods of this paper we have found in the zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso alpha 1 beta 1 zzso a rigid domain closely related to that previously identified by Baldwin and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide two zzso both using the zzso zzso with which to search for rigid zzso directly from atomic zzso The first finds all rigid zzso in a protein but has storage and processing demands that become zzso large with increasing protein zzso The second, although not necessarily finding every rigid domain, is zzso zzso for proteins of any zzso Because of its efficiency we are able to search protein zzso zzso for groups of zzso zzso Different protein zzso when aligned by zzso their respective domain structures, can be examined for structural differences in regions zzso a rigid zzso
