zzso beam CT zzso requires a two-dimensional X-ray zzso In the several zzso systems developed for dental imaging, detection has been by the combination of an X-ray image zzso and zzso device zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso system in which the detector is of the flat-panel type and evaluate its performance in dental zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso that has a zzso zzso The detector consists of a zzso zzso screen and a zzso zzso First, the flat panel detector and image zzso detector were compared in terms of the zzso ratio zzso of projected zzso We then used these data and a theoretical formula to evaluate noise in reconstructed zzso Second, reconstructed images of a bar pattern phantom were obtained as a way of evaluating the spatial zzso Then, reconstructed images of a skull phantom were zzso 

The zzso of the developed system was zzso times as high as that of a system with an image zzso detector of equal detector zzso The system was capable of resolving a zzso zzso pattern and its field of view almost completely zzso that of an image zzso detector which is used in zzso zzso The fine spatial resolution of the detector led to images in which the structural details of a skull phantom were clearly zzso 

The system's zzso fine resolution will lead to improved precision in dental diagnosis and zzso The next stage of our research will be the development of a flat panel detector system with a high frame acquisition zzso
