zzso of different methods for an initial treatment decision in individuals with suspected pulmonary zzso 

Recently, important advances regarding the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis have been introduced, which influence the decision to initiate zzso zzso 

To evaluate the impact of different methods for the presumed diagnosis of zzso individuals with suspected tuberculosis were zzso enrolled following a specific zzso including initial zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid amplification zzso from zzso In cases of negative initial test results, zzso skin testing, zzso with zzso zzso and zzso release zzso zzso in peripheral blood and zzso zzso zzso fluid were zzso 

zzso 135 individuals with suspected zzso 42 had zzso 10 had zzso zzso pulmonary zzso (one had both tuberculosis and zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and 84 had an alternative final zzso The sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso zzso likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso acid amplification, zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso was zzso sensitive and zzso specific zzso zzso 7) for the diagnosis of zzso 

None of the zzso or zzso methods that aim to provide a rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis whilst waiting the confirmation of the zzso tuberculosis culture results is on its own accurate enough to diagnose or exclude pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results should prompt zzso including zzso for zzso zzso zzso in individuals with suspected pulmonary zzso
