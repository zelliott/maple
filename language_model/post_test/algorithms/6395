We evaluated the quantitative accuracy of the zzso zzso segmented zzso correction zzso technique and zzso calculated zzso correction zzso technique in both zzso and zzso scanning for the brain, and compared the results with those obtained using the zzso zzso measured zzso correction zzso technique, which is generally accepted as the zzso zzso 

We examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both a zzso phantom and in 10 patients with zzso The statistical analyses were performed using both the region of interest zzso method and statistical zzso mapping zzso 

In the zzso analysis, zzso activity concentration values obtained by the zzso technique were well correlated with those obtained by the MAC technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although these values were underestimated over the entire zzso The zzso technique was also found to have significant correlation with the MAC technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but this technique showed apparent zzso or zzso in several parts of the zzso In the zzso analysis, there were no significant differences between the zzso and MAC technique, while those values obtained by the zzso technique were significantly lower in the zzso region and higher in the lower frontal region zzso zzso 

The zzso technique was superior to the zzso technique in both zzso and zzso zzso although we found that both the zzso and zzso techniques had some problems in quantitative zzso We considered that the zzso technique may yield adequate qualitative zzso of the zzso activity concentration value after global zzso
