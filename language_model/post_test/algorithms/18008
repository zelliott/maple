It is important to consider zzso zzso data zzso that does not sacrifice diagnostic quality significantly before applying zzso data zzso to mobile zzso zzso In this paper, we assessed the reconstructed zzso quality after zzso with a zzso zzso algorithm, using both zzso and objective zzso We included diverse zzso databases including both normal and abnormal zzso data, and evaluated the relationship between the zzso and objective zzso paying close attention to specific cases in which there was a large zzso between the objective and zzso zzso Based on our zzso an zzso determined zzso ratio can be applied to compress continuous zzso signals in zzso mobile zzso zzso
