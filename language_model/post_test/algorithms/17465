The two roles in awareness most often suggested for the zzso are zzso keeping the details of motor skills away from zzso computation, and zzso signaling to the zzso when a sensory event is not predictable from prior motor zzso However, it is unclear how current models of the zzso could carry out these zzso Their architecture, based on the seminal ideas of zzso and zzso appears to need zzso zzso to learn correct motor zzso However, since motor error is the difference between the actual motor command and what the command should have been, it is a signal unavailable to the zzso in zzso We propose a possible solution to this problem, termed zzso control, in which the zzso learns to zzso the motor command sent to the muscles from the sensory consequences of motor zzso This method was tested in a linear model of zzso plant compensation in the zzso zzso A copy of the zzso command was sent as zzso input to the zzso represented as a simple zzso filter version of the zzso zzso The sensory consequences of motor error were retinal zzso delivered as climbing fiber input to the zzso A standard zzso learning rule was used to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso problem showed the method to be effective and robust for plant zzso zzso control is thus a candidate zzso for the basic zzso zzso indicating how it could achieve motor learning using only signals available to the zzso Such learning might then enable the zzso to free up visual zzso and also, by providing a sensory signal zzso from motor command, supply awareness with crucial information about the external zzso
