zzso organ zzso is highly desirable but difficult, due to large differences between patients and to overlapping zzso values of the various tissue zzso The first step in zzso this process is to cluster together the zzso within each organ or tissue zzso We propose to form images based on zzso statistical texture zzso zzso zzso of a CT or zzso zzso The original scan plus the suite of texture zzso are then input into a zzso neural network zzso The network is constructed to solve an zzso problem, where the best solution is the zzso of a zzso energy zzso On a sample abdominal CT zzso this process successfully clustered zzso of the zzso of seven abdominal zzso It is envisioned that this is the first step to automate zzso Active zzso zzso zzso or a zzso neural network can then be used to assign names to the clusters and fill in the incorrectly clustered zzso
