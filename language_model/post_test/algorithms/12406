zzso is a zzso tool designed to enable comparative analysis of protein interaction networks zzso zzso compares a query zzso with a target zzso by combining interaction zzso and sequence similarity to identify zzso network zzso zzso which may derive from a common zzso and disclose zzso zzso organization of interactions in zzso To exemplify the application of zzso we perform two zzso comparisons with zzso the zzso coli zzso against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso Many of the identified zzso zzso to known zzso therefore, zzso zzso comparison provides a way for discovery of zzso zzso In addition, based on the zzso differences in zzso we zzso the problems of zzso interaction zzso prediction and species divergence from a network zzso
