zzso design experiments have shown that the use of specific zzso of zzso acids can produce zzso zzso This zzso the question of whether there is a minimal zzso acid alphabet which could be used to fold all zzso In this work we make an zzso between sequence patterns which produce zzso sequences and those which make it possible to detect structural zzso by aligning zzso and use it to suggest the possible size of such a reduced zzso We estimate that reduced zzso containing zzso letters can be used to design zzso sequences for a large number of protein zzso This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural zzso in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the zzso acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly zzso when further reductions in the alphabet are zzso
