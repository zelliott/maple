The zzso shift test is the only clinical test that has been shown to correlate with zzso criteria of knee joint function following zzso of the anterior cruciate zzso The grade of the zzso shift is important in predicting zzso and long-term zzso However, because this grade is established by a zzso in a zzso manner, the zzso zzso value as a clinical tool is zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a system that will zzso grade the zzso shift test based on recorded knee joint zzso zzso subjects with different degrees of knee joint stability had the zzso shift test performed by one of eight different zzso surgeons while their knee joint zzso were zzso A support zzso machine based zzso was used to zzso zzso these recordings according to a clinical zzso The grades established by the surgeons were used as the gold standard for the development of the zzso There was substantial agreement between our zzso and the surgeons in establishing the grade (weighted zzso Seventy-one of 107 recordings zzso were given the same grade and zzso of the time our zzso was within one grade of that given by the zzso Moreover, grades 0 and 1 were distinguished from grade 2 to 3 with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso Our results show the feasibility of automatically grading the zzso shift in a manner similar to that of an experienced clinician, based on knee joint zzso
