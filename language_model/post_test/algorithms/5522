Fluorescence zzso allows real-time monitoring of optical molecular zzso for disease zzso drug development, and tissue zzso However, when a biological sample is thicker than 1 zzso intense scattering of light would significantly degrade the spatial resolution of zzso zzso In this paper, we develop a zzso zzso technique that zzso the zzso Carlo method to image zzso reporters in thick biological zzso This approach is based on an zzso zzso model and provides an excellent zzso Our studies on zzso tissue scaffolds have demonstrated that the proposed approach is capable of zzso and zzso the distribution of optical molecular probe accurately and zzso
