zzso zzso events have been found to concentrate in zzso zzso base regions, but these zzso hot spots do not share a consensus sequence and why they occur at specific sites is not fully zzso Some previous evidence suggests that zzso zzso tracts zzso a class of sequence with distinctive zzso properties, could be involved in zzso but no general association of zzso with zzso zzso hot spots has previously been zzso 

We used zzso methods to investigate in detail the relationship between zzso and hot zzso We show statistical associations of zzso frequency with hot spots of zzso zzso initiating zzso zzso breaks, in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and with zzso well characterized human zzso zzso hot zzso Supporting a possible role of zzso sequences in hot spot zzso we also found that all three single zzso zzso previously shown to be associated with human hot spot activity changes occur within sequence contexts of 14 zzso or longer that are zzso or more zzso and at least zzso zzso These zzso are all close to the hot spot mid zzso Comparing the sequences of zzso characterized human hot spots with the zzso regions of the zzso zzso previously shown not to contain hot spots, we found that in all five cases in which comparisons for the hot spot central regions are possible with publicly available sequence data, there are differences near the human hot spot mid points within sequences 14 zzso or longer consisting of more than zzso zzso and at least 50% zzso 

Our results, along with previous evidence for the unique zzso properties and zzso potential of zzso zzso suggest that the possible functional involvement of this type of sequence in zzso zzso hot spots deserves further experimental zzso
