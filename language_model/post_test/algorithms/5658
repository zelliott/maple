Advances in reporters for gene expression have made it possible to document and zzso expression patterns in zzso In contrast to zzso which provide data for many genes but averaged and/or at low resolution, images reveal the high spatial dynamics of gene zzso zzso zzso methods to compare, zzso and model gene expression based on images is zzso considering that available data are rapidly zzso We have developed a sparse zzso factor analysis model in which the observed expression diversity of among a large set of zzso images is modeled by a small number of hidden common zzso We apply this approach on embryonic expression patterns from a zzso zzso in zzso image database, and show that the automatically zzso factors provide for a meaningful decomposition and represent common zzso or biological zzso The zzso set of factor mixing weights is further used as features by a zzso to zzso expression patterns with functional zzso On zzso zzso our sparse approach reaches similar or better zzso of expression patterns at different zzso zzso when compared to other automatic image zzso methods using thousands of zzso zzso Our study therefore outlines a general framework for large zzso data sets, in which both the zzso model itself, as well as its application for analysis tasks such as automated zzso can provide insight into biological zzso
