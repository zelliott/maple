Last 10 years have witnessed the growth of many computer applications for the zzso of the vessel wall in ultrasound zzso zzso studies showed that the thickness of the major arteries is an early and effective marker of onset of cardiovascular zzso zzso imaging, being zzso economic, reliable, safe, and now seems to become a standard in vascular assessment zzso This review is an attempt to discuss the most performing zzso that have been developed so far to perform computer-based zzso and zzso thickness zzso measurement of the carotid arteries in ultrasound zzso First we will present the rationale and the clinical relevance of computer-based zzso in clinical practice, followed by the challenges that one has to face when approaching the zzso of ultrasound vascular zzso The core of the paper is the zzso discussion, zzso and evaluation of different zzso techniques, zzso zzso active zzso dynamic programming, local statistics, zzso zzso statistical zzso and integration of these zzso Also, we will discuss and compare the different performance metrics that have been proposed and used to perform the zzso Best performing zzso techniques show an average zzso measurement error of about zzso when compared to human zzso zzso whereas completely automated techniques show errors of about zzso The review ends with a discussion about the current standards in carotid wall zzso and in an overview of the future perspectives, which may include the adoption of advanced and intelligent strategies to let the computer technique measure the zzso in the image portion where measurement is more zzso
