The study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso of body mass index zzso and zzso thicknesses in detecting excess zzso in zzso 

zzso 

zzso children zzso females and zzso zzso aged 10 zzso 1 years zzso zzso zzso zzso 8-12 zzso were zzso All underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso was performed in 52 children to develop a zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso mass zzso from zzso The zzso was applied to the remaining 934 children to estimate their zzso Fat mass zzso was obtained by zzso zzso from weight zzso zzso of zzso were transformed in zzso and converted into 19 zzso categories (from 5 to 95 in steps of zzso The same procedure was performed with zzso and the zzso sum of four zzso thicknesses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Excess zzso was defined as a level of zzso greater than the internally derived zzso zzso zzso and SP of each internally derived zzso of zzso and zzso in detecting excess zzso were zzso 

In the pooled sample zzso zzso zzso zzso and SP were zzso and zzso for the 95th zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso employed in the present study have a high SP but a low zzso in detecting excess zzso in zzso zzso The use of the sum of four zzso has the potential to increase the zzso of a screening zzso for excess zzso in children of this zzso
