zzso information currently exists on how clinicians should approach the evaluation of the young patient with zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of specific diseases and the most useful tests to establish the diagnosis in an active duty military population presenting with zzso zzso 

A total of 105 active duty military patients with complaints of zzso zzso and 69 active duty military zzso controls were evaluated at a pulmonary disease clinic at an Army zzso care zzso All patients and controls underwent a standard evaluation that included history, physical examination, chest zzso zzso zzso blood gas testing, laboratory testing, full pulmonary function testing zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso zzso challenge testing, zzso exercise testing, zzso and zzso 

zzso lung disease was found in zzso of patients zzso with zzso asthma and zzso with zzso zzso had vocal zzso dysfunction, and zzso had other zzso zzso percent of patients had no specific zzso zzso challenge testing yielded a positive diagnosis in zzso of patients and zzso in zzso Other pulmonary tests were of limited value, with abnormal values of zzso for full zzso zzso for zzso blood gas testing, and zzso for zzso Laboratory evaluation yielded positive results in less than zzso of patients, and cardiac evaluation was normal in all zzso 

Various forms of zzso lung disease and vocal zzso dysfunction were the most common findings in this zzso The routine use of zzso and zzso testing is warranted, but other tests, such as full zzso zzso and cardiac and laboratory evaluations, have limited diagnostic value in this zzso
