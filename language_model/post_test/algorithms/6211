To better zzso limited resources for their survival and zzso all organisms undergo zzso changes in both body size and shape during zzso The genetic analysis of size change with increasing age, zzso growth, has received considerable attention in quantitative zzso genetic studies, but the genetic architecture of zzso changes in body shape and its associated zzso have been poorly understood partly due to the lack of zzso zzso In this article, we attempt to construct a zzso statistical framework for studying the genetic regulation of zzso growth and zzso We have integrated biologically meaningful mathematical functions of growth zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso process of genetic mapping aimed at identifying individual quantitative trait zzso zzso for zzso zzso This model defined with high dimensions can characterize the zzso patterns of genetic effects of zzso over the lifetime of an zzso and assess the interplay between genetic zzso and zzso zzso The closed forms for the residual zzso zzso and its zzso and inverse were derived to overcome the zzso complexity typical of our zzso zzso We used a worked example to validate the utility of this zzso The implications of this model for genetic research of zzso are zzso
