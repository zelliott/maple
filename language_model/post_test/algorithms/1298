zzso autopsy zzso is an indirect method for zzso zzso zzso In most previous studies, cause of death has been assigned from verbal autopsy data using expert zzso or by physician zzso Both of these methods may have poor zzso In addition, physician review is time consuming and has to be carried out by zzso A range of methods exist for zzso zzso rules from zzso Such rules are quick and simple to apply and in many situations perform as well as zzso 

This paper has two zzso First, it considers the advantages and disadvantages of the three main methods for zzso zzso rules zzso zzso linear and other zzso techniques, zzso probability density zzso and zzso decision trees and zzso zzso Second, it reviews the factors which need to be taken into account when choosing a zzso method for assigning cause of death from VA zzso 

Four main factors influence the choice of zzso method: zzso the purpose for which a zzso is being developed, zzso the number of validated causes of death assigned to each case, zzso the characteristics of the VA data and zzso the need for a zzso to be zzso When the objective is to estimate mortality from a single cause of death, zzso zzso should be zzso When the objective is to determine patterns of zzso the choice of method will depend on the above factors in ways which are elaborated in the zzso 

Choice of zzso method for assigning cause of death needs to be considered when designing a VA validation zzso zzso of the performance of zzso derived using different methods requires a large VA zzso which is not currently zzso
