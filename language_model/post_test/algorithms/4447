Having a valid mathematical model for zzso zzso band shapes is important when zzso zzso zzso of complex zzso We propose a new zzso model for zzso zzso of five organic molecules containing aromatic zzso zzso zzso alcohol, zzso zzso and zzso For each zzso a series of zzso zzso varying in zzso zzso were fitted with the new model as well as with two other zzso zzso zzso described previously in the literature, and zzso Their zzso into two, three and four zzso components was also performed, in order to estimate the number of zzso components needed to obtain a better fitting quality than that of the zzso zzso Four zzso of the new model, as well as the zzso one, did not differ significantly in their fitting zzso while the zzso model showed a significantly worse zzso zzso of two zzso zzso alcohol and zzso were zzso into two zzso and four zzso zzso zzso of zzso components of zzso matched those of separate zzso while zzso did zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso was also zzso In this more complex case zzso and zzso components also grouped in alternating zzso
