zzso of zzso blood pressure measurement with two different devices zzso using a new zzso and zzso using an established algorithm, both Hewlett zzso and evaluation of current recommendations concerning the relation between cuff size and upper arm circumference in critically ill zzso 

Prospective data zzso 

Emergency department in a zzso inner-city zzso 

A total of 30 patients zzso into three groups according to their upper arm circumference zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso III, zzso zzso were enrolled in the study zzso zzso In each patient, two zzso blood pressure devices with three different cuff sizes were used to perform zzso blood pressure zzso zzso mean zzso blood pressure measurement was done by zzso of the zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso pairs of simultaneous zzso and invasive blood pressure zzso were collected in 30 patients zzso I, zzso zzso 10; group II, zzso zzso 10; group III, zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso between both methods with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if the recommended cuff size according to the upper arm circumference was used zzso zzso If smaller cuff sizes than recommended were used zzso zzso performed in group II and zzso the overall zzso between both methods with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The new zzso reduced the overall bias of the zzso method but still showed a significant zzso between both methods of blood pressure zzso primarily due to the mismatch between upper arm circumference and cuff zzso The improvement of the zzso alone could not result in a sufficient improvement of zzso blood pressure zzso A zzso of the recommendations concerning the relation between upper arm circumference and cuff size are urgently required if zzso blood pressure measurement should become a reasonable alternative to zzso blood pressure measurement in critically ill zzso
