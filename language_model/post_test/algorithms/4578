The experimental procedure of lowering and raising a leg while the subject is in the zzso position is considered to stimulate and zzso the zzso nervous system of zzso zzso patients with Parkinson's disease and zzso age and sex matched control zzso The assessment of zzso function for each group is achieved using an zzso based on zzso kernel zzso By applying this zzso and considering the process of lowering and raising a leg as stimulus input and the Heart Rate zzso signal zzso as output for system zzso a mathematical model is expressed as integral zzso The integral equations are considered and fixed for control subjects and Parkinson's disease patients so that the identification method reduced to the determination of the values within the integral called zzso resulting in an integral equations whose zzso behavior is nearly identical to that of the system in both healthy subjects and Parkinson's disease zzso The model for each group contains the linear part zzso order zzso and zzso part zzso order zzso A difference equation model was employed to represent the system for both control subjects and patients with Parkinson's zzso The results show significant difference in first order zzso zzso and second order kernel zzso zzso for each zzso Using first order kernel and second order zzso it is possible to assess zzso function zzso and zzso in both zzso
