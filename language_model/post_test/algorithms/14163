Both autonomously functioning zzso zzso zzso and cold zzso zzso zzso are characterized by an increased zzso however, they have opposite functional zzso zzso with the aim to further understand the distinct molecular pathology of each entity and to discover common mechanisms like those leading to increased proliferation in both, zzso and zzso we now compared gene expression of zzso and zzso with in zzso model systems zzso and zzso primary cultures zzso whose gene expression patterns can be attributed to specific molecular zzso Since combinations of zzso genes are more likely to reveal molecular mechanisms, we used a procedure which groups zzso genes within zzso zzso We found a zzso gene set in the zzso that zzso with differential expression in zzso PCs but not in zzso or zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso 1, this set of zzso genes comprises zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Although their role in the zzso is unknown so far, their appearance in one group indicates a functional relevance in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso gene sets with zzso expression patterns in zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, these expression patterns are not of relevance in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso PCs can be used as a model of increased zzso function zzso whereas the zzso PCs better reflect the increased proliferation of both zzso and zzso
