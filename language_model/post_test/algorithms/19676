zzso zzso control strategies adapt their parameters from an analysis of response patterns exhibited by the zzso This work presents an analysis of a class of artificial neural network zzso zzso zzso zzso It provides conditions under which the zzso zzso will zzso and it also characterizes the zzso stability zzso In addition, a method for monitoring the adaptation is also zzso Several simulation examples illustrate our zzso
