The design of a simulated moving bed involves zzso kinetic and zzso aspects and requires the zzso of several zzso plant design zzso such as the column length and diameter, and operating zzso among them four independent zzso the feed concentration and the switch zzso In this work we develop an zzso to design both the unit and its operating conditions, with an overall view on equilibrium properties, efficiency and zzso using a simple equilibrium stage zzso In this way we determine the parameters leading to the highest possible productivity for a given zzso only requiring the knowledge of the equilibrium zzso the Van zzso equation and a correlation for pressure zzso The zzso has been used to investigate the effect on the separation performance of some zzso such as particle size and required product zzso which are not considered by equilibrium zzso The results have been compared with the predictions of equilibrium theory and the observed zzso have been put in evidence and zzso
