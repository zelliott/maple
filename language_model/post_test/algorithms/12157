The conventional two-dimensional zzso transform used in existing image zzso is usually performed through one-dimensional zzso filtering in the vertical and horizontal directions, which cannot efficiently represent edges and lines in zzso The curved zzso transform presented in this paper is carried out by applying zzso filters along curves, rather than being restricted to vertical and horizontal straight zzso The zzso are determined based on image content and are usually parallel to edges and lines in the image to be zzso The zzso along these zzso can be well represented by a small number of zzso zzso The curved zzso transform is used to construct a new image zzso The zzso syntax of the new zzso is the same as that of zzso except that a new marker segment is added to the tile zzso zzso of image coding and zzso quality assessment show that the new image zzso performs better than, or as well as, zzso It is particularly efficient for images that contain sharp edges and can provide a zzso gain of up to zzso zzso for natural images compared with zzso
