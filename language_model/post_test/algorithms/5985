This paper presents an zzso zzso learning mechanism for zzso data that are zzso by zzso Using a similarity zzso and a local zzso zzso zzso the system is able to grow zzso and to accommodate input patterns of zzso zzso data zzso A definition of a utility zzso the zzso allows this system to learn the number of zzso needed to solve a zzso The use of a new technique for removing zzso in low probability density regions can separate clusters with zzso zzso and zzso eliminate noise in the input zzso The design of zzso neural network enables this system to represent the zzso structure of zzso zzso data, report the reasonable number of zzso and give typical zzso patterns of every cluster without prior conditions such as a suitable number of zzso or a good initial zzso
