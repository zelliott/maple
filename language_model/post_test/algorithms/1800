We analyzed the relationship between zzso and spatial biomass zzso along an ecological succession developed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso biomass spatial patterns at several zzso stages were obtained using digital image analysis and at the same time we estimated the species composition and zzso We show that the spatial pattern was zzso and as the community developed in an homogeneous environment the pattern is zzso To characterize it we estimated the zzso spectrum of generalized dimensions zzso Using zzso we analyze the existence of cycles of zzso during succession and the use of the information dimension zzso as an index of zzso zzso We did not find cycles but the values of zzso showed an increasing trend as the succession developed and the biomass was zzso zzso was also zzso correlated with Shannon's zzso Several studies have found this relationship in different zzso but here we prove that the community zzso and generates its own spatial zzso influencing zzso If this is confirmed with more experimental and theoretical evidence zzso could be used as an index, easily calculated from remote sensing data, to detect high or low diversity zzso
