zzso disorder is relatively common in zzso plays important roles in numerous cellular activities, and its prevalence was implicated in various human zzso However, zzso of the disorder lag behind the rapidly increasing number of known protein zzso The last decade observed development of a relatively large number of zzso methods that predict the disorder using the protein sequence as their zzso We perform a zzso kind comprehensive empirical evaluation of the disorder zzso which is characterized by three novel aspects, zzso we evaluate the quality of the disorder predictions at the zzso segment, and chain zzso zzso we consider a large number of published and accessible to the end user zzso that are evaluated on a relatively big zzso with close to 500 zzso and zzso we assess statistical significance of differences between the considered zzso Our study reveals that there is no universally superior predictor and that the top-performing methods are zzso We show that while recent zzso zzso outperform other considered methods for the zzso predictions, some older methods perform better for the prediction of the zzso zzso Our analysis indicates that certain zzso are biased to zzso the disorder, while some other solutions tend to zzso the number of the zzso zzso We also evaluate the utility of the predicted zzso disorder for prediction of proteins with long zzso segments and prediction of the zzso disorder zzso Lastly, we provide recommendations concerning development of a new generation of zzso methods and specialized methods for improved prediction of the disorder zzso
