zzso method is explored for detecting and imaging zzso metal seeds in gel zzso In a previous paper, we have shown that some immersed zzso resonance zzso could be detected by zzso Here, we use this idea to zzso the zzso zzso of two different sized brass seeds implanted in an zzso gel zzso In the experiments, the best zzso zzso zzso were determined either by calculating fundamental resonance zzso for each of the seeds or the experimental optimal resonance frequency of the zzso The resulting zzso images demonstrate remarkable contrast in acoustic zzso zzso compared with images obtained at zzso zzso zzso suggest the possible application of zzso for directing prostate zzso seed zzso zzso
