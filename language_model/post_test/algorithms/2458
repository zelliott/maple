To examine the extent to which zzso of recommended monitoring of diabetes zzso zzso differed for participants with and without zzso zzso as well as the effect of other zzso on monitoring of zzso in individuals with zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

Secondary analysis of zzso claims and enrollment data for a zzso national random sample of Medicare zzso 

Two hundred zzso thousand eight hundred five Medicare zzso beneficiaries with a diagnosis of zzso before 2006, zzso zzso of whom had evidence of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso were used to determine whether patients received at least one zzso zzso zzso test, one zzso zzso cholesterol zzso test, and one annual eye examination in 2006 and to construct variables representing zzso common in zzso zzso zzso and patterns of zzso zzso 

In zzso and fully adjusted models, the presence of zzso reduced the likelihood of receiving zzso tests, zzso tests, and eye zzso with effects being smallest for zzso zzso The effects of other zzso on zzso monitoring in participants with zzso varied according to the nature of the zzso and the specific zzso 

zzso reduces the likelihood that individuals with zzso will receive recommended annual monitoring for zzso More research is needed to understand reasons for lower monitoring in this zzso and how this affects zzso adverse events, and quality of zzso
