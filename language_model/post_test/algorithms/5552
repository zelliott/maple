An zzso zzso zzso resonance energy zzso zzso method for determination of zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso zzso quantum dots zzso immobilized on zzso zzso zzso as donors was zzso In the method, zzso zzso were first modified with zzso zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso were immobilized on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso in the solution was attached to the empty sites on the surface of zzso zzso with zzso through zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso molecules on the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso method was zzso higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso method, zzso as low as zzso zzso could be zzso The method was applied to zzso trace zzso in water zzso
