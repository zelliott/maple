zzso the biological function of one protein to another is a key issue in understanding the structure and function relationship of zzso We have developed a strategy for zzso zzso interaction zzso As a first step, zzso at the interface of the zzso protein which strongly interact with the zzso protein were zzso Then protein scaffolds were zzso onto zzso protein based on geometric zzso Only high zzso score matches were zzso For each saved match, the scaffold protein was accepted if it had suitable positions for zzso key interaction zzso of the zzso zzso These candidate zzso were zzso to corresponding zzso in the zzso protein at each relevant position and the zzso scaffold protein was zzso with zzso zzso Finally, the minimized complexes were evaluated by a scoring function deduced from statistical analysis of rigid binding data zzso As a test case, the binding zzso of zzso the inhibitor of zzso was grafted onto smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso entry zzso has been found to be a good zzso The calculated binding free energy for zzso zzso zzso is equivalent to that of zzso
