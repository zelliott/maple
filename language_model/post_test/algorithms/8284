According to the integrated information theory, the quantity of consciousness is the amount of integrated information generated by a complex of zzso and the quality of experience is specified by the informational relationships it zzso This paper outlines a framework for characterizing the informational relationships generated by such zzso zzso space zzso is a space having an axis for each possible state zzso zzso of a zzso Within zzso each zzso specifies a point corresponding to a repertoire of system zzso Arrows between zzso in Q define informational zzso Together, these zzso specify a zzso -- a shape that completely and zzso characterizes the quality of a conscious zzso zzso -- the height of this shape -- is the quantity of consciousness associated with the zzso zzso measures how zzso informational relationships are to their component zzso specifying concepts and zzso Several zzso follow from these zzso The zzso is determined by both the mechanism and state of the zzso Thus, two different systems having identical activity patterns may generate different zzso zzso the same zzso may be generated by two systems that differ in both activity and zzso Both active and inactive elements specify a zzso but elements that are zzso do zzso Also, the zzso of an element affects experience by changing the shape of the zzso The subdivision of experience into zzso and zzso zzso to zzso in zzso In principle, different aspects of experience may be classified as different shapes in zzso and the similarity between experiences reduces to similarities between zzso Finally, specific qualities, such as the zzso of red, while generated by a local zzso cannot be reduced to it, but require considering the entire zzso Ultimately, the present framework may offer a zzso way for translating qualitative properties of experience into zzso
