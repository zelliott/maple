It is commonly accepted that larger visual objects are represented in the cerebral zzso by specific spatial patterns of zzso zzso zzso is a key concept in the different explanations of such zzso zzso We here propose as a hypothesis that fast cortical selection zzso is an intrinsic functional element of cortical zzso during zzso zzso is a central concept in theoretical biology which has proved its explanatory power in different fields of our natural and cultural zzso The central element in the cortical selection process is the zzso cell with its two types of zzso zzso In primary cortical areas one of these zzso comes from any of the sensory zzso determining the zzso and zzso receptive field properties of the cell and also driving it zzso The other type of input connects zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso and only zzso the driving zzso These two functionally different zzso constitute the elementary selection system working by zzso mutual zzso as a biological zzso A short zzso based entirely on such biological facts, illustrates the dynamic of this selection process: the activity of cells responding better to the external stimulus zzso and zzso the zzso whereas less responsive cells decrease their activity due to zzso
