It has long been observed in experiments that frozen state of spiral waves can spontaneously appear in both excitable and zzso media, in which several spiral waves coexist and are well separated by thin walls zzso In this work, we study the global structure of frozen state of spiral waves in excitable media and find that different from stationary shocks in zzso media, in excitable media the shock dynamics actually depends on the status of single zzso which is also determined by the system zzso zzso the shock line can be stationary if the single spiral is zzso zzso whereas it can wiggle if the single spiral is meandering, and the zzso zzso increases with the degree of zzso We also find the stationary structure of shock line can still be well predicted by a previous theory, which has been developed for the frozen state of spiral waves in zzso zzso All these findings are generic and expected to be verified in zzso
