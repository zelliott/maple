zzso contrast agents have zzso properties that differ greatly from those of soft zzso These agents exhibit zzso scattering properties in response to incident acoustic energy, causing harmonic components in reflected zzso Even in linear scattering conditions, an important difference is observed in the frequency dependence of their zzso zzso when compared to that of zzso In this situation, any such differential zzso can be exploited by imaging zzso to enhance the detection of zzso vessels against background zzso The resulting zzso image brightness (or zzso zzso can thus be the representation of a local zzso zzso from radio frequency zzso signal processing of the raw zzso The object of this article is to report on zzso imaging studies performed with zzso (formerly code named zzso zzso Research zzso aimed at assessing the zzso potential of spectral zzso signal zzso The technique used, termed here zzso contrast zzso zzso is zzso in real-time zzso zzso It is based on an zzso zzso approach, using zzso signal processing to implement differential filtering and zzso In this preliminary work, zzso was implemented zzso on zzso echo signals zzso from commercial zzso zzso Data zzso zzso processing and complete zzso image reconstruction were programmed on a personal zzso The images presented were produced from test zzso as well as animal phased array zzso The phantom included a flow channel, background scattering material, fixed zzso targets and zzso zzso Animal scanning was performed on rabbit zzso The results obtained from zzso show promising zzso zzso The regions containing no contrast agent are significantly suppressed from the image, zzso leaving the regions zzso by the contrast zzso This property was zzso to experimenting with zzso presentations, zzso zzso zzso imaging with standard zzso zzso zzso in a way analogous to duplex imaging combining zzso zzso and zzso
