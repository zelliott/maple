To test the feasibility of using text mining to depict zzso the experience of pain in patients with zzso prostate cancer, to identify novel pain zzso and to propose methods for zzso zzso of pain zzso 

zzso from zzso clinical encounters for 33 men enrolled in a 15-year zzso zzso autopsy study of zzso prostate cancer zzso to zzso lethal zzso was subjected to natural language processing zzso using zzso Medical Language zzso zzso A zzso pain scale was developed, and zzso zzso analysis identified factors that correlated with experience of severe pain during each zzso 

zzso identified zzso pain and 13 zzso drug mentions in the zzso zzso displays revealed the pain zzso described in the zzso records and confirmed dramatically increasing levels of pain in the last years of life in all but two patients, all of whom died from zzso zzso Severe pain was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso radiation zzso zzso Surprisingly, no severe or controlled pain was detected in two of 33 subjects' clinical zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso proved zzso in an evaluation using a separate data source zzso zzso for zzso Biology and the zzso zzso discharge zzso 

zzso in the pain experience, zzso without the use of zzso to mine the zzso clinical record, were consistent with clinical expectations, suggesting that meaningful zzso pain status monitoring is zzso zzso in this initial cohort suggest that zzso pain zzso useful for probing the molecular basis of cancer pain may zzso 

The results are limited by a small cohort size and use of proprietary zzso zzso 

We have established the feasibility of tracking zzso patterns of pain by text mining of free text clinical zzso These methods may be useful for monitoring pain management and identifying novel cancer zzso
