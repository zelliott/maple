zzso in protein abundance among single cells are primarily due to the inherent zzso in zzso and translation zzso such zzso can often zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso It has been proposed that expression noise can be triggered as an adaptation to environmental stresses and genetic zzso and as a mechanism to facilitate gene expression zzso Thus, zzso the relationship between expression noise, measured at the zzso level, and expression variation, measured on population of cells, can improve our understanding on the zzso and zzso of gene zzso Here, we showed that noise levels are significantly correlated with conditional expression zzso We further demonstrated that expression variations are highly zzso for noise level, especially in zzso containing zzso Our results suggest that expression zzso can serve as a proxy for noise level, suggesting that these two properties share the same underlining zzso zzso zzso zzso Our work zzso the way for the study of zzso noise in other zzso zzso
