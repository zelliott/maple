zzso zzso complexity, which measures the generation rate of new patterns along a digital zzso is closely related to such important source properties as zzso and zzso ratio, but, in contrast to these, it is a property of individual zzso In this article, we propose to exploit this concept to estimate (or, at least, to bound from below) the zzso of neural zzso zzso zzso The main advantages of this method include fast convergence of the zzso (as supported by zzso zzso and the fact that there is no need to know the probability law of the process generating the zzso Furthermore, we present zzso and experimental comparisons of the new method against the standard method based on word zzso providing evidence that this new approach is an alternative zzso zzso for zzso spike zzso
