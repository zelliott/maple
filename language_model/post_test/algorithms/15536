Heart failure zzso is the end result of progressive and diverse biological adaptations within the diseased zzso We used zzso zzso and quantitative zzso to examine the zzso of 38 left zzso from failing and zzso human zzso After identification of a pool of putative zzso candidate genes by zzso on seven zzso and eight failing hearts, we used quantitative zzso and a general linear statistical model in a larger sample set zzso zzso 34) to validate and examine the role of contributing biological variables (age and zzso We find that most zzso genes zzso factors, zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significant changes in gene zzso however, the majority of differences among samples depended on variables such as sex and age, and not on zzso zzso Some zzso gene products also demonstrated highly significant changes in expression as a function of age and/or sex, but independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results emphasize the need to account for biological variables zzso sex and age zzso to zzso zzso zzso that trigger molecular pathways responsible for the progression of zzso zzso
