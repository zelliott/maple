Breast cancer accounts for about zzso of all zzso and zzso of cancer deaths in zzso Advances in zzso analysis hold promise for zzso zzso of disease and improving zzso zzso We introduce a zzso decision support system for performing automatic analysis of zzso breast tissue zzso To date, we have processed more than zzso digitized specimens zzso zzso 1200 zzso each) on zzso World Community zzso zzso As a part of the Help Defeat Cancer zzso project, we have analyzed that the data returned from zzso along with retrospective patient clinical profiles for a subset of zzso breast tissue samples, and have reported the results in this zzso zzso features were extracted from the digitized zzso and zzso feature mapping was applied to achieve zzso dimension zzso zzso zzso and testing were performed to zzso several major zzso of breast zzso Overall, the most reliable approach was gentle zzso using an zzso zzso and zzso tree as the weak zzso Using the proposed algorithm, a zzso zzso accuracy of zzso and the zzso accuracy of zzso were zzso Throughout the course of the experiments, only zzso of the zzso was used for zzso
