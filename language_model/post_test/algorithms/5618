zzso and improving the zzso skill of imperfect models for complex systems in their response to external forcing is a crucial issue in diverse applications such as for example climate change zzso zzso statistical zzso of the imperfect model on suitable zzso variables is a necessary but not sufficient condition for this zzso zzso and elementary examples are given here demonstrating zzso Here, with equilibrium statistical zzso of the imperfect model, a direct link is developed between the zzso zzso of specific test problems in the training phase where the perfect natural system is observed and the zzso skill for the forced response of the imperfect model by combining appropriate concepts from information theory with other concepts based on the fluctuation dissipation zzso Here a suite of zzso zzso models with zzso zzso zzso zzso and intermittent zzso statistics mimicking crucial features of atmospheric zzso together with zzso forced standard zzso zzso approximation with model error are zzso to illustrate this zzso
