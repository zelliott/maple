Despite having remarkably similar three-dimensional structures and zzso zzso promotes zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso Their energy landscapes are similar and have zzso to facilitate competitive binding to the zzso zzso Nevertheless, we find that zzso folds faster than zzso A structural alignment of the proteins shows differences mainly in two zzso a zzso of zzso and a loop in zzso that interacts with zzso zzso and connects zzso 11 and zzso zzso indicate that inserting the zzso from zzso zzso partial signaling capability onto a zzso zzso of zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso and our zzso folding results, we zzso that functional regions are not central to the zzso motif and cause slow zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity and replacing it by the zzso zzso results in a hybrid protein that folds faster than zzso zzso the zzso zzso which aids zzso into either zzso or the hybrid protein slows zzso Thus, regions that aid function zzso through activity or zzso can be zzso from folding traps via structural zzso zzso functional properties onto the numerous folds determined in structural zzso efforts is an area of intense zzso Our studies provide a systematic approach to mapping the functional zzso of a fold zzso
