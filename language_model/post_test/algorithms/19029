The zzso ultrasound zzso from zzso contains information about the zzso that can be zzso In many cases, the zzso zzso details responsible for zzso scattering remain zzso However, their identification would lead to potentially improved zzso for characterizing tissue and diagnosing disease from zzso zzso zzso Recently, three-dimensional zzso acoustic models of tissue zzso termed zzso zzso maps zzso were introduced to help to identify scattering sources zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O'Brien, zzso and zzso zzso Zachary, zzso zzso scattering sites from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current study, new zzso zzso are used to model and identify scattering zzso New processing procedures zzso zzso zzso are presented that allow more accurate zzso to be constructed from zzso New strategies are proposed to construct scattering models zzso form factor zzso from zzso These new methods are tested on simulated zzso and then used to evaluate zzso from three different zzso tumor zzso zzso results demonstrate the ability of the extended strategies to accurately predict zzso and estimate zzso zzso Using the zzso methods, distinct zzso and zzso properties were obtained for each tumor zzso
