Electronic colon zzso zzso aims to segment the colon zzso from a patient abdominal image acquired using an oral contrast agent for zzso material zzso so that a virtual colon model can be zzso zzso zzso zzso provides zzso navigation within the colon model, looking for zzso on the inner surface in a manner analogous to that of fiber zzso zzso We have built an zzso pipeline for a commercial VC navigation zzso In this paper, we present an improved zzso zzso It is based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is derived using the well-established statistical zzso zzso The presented zzso method was evaluated by both visual inspection and zzso detection of zzso zzso within the cleansed colon zzso obtained using 20 patient zzso Compared to our previous zzso pipeline, which does not sufficiently consider the zzso effect, the method presented in this paper demonstrates improved zzso detection by both visual judgment and zzso zzso
