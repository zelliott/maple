A field theory of frictionless grain zzso in two dimensions is shown to exhibit a zzso critical point at a zzso value of the packing zzso The zzso constraint of force balance plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the zzso Two order zzso zzso the zzso of the average number of contacts from the zzso value, and zzso the average magnitude of the force per zzso characterize the transition from the jammed zzso packing zzso to the zzso zzso packing fraction zzso The critical point has a mixed character with the order parameters showing a jump zzso but with fluctuations of the contact force zzso At the critical point, the distribution of zzso shows the characteristic plateau observed in zzso zzso zzso The theory makes zzso predictions about the spatial fluctuations of the contact zzso
