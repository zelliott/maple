Comparative molecular field analysis zzso with partial least squares zzso is one of the most frequently used tools in three-dimensional quantitative zzso relationships zzso zzso Although many successful zzso applications have proved the value of this approach, there are some problems in its proper zzso zzso the inability of zzso to handle the low zzso ratio zzso zzso has attracted much attention from zzso researchers as an exciting research target, and several variable selection methods have been zzso More recently, we have developed a novel variable selection method for zzso modeling zzso genetic zzso region zzso and its utility has been demonstrated in the previous paper zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998, 38, zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether zzso can pinpoint known molecular interactions in zzso zzso We have used a published set of zzso zzso zzso as a test zzso By applying zzso to a data set of zzso zzso several improved models with high internal prediction and low number of field variables were zzso External validation was performed to select a final model among zzso The zzso zzso maps of the final zzso model were compared with the properties of the active site in zzso and the consistency between them was zzso
