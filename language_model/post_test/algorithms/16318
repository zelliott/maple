zzso can undergo a variety of zzso changes upon zzso zzso Although different mechanisms may play a role, the phenomenon is commonly referred to as induced fit to indicate that the tight structural zzso of the interaction partners is a consequence of the binding zzso zzso methods need to take into account this ability of the zzso and the protein to mutually adapt to each other when forming a zzso zzso the zzso as flexible is already common practice in zzso zzso This is not yet the case for the zzso In fact, the accurate prediction of protein zzso changes upon zzso binding is still a major challenge, even more if zzso speed is an issue, as for example in virtual screening zzso However, significant progress has been made over the past years and many valuable approaches have become available to address the protein flexibility problem and to provide more reliable zzso predictions for complexes governed by significant zzso zzso This review provides a brief overview of the current situation, the most recent advances, and the remaining limitations of flexible protein zzso with particular focus on approaches handling protein flexibility simultaneously with zzso placement in the zzso zzso
