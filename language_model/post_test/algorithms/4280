Overcrowding in emergency departments zzso leads to reductions in quality of zzso zzso several different zzso tools have been developed to zzso patient zzso zzso in emergency medical services in different countries have limited the zzso of pre-existing zzso zzso for this reason, specific zzso corresponding to local characteristics are zzso zzso we developed a specific zzso zzso system named zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso This study tested its zzso and zzso 

zzso is a zzso nursing zzso zzso zzso agreement was tested by comparing zzso levels attributed to the same clinical scenarios at two different zzso zzso agreement was investigated by comparing zzso categories attributed to clinical cases by different zzso zzso Finally, zzso was estimated by studying the correlations between the zzso ranking assigned by the nurse and actual resource consumption and patient zzso 

The distribution of the difference between nurse zzso at the two times was statistically unrelated to which nurse carried out the zzso Regarding zzso agreement, assigned zzso were compared to the reference zzso Cohen's zzso zzso revealed an almost perfect agreement between zzso by nurses and the zzso Finally, statistical analysis revealed a strong relation between zzso and the overall need for supplementary clinical zzso Outcomes were also significantly correlated with zzso 

The need for a specific, zzso zzso tool in our zzso led us to develop a new zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the scale is a valid zzso tool with high zzso and zzso agreement and considerable zzso
