We investigate a zzso surface zzso resonance zzso sensor for sensitivity zzso The theoretical model containing an zzso layer of zzso is investigated using zzso zzso equations and the effective medium zzso The properties of the zzso zzso zzso versus the metal thin film thickness zzso length zzso and diameter D of the zzso are studied in the environment with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Compared to the conventional thin metal film zzso zzso the zzso zzso sensor presents a larger resonance angle shift and the sensitivity increases with increasing zzso index of the target zzso Besides the theoretical analysis, we zzso different zzso zzso zzso film zzso by zzso angle deposition and characterize their zzso responses using a zzso zzso setup in air and in zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso film sample, the zzso angles observed for zzso zzso film samples shift to larger angles in air (for shorter zzso while it is hard to observe the zzso angle in zzso water, which is zzso consistent with theoretical zzso We believe that the zzso zzso sensor is able to improve the sensitivity and the theoretical discussion is helpful for sensor zzso
