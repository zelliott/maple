zzso is an oral zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso A zzso phase zzso screening trial in human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso advanced breast cancer demonstrated a significant improvement in zzso survival zzso when zzso was added to zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso Most drug-related adverse events were Grade 1/2 in severity with the exception of Grade 3 zzso skin zzso zzso versus zzso zzso These results suggest a role for the combination of zzso and zzso in breast cancer and supported a phase 3 zzso zzso Here we describe zzso - a zzso zzso randomized, zzso phase 3 trial - assessing the addition of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso in advanced zzso breast zzso 

zzso criteria include zzso years of age, zzso prior chemotherapy regimen for zzso disease, and resistant zzso zzso and zzso or no indication for further zzso Prior treatment with a vascular zzso growth factor inhibitor is not zzso Patients with significant cardiovascular disease or active brain zzso are not zzso Patients are zzso by zzso status, geographic region, and prior zzso chemotherapy status and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso orally twice daily zzso days 1 to 14 of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso days 1 to 21, total dose 600 zzso or matching zzso zzso and zzso doses can be escalated to zzso zzso zzso and 400 zzso zzso respectively, as zzso or reduced to manage zzso zzso zzso after a reduction is allowed for zzso but not for zzso This dosing zzso was designed to mitigate zzso and other zzso in addition to detailed guidelines for zzso and symptomatic zzso zzso assessment is every 6 weeks for 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks zzso The primary zzso is zzso by blinded independent central review zzso zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso zzso Secondary zzso include overall survival, time to zzso overall response rate, duration of response, and zzso Enrollment began in November 2010 with a target of approximately zzso zzso 

zzso will provide definitive zzso data for the combination of zzso and zzso in advanced zzso breast cancer and better characterize the zzso zzso
