A two-dimensional coherent imaging equation is derived for zzso zzso zzso zzso which uses a zzso material to generate an interference pattern in the detection zzso This interference pattern, called a zzso pattern, zzso the zzso function zzso along the lateral zzso To derive the imaging zzso an equation for the zzso pattern is zzso zzso simulation results based on the imaging equation are zzso zzso response results show a zzso reduction in the zzso of the lateral zzso zzso response results show a nearly twofold improvement in zzso zzso
