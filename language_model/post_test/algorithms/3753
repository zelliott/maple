The growth of computing power has greatly improved our ability to extract quantitative information about complicated three-dimensional structures from microscope zzso New hardware techniques are also being developed to provide suitable images for these zzso However, a need exists for synthetic data to test these new zzso The work reported here was motivated by studies of zzso health, but similar needs exist across the field of zzso We report a rigorous computer model, based on Maxwell's zzso that can produce the required synthetic images for zzso differential interference contrast, zzso imaging, and zzso zzso After a description of the algorithm, sample results are zzso followed by a discussion of future plans and zzso
