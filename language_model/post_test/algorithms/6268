This paper presents two novel approaches to determine optimum growing zzso network zzso zzso The first method called direct method deals with expertise domain and levels in connection with local zzso The growing neural gas zzso zzso is used to cluster the local zzso The concept of error distribution is used to zzso error among the local zzso After reaching the specified size of the network, redundant experts removal zzso is invoked to prune the size of the network based on the ranking of the zzso However, zzso is not zzso due to too many network control zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso adopts zzso learning rates for zzso learning zzso In addition, zzso adopts a more rigorous zzso method called fully zzso simplified zzso resonance theory in a modified zzso Experimental results show zzso zzso comparative or even better performance than zzso in four benchmark examples, with reduced sensitivity to learning parameters zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso outperform the other neural networks and statistical zzso The efficacy of zzso is further justified in three industrial applications and a control zzso It provides consistent results besides holding out a profound potential and promise for building a novel type of zzso model consisting of several local linear zzso
