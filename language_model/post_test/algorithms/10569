We apply passive zzso to protein solutions and evaluate the viscous response to folding and zzso allowing us to accurately zzso both the thermodynamics of protein folding and the structural dimensions of the protein molecules with zzso zzso zzso approximations predict a measurable change in relative zzso as the zzso volume fraction of protein molecules increases during zzso zzso measures these changes to zzso evaluate the ensemble average characteristics of the unfolded state in a zzso zzso while minimizing the zzso unfolding and alignment associated with conventional zzso
