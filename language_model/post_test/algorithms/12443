We describe a new technique for the zzso of motor imagery electroencephalogram zzso recordings in a brain computer interface zzso zzso The technique is based on an zzso zzso analysis of zzso signals zzso using local zzso bases zzso derived from local zzso packets zzso In an zzso step, the zzso data obtained from the zzso zzso locations of the standard zzso system is zzso segmented in time, over a zzso grid by maximizing the zzso distances between expansion zzso corresponding to left and right hand movement zzso This is followed by a frequency domain zzso procedure in each adapted time segment to maximize the discrimination power of the resulting zzso zzso Then, the most zzso features from the resulting arbitrarily segmented zzso plane are zzso A principal component analysis zzso step is applied to reduce the zzso of the feature zzso This reduced feature set is finally fed to a linear zzso for zzso The online step simply zzso the reduced zzso features determined by the zzso step and feeds them to the linear zzso We provide experimental data to show that the method can adapt to zzso differences, zzso and zzso motor imagery zzso The zzso was applied to all nine subjects of the zzso Competition zzso The zzso performance of the proposed zzso varied between zzso and zzso across subjects using just two zzso The average zzso accuracy was zzso For comparison, we also implemented an zzso zzso model based zzso procedure that achieved an average error rate of zzso on the same subjects, and higher error rates than the proposed approach on each individual zzso
