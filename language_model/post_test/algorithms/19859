zzso genetic differences between male and females have been zzso to cause greater zzso in cognitive ability in zzso Males with only one X zzso tend to express the genes on the X zzso more fully than zzso who express an zzso of their two X zzso due to zzso Greater zzso in expression of genes on the X zzso could account for greater zzso in male cognitive zzso This would affect both the high and low ends of the cognitive ability distribution, but the possibility of high-end impact has drawn the most attention and zzso The objective of this paper was to outline a method to test for empirical evidence that greater zzso variation in males is associated with greater variation in cognitive ability in males at the high end of the zzso The method zzso zzso variation in the maternal X zzso of twins to test the effect of sex on zzso zzso We applied this method to g composite test scores at age 10 using data from the zzso Early Development zzso zzso zzso was used as an instrument reflecting whether twins had different maternal X zzso We estimated differences in the association between variation in the maternal X zzso in males and females and zzso variation in test scores using a difference in differences zzso of a linear zzso zzso We found no evidence supporting the proposition that the zzso effect of zzso in females resulted in greater variation in male cognitive zzso There was evidence of differential selection for cognitive ability in the sample, however, indicating that the value of our study was primarily to introduce a novel method of addressing the zzso
