The zzso model of the plate is established and the genetic simulated zzso zzso is developed for zzso of the mode distribution of the zzso zzso The experiment results indicate that the zzso model can simulate the real plate zzso And zzso aimed at the equal distribution of the modes in the zzso model is made to improve the corresponding sound pressure zzso
