zzso zzso zzso is the gold standard for long-term zzso zzso An adequate zzso candidate must have life expectancy longer than a few zzso Patients surviving less than three weeks should have a zzso tube, and zzso should be zzso There are few studies looking to zzso factors and fewer attempts of creating a predictor model for zzso patient's zzso 

The aim of this study was creating a zzso survival model for zzso candidates, using underlying disease, cholesterol, zzso and zzso 

Data was obtained from records of adult patients that underwent zzso between 1999 and zzso Patients surviving zzso 3 weeks were considered short zzso surviving zzso 3 weeks were considered adequate zzso A full zzso zzso model was used to zzso future cases into one of the two groups of zzso 

An equation for the probability of future cases was generated, in order to obtain a P zzso In the future, patients with a P zzso zzso will have a zzso probability of adequate zzso patients with a P zzso zzso will have a zzso probability of short zzso 

When clinical evaluation alone does not display a clear zzso this equation should be included in the evaluation of zzso candidates, avoiding useless zzso
