We developed and validated a heart failure zzso risk score combining daily zzso of multiple zzso zzso 

Heart failure patients from clinical studies with zzso devices were used to form two separate data zzso Daily zzso scores were estimated by combining changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso burden, rapid rate during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso night heart rate, heart rate zzso and activity using a zzso zzso zzso monthly zzso consisted of looking back at the maximum daily zzso risk score in the preceding 30 days, zzso the evaluation as high, zzso or low risk, and evaluating the occurrence of zzso zzso in the next 30 zzso We used an zzso model to compare survival free from zzso events in the next 30 days based on risk zzso 

The development data set consisted of 921 patients with zzso zzso of data and 91 months with zzso zzso The validation data set consisted of zzso patients with 10 655 zzso of data and zzso months with zzso zzso In the validation data set, zzso of monthly evaluations in zzso of the patients were in the high-risk zzso Monthly diagnostic evaluations in the high-risk group were 10 times zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso more likely to have an zzso hospitalization zzso rate of zzso in the next 30 days compared with monthly evaluations in the low-risk group zzso rate of zzso 

An zzso score based on zzso device zzso can identify increased risk for zzso hospitalization in the next 30 zzso
