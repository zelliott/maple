zzso examination of a liver biopsy zzso is regarded as the reference standard for detecting liver zzso zzso can be painful and zzso and assessment is zzso and prone to sampling zzso We developed a panel of sensitive automated zzso to detect zzso constituents and zzso of zzso zzso in serum to evaluate their performance in the detection of liver zzso 

In an international zzso cohort study, serum levels of 9 surrogate markers of liver zzso were compared with zzso stage in liver biopsy specimens obtained from zzso subjects with chronic liver zzso zzso analysis of a test set of samples was used to identify an zzso combining age, zzso acid, zzso zzso of type III zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso 1 that was subsequently evaluated using a validation set of biopsy specimens and serum zzso 

The zzso detected zzso zzso zzso and accurately detected the absence of zzso zzso zzso value for significant fibrosis, zzso area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot, zzso standard error, zzso P zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Performance was excellent for alcoholic liver disease and zzso fatty liver zzso The zzso performed equally well in comparison with each of the zzso In contrast, zzso agreement over zzso scores ranged from very good to moderate zzso zzso zzso 

Assessment of liver zzso with multiple serum markers used in combination is sensitive, specific, and zzso suggesting they may be used in conjunction with liver biopsy to assess a range of chronic liver zzso
