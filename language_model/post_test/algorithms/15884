Many patients were contaminated by blood products in the 1980s and early 1990s, a period during which there was no means of detecting zzso C virus zzso and measures of vigilance in French blood zzso centers were lacking in rigor, and it has become a real public health issue by zzso The blood zzso centers which produce and distribute the products are liable for such contamination, as long as the expert appraisal has established a link of causality between the zzso and the zzso When the viral zzso status zzso the zzso zzso of the donors is not known, experts often resort to indirect evidence, including use of probability estimates calculated according to the following zzso The probability zzso that there was at least one zzso donor among those having provided the blood given to a patient, is calculated using the following zzso zzso is the prevalence of subjects who have tested positive for zzso virus zzso in a population of blood donors, and N is the number of donors having contributed to the zzso in zzso Although the zzso chain reaction zzso is very sensitive, its zzso below which weak replication is zzso varies depending on the technique zzso One study has demonstrated that below a dilution of zzso zzso is no longer detected by the majority of zzso The specificity of zzso is not flawless either, since zzso results are found, probably resulting from contamination of the zzso Considering that zzso is a reasonable approximation of the prevalence of subjects who had zzso zzso that were zzso by zzso zzso zzso during that period, one can calculate the probability that there is a zzso donor among the blood donors who contributed to the product that was administered and determine a zzso
