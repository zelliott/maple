zzso zzso which often generate zzso proteins by fusing segments of two distinct zzso represent the single major genetic aberration leading to zzso We suggest that the unifying theme of these events is a high level of intrinsic structural disorder, enabling fusion proteins to evade cellular surveillance mechanisms that eliminate zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso human proteins show that they are significantly enriched in disorder zzso zzso zzso in all human zzso they have fewer zzso zzso and their zzso zzso tend to avoid domain zzso The vicinity of the zzso is significantly more zzso than the rest of these already highly zzso fusion zzso In the unlikely event of domain splitting in fusion it usually spares much of the domain or splits at locations where the newly exposed zzso surface area zzso that of an intact zzso The mechanisms of action of fusion proteins suggest that in most cases their structural disorder is also essential to the acquired zzso function, enabling the long-range structural communication of remote binding and/or zzso zzso In this respect, there are three major mechanisms that contribute to generating an zzso zzso zzso a zzso site and a zzso domain are zzso and structural disorder of the intervening region enables zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain zzso with a zzso zzso domain and disorder enables the two zzso within the zzso to engage in permanent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the fusion of a zzso element to a zzso domain results in an zzso zzso factor that causes severe zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our findings also suggest novel strategies of intervention against the ensuing zzso zzso
