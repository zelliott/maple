A zzso discrete time zzso model coupled through insect zzso is zzso The model is based on three different zzso Plant growth is followed by the zzso of insects followed by insect zzso Our objective is to understand how different zzso of zzso impact both local and global population dynamics of the zzso zzso Special attention is paid to two situations: When the zzso model zzso in the absence of zzso is permanent and when the zzso model exhibits zzso zzso The existence and stability of zzso and zzso dynamics between two patches is zzso If the zzso system is zzso the zzso of the system in two patches is destroyed by extremely large zzso and large attacking rates of insects, thus creating multiple zzso If the zzso model exhibits zzso effects, zzso and zzso results indicate that small intensity of zzso can generate zzso dynamics between two patches, while intermediate intensity of zzso promote the extinction of insects in both patches for certain zzso zzso Our study suggests a possible biology control strategy to stop the invasion of a zzso by controlling its migration between zzso
