In this paper, sliding mode control is zzso for stabilization of a particular class of zzso zzso differential inclusion systems with zzso This class of fractional order differential inclusion systems is used to model physical chaotic fractional order Chen and zzso zzso By defining a sliding surface with fractional integral formula, exploiting the concept of the state space norm, and obtaining sufficient conditions for stability of the sliding surface, a special feedback law is presented which enables the system states to reach the sliding surface and consequently creates a sliding mode zzso Finally, simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
