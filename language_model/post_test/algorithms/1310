zzso involving data from many locations throughout the world have now been conducted to assess the association between air pollution and zzso To date, six independent analyses of mortality data for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have been zzso In this new analysis of Philadelphia data for zzso zzso zzso models were developed to estimate the increased risk of daily mortality associated with air pollution while controlling for longer-term time trends and season and for zzso Model development was based on prior understanding of the effects of these factors on mortality and on consideration of model zzso The authors found moderate correlations of daily zzso of total suspended particles zzso sulfur dioxide zzso nitrogen dioxide zzso and carbon monoxide zzso and only slight correlations of ozone zzso with other zzso When included individually in the model, the means of current and previous days' levels of zzso zzso and zzso had statistically significant effects on total zzso zzso increases of an zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were associated with increases in mortality of around zzso for zzso and zzso and of around zzso for zzso The effects of zzso and zzso were diminished when both pollutants were simultaneously included in the model, whether zzso or in the full zzso zzso These analyses confirm the association between zzso and mortality found in previous studies in Philadelphia and show that the association is robust to consideration of other pollutants in the zzso 

Data from various studies on the association between air pollution and mortality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, undertaken in the period zzso are used in a new analysis in which the authors attempt to control for the effects of zzso factors, weather, and other pollutants in order to estimate the independent effect of total suspended particles zzso on zzso The results confirm the association between zzso and mortality found in previous studies in Philadelphia and show that the association is robust to consideration of other zzso
