The aim of this study was to evaluate the effective dose in zzso zzso and zzso procedures on the basis of the zzso product zzso either measured or calculated using two different zzso 

We studied zzso examinations carried out on several X-ray systems both in zzso and in zzso zzso Some of the systems were equipped with an zzso transmission chamber for zzso zzso for these systems we took direct zzso zzso for each type of zzso For the systems without the dose measurement device, we used a portable transmission chamber, acquiring the data from a set of sampling zzso We then derived the dose values from the zzso zzso data and the information about each zzso To this end, the zzso of each zzso system was done by measuring tube output in the different acquisition zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso data sheets were filled in after every examination indicating the exposure data zzso zzso zzso zzso distance and field zzso These values combined with the zzso data were used to evaluate the zzso for each zzso Where possible, we compared the measured and calculated zzso values by assessing the percentage zzso between each pair of zzso A similar comparison was made for the single examinations using a simplified calculation zzso reported in the zzso For all the examinations for which we had adequate survey data zzso we estimated the zzso and the entrance dose values and, with the aid of zzso software, the effective zzso 

The direct zzso of zzso showed that, in zzso zzso and zzso procedures, the zzso in examination conditions leads to a wide range of possible patient doses even within the same examination zzso The comparison between the measured and calculated zzso using our zzso showed substantial agreement zzso difference zzso maximum zzso By contrast, using the zzso proposed in the literature, we obtained zzso higher than zzso An estimate of the effective dose for all the recorded examinations zzso permitted evaluation of both magnitude and zzso of patient doses in special zzso procedures such as zzso and zzso zzso However, it should be noted that evaluations based on calculated zzso values may be as uncertain as those estimated for zzso and that clearly the evaluations made for the examinations for which direct zzso are available are more zzso In particularly zzso examinations in terms of entrance dose, where the threshold limits for deterministic effects might possibly be zzso the equivalent doses to critical zzso were also zzso This analysis showed that in a small percentage of patients zzso 2 zzso to the skin was exceeded in the areas exposed with possible transient zzso while in fewer than zzso of patients, the 3 zzso limit for temporary zzso was zzso 

Many zzso zzso especially zzso examinations have shown to give significant exposure to zzso The direct dose measurement method has shown to be the only method able to provide reliable information on such zzso the authors believe that since the patient dose cannot be established in advance, even in terms of magnitude and since direct dose measurement cannot be performed on all patients, it is nonetheless interesting to be able to zzso at least zzso the amount of the above zzso
