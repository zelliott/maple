In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a zzso Does this patient require zzso The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require zzso 

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo zzso 

A systematic review was performed using articles from zzso zzso zzso that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International zzso Society diagnostic criteria as a gold zzso and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying zzso pathology (with zzso zzso resonance imaging as the reference zzso 

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine zzso abstract data, and zzso zzso quality using predetermined zzso zzso was resolved by consensus with a third zzso 

Four studies of screening questions for migraine zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso met inclusion zzso All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were zzso The best zzso can be summarized by the zzso zzso zzso duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio zzso for zzso or possible migraine is 24 zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso if 3 are met, the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and if 2 or fewer are met, the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious zzso zzso zzso headache zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormal findings on zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undefined headache zzso not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso headache with aura zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso headache aggravated by exertion or a zzso maneuver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and headache with vomiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant zzso zzso 

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose zzso Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant zzso zzso and patients with these features should undergo zzso
