zzso changes in the side chains are essential for zzso zzso zzso states and zzso zzso zzso changes in the surface zzso were systematically studied on a representative set of protein zzso The zzso zzso were mapped onto zzso angles zzso The variable threshold zzso was developed to cluster the zzso angle zzso and to derive zzso defined as the most probable zzso in a zzso Six zzso libraries were zzso full surface, surface zzso and surface zzso for bound and zzso zzso The libraries were used to calculate the probabilities of the zzso transitions upon zzso The stability of zzso acids was zzso based on the transition zzso The zzso zzso stability was higher than that of the zzso Long side chains with three or four zzso angles were less stable than the shorter zzso The transitions between the zzso at the interface occurred more frequently than on the zzso zzso Most side chains changed zzso within the same zzso or moved to an adjacent zzso The highest percentage of the transitions was observed primarily between the two most occupied zzso The probability of the transition between zzso increased with the decrease of the zzso zzso The analysis revealed characteristics of the surface zzso zzso transitions that can be zzso in flexible zzso zzso
