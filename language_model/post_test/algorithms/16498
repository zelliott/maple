There is growing interest in zzso zzso which aims to identify all possible zzso of all target families using in zzso prediction zzso In particular, kernel methods provide a means of zzso compounds and proteins in a zzso manner and enable the exploration of zzso binding on a zzso zzso To better understand the link between zzso and targets, it is of fundamental interest to identify molecular interaction features that contribute to prediction of zzso zzso To this end, we describe a feature selection approach based on kernel zzso reduction zzso that works in a zzso space defined by zzso We further propose an efficient zzso to overcome a zzso bottleneck and thereby provide a useful general approach to feature selection for zzso Our experiment on zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown that the zzso is capable of identifying zzso features, as well as zzso features that are indicative of zzso preference for a given target zzso We further illustrate its zzso on the zzso data of zzso zzso by identifying influential zzso positions within zzso zzso These results suggest that our approach has the potential to uncover the molecular basis for zzso selectivity and zzso zzso
