The accurate prediction of the secondary and zzso structure of an zzso with different folding zzso is dependent on several factors, including the energy zzso However, an zzso zzso structure cannot be predicted accurately from its sequence based on a limited set of energy zzso The zzso and zzso forces between this zzso and other small molecules and zzso in addition to other factors in the cell such as zzso zzso strength, and temperature, influence the complex dynamics associated with transition of a single stranded zzso to its secondary and zzso zzso Since all of the factors that affect the formation of an zzso zzso structure cannot be determined zzso statistically derived potential energy has been used in the prediction of protein zzso In the current work, we evaluate the statistical free energy of various secondary structure zzso including zzso zzso hairpin zzso and internal zzso using their statistical frequency obtained from the comparative analysis of more than 50,000 zzso sequences stored in the zzso Comparative Analysis Database zzso at the Comparative zzso Web zzso zzso zzso energy was zzso from the structural statistics for several zzso While the statistical energy for a zzso stack zzso with zzso derived free energy values, suggesting a zzso distribution, variation is observed between different molecules and their location on the zzso tree of zzso Our statistical energy values calculated for several structural elements were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The combined statistical energy values for zzso zzso zzso and internal loop zzso result in a significant improvement in the accuracy of secondary structure zzso the hairpin zzso contribute the zzso
