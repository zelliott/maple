zzso to account for population structure zzso in zzso association studies have been well developed in samples of unrelated individuals, but when a sample is composed of families, the task of finding and accounting for zzso is not as straight zzso zzso tests that condition on parental zzso or their sufficient statistics are immune to biases due to zzso but are known to have low power, particularly for zzso zzso zzso approaches that use all available data are an attractive alternative, but the methods have not been evaluated for continuous outcomes when a sample has both family and zzso zzso we compare through simulation the performance of zzso zzso models that account for family and zzso with continuous outcomes using a range of family sizes and structures, including two and three zzso families with zzso and discrete zzso We find that when zzso time is a concern, the zzso et zzso efficient score test performs very zzso When zzso time is not an issue, a linear mixed effects model adjusting for genetic principal components tends to have slightly better power than the score test and may be zzso
