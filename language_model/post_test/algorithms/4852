The zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence is a rapid method for obtaining the average ratio of zzso to zzso relaxation times zzso as a function of zzso Since this is a one-dimensional experiment, the zzso ratio can be acquired, zzso in just two zzso the second scan being a reference zzso zzso zzso zzso is determined from a two-dimensional zzso relaxation correlation zzso The method described here offers a significant reduction in experimental time without a reduction in zzso The zzso ratio is useful for comparing the zzso of liquids in porous zzso Here we demonstrate the application of the zzso sequence to the study of zzso rocks by zzso oil or water saturated rock cores, and by observing the relative strengths of surface interaction for water in two types of rock by measuring zzso as a function of magnetic field zzso
