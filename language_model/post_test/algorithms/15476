The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk score zzso for childhood overweight based on a prediction model in zzso 

Analysis was conducted by using the UK Millennium zzso zzso The cohort was divided randomly by using zzso of the sample for derivation of the risk zzso and zzso of the sample for zzso zzso zzso zzso determined a prediction model for childhood overweight at 3 years defined by the International zzso Task Force zzso zzso metrics zzso area under the receiver operating curve zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso were zzso 

Seven zzso were found to be significantly associated with overweight at 3 years in a mutually adjusted predictor model: zzso birth weight, weight gain, maternal zzso zzso paternal zzso maternal smoking in pregnancy, and zzso zzso zzso scores ranged from 0 to 59 corresponding to a predicted risk from zzso to zzso The model revealed moderately good zzso ability in both the derivation cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and validation cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using a prediction zzso to identify zzso infants could reduce levels of child overweight and obesity by enabling health professionals to target prevention more zzso Further research needs to evaluate the clinical zzso zzso and zzso of zzso this zzso
