The shared features that characterize the noun categories that young children learn first are a formative basis of the human category zzso To investigate the potential zzso information contained in the features of zzso zzso we examine the zzso properties of zzso zzso The networks are built from the overlap of words zzso acquired by children prior to zzso years of age and zzso and conceptual zzso features acquired from adult feature generation zzso The resulting networks have zzso structure, indicative of a high degree of feature overlap in local zzso However, zzso zzso to their abundance and zzso networks more robust to feature omissions, while conceptual features are more discriminating and, per feature, offer more zzso information than zzso zzso Using a network specific cluster identification zzso (the zzso zzso zzso we also show that shared features among these zzso nouns create zzso groupings common to adult zzso zzso Again, zzso and conceptual features play distinct roles among different categories, typically with zzso features being more inclusive and conceptual features being more exclusive of category zzso The results offer new and testable hypotheses about the role of shared features in human category zzso
