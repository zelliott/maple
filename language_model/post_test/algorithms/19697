A new model is developed to recognize zzso promoter sequences from zzso sequences based on genetic zzso and neural network in this zzso zzso results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to recognize the promoter sequences on the training set and on the test zzso The mean recognition rate is as high as zzso on the training set and zzso on the test set, which shows the zzso has great prospect application in promoter zzso
