zzso of the mechanical zzso position is required as part of comprehensive quality assurance programs for zzso zzso zzso zzso Several techniques have been proposed for this purpose but each of them has certain zzso In this paper, a new efficient and more comprehensive method using zzso images has been introduced for automatic zzso of the zzso with sufficient accuracy for zzso zzso 

Using a circular zzso fixed to the zzso head to define the field, zzso images of a zzso phantom were acquired in zzso mode during zzso zzso zzso A robust zzso code was developed to analyze the data by finding the center of the field and the center of the ball bearing shadow in each image with zzso zzso The distance between these two centers was determined for every zzso The method was evaluated by comparison to results of a mechanical zzso and also by detection of a manual shift applied to the phantom zzso The zzso and zzso of the method were tested and it was also applied to detect couch and zzso zzso during zzso 

The accuracy of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was less than 3 pm and the zzso was less than 86 zzso The time elapsed for the analysis of more than 100 zzso images of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were approximately 65 and 20 zzso zzso zzso of images taken in integrated mode took zzso zzso The output of the analysis software is zzso and shows the zzso shifts as a function of angle in both zzso and zzso zzso It gives warning messages where the shifts exceed the criteria for zzso and provides useful data for the necessary adjustments in the system including bearing system and/or room zzso 

The comprehensive method introduced in this study uses zzso is highly accurate, fast, and independent of the zzso It tests all zzso angles and is suitable for zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso
