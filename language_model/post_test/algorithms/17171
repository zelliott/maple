The optimum management of the zzso neck remains zzso When the neck is observed it is hoped that close follow-up will detect regional failure at an early zzso To test this hypothesis we examined patients undergoing therapeutic neck dissection for newly developed neck zzso during observation after treatment of the primary zzso 

A retrospective chart review of 47 patients undergoing neck dissection for regional failure after surgical treatment of the primary tumor and observation of the neck from 1987 to 1992 was zzso The median time to failure in the neck was 13 zzso 

The clinical neck stage at the time of neck dissection was zzso in 37, zzso in 6, zzso in 1, and zzso in zzso However, zzso staging revealed stages of zzso in 19, zzso in 5, zzso in 20, and zzso in zzso zzso spread zzso was present in 23 patients zzso zzso 36 patients zzso had adverse zzso findings (N greater than 1 or zzso 

These data indicate that when observation is used for the neck at risk for zzso patients tend to fail with high stage disease in the zzso This supports the philosophy of zzso treatment of the neck but cannot show whether zzso treatment will improve zzso
