Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise to provide a better understanding of the zzso of human disease as well as the evolution of microbial zzso Single zzso zzso zzso are established genetic markers that aid in the identification of zzso affecting quantitative traits and/or disease in a wide variety of zzso zzso With today's technological capabilities, it has become possible to zzso a large set of appropriate candidate genes in individuals with a given disease in an attempt to identify zzso zzso In addition, zzso have been used extensively in efforts to study the evolution of microbial zzso and the recent application of random shotgun sequencing to environmental samples enables more extensive zzso analysis of zzso and zzso microbial zzso The program is available at zzso 

We have developed and present two modifications of an interactive zzso zzso zzso to aid in the analyses of the following types of zzso zzso zzso zzso data of zzso genes for discovery of associated and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso data for studying zzso zzso in microbial populations zzso The main features and capabilities of zzso are: 1) mapping of zzso to gene zzso 2) zzso of zzso based on their location in the zzso frequency of occurrence in samples and zzso zzso 3) zzso based on zzso zzso of zzso highlighting zzso as well as zzso zzso 4) integration of protein evolutionary conservation zzso and 5) display of automatically calculated zzso points that are zzso 

The main strength of zzso is its zzso interface and use of visual zzso which support interactive exploration and hence better understanding of large-scale zzso data by the zzso
