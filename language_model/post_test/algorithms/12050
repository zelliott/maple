This paper studies gene trees in subdivided populations which are constructed as perfect zzso from the pattern of zzso in a sample of DNA sequences and presents a new zzso for the probability distribution of such gene zzso The underlying evolutionary model is the zzso process in a subdivided zzso The zzso model of zzso is zzso zzso zzso questions that are discussed are maximum likelihood zzso of migration and zzso zzso detection of population growth by likelihood zzso determining the distribution of the time to the most recent common zzso of a sample of zzso determining the distribution of the age of the zzso on the gene zzso determining in which zzso the most recent common zzso of all the sequences was; determining zzso ancestors, where they were, and times to zzso and determining in which zzso zzso zzso A zzso technique of zzso and zzso used is a computer intensive zzso chain zzso which simulates gene trees conditional on their zzso implied by the zzso pattern in the sample of DNA zzso The software zzso which zzso these ancestral zzso techniques, is zzso
