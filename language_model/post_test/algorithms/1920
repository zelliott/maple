zzso of multiple proteins to DNA is crucial in many regulatory cellular zzso The zzso of assembly and zzso of zzso protein complexes is very difficult to study in detail due to the lack of suitable experimental zzso A zzso approach has been recently proposed to resolve zzso zzso of such zzso While zzso simple, the zzso approach generates experimental data with very complex zzso The analysis of these patterns is a challenging problem on its zzso Here we report on a mathematical approach that can extract a solution for the experimental data obtained in zzso analysis of sequential zzso of a DNA complex with multiple zzso This case describes the zzso of proteins zzso from the zzso Generally speaking, a mathematical solution of such problems requires calculations of multiple zzso Our approach reduces this procedure to taking double zzso and constructing their zzso We tested this approach with the experimental data obtained for three-step sequential zzso of complexes of DNA with two protein zzso
