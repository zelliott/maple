To provide an overview of decision trees based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As an example, we developed a zzso model intended to estimate the probability of zzso death from acute zzso zzso zzso 

We employed the minimum data set zzso of zzso zzso Madrid and the zzso Country zzso which included zzso patients with a diagnosis of zzso The zzso patients were randomly divided zzso and zzso into the development zzso zzso zzso zzso and the validation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso model was based on zzso algorithm, with a sensitivity analysis based on the zzso index and zzso We compared the results with those obtained by using both zzso zzso zzso and artificial neural network zzso zzso zzso zzso The developed models were contrasted with the VS and their properties were evaluated with the area under the zzso curve zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

In the zzso the zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ANN zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ANN zzso zzso 

None of the methods tested outperformed the others in terms of zzso zzso We found that the zzso model was much easier to use and zzso because the decision rules generated could be applied without the need for mathematical zzso
