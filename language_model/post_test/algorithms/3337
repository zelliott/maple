The aim of the study is to determine the results obtained with zzso zzso at zzso y zzso Hospital after 17 years of experience, comparing current results with those at the beginning of the zzso 

Between 1991 and December 2007, zzso zzso zzso were performed at the zzso y zzso zzso 1,849 patients were operated on between 1991 and 2000, and zzso between 2001 and zzso Patients studied included zzso of women and zzso of men, with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso In all, zzso of patients had a zzso disease before surgery zzso diabetes, zzso heart disease, respiratory zzso Surgery was performed by a staff surgeon for zzso of cases, and by a resident in the remaining zzso zzso indications were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and others in zzso of zzso 

Mean hospital stay was zzso zzso zzso to open surgery was required for zzso of cases zzso zzso The major surgical complication rate was zzso with the most frequent being zzso zzso Common zzso duct injury occurred in thirteen cases zzso 51 patients zzso were soon zzso and 5 patients died zzso When the results of both decades zzso zzso zzso were zzso we observed differences in the number of procedures performed by residents zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso number of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso conversion rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and mean hospital stay zzso zzso zzso days, p zzso zzso 

These results should be interpreted with caution as this is a retrospective study with multiple uncontrolled variables zzso number of surgeons and continuous learning zzso The lower conversion rate and mean hospital stay in the first decade of the learning curve are amazing, although this could be related to better patient selection and a lower number of zzso operated using a zzso approach in the initial zzso In general, these results are acceptable and zzso with the rest of the zzso
