The receiver operating characteristic zzso curve is an important tool to gauge the performance of zzso In certain situations of zzso data analysis, the data is heavily zzso zzso most features tested belong to the true negative zzso In such cases, only a small portion of the zzso curve is relevant in practical terms, rendering the zzso curve and its area under the curve zzso insufficient for the purpose of judging zzso zzso Here we define an zzso surface zzso using true positive rate zzso false positive rate zzso and true discovery rate zzso The zzso surface, together with the associated zzso volume under the surface zzso and zzso area under the zzso curve zzso provide a useful approach for gauging zzso performance on zzso zzso zzso The zzso as an R package is available at zzso
