zzso evaluation of autopsy zzso 

To explore zzso changes that occur with aging in zzso and cortical bone of the human zzso zzso 

Human zzso bone is continuously subjected to external forces zzso that promote changes in inner zzso This functional zzso is zzso however, and when lost, zzso bone progressively zzso and becomes subject to injury with increases in mechanical zzso 

Bone zzso were drilled with a zzso from three regions zzso zzso central zzso and zzso of the third zzso zzso bodies of 48 autopsy cases 31 to 76 years zzso Two consecutive zzso sections obtained 150 zzso apart were stained with zzso blue and zzso zzso and photographed at zzso zzso in numerous zzso factors were evaluated by age and region of the vertebra using zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Starting at about 50 years of age, zzso zzso progressive decreases occurred in zzso and cortical bone volume zzso zzso zzso zzso surface area zzso zzso zzso number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and thickness of zzso zzso zzso zzso Space between zzso increased from ages 31 to 70 years and then decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso deterioration was significantly more pronounced in central versus lateral regions zzso zzso zzso zzso bone thickness decreased significantly with aging in central regions but increased in lateral regions between ages 61 and 70 years zzso zzso zzso 

The balance between cortical and zzso bone maintains the strength of the zzso body until about the age of 50 years, when irreversible deterioration begins in central regions and subsequently involves lateral zzso
