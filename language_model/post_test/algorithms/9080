To investigate the sensitivity of zzso of the spine compared with CT zzso zzso in detecting zzso zzso 

Between July 1998 and October 2010, 12 patients with zzso headache and a zzso spinal zzso leak underwent an zzso of the spine with and without zzso Using zzso as the gold standard, we zzso investigated the sensitivity of spinal zzso in detecting a zzso zzso 

Eleven of 12 patients with a zzso leak documented by zzso also had zzso fluid collections on spinal zzso zzso zzso Six patients with zzso fluid collections on spinal zzso also had spinal zzso zzso 

When compared with the gold standard of zzso zzso of the spine appears to be a sensitive and less invasive imaging zzso for detecting a spinal zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of the spine should be the imaging zzso of first choice for the detection of spinal zzso zzso
