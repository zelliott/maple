zzso analysis of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso signals is an excellent approach to detect functional connectivity between different zzso zzso In our current research, the zzso phase synchronization index zzso zzso ) is of special zzso We prove the existence of stable and unstable zzso dependent upon the analysis zzso and show that they lie closely together in the frequency zzso Thus, a plot of the zzso plane of the zzso zzso automatically violates the sampling zzso and zzso the method cannot be considered as a black zzso A zzso approach is presented that can detect robust zzso while ignoring the unstable zzso The improved zzso detection is evaluated in zzso experiments on using both simulated and real-life zzso It can be demonstrated that the transient synchronization events between zzso zzso in distant frequency ranges can be detected and that zzso zzso zzso synchronization patterns can be reliably zzso
