zzso freedom after zzso zzso surgery is not obtained in a substantial number of patients with medically intractable zzso zzso neural network analysis is a promising technique for more accurate identification of the target areas for zzso surgery, but a better understanding of the correlations between changes in functional network organization due to surgery and zzso seizure status is zzso We explored these correlations in zzso zzso zzso recordings of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings were obtained at baseline zzso zzso and at zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso We assessed zzso functional connectivity and performed a minimum spanning tree zzso network zzso The zzso captures the most important connections in the zzso We found a significant positive correlation between functional connectivity in the lower alpha band and seizure frequency at zzso especially in regions where zzso were zzso zzso leaf zzso a measure of integration of information in the network, was significantly increased between zzso and zzso only for the zzso zzso This is in line with previous work, which showed that lower functional network integration in zzso zzso patients is related to higher zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso zzso which are measures of zzso decreased between zzso and zzso in seizure free patients, also in regions that were zzso close to zzso zzso Our results increase insight into functional network changes in successful zzso surgery and might eventually be zzso for zzso of zzso zzso
