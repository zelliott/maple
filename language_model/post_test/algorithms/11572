A new zzso for molecular shape description is zzso The zzso based on considering each zzso as a collection of its zzso zzso is applied to both the graph theory and geometrical coordinate representations of zzso The timing results for shape description of several databases indicate that this new method is zzso to large zzso Furthermore, results from zzso a small database show good agreement with zzso results obtained by a zzso zzso
