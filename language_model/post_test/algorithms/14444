We propose a general theoretical framework for analyzing zzso expressed genes and behavior patterns from two zzso short zzso zzso The framework zzso the recently proposed zzso Independence zzso zzso framework adapting it to the zzso scenario by utilizing zzso analysis for data zzso The proposed framework is effective in yielding criteria that can identify both the zzso expressed genes and zzso patterns of interest between two zzso experiments without requiring to explicitly cluster the zzso The results, obtained by applying the proposed framework with a linear kernel zzso on various data sets are found to be both biologically meaningful and consistent with published zzso
