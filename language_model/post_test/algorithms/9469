Comprehensive identification and zzso of the zzso factors zzso in a given zzso is an important aspect in understanding zzso regulatory networks of a specific zzso zzso are an ancient group of zzso bacteria with strong variation in zzso size ranging from about zzso to zzso zzso and little is known about their zzso zzso zzso we constructed the zzso database to zzso and analyze all the putative zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso comparative zzso 

In the current release, zzso contains zzso putative zzso identified from 21 fully zzso zzso zzso Through its zzso interactive zzso users can employ various criteria to retrieve all zzso sequences and their detailed zzso information, including sequence features, domain architecture and sequence similarity against the linked zzso Furthermore, zzso provides zzso trees of individual zzso family, multiple sequence alignments of the zzso zzso and zzso identification from any selected zzso Comparative analysis revealed great zzso of the zzso sequences in zzso zzso The high zzso on the gene number and domain organization would be related to their diverse biological functions and their adaptation to various environmental zzso 

zzso provides a zzso warehouse for comparative analysis of putative zzso in zzso zzso The availability of such an extensive database would be of great interest for the community of researchers working on zzso or zzso regulatory networks in zzso zzso can be freely accessible at zzso and will be continuously updated when the newly zzso zzso zzso are zzso
