The objective of this study was to develop an estimate of a radio frequency zzso dose as the amount of mobile phone zzso energy absorbed at the location of a brain zzso for use in the zzso zzso zzso 

We systematically evaluated and zzso all the main parameters thought to influence the amount of specific zzso energy absorbed in the brain from mobile telephone zzso For this, we identified the likely important zzso of zzso specific energy zzso rate during protocol and questionnaire design, we collected information from study subjects, network operators and laboratories involved in specific energy zzso rate zzso and we studied potential zzso of phone output through the use of zzso zzso Data collected were zzso to assess the relative importance of the different factors, leading to the development of an zzso to evaluate the total cumulative specific zzso energy (in zzso per zzso or dose, absorbed at a particular location in the zzso This zzso was applied to zzso Study subjects in five zzso 

The main zzso of total cumulative specific zzso energy from mobile phones were communication system and frequency band, location in the brain and amount and duration of mobile phone zzso Though there was substantial agreement between zzso of subjects by cumulative specific zzso energy and cumulative call time, zzso was zzso particularly at higher frequency zzso zzso such as zzso power control (except in Code Division Multiple Access zzso zzso transmission and conditions of phone use were found to have a relatively minor influence on total cumulative specific zzso zzso 

While amount and duration of use are important zzso of zzso dose in the brain, their impact can be substantially modified by communication system, frequency band and location in the zzso It is important to take these into account in analyses of risk of brain zzso from zzso exposure from mobile zzso
