This paper is concerned with the problem of zzso fuzzy tracking control for a class of zzso zzso zzso systems with input zzso To overcome the design difficulty from zzso zzso zzso a smooth zzso function of the control input signal is first introduced to approximate the zzso zzso then, an zzso fuzzy tracking controller based on the zzso zzso is constructed by using zzso zzso The proposed zzso fuzzy controller guarantees that all signals in the zzso system are bounded in probability and the system output eventually zzso to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal in the sense of mean zzso zzso zzso results further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control zzso
