zzso of obesity is substantial and recent zzso of zzso association studies zzso have been successful in detecting several robustly associated zzso regions for obesity using zzso zzso zzso However, taken together, the zzso explain only a small proportion of the overall zzso Copy number variations zzso might contribute to the zzso zzso We searched zzso for association between common zzso and zzso extreme zzso Four hundred and zzso zzso obesity trios and an independent sample of 453 extremely obese children and adolescents and 435 zzso and lean adult controls were zzso by the zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso We detected 20 common copy number variable regions zzso which were associated with zzso The most promising zzso were zzso in an independent sample of 365 obesity zzso confirming the association for two candidate zzso We identified a common zzso exclusively covering the three zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso to be associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso in a total of zzso zzso odds ratio for the obesity effect zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso We also zzso two common deletions (near zzso and at zzso zzso that have previously been reported to be associated with body zzso Additionally, we support a rare zzso on zzso 16 that has recently been reported by two independent zzso However, rare zzso had not been the focus of our zzso We conclude that common zzso are unlikely to contribute substantially to the genetic basis of zzso extreme zzso
