zzso families evolve a zzso of functions through gene duplication, zzso and other zzso As a number of studies have zzso standard methods of protein function prediction produce systematic errors on these zzso zzso zzso zzso tree construction, integration of experimental data and differentiation of zzso and zzso been proposed to address these errors and improve the accuracy of functional zzso The explicit integration of structure prediction and analysis in this zzso which we call structural zzso provides additional insights into protein zzso zzso 

zzso of protein functional zzso using zzso analysis show fewer expected false zzso overall than when zzso methods of functional zzso are zzso We present an overview of the motivations and fundamental principles of zzso analysis, new methods developed for the key tasks, benchmark zzso for these tasks (when zzso and suggest procedures to increase zzso We also discuss some of the methods used in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso 

Software tools from the Berkeley zzso Group are available at zzso
