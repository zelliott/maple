Calling animals may be located from zzso of the differences in acoustic travel time at pairs of zzso For zzso fields of speed, locations can be made with better accuracy when the location zzso allows the speed to vary from path to zzso A new geometrical shape, called an zzso is zzso It is the locus of points corresponding to a constant difference in travel time along straight paths between the animal and two zzso Its properties allow an interpretation for locations when the speed differs from path to zzso An zzso has been developed for finding the location of calling animals by zzso zzso from data collected at pairs of zzso When the sound speed field is zzso zzso zzso become zzso Unlike a zzso that extends to zzso an zzso is confined to a finite region of space when the speeds differ between the animal and each of two zzso Its shape is significantly different than a zzso for cases of practical zzso zzso can be used to better understand locations of calling animals and other sounds in the sea, zzso and zzso
