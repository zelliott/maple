During zzso zzso zzso electrical zzso waves are fragmented, and the heart cannot contract in zzso It has been proposed that zzso waves zzso from stable periodic sources zzso called zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to determine if stable zzso are consistently present on the zzso surface of hearts comparable in size to human zzso Using new optical mapping technology, we zzso zzso from nearly the entire zzso surface of six isolated zzso zzso Using newly developed pattern analysis zzso we identified and tracked zzso wave fronts and phase zzso zzso the zzso point of a zzso wave zzso We introduce the notion of a compound zzso in which the zzso central zzso can change and describe an zzso for automatically identifying such zzso This prevents zzso lifetimes from being inappropriately zzso by wave front fragmentation and collision events near the zzso We found that stable zzso zzso were not consistently present during zzso only 1 of 17 zzso episodes contained a compound zzso that lasted for the entire mapped zzso of 4 zzso However, zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso compound zzso with lifetime zzso zzso were visible on the zzso at any given zzso We conclude that zzso mother zzso do not drive zzso in this experimental zzso if mother zzso do exist, they are zzso or zzso This paucity of persistent zzso suggests that individual zzso will eventually terminate by themselves and therefore that the continual formation of new zzso is critical for zzso zzso
