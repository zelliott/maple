In this paper, we introduce a modified optimal control model of drug scheduling in cancer chemotherapy and a new zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso to solve zzso Working closely with an oncologist, we first modify the existing model, because its equation for the cumulative drug toxicity is inconsistent with medical knowledge and clinical zzso To explore multiple efficient drug scheduling policies, we propose a novel variable zzso zzso zzso and modify the elitist genetic search operators in the zzso The simulation results obtained by the modified model match well with the clinical treatment experiences, and can provide multiple efficient solutions for zzso to zzso Moreover, it has been shown that the evolutionary drug scheduling approach is simple, and capable of solving complex cancer chemotherapy problems by adapting zzso versions of evolutionary zzso
