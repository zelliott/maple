A novel technique based on evolutionary zzso is proposed here to zzso the average rotation zzso zzso of ball zzso linked into zzso chains using zzso zzso of the markers attached to the external surface of the corresponding articulated zzso The chain is zzso solved by zzso minimizing the zzso of the marker distances from the actual zzso through an zzso strategy method zzso from zzso to zzso zzso In particular, the technique is compared to the zzso zzso method, recently proposed in literature and implemented through a zzso solution zzso in conditions of random and systematic noise superimposed to the marker zzso zzso from simulated motions showed that, in case of small range of motion (5 degrees , 10 degrees ) the performance of zzso is really unreliable whereas zzso provided satisfactory zzso zzso propagation along the zzso chain was found to be zzso Also in the case of systematic zzso zzso provides an accuracy that is zzso better than that of the zzso As a case study, zzso was applied to the in zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso in the lower spine region using a specific marker zzso A set of spine movements by a normal adult male, recorded by an zzso motion capture system, were processed with the developed zzso The zzso of the estimated average zzso was small zzso zzso in agreement with the literature data from zzso studies and X-ray zzso
