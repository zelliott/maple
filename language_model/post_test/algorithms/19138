A zzso acoustic technique for predicting the coating layer thickness of a drug tablet is zzso Quality of tablet zzso can play a major role in the effectiveness of drug zzso Many pharmaceutical zzso consist of a tablet core and a coated outer zzso Variations in the tablet coating can be indicative of various process problems and, therefore, is of a concern for quality zzso In the current zzso measurement system, an zzso zzso and laser zzso detection for predicting the coating layer thickness of a drug tablet is zzso Drug zzso with different coating thicknesses are zzso via an acoustic field generated by an zzso zzso in a frequency range sufficiently high to zzso their several zzso zzso The tablet surface zzso responses are acquired at a number of measurement points by a laser zzso in a zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso method and Newton's method, was developed and demonstrated to extract the coating layer thicknesses of the zzso from a subset of the measured resonance zzso
