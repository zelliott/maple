We introduce zzso digital zzso zzso as a method for quantitative zzso phase imaging of buried layers in zzso zzso The procedure is based on the acquisition of multiple zzso for different zzso zzso the intensity over wavelength zzso wise and using an inverse zzso transform leads to a zzso of the multilayered zzso zzso a windowed zzso transform with a narrow window, we choose a zzso interest zzso which is used to zzso filtered interference patterns that just contain information of this limited zzso We use the angular spectrum method to introduce an additional spatial filtering and to reconstruct the corresponding zzso After a short theoretical framework we show experimental zzso results for the zzso
