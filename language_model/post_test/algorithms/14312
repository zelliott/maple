zzso neighborhood methods for learning entail zzso of class conditional probabilities based on relative zzso of samples that are zzso of a test zzso We propose and explore the behavior of a learning zzso that uses linear zzso and the principle of maximum zzso zzso We consider some theoretical properties of the zzso zzso zzso weights have exponential zzso the estimates are zzso and the estimates are robust to additive zzso In relation to bias reduction, we show that zzso contain a test point in their convex zzso zzso The common linear zzso solution used for zzso on zzso or zzso is shown to solve a related maximum zzso zzso zzso simulation results support use of the method, and performance on a pipeline integrity zzso problem demonstrates that the proposed zzso has practical zzso
