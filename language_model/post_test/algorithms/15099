zzso zzso zzso zzso has successfully been used in the management of angina during the last several zzso Although important information on the pharmacological actions and efficacy of zzso have been zzso to date, limited research has been conducted on its effects on cerebral blood zzso In recent years, with the aid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PET zzso zzso zzso it has been shown that marked cerebral blood flow changes occur under treatment of a wide zzso of zzso zzso of the pharmacological mode of action of zzso has gained momentum with the discovery of zzso oxide zzso as an zzso zzso and with the knowledge that zzso acts as a NO zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso over 10 zzso on the cerebral blood flow, using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso model, as well as the effects of its drug interactions with therapeutic agents that influence cerebrovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The present study with zzso indicates that the response time to measure cerebral blood flow effects seems to be present and an important factor as the transient is relatively zzso The current treatment regime with zzso indicates a slight increase, when compared with control control results, although not zzso except for regional significant increases in particular the zzso regions of the zzso Drug interaction between zzso and zzso may occur as a reduction of zzso in cerebral blood flow from the control control was observed in this zzso The results for the combination of zzso with zzso showed a further increase of the cerebral blood flow to near significance, when compared with the control results and is significantly increased zzso when compared with zzso treatment zzso zzso treatment with zzso may therefore be compromised with simultaneous administration of zzso or NO donor zzso The combination of zzso and zzso suggested that the increase in cerebral blood flow is primarily attributed to the influence of zzso The cerebral blood flow effects of these drugs and possible interactions during an angina attack need to be zzso
