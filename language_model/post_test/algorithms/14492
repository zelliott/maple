A zzso zzso zzso model, based upon National zzso zzso System zzso Data System zzso data for calendar years zzso was developed to predict the probability that a zzso vehicle will contain one or more occupants with serious or zzso zzso These vehicles were defined as containing at least one occupant coded with an zzso zzso zzso zzso of greater than or equal to 15, in zzso zzso crash events involving Model Year 2000 and newer cars, light trucks, and zzso The target injury outcome measure was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso National Expert Panel on Field zzso in their recent revision of the Field zzso zzso zzso (American College of Surgeons, zzso The parameters to be used for crash injury prediction were subsequently specified by the National Expert zzso Model input parameters zzso crash direction zzso left, right, and zzso change in zzso zzso multiple zzso single impacts, belt use, presence of at least one older occupant zzso 55 years zzso presence of at least one female in the vehicle, and vehicle type zzso pickup truck, van, and sport zzso The model was developed using predictor variables that may be readily available, zzso from zzso zzso zzso Model sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, using a probability zzso of zzso The area under the receiver operator characteristic zzso curve for the final model was zzso zzso zzso seat belt use and crash direction were the most important zzso of serious zzso Due to the complexity of factors associated with zzso injuries, a separate screening zzso is needed to model injuries associated with this crash zzso
