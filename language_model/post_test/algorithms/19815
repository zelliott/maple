Recently promising trials of innovative biomedical approaches to prevent zzso transmission have been zzso zzso zzso to the prevention methods zzso the analyses and interpretation of trial zzso The influence of variable sexual behaviors within and between participants of trials further obscures zzso Current zzso and statistical approaches in zzso studies, as well as ongoing debates on contradictory trial results, may fail to accurately address these zzso 

Through developing a cumulative probability model of infection within zzso prevention trials, we demonstrate how adherence and sexual behavior patterns impact the overall estimate of effectiveness, the effectiveness of prevention methods as a function of zzso and conclusions about zzso true zzso zzso the model to zzso data from the zzso trial, we observe markedly different values for the true method effectiveness of the zzso and show that if the gel would have been tested among women with slightly different sexual behavior patterns, conclusions might well have been that the gel is not zzso 

Relative risk and adherence analyses in zzso prevention trials overlook the complex interplay between adherence and sexual behavior zzso zzso they may not provide accurate estimates of zzso and zzso Moreover, trial conclusions are contingent upon the zzso sexual behavior pattern of participants and cannot be directly generalized to other zzso We recommend researchers to zzso their data and use the cumulative probability model to estimate the true method effectiveness, which might contribute to resolving current questions about contradictory trial zzso Moreover, we suggest taking into account the issues raised in the design of future trials and in population models zzso the impact of large-scale dissemination of prevention zzso zzso of the topics described will help readers to better interpret (apparently zzso trial zzso
