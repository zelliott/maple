zzso exchange methods are widely used for the purposes of accelerating the zzso sampling of small organic molecules and zzso and, to a lesser extent, to explore structural transformations in small zzso zzso Though the general ability of such approaches to enhance the sampling efficiency of both zzso and organic systems makes replica exchange methods ideal candidates for simulations of zzso and zzso inherent limitations have largely restricted their zzso to small system sizes and/or short zzso and their potential in this area has not yet been thoroughly zzso This chapter provides an introduction to the standard replica exchange molecular dynamics method and presents more advanced zzso zzso which are designed to improve the efficiency of the replica exchange procedure in large zzso zzso
