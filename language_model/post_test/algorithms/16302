Current zzso modeling methods for predicting zzso interactions zzso have difficulty in the zzso zzso zzso of sequence zzso Threading methods extend coverage further into the twilight zone by aligning primary sequences for a pair of proteins to a zzso template complex to predict an entire three-dimensional zzso We introduce a zzso approach, zzso which focuses only on the protein zzso Our approach combines a novel linear programming zzso for interface alignment with a boosting zzso for interaction zzso We demonstrate its efficacy on zzso a zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and on the entire zzso zzso zzso provides significantly improved prediction of zzso and their zzso in stringent zzso on zzso Furthermore, by combining our predictions with a zzso zzso we achieve a coverage of zzso for the zzso zzso which is close to a 50% increase over previous methods at a higher zzso As an application, we effectively combine zzso with zzso data to identify novel zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso organization, and zzso complex zzso zzso is available at zzso
