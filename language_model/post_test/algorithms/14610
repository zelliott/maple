In the study of neural zzso it becomes essential to discern the different zzso cell types that build the zzso Traditionally, zzso cell types have been classified using qualitative zzso More recently, several attempts have been made to zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso While useful, these zzso do not take advantage of previous information known to the investigator, which could improve the zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso the problem to discern among different cell types is particularly difficult and better methods are needed to perform objective zzso Here we explore the use of supervised zzso zzso to zzso zzso based on their zzso features, using a database of 128 zzso cells and 199 zzso from mouse zzso To evaluate the performance of different zzso we used, as a zzso the test to automatically distinguish between zzso cells and zzso defining zzso zzso by the presence or absence of an zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso with a battery of different supervised zzso zzso finding that supervised zzso outperformed zzso zzso In addition, the selection of zzso of distinguishing features enhanced the zzso accuracy for both sets of zzso The analysis of selected variables indicates that zzso features were most useful to distinguish zzso cells from zzso when compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that supervised zzso zzso are better matched to the general problem of distinguishing zzso cell types when some information on these cell groups, in our case being zzso or zzso is known a zzso As a zzso of this zzso study, we provide several methods to automatically distinguish zzso zzso cells from zzso based on their zzso
