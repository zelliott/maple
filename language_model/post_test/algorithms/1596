The aim was to determine the agreement between absorbed dose zzso using the zzso and treatment planning system calculations in ideal circumstances, zzso zzso zzso before deciding upon action zzso 

A zzso metal oxide semiconductor zzso transistor zzso Technologies, Morrisville, zzso in zzso zzso system was subjected to a zzso evaluation that tested standard and zzso field conditions related to treatment planning system calculations for an zzso zzso 

The system was found to perform within manufacturer zzso zzso uniformity was found to be within zzso when measured using a method described by zzso A modification used to assess statistical distribution of response showed an increase in the value of two standard zzso (2 zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso which was still within the zzso value of zzso zzso The tests using the zzso phantom also zzso the fact that patient density zzso in the region of the zzso point will affect the dose calculated by the treatment planning system and delivered to the zzso 

The zzso system does not account for these zzso leading to dependence in the zzso between expected and reported dose on zzso and choice of calculation zzso
