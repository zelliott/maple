The risks of currently available invasive procedures in body zzso motivate a need for safer, zzso technologies for improving the appearance of body zzso A new device has been developed that uses focused therapeutic ultrasound to reduce zzso tissue zzso The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel zzso focused ultrasound system zzso zzso Tel zzso zzso in reducing localized fat deposits to improve body zzso 

A prospective study was conducted on 30 healthy zzso All patients underwent three treatments, at zzso zzso and were followed for 1 month after the last zzso Areas treated were the abdomen, inner and outer zzso zzso inner knees, and breasts zzso zzso No other body zzso procedure was used during the zzso zzso was determined by change in fat zzso assessed by ultrasound zzso and by circumference zzso Weight change was monitored to assess whether reduction in fat thickness or circumference was dependent on or independent of weight zzso Safety was determined by clinical findings, zzso of serum zzso and liver ultrasound evaluation for the presence of zzso 

All patients showed significant reduction in subcutaneous fat thickness within the treated zzso The mean reduction in fat thickness after three treatments was zzso zzso zzso was reduced by a mean of zzso zzso Weight was unchanged during the treatment and follow-up zzso No adverse effects were zzso 

This study shows the efficacy and safety of focused zzso using the zzso zzso I, as a zzso zzso method for reducing unwanted fat deposits in the zzso Multiple treatments combined with appropriate patient and treatment area selection can produce dramatic improvements in body zzso
