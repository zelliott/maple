The zzso screening model for realistic zzso zzso method has been established as a novel way to predict zzso data for liquid systems and has become a frequently used alternative to force zzso molecular simulation methods on one side and group contribution methods on the zzso Through its unique combination of a quantum chemical treatment of zzso and zzso with an efficient statistical thermodynamics procedure for the molecular surface zzso it enables the efficient calculation of many properties that other methods can barely zzso This review presents a short zzso of the theory, the application potential and limitations of zzso and its most important application zzso
