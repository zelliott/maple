We report on a simple correlation method for lifetime zzso using a random modulated zzso light zzso We use an intensity correlation function of zzso for lifetime zzso In this method, no reference timing of the zzso is zzso We apply the correlation method to measure zzso zzso and successfully demonstrate in the analysis of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso cells under zzso and zzso conditions to understand the oxygen dynamics in individual zzso The method is zzso to faster zzso time zzso down to a zzso range when the detection system is zzso Current zzso correlation zzso can easily be modified for lifetime zzso expanding the zzso in biological zzso
