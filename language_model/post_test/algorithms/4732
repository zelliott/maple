zzso sensory feedback is believed to contribute significantly to maintaining walking zzso Patients with diabetic peripheral zzso have a greatly increased risk of zzso Previously, we demonstrated that slower walking speeds in zzso patients lead to improved local dynamic zzso However, all subjects exhibited significant local instability during walking, even though no subject fell or stumbled during zzso The present study was conducted to determine if and how significant changes in peripheral sensation and walking speed affect zzso stability during zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso were examined from two prior experiments that compared patients with significant zzso to healthy controls and walking at multiple different speeds in young healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for each time series to zzso the zzso stability of these zzso All subjects exhibited zzso stable walking zzso even though these same zzso were previously shown to be locally zzso zzso in zzso stability between zzso and control subjects were small and, with the exception of knee joint movements zzso not statistically significant zzso zzso in knee zzso stability were not zzso by differences in walking zzso This was supported by our finding that although zzso stability improved slightly with slower walking speeds, the correlations between walking speed and zzso stability were generally weak zzso Thus, zzso patients do not gain improved zzso stability as a result of slowing down and do not experience any loss of zzso stability because of their sensory zzso
