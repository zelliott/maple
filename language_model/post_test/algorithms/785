The zzso web server zzso provides remote access to methods for protein structure alignment and zzso motif zzso zzso is unique among such zzso in that it improves both the motif definition and the sensitivity of a structural similarity search by combining the search and motif discovery methods and using information from each process to enhance the zzso In a typical run, a query structure is aligned to all structures in one of several databases of single domain targets in order to identify its structural neighbors and to discover a motif that is the basis for the similarity among the query and statistically significant zzso This process is fully zzso but options for manual refinement of the results are available as zzso The server uses the zzso zzso and customized controls to allow for zzso of the motif and of structural zzso In addition, we provide an interface to the zzso 2 zzso for rapid alignments of a query structure to smaller numbers of zzso zzso
