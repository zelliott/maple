A model of the muscle zzso was developed based on its anatomical zzso The model contains three zzso fibers zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso gamma zzso to the zzso fiber and zzso gamma zzso to zzso and chain zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and secondary zzso As in the real muscle zzso the zzso model, under the zzso of gamma zzso responds to the zzso muscle fiber zzso Both zzso zzso and II zzso of the model were compared extensively with published data, under both zzso stretch (with different stretch zzso and zzso and ramp and hold stretch (with different stretch zzso and zzso in three different zzso zzso conditions zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso and without gamma zzso Model zzso zzso responses fit the published data well with active gamma zzso but less well in the passive zzso Model II zzso responses also fit the published data, although less quantitative data were available for zzso The model correctly predicted the fractional power dependence of the primary and secondary ending responses on stretch zzso The current model provides a powerful tool for simulation studies of zzso systems, and demonstrates the feasibility of using a structural approach to model complex zzso zzso
