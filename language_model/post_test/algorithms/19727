To assess the value of zzso exams prescribed in case of in zzso zzso death, to result in the establishment of a new zzso of diagnostic zzso 

A retrospective analysis on a series of 106 zzso gathered between September 1989 and December 1998 in the zzso and zzso department of the zzso University Hospital which is a zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso death occurring as from the date of zzso zzso Thus, only zzso from 24 weeks and zzso were included in this zzso We excluded all zzso occurring during medical termination of pregnancy and cases with incomplete data zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The different exams asked by the physician were screened and we zzso their zzso to determine the zzso diagnosis for each zzso The search for significant risk factors was also taken into zzso We compared our management of in zzso zzso death with data from the literature to propose a new zzso 

The zzso of in zzso zzso death could be attributed in zzso percent of the zzso The principal causes were in zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anomalies zzso infections zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maternal diabetes zzso The remaining zzso are divided in to zzso zzso In zzso of the cases we could not find any explanation to the death of the zzso The exams that yielded the most information when done were: zzso autopsy which was abnormal in zzso zzso investigation which was abnormal in zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which was abnormal in zzso zzso zzso for infections was zzso in zzso of the zzso 

We present here a protocol for the diagnostic management of zzso which is differentiated according to the circumstances surrounding the zzso This should prove useful to reduce superfluous zzso
