zzso data have been widely used in biological and medical studies to discover gene and protein zzso Due to the high zzso principal component analysis zzso is often involved for data dimension zzso However, when a few principal components zzso are selected for dimension reduction or considered for dimension determination, they are typically ranked by their zzso zzso However, this approach is not always effective in subsequent zzso analysis, particularly zzso To maximize information from data with a subset of the zzso we apply a different ranking zzso zzso zzso zzso which considers zzso and zzso zzso rather than total zzso in the classical zzso Four prevalent zzso methods are considered and compared using zzso zzso These methods are illustrated with three real zzso data sets, two zzso data sets and a nuclear magnetic resonance zzso data zzso
