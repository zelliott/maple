As zzso continues to establish itself as an effective zzso research zzso there is an increasingly urgent need for efficient, automated analysis techniques capable of effectively dealing with the vast amounts of data generated via mass zzso Wholesale analysis packages, often used to deal with these enormous amounts of data, may benefit from zzso targeted analyses as current research begins to emphasize zzso protein zzso protein zzso and poorly characterized zzso We demonstrate the application of a new analysis technique based on mathematical correlation that is zzso efficient and robust against different instruments, noise levels, and experimental zzso We have previously shown that this technique is able to extract pertinent mass shift signals from zzso data, corresponding to the neutral loss of a modification from a zzso zzso a loss of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Here we show that an extension of this method is zzso to zzso and zzso data in general, allowing zzso of zzso that produce a particular mass shift zzso be it from differential stable isotope zzso overlap of zzso zzso in a series, or zzso that produce a neutral zzso The application of this method allows the researcher to discover individual features, such as the presence of specific modified or zzso labeled zzso to eliminate overlapping zzso zzso series, and to zzso specific sites of zzso
