The zzso of the zzso Image Analysis Contest zzso zzso was zzso with the Brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso methods in the zzso domain were used for zzso on zzso test statistics of zzso contrasts relevant to the zzso design of the study, zzso the average response across all active blocks, the main effect of speaker, the main effect of sentence, and the interaction between sentence and zzso zzso zzso was seen with all these zzso In particular, different zzso zzso blocks produced elevated zzso in bilateral regions of the superior zzso lobe and repetition suppression for linguistic materials zzso zzso zzso blocks) in left inferior frontal zzso These are regions previously reported in the zzso Additional regions were detected in this study, perhaps due to the enhanced sensitivity of the zzso zzso sentence suppression was tested zzso by zzso of an exponential zzso model onto the extracted time series from the left inferior frontal zzso but no strong evidence of such an effect was zzso The significance levels set for the zzso maps are zzso at which we expect zzso zzso cluster per zzso Nominal type I error control was verified by empirical testing of a test statistic corresponding to a randomly ordered design zzso The small size of the zzso effect zzso sensitive methods of detection of brain zzso zzso methods permit the necessary flexibility to develop novel test statistics to meet this zzso
