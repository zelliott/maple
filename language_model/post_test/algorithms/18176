zzso the optimal stimuli for a sensory zzso is often a difficult process involving trial and zzso By analyzing the relationship between stimuli and responses in zzso and stable zzso neural network models, we find that the stimulus yielding the maximum firing rate response always lies on the zzso boundary of the collection of all allowable zzso provided that individual zzso have increasing zzso relations or gain functions and that the synaptic connections are zzso between layers with zzso weight zzso This result suggests that in zzso experiments under these conditions, only stimuli on the boundary need to be tested in order to maximize the response, thereby potentially reducing the number of trials needed for finding the most effective zzso Even when the gain functions allow firing rate zzso or zzso a peak still cannot exist in the zzso relation in the sense that moving away from the optimum stimulus always reduces the zzso We further demonstrate that the condition for zzso synaptic connections also implies that proper stimuli can independently zzso the activities of all zzso in the same zzso One example of this type of manipulation is changing the activity of a single zzso in a given processing layer while keeping that of all others zzso Such stimulus zzso might help zzso isolate the interactions of selected zzso within a zzso
