zzso ultrasound is widely used in medical applications to extract the blood zzso flow zzso in the arteries via spectral zzso The spectral analysis of zzso signals and particularly zzso signals requires adequate tools that should present both good time and frequency zzso It is well-known that the most commonly used zzso zzso zzso which provides a zzso zzso is limited by the intrinsic zzso between time and frequency zzso zzso methods have then been introduced as an alternative to overcome this resolution zzso However, the performance of those methods zzso when high zzso are present in the zzso zzso For the purpose of accurately zzso the zzso frequency shift, even when the zzso flow zzso is rapid zzso zzso we propose to combine the use of the zzso zzso zzso method and the zzso pole zzso This proposed method performs well in the context where zzso are very zzso A comparative evaluation has been made between classical zzso zzso and zzso (both block and zzso zzso Among zzso zzso we test an zzso zzso method as well as a zzso zzso zzso Finally, the superiority of the zzso zzso approach in terms of frequency tracking and delay in the frequency estimate is illustrated for both simulated and in zzso zzso zzso
