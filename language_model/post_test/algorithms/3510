We present a distributed zzso architecture for smart zzso that is composed of multiple control zzso each with a specialized level of zzso Our architecture is zzso and zzso in the sense that each control loop can add to the competence level of the zzso below, and in the sense that the zzso can present a zzso zzso with respect to vision zzso At the zzso level, the processing of sensory information enables a robot to become aware of the approximate location of an object in its field of zzso On the other hand, at the finest end, the processing of stereo information enables a robot to determine more precisely the position and orientation of an object in the coordinate frame of the zzso The processing in each module of the control zzso is completely independent and it can be performed at its own zzso A control zzso ranks the results of each loop according to certain confidence zzso which are derived solely from the sensory zzso This architecture has clear advantages regarding overall performance of the system, which is not affected by the zzso zzso and regarding fault zzso since faults in one module does not affect the other zzso At this time we are able to demonstrate the utility of the architecture for zzso visual zzso The architecture has also been applied to mobile robot navigation and can easily be extended to tasks such as zzso
