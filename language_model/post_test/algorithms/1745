We investigate both zzso and zzso the zzso group equations in two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso The position of the critical points of the two phase transitions for zzso is established and the critical index zzso is zzso For zzso and 17 the critical points are located by zzso Carlo simulations, and some of the corresponding critical zzso are zzso The behavior of the zzso zzso is studied for zzso 7, and zzso Using these and other available zzso Carlo data we discuss the zzso of the critical points with N and some other open theoretical zzso
