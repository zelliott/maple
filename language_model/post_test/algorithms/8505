zzso which is considered to be a major source of morbidity following total hip joint replacement, has been notoriously difficult to measure accurately, particularly in the zzso zzso In order to study zzso zzso specialized software for computerized zzso zzso scan image analysis has been zzso This software zzso eliminates metal artifacts, allows three-dimensional zzso of the CT image, and reconstructs the segmented image to provide an accurate representation and measurement of volume for zzso zzso In the present study, 20 patients underwent zzso zzso volume determination using zzso functional assessment zzso the Harris zzso zzso the Western Ontario and zzso University zzso Index, and the short form 36 zzso and two-dimensional analysis of zzso zzso wear using zzso plain zzso zzso zzso correlated directly with the zzso wear rate zzso risk zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso If one patient with an zzso zzso one patient with zzso dislocation, and one patient with a Biomet zzso are zzso then the correlation between wear and zzso is improved zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso the current study demonstrates both the feasibility of CT imaging of zzso zzso and the correlation between zzso wear and zzso volume, providing a potential outcome measure for clinical trials that are designed to examine interventions in this complex disease zzso
