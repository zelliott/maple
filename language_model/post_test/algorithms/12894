A design for a zzso multiple zzso pattern phase retrieval technique using a zzso mirror zzso is analyzed within the zzso of complex zzso zzso its use in conjunction with dynamic zzso The variable focal length zzso positioned at a zzso plane of a lens comprises the zzso optical zzso system that replaces the time-consuming zzso zzso in the conventional zzso multiple plane zzso Compared with a spatial light zzso a zzso has a smooth continuous surface which avoids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The calculated distances for the proposed zzso are evaluated zzso using the conventional zzso phase retrieval zzso Two distance ranges are investigated depending on whether the measurement planes satisfy the zzso detector sampling condition or zzso It is shown zzso and zzso that zzso patterns measured at the zzso range still yield good zzso A zzso with a surface height of 25 zzso and an zzso diameter of zzso zzso may be used to reconstruct zzso phase patterns with zzso fringe zzso
