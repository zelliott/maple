We have been investigating analysis of knee joint zzso or zzso zzso signals as a potential tool for zzso diagnosis and monitoring of cartilage zzso In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparative study of different zzso representations of zzso zzso zzso poles and zzso zzso were derived from zzso models of zzso segmented zzso zzso Signal features and a few clinical features were used as feature zzso in pattern zzso experiments based on zzso zzso analysis and the zzso zzso The results using 51 normal and 39 abnormal signals indicated the superior performance of zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso with an accuracy rate of zzso With 51 normal and 20 abnormal signals limited to zzso zzso zzso zzso again gave the highest accuracy rate of zzso
