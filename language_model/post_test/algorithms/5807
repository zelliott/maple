zzso zzso zzso identification is one of the most important steps in membrane protein structure zzso zzso zzso zzso tend to pursue accurate zzso models without carefully considering the zzso of these models and thus act as a black zzso In this paper, a novel zzso predictor called zzso with excellent zzso while possessing high prediction accuracy is zzso The zzso uses a zzso map zzso to learn zzso distribution knowledge, which is zzso in the zzso zzso of the trained zzso from the training zzso Human zzso fuzzy rules are then extracted from the zzso zzso of the trained zzso By zzso fuzzy rules from the learned knowledge rather than the original training samples, on the one hand, the zzso burden of zzso fuzzy rules can be greatly zzso on the other hand, the reliability of the extracted rules can also be enhanced since noise contained in the original samples can be zzso by the learning procedure of zzso The zzso of the fuzzy rules extracted by zzso is zzso and zzso zzso Experimental results on the benchmark zzso show that the zzso zzso most existing popular zzso zzso and is flexible to suite for a wide variety of problems in zzso The zzso software is implemented by zzso and zzso and is available for academic use at: zzso
