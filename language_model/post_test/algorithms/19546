As the evaluation of zzso function can be complex in the setting of a busy cardiac operating room, its assessment may benefit from an zzso approach using zzso zzso We developed a diagnostic zzso which was then applied in a series of cardiac surgery patients to determine whether moderate to severe left zzso zzso dysfunction zzso and right zzso zzso dysfunction zzso can predict difficult separation from zzso bypass zzso 

An zzso using zzso zzso interrogation of the zzso and zzso zzso the pulmonary and zzso zzso flow, and tissue zzso interrogation of the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The study was divided in two zzso involving two groups of patients undergoing cardiac zzso In phase I, zzso evaluations of patients zzso zzso zzso were used to test the zzso of the zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso using Cohen's zzso values which were calculated in three specific zzso In phase II, the zzso was applied to a second group of patients zzso group, zzso zzso zzso to explore its zzso zzso The primary zzso in phase II was zzso 

In phase I, the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso In phase II, moderate or severe degrees of zzso were observed in 29 patients zzso and moderate to severe zzso was observed in 18 patients zzso before cardiac zzso Both moderate and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso before surgery were observed more frequently in patients with zzso 

zzso and severe zzso and zzso can be identified with very good zzso and both degrees of zzso dysfunction are associated with zzso
