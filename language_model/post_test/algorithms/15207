zzso zzso zzso aim to provide a means for people with severe motor disabilities to control their environment directly with neural zzso In zzso zzso for people with zzso the decoder that maps neural activity to desired movements has typically been zzso using zzso zzso imagination of control while a zzso automatically moves to targets on a computer zzso However, because neural activity can vary across zzso a decoder zzso using OL data may not be optimal for zzso zzso neural zzso Here, we tested whether zzso zzso creates a better decoder than OL zzso even when all other factors that might influence performance are held constant, including the amount of data used for zzso and the amount of elapsed time between zzso and zzso 

Two people with zzso enrolled in the zzso pilot clinical trial performed a zzso task using an zzso zzso switching between zzso that had been zzso on OL versus zzso zzso 

Even when all other variables were held constant, zzso zzso improved neural control as well as the accuracy and strength of the tuning zzso zzso the zzso decoder using additional and more recent data resulted in further zzso 

zzso in neural activity between OL and zzso contexts contribute to the superiority of zzso zzso even prior to their additional zzso zzso In the near future, zzso decoder zzso may enable robust neural control without needing to pause zzso practical use of zzso an important step toward clinical zzso
