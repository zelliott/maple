zzso zzso can be obtained by plotting two respiratory signals on an zzso zzso the resulting zzso represent a zzso description of the respiratory zzso In zzso zzso are commonly measured during tidal breathing and their interpretation is hampered by high zzso zzso Therefore a two-dimensional averaging technique for zzso has been zzso The zzso is based on zzso of the zzso and required two zzso First, the total length of the loop of every breathing cycle was divided into a specified number of zzso intervals and the zzso calculated by zzso linear approximation of the zzso Second, averaged zzso were calculated using the zzso mean (or the median if there were zzso of the zzso and y zzso of the zzso for all calculated zzso To compare the new technique with averaging in the time domain a simulation study was performed using respiratory signals with a zzso of variation zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to the new technique, with increasing zzso averaging in the time domain led to increasing zzso in the averaged zzso zzso Mean errors of peak tidal zzso flow were zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas errors with the new technique were considerably lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso and independent of the level of zzso
