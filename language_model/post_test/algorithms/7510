Respiratory motion remains a major challenge for zzso coronary magnetic resonance zzso zzso Recently, zzso reconstruction has been zzso with zzso motion compensation to correct for the effects of respiratory zzso The major challenge of this approach is the zzso of dense deformation zzso In this work, the application of such a zzso reconstruction is proposed for accelerated zzso Cartesian zzso zzso Without the need for extra zzso data or user interaction, the zzso zzso due to respiratory motion are directly estimated on the acquired image zzso zzso experiments on 14 healthy volunteers were performed to compare the proposed method with the result of a zzso reference zzso While reducing the acquisition time by one third, the reconstructed images resulted in equivalent vessel sharpness of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
