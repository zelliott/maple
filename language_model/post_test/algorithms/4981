The mouse has become the most popular zzso for investigating molecular mechanisms of body weight zzso But understanding the zzso context by which a zzso exerts its effect on body weight requires knowledge of energy zzso energy zzso and fuel zzso Furthermore, zzso of these variables made at an isolated time point cannot explain why body weight has its present value since body weight is determined by the past history of energy and zzso zzso While food intake and body weight changes can be frequently measured over several weeks (the relevant time scale for zzso zzso frequent zzso of energy expenditure and fuel selection are not currently zzso To address this issue, we developed a mathematical method based on the law of energy conservation that uses the measured time course of body weight and food intake to estimate the underlying zzso dynamics of energy output and net fat zzso We applied our methodology to male zzso mice consuming various ad zzso diets during weight gain and loss over several weeks and present the first zzso estimates of energy output and net fat zzso rates underlying the observed body composition zzso We show that transient energy and fat imbalances in the first several days following a diet switch can account for a significant fraction of the total body weight zzso We also discovered a zzso curve relating body fat and zzso masses in male zzso mice, and the shape of this curve determines how diet, fuel selection, and body composition are zzso
