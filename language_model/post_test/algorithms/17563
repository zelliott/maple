zzso is the third position from the N zzso in the zzso with zzso backbone zzso zzso All 20 zzso acids have been placed in the zzso position of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso content measured by circular zzso zzso at 273 zzso The dependence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso identity has been used to determine a free energy scale by analysis with a modified zzso zzso zzso theory that includes a zzso for the zzso energy zzso The most stabilizing zzso at zzso in rank order are Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Free energies for the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could not be zzso The results correlate with zzso zzso and zzso interior energies and not at all with zzso zzso This completes our work on studying the structural and energetic preferences of the zzso acids for the zzso positions of the zzso These results can be used to rationally modify protein stability, help design zzso and improve prediction of zzso location and zzso
