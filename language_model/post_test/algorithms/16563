We developed and tested a new computer program to match zzso sets of incompatible live zzso pairs from a national paired kidney donation zzso zzso Data of 32 incompatible pairs included zzso and 4 zzso donor and recipient zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three test runs were zzso in which donors were excluded from matching to recipients with either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso at zzso zzso 1) or zzso at high-resolution zzso 2) or zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso Run 1 identified 22 703 possible combinations, with 20 pairs in the top zzso Run 2 identified 24 113 combinations, with 19 pairs in the top ranked and Run 3 identified zzso combinations, with 17 pairs in the top zzso Review of zzso in Run 1 revealed that six recipients had zzso zzso causing a possible positive zzso resulting in breakdown of two zzso and three zzso zzso In Run 2, four recipients had zzso zzso also potentially causing breakdown of three zzso zzso The more prudent approach of excluding from matching recipients with zzso with zzso reduces the probability of matched pairs having a positive zzso without significantly decreasing the number of possible zzso
