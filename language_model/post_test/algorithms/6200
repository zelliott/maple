The Geometric zzso Model is developed for accurate colon zzso zzso as part of an automatic zzso zzso zzso The zzso model zzso the zzso surface found by an automatic seed location and zzso zzso The challenges to applying the zzso model are zzso showing the definition of the stopping function as the key to accurate zzso The limitations of current stopping criteria are examined and a new definition, tailored to the task of colon zzso is zzso First, a zzso edge operator is used to locate high confidence zzso These boundaries are then integrated into the stopping function using a distance zzso The hypothesis is that the new stopping function results in a more accurate representation of the zzso surface compared to previous zzso functions of the zzso zzso This hypothesis is tested using observer ratings of colon surface zzso at 100,000 randomly selected locations in each of four zzso The results show that the surfaces determined by the modified zzso model better represent the zzso surface zzso
