zzso zzso diffusion potential zzso zzso inside zzso in the zzso made of zzso and various amounts of cholesterol was measured by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In any zzso the values of membrane potential obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreed well with those calculated from the imposed zzso concentration zzso using the zzso zzso and were not affected by the presence of zzso However, both delta zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso showed smaller values than delta zzso zzso when the cholesterol content in zzso zzso delta zzso zzso at a stationary state was much smaller than delta zzso zzso The zzso order zzso of the zzso zzso with various cholesterol content was estimated from zzso polarization of zzso The results indicated that the zzso of zzso or zzso into zzso containing a large amount of cholesterol is strongly restricted by the high ordering of zzso zzso zzso
