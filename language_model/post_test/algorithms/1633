A variety of functionally important protein properties, such as secondary structure, zzso zzso and zzso accessibility, can be zzso as a labeling of zzso zzso Indeed, the prediction of such properties from the primary zzso acid sequence is one of the core projects of zzso zzso zzso a panoply of approaches have been developed for predicting such zzso however, most such approaches focus on solving a single task at a zzso zzso by recent, successful work in natural language processing, we propose to use zzso learning to train a single, joint model that exploits the zzso among these various labeling zzso We describe a deep neural network architecture that, given a protein zzso zzso a host of predicted local properties, including secondary structure, zzso accessibility, zzso zzso signal peptides and zzso zzso The network is trained jointly on all these tasks in a supervised fashion, zzso with a novel form of zzso learning in which the model is trained to distinguish between local patterns from natural and synthetic protein zzso The zzso architecture of the network zzso the need for zzso feature zzso We demonstrate that, for all of the tasks that we considered, our approach leads to statistically significant improvements in performance, relative to a single task neural network approach, and that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art zzso
