Many clinical procedures introduce holes into thin zzso that are typically under zzso stresses and finite zzso Such incisions change the stresses and strains from their zzso values, which may induce cells to alter their orientation and zzso organization as well as to zzso zzso change their synthesis of zzso or even to enter the cell death zzso To correlate such changes in cellular activity with changes in the mechanics, we need solutions for the native and the zzso boundary value zzso Such problems will often be complex and require a finite element zzso weak solutions should be evaluated zzso however, at least for special zzso zzso we present a zzso solution of the governing zzso ordinary differential equation for the special case of stress zzso due to the introduction of a circular hole into a zzso zzso zzso circular membrane that exhibits a zzso zzso Among other results, we show that the zzso plays an increasingly greater role as the size of the hole becomes smaller, which is of course a goal of minimally invasive zzso
