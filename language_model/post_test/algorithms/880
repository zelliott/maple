zzso quality control zzso data have been reported to be zzso zzso correlation may increase the rate of false alarms if the traditional zzso weighted moving average zzso control chart to monitoring the process mean is zzso False alarms are the focus of this paper, where an alarm is defined as the occurrence of a zzso value outside the three standard zzso control zzso 

Daily zzso zzso of common zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso quantities were recorded during several months while methods and zzso showed no signs of zzso The time series were examined for zzso and the performance of the zzso chart was compared with that of the zzso chart when zzso was zzso 

Many of the time series showed significant signs of zzso Using the zzso chart to monitor the process mean, false alarms were noted for positively zzso time series, while this was seldom the case when the zzso chart was zzso For some zzso the zzso chart gave zzso However, when the process zzso and therefore the limits of the control chart were zzso the alarms given by the zzso chart were reduced or zzso In some cases the mean level changed over time, which is expected due to zzso This problem will be the topic of a subsequent zzso 

Positive zzso may be present in zzso zzso In this case the zzso chart should be used in place of the zzso zzso
