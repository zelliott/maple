zzso failures constitute an important vulnerability of interconnected zzso Here we focus on the study of such failures on networks in which the connectivity of zzso is constrained by geographical zzso Specifically, we use random geometric zzso as representative examples of such spatial networks, and study the properties of zzso failures on them in the presence of distributed zzso The key finding of this study is that the process of zzso failures is zzso on spatial networks, and thus, zzso zzso made from analyzing an ensemble of such networks lead to incorrect conclusions when applied to a single network, no matter how large the network zzso We demonstrate that this lack of zzso disappears with the introduction of a small fraction of long-range links into the zzso We simulate the well studied zzso zzso removal strategy for cascade zzso and show that it is largely ineffective in the case of spatial zzso We introduce an zzso strategy designed to limit the loss of network zzso in the event of a cascade triggering failure and show that it performs better than the zzso zzso Finally, we consider a real-world spatial network zzso a European power transmission network and validate that our findings from the study of random geometric zzso are also borne out by simulations of zzso failures on the empirical zzso
