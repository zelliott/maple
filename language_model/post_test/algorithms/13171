The anomalous zzso of the zzso structure functions of a passive zzso field zzso by the zzso field governed by the zzso zzso equation is investigated by the field zzso zzso group and the zzso expansion with inclusion of additional ultraviolet zzso related to the spatial dimension zzso Some modification of the standard minimal zzso scheme is used to calculate the turbulent zzso number and the anomalous zzso within the zzso approximation of a zzso zzso It is shown that the taking into account of these additional zzso is in full agreement with results obtained in the framework of the usual zzso expansion technique, which are valid for zzso
