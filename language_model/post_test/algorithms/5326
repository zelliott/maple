We study a model of coupled zzso with zzso first nearest neighbors zzso with periodic boundary zzso We show that a stable zzso solution is decided by the zzso at the borders between the major zzso which merge to form a larger one of all zzso at the stage of complete zzso We are able to locate these four zzso depending only on the set of the initial zzso Using these results plus an educated guess zzso by zzso zzso of the functional dependence of the corrections due to periodic boundary conditions, we are able to obtain a formula for the critical zzso at which the complete synchronization state zzso Such formula fits well in very good accuracy with the results that come from zzso zzso This also helps to determine the sizes of the major clusters in the vicinity of the stage of full zzso
