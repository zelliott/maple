This paper describes an zzso method for determining the beta dose distribution in zzso and it describes the associated testing and zzso The method uses electron transport theory and zzso techniques to analyze the responses of a zzso zzso dosimeter zzso zzso Specifically, the method determines the effective beta energy distribution incident on the dosimeter system, and thus the system performs as a beta zzso zzso transport theory provides the mathematical model for performing the zzso zzso In this zzso parameters are determined that produce calculated doses for each of the zzso components in the zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso parameters describe an effective incident beta zzso This method can be used to determine the beta dose specifically at 7 zzso X zzso or at any depth of zzso The doses at 7 zzso X zzso in tissue determined by this method are compared to those zzso determined using an zzso zzso For a great variety of pure beta sources having different incident beta energy zzso good agreement is zzso The results are also compared to those produced by a commonly used empirical zzso Although the zzso method produces somewhat better results, the advantage of the zzso method is that its performance is not sensitive to the specific method of zzso
