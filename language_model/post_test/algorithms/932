This paper presents the statistical technique known as the zzso to the general audience of zzso The zzso introduced by zzso (1979), allows data analysts to study the distribution of sample statistics that might otherwise be too complicated to zzso The technique, which requires simple calculations, involves drawing repeated samples (with zzso from the zzso the zzso distribution and then building a distribution for a statistic by calculating a value of the statistic for each zzso The zzso can be used to obtain confidence zzso standard zzso and even higher moments for the zzso It is similar to the well-known zzso of zzso and zzso After discussing the history and theory of both the zzso and the zzso we illustrate the use of the zzso in the statistical analysis of correlation zzso and the general linear zzso
