The alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso crops in zzso Its management is based mainly on chemical control of larvae whenever the larvae exceed the action zzso To develop and validate zzso sequential sampling plans, an intensive sampling zzso for zzso zzso eggs was carried out in two alfalfa plots located in the Province of zzso Argentina, from 1999 to zzso Using zzso for zzso of zzso Plans software, 12 additional independent data sets were used to validate the sequential sampling plan with precision levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso For a range of mean zzso of zzso to zzso zzso an average sample size of only 27 and 26 sample units was required to achieve a desired precision level of zzso for the sampling plans of Green and zzso zzso As the precision level was increased to zzso average sample size increased to 161 and 157 sample units for the sampling plans of Green and zzso zzso We recommend using Green's sequential sampling plan because it is less sensitive to changes in egg zzso These sampling plans are a valuable tool for researchers to study population dynamics and to evaluate integrated zzso management zzso
