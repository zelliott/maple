This paper proposes a zzso basis function neural network zzso called the zzso zzso that reproduces different zzso basis functions zzso by means of a real zzso zzso The architecture, weights and zzso zzso are zzso through a hybrid zzso zzso In order to test the overall performance, an experimental study with zzso data sets taken from the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso was compared to zzso with zzso zzso and inverse zzso zzso in the hidden layer and to other zzso zzso including different zzso design methods, support zzso machines zzso a sparse zzso zzso zzso zzso regression, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regression, zzso The results show that the zzso model can be considered very competitive with the other zzso zzso
