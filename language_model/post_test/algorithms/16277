The aim of this work is to evaluate the role of different amount of zzso and scatter on zzso image volume zzso using a zzso method based on the zzso zzso ratio and target zzso A phantom study was designed employing 3 phantom sets, which provided a clinical range of zzso and scatter conditions, equipped with 6 spheres of different volumes zzso zzso The zzso were: zzso the Hoffman zzso brain zzso zzso a modified International zzso technical Commission zzso phantom with an zzso ring of water bags of 3 zzso thickness fit over the zzso zzso and zzso a modified zzso phantom with an zzso ring of water bags of 9 zzso The zzso cavities were filled with a solution of zzso at zzso zzso activity zzso and the spheres with activity concentration ratios of about 16, 8, and 4 times the background activity zzso Images were acquired with a zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined as a percentage of the maximum intensity in the cross section area of the zzso To reduce statistical fluctuations a nominal maximum value is calculated as the mean from all zzso zzso zzso To find the zzso value that yielded an area A best matching the true value, the cross section were zzso in the zzso corrected slices varying zzso in step of zzso until the area so determined differed by less than 10 zzso versus its known physical zzso Multiple zzso methods were used to derive an zzso zzso zzso and to test its dependence on different conditions of zzso and zzso The errors of scatter and zzso correction increased with increasing amount of zzso and scatter in the zzso Despite these increasing zzso PET threshold zzso zzso resulted not influenced by the different condition of zzso and zzso The test of the hypothesis of zzso zzso lines for the three zzso used provided no statistical basis for believing that the three lines are not zzso zzso zzso needed to implement zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso of PET volumes can be devised in different conditions of zzso and zzso This opens the possibility of defining a unified zzso method for target zzso in different anatomical zzso
