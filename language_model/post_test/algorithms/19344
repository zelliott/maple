This paper presents an automated method for the zzso of the vascular network in retinal zzso The zzso starts with the extraction of vessel zzso which are used as guidelines for the subsequent vessel filling zzso For this purpose, the zzso of four directional differential operators are processed in order to select connected sets of candidate points to be further classified as zzso zzso using vessel derived zzso The final zzso is obtained using an zzso region growing method that zzso the contents of several zzso images resulting from vessel zzso dependent zzso zzso Our approach was tested on two publicly available databases and its results are compared with recently published zzso The results demonstrate that our zzso zzso other solutions and zzso the average accuracy of a human observer without a significant degradation of sensitivity and zzso
