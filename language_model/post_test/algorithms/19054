Previous studies demonstrated substantial zzso of the location of primary visual zzso zzso in zzso coordinates when linear zzso registration is used to match zzso image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso areas 17 and 18 brought into zzso zzso and how zzso zzso zzso However, other qualitative reports of zzso location zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso region of the cerebral zzso in man and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eddington, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The topography and zzso of the primary visual zzso in zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso variation of the human primary zzso implications for zzso brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested a consistent relationship between zzso and the surrounding cortical zzso Here, the relationship between folds and the location of zzso is zzso using zzso analysis to generate a zzso zzso of human zzso zzso (about 200 zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 7 T of ex zzso human cerebral zzso allowed identification of the full area via the zzso of zzso a zzso feature specific to zzso zzso zzso scans were acquired using zzso at zzso T to allow zzso and mesh reconstruction of the cortical gray zzso For each individual, zzso was manually identified in the high-resolution volume and projected onto the cortical zzso zzso zzso registration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso averaging and a coordinate system for the cortical zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso was performed to align the primary cortical folds of individual zzso to those of a reference template representing the average folding zzso An zzso of zzso location was constructed by computing the probability of zzso inclusion for each cortical location in the template zzso This zzso zzso of zzso exhibits low prediction error compared to previous zzso zzso zzso built in zzso zzso The increased predictability observed under zzso registration suggests that the location of zzso is more accurately predicted by the cortical folds than by the shape of the brain embedded in the volume of the zzso In addition, the high quality of this zzso provides direct evidence that zzso zzso registration methods are superior to zzso methods at zzso functional areas of zzso and therefore are better suited to support zzso averaging for functional imaging experiments targeting the cerebral zzso
