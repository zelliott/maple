zzso methods, such as the support zzso machine zzso are often formulated as zzso programming zzso zzso However, given m training patterns, a zzso zzso of the zzso solver takes zzso training time and at least zzso zzso zzso zzso up these zzso is a major stumbling block in applying kernel methods on very large data sets, and a replacement of the zzso method for finding the zzso solutions is highly zzso Recently, by using approximation zzso for the minimum enclosing ball zzso problem, we proposed the core zzso machine zzso zzso that is much faster and can handle much larger data sets than existing zzso zzso However, the zzso can only be used with certain kernel functions and kernel zzso For example, the very popular support zzso zzso zzso cannot be used with the zzso In this paper, we introduce the zzso zzso problem and subsequently extend the zzso zzso The generalized zzso zzso can now be used with any zzso kernel and can also be applied to kernel methods such as zzso and the ranking zzso Moreover, like the original zzso its zzso time complexity is again linear in m and its space complexity is independent of zzso zzso show that the generalized zzso has comparable performance with state-of-the-art zzso and zzso zzso but is faster and produces fewer support zzso on very large data zzso
