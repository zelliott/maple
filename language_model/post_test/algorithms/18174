Rapid zzso movements serve as an excellent test bed for any theory about trajectory zzso How are these movements zzso A minimum acceleration criterion has been examined in the past, and the solution zzso based on the zzso zzso failed to predict that the hand would begin and end the movement at rest zzso with zero zzso zzso this criterion was rejected in favor of the minimum zzso which was proved to be successful in describing many features of human zzso This letter follows an alternative approach and zzso the minimum acceleration problem with constraints using zzso minimum zzso We use the minimum principle to obtain minimum acceleration zzso and use the zzso as a control zzso In order to find a solution that does not include zzso impulse functions, constraints on the maximum and minimum zzso values are zzso The zzso solution provides a zzso zzso constant zzso signal zzso zzso where the magnitude of the zzso and the two switching times depend on the magnitude of the maximum and minimum available zzso zzso This result fits the observed zzso of reaching movements and takes into account both the zzso coordinates and the muscle limitations in a single zzso The minimum acceleration with constraints principle is discussed as a unifying approach for many observations about the neural control of zzso
