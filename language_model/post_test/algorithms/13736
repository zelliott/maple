The goal of image zzso is to reduce the amount of data needed to represent zzso In medical applications, it is not desirable to lose any information and thus zzso zzso methods are often zzso However, medical imaging systems have intrinsic noise associated to zzso The application of a zzso technique, which acts as a low pass zzso reduces the amount of data at a higher rate without any noticeable loss in the information contained in the zzso We have compressed images of nuclear medicine using the discrete zzso transform zzso The zzso images were considered reliable for visual zzso Furthermore, a zzso was zzso from these images and no discernible change was found from the results obtained using the original zzso zzso
