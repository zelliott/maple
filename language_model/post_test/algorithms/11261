The identification of peptides binding to major zzso complexes zzso is a critical step in the understanding of T cell immune zzso The human zzso zzso region zzso is extremely zzso zzso several thousand zzso many zzso a distinct zzso The potentially unique zzso remain zzso zzso for the vast majority of zzso zzso Likewise, for nonhuman species, only a minor fraction of the known zzso molecules have been zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso to functionally cluster zzso molecules based on their predicted binding zzso The method has a flexible web interface that allows the user to include any zzso of interest in the zzso The output consists of a zzso heat map and zzso zzso zzso of the functional relationship between zzso zzso and a dynamic zzso interface where both the functional relationship and the individual binding zzso of zzso molecules are zzso We demonstrate that conventional zzso zzso will fail to identify the functional relationship between zzso when applied to zzso system, and only through the use of the predicted binding specificity can a correct zzso be zzso zzso of prevalent zzso and zzso zzso using zzso confirms the presence of 12 major specificity groups zzso some however with highly divergent zzso zzso some zzso molecules are shown not to fit any zzso zzso Also, we use zzso to show that zzso zzso class I molecules have a reduced functional diversity compared to that of zzso class I zzso zzso is available at zzso
