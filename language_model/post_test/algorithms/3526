zzso diagnosis is one of the most widely used approaches to zzso diagnosis within the artificial intelligence zzso It is usually carried out through an zzso cycle of behavior zzso conflict zzso candidate generation, and candidate zzso In that process conflict detection has proven to be a zzso step from the theoretical point of zzso For this reason, many approaches to zzso diagnosis have relied upon some kind of zzso These techniques have had different problems, specially when they were applied to diagnose dynamic zzso Recently, zzso dependency compilation has established itself as a suitable alternative approach to online zzso In this paper we propose the possible conflict concept as a compilation technique for zzso zzso Each possible conflict represents a zzso within system description containing minimal zzso zzso and being capable to become a zzso Moreover, the whole set of possible conflicts can be zzso zzso with no model zzso Once we have zzso the possible conflict concept, we explain how possible conflicts can be used in the zzso diagnosis zzso and how this concept can be easily extended to diagnose dynamic zzso Finally, we analyze its relation to conflicts in the general diagnosis engine zzso framework and compare possible conflicts with other compilation techniques, especially with zzso zzso relations zzso obtained through structural zzso Based on results from these comparisons we provide additional insights in the work carried out within the BRIDGE community to provide a common framework for zzso diagnosis for both artificial intelligence and control engineering zzso
