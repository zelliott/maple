Elementary flux mode zzso is a fundamental concept as well as a useful tool in zzso zzso zzso One important role of zzso is that every flux distribution can be zzso into a set of zzso and a number of methods to study flux zzso originated from zzso Yet finding such zzso requires the complete set of zzso which is intractable in zzso zzso networks due to zzso zzso 

In this article, we proposed an zzso to decompose flux zzso into zzso in zzso zzso It is an zzso scheme of a mixed zzso linear zzso Unlike previous zzso models to find zzso any feasible solutions can become zzso in our zzso This advantage enables the zzso to approximate the zzso of largest contribution to an objective reaction in a flux zzso Our zzso is able to find zzso of flux zzso with complex structures, closer to the realistic case in which a cell is subject to various zzso A case of zzso coli growth in the zzso broth zzso medium containing various carbon sources was zzso Essential zzso and their zzso were zzso Information on the contribution of each carbon source not obvious from the apparent flux distribution was also zzso Our work further confirms the utility of finding zzso by zzso models in zzso zzso zzso
