Comparing the available zzso zzso and the related uncertainties with the space of muscle forces potentially driving the same motion can provide insights into understanding human motion in healthy and pathological zzso zzso However, it is not clear how effective the available zzso tools are in completely sample the possible muscle zzso In this study, we compared the effectiveness of zzso and the zzso zzso at generating a comprehensive spectrum of possible muscle forces for a representative motion zzso The hip force peak during a selected walking trial was identified using a zzso musculoskeletal zzso The joint moments, the muscle lever arms, and the muscle force constraints extracted from the model constituted the indeterminate equilibrium equation at the zzso Two zzso each containing 200,000 muscle force samples, were calculated using zzso and the zzso zzso The full hip force range was calculated using zzso and compared with the hip force ranges derived from the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso spectrum spanned a much larger force range than the zzso spectrum, reaching zzso difference for the zzso zzso intermediate zzso The zzso hip force range exhibited a zzso zzso error on the upper and lower boundaries of the full hip force range zzso zzso whereas the full range was imposed in the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is well suited for zzso sample the spectrum of possible muscle recruitment zzso Future studies will investigate the muscle force range in healthy and pathological zzso zzso
