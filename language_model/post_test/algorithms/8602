The purpose of this study was to determine how zzso ultrasound zzso fine needle aspiration zzso with a zzso confirmed biopsy protocol impacted on staging and managing zzso zzso in terms of zzso and zzso therapy zzso and radiation zzso 

The records of 40 consecutive patients diagnosed with zzso cancer referred for zzso staging were zzso zzso zzso zzso scan then zzso imaging and zzso zzso staging, including involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso surgical pathology, and subsequent treatment were zzso zzso balloons were used for zzso when needed to examine the zzso zzso 

All 40 patients followed the protocol and were successfully zzso by zzso Sixteen of the 40 required zzso zzso using the zzso zzso No complications were observed from zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso met the criteria for zzso zzso biopsy from a total of 40 zzso imaging zzso Twenty zzso of the 23 zzso zzso were directed toward the zzso zzso 18 zzso of the 20 were positive for zzso and were treated by zzso therapy and 2 zzso zzso were negative for zzso and were treated by surgical zzso The CT scan was able to detect only 6 zzso of 20 cases of suspicious zzso zzso zzso of which 5 zzso were positive for zzso by zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso (20 zzso directed management in all patients zzso zzso zzso is superior to CT scan for diagnosing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal study when used in conjunction with zzso treatment protocols for zzso zzso
