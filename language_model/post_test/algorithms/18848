We describe an efficient method for partial complementary shape matching for use in rigid zzso zzso The local shape features of a protein are represented using zzso data structures called Context zzso The relative zzso of the zzso and zzso surfaces are searched using zzso zzso zzso zzso quantities are derived from shape zzso and buried surface area zzso using efficient zzso zzso zzso results indicate that our context shapes approach zzso state-of-the-art geometric zzso zzso zzso
