Computer recognition of short functional sites on DNA, such as promoter regions or zzso zzso has recently attracted much zzso In this paper we have focused our attention on the automatic recognition of relevant features of human zzso acid sequences by means of an zzso artificial neural network zzso Sixty zzso zzso and 31 zzso DNA sequences were zzso The results showed that in zzso the minimal similarity 60 base pattern was zzso and zzso and located in most sequences in a range of 250 bases from either the middle point of the signal zzso coding region or from the start of the coding zzso On DNA sequences a region defined by a cluster of minimal similarity patterns was present in many of the zzso zzso This zone may be related to alternative zzso and DNA zzso
