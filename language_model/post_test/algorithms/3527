This paper presents a zzso diagnostic method designed in the context of process zzso It has been inspired by both artificial intelligence and control zzso zzso contributes tools for qualitative zzso including zzso zzso whose aim is to split a complex process into elementary zzso Control theory, within the framework of fault detection and isolation zzso provides zzso models for generating and testing zzso and for taking into account zzso in the model, unknown disturbances and zzso zzso reasoning provides a logical foundation for diagnostic reasoning and zzso fundamental zzso such as single fault and zzso The diagnostic method presented in the paper benefits from the advantages of all these zzso zzso modeling enables the method to focus on sufficient relations for fault isolation, which avoids zzso zzso Moreover, it allows the model to be modified easily without changing any aspect of the diagnostic zzso The zzso zzso that are used to detect inconsistency benefit from the precise quantitative analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso models are studied in order to link this method with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso use of this zzso is explained and the concept of local zzso is zzso
