This paper investigates dynamic source imaging of the spinal zzso zzso activity from its evoked magnetic field by applying the spatial filter version of standardized zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso Our computer simulation shows that the zzso spatial filter can reconstruct the four current sources typically associated with the zzso of the spinal zzso evoked magnetic field zzso The results from animal experiments show that significant changes in the zzso and intensity of the reconstructed volume current arise near the location of the artificial incomplete zzso zzso The results from the human zzso show that the zzso source imaging can zzso the dynamics of the volume currents and other nerve electrical activity zzso along the human spinal zzso These experimental results demonstrate the potential of zzso source imaging as a future clinical tool for diagnosing cervical spinal zzso zzso
