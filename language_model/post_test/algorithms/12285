Because of rapid progress in zzso techniques, many zzso zzso zzso studies are now under zzso Typically, the disorders examined are zzso and, therefore, researchers seeking association must consider interactions among zzso and between zzso and other zzso One of the challenges of large zzso studies is obtaining accurate estimates of the significance of discovered zzso The linkage zzso between zzso makes the tests highly dependent, and dependency worsens when interactions are zzso The standard way of assigning significance zzso zzso is by a zzso zzso Unfortunately, in large studies, it is zzso slow to zzso low P values by this zzso We present here a faster zzso for accurately calculating low P values in zzso association zzso Unlike with several previous methods, we do not assume a specific distribution of the traits, given the zzso Our method is based on importance sampling and on accounting for the zzso in linkage zzso along the zzso The zzso is dramatically faster than the standard zzso zzso On data sets mimicking zzso association studies, it speeds up zzso by a factor of zzso sometimes reducing running times from years to zzso Thus, our method significantly increases the zzso range for which accurate, meaningful association results are zzso
