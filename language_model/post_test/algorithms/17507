This novel method of zzso Tracking using Support zzso zzso proposed for a video surveillance instrument combines the Support zzso zzso zzso zzso into an zzso based zzso The traditional method using optical flow tracks objects by minimizing an intensity difference function between successive zzso while zzso tracks objects by maximizing the zzso zzso zzso As the zzso zzso for object and zzso is zzso there is need only to zzso an image block as object or zzso without having to compare the zzso region of the tracked object in the previous zzso To account for large motions between successive frames we build zzso from the support zzso and use a zzso scan in the zzso zzso To accelerate the training of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The results of using a zzso for pedestrian tracking from real time video are shown at the zzso Comparative experimental results showed that zzso improves the reliability of tracking compared to that of traditional tracking method using optical zzso
