The analysis and zzso of large data sets collected by use of laser zzso zzso has presented a challenge to researchers using this technique to investigate complex flow zzso This paper describes an automated procedure for analysis and animation of two- and three-dimensional laser zzso zzso zzso The procedure consists of a suite of zzso programs for calculating phase window averages of zzso and the Reynolds stress zzso calculating the principal normal zzso maximum zzso zzso and preparation of data files for input into zzso compatible data zzso zzso An example application of these techniques to data collected from an in zzso investigation of the retrograde flow field associated with a zzso mechanical heart valve is also zzso
