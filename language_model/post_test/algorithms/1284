zzso zzso can be developed to size unknown zzso zzso DNA fragments based on their zzso zzso when they are compared with the zzso of standard fragments of known zzso however, zzso anomalous zzso migration can affect the accuracy and precision of the called sizes of the zzso We used the anomalous migration of zzso fragments to zzso zzso conditions for zzso zzso The zzso zzso system uses a zzso zzso that both coats the zzso wall to suppress zzso flow and acts as the zzso zzso The addition of 8 M zzso to the zzso solution, as in slab gel zzso is insufficient to fully zzso some zzso zzso zzso fragments in this zzso zzso zzso The zzso accuracy of these fragments is significantly improved by the addition of zzso or increased zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso the effect of these two zzso strategies is zzso and the best accuracy and precision in zzso results are obtained with a combination of chemical and zzso zzso
