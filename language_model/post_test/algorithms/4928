We created a prediction model to be used in zzso resuscitation zzso attempts as a decision tool to omit futile zzso attempts and to save zzso 

In this post hoc analysis, we assessed zzso parameters for neurological recovery after successful zzso The original study was designed as a zzso randomized, zzso controlled, zzso clinical zzso 

We identified zzso zzso cardiac arrest patients being treated with advanced cardiac life zzso Seven hundred zzso of zzso patients zzso died at the scene and 380 of zzso zzso were brought to the zzso Two hundred zzso of zzso patients zzso died in the zzso One hundred zzso of zzso zzso were discharged from the hospital and 92 of the 115 patients zzso could be zzso Good cerebral performance was regained by zzso of discharged patients zzso of 92 zzso In zzso of patients zzso zzso or severe disability zzso zzso zzso was more likely to have occurred in patients with good neurological recovery zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was more likely in patients with poor neurological recovery zzso zzso zzso A score was developed to predict the probability of death using zzso zzso zzso zzso death in the hospital revealed a sensitivity of zzso zzso but only a specificity of zzso zzso threshold zzso zzso survival until discharge from the hospital revealed a sensitivity of zzso zzso but only a specificity of zzso zzso threshold zzso A receiver operating characteristic curve yielded an area under the curve of zzso zzso at a confidence zzso of zzso 

For zzso patients with cardiac arrest, parameters documented in the field did not allow accurate prediction of hospital zzso
