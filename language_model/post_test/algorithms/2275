A set of consensus zzso sites for the zzso complex are derived by comparing six zzso zzso These zzso sites include a subset of the observed water molecules plus some sites that are occupied by neighboring protein atoms in the zzso crystal zzso Two zzso prediction zzso zzso and zzso showed significant increases in apparent efficacy using these consensus water sites, suggesting that our proposed set of consensus zzso sites is truly a better representation of the zzso properties of zzso in zzso zzso the consensus zzso sites include all buried water zzso Otherwise, the features of zzso sites included in the consensus list versus those discarded reveal no distinctive features that would allow them to be selected zzso without reference to multiple crystal zzso We suggest that analyses such as this one are a crucial prelude to any theoretical analysis aimed at understanding zzso zzso
