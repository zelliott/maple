The sensitivity of zzso MRS can be increased using higher magnetic fields, but also by using zzso to zzso polarization transfer techniques where the sensitivity is determined by the polarization of the zzso spins and thus the zzso per unit time is unaffected by the slow zzso relaxation properties of the zzso zzso This implies that zzso spins can be manipulated during the zzso relaxation of the zzso spins without affecting the zzso of the zzso to zzso polarization transferred zzso It is shown here that by combining zzso to zzso polarization transfer with a direct zzso detection sequence in one repetition time, one can gain more zzso per unit of time as compared to a polarization transfer sequence zzso Proof of principle was demonstrated by phantom zzso and additionally the method was applied to the human calf muscle and to the human breast in zzso at 7 zzso
