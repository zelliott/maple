The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso dysfunction zzso patients with zzso pacing programmed with a fixed long zzso zzso zzso 

In a prospective study, a total of 60 patients with zzso were implanted with a zzso PM with two different zzso for detection of zzso The study was done with a 3 month data collection period retrieved from the memory of PM and with a 7 day external zzso recording zzso 

In 13 of 16 zzso zzso patients whose zzso recording revealed the presence of zzso episodes of AT sensing were retrieved from the PM memory with zzso zzso confirming that the devices had detected the zzso Very short zzso seen in zzso recordings were missed by the PM with three zzso However, with all these patients after 3 months of follow up period, there were recognized periods of zzso by the zzso With ten (17 zzso patients, there were intermittent periods of zzso by the PM although continuous zzso zzso zzso was seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused false AT detection due to repetitive zzso zzso zzso rhythm zzso in six zzso zzso of the 24 patients with retrograde zzso 

Even with long zzso zzso zzso can be accurately zzso However, transient zzso of continuous zzso and zzso of very short AT episodes can still zzso zzso a long zzso delay zzso to zzso which can cause false AT detection and symptoms in zzso patients who have retrograde zzso
