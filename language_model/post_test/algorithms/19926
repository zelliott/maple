zzso gene zzso using real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technology is a mainstay of molecular zzso Technologies now exist to measure the abundance of many transcripts in zzso The selection of the optimal reference gene for the zzso of this data is a recurring problem, and several zzso have been developed in order to solve zzso So far nothing in R exists to unite these methods, together with other functions to read in and zzso the data using the chosen reference zzso 

We have developed two zzso packages, zzso and zzso intended for a user with some experience with zzso data analysis using zzso who wishes to use R to zzso zzso zzso We illustrate their potential use in a zzso zzso a generic zzso experiment, and apply this to a real zzso zzso are available from zzso zzso 

These packages increase the zzso of zzso analysis tools available to the R user and allow them to zzso other things) read their data into zzso hold it in an zzso compatible R object, choose appropriate reference zzso zzso the data and look for differential expression between zzso
