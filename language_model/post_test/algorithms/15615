The long short-term memory zzso network trained by zzso descent zzso difficult problems which traditional zzso neural networks in general zzso We have recently observed that the zzso extended Kalman filter training zzso allows for even better performance, reducing significantly the number of training steps when compared to the original zzso descent training zzso In this paper we present a set of experiments which are zzso by classical zzso networks but which are solved elegantly and robustly and quickly by zzso combined with Kalman zzso
