The systematic use of zzso testing assumes a remarkable importance where zzso manufacturing quality control is associated with the maintenance of complex zzso For this reason, zzso testing and evaluation zzso together with accuracy and precision of zzso of the zzso results as a strategic activity in many fields of industrial and civil zzso It is well known that zzso research zzso are able to provide information on the state of a manufacturing process without compromising its integrity and zzso Moreover, exploitation of zzso with a low zzso complexity for detecting the integrity of a zzso plays a crucial role in real-time zzso In such a context, the production of carbon fiber zzso zzso zzso is a complex process that is not free from defects and faults that could compromise the integrity of the manufactured zzso zzso tests provide an effective contribution in identifying the presence of a zzso In this work, a fuzzy similarity approach is proposed with the goal of zzso and zzso defects in zzso in terms of a sort of distance among signals zzso of zzso zzso A zzso gate array zzso board will be also presented which zzso the described zzso on a hardware zzso The good performance of the detection and zzso achieved assures the zzso of the results with the results obtained using zzso techniques with a higher zzso zzso
