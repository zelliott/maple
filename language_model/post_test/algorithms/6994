zzso zzso use information from sensors to change the rate of heart zzso Until now, zzso zzso have been used to combine zzso from sensors to improve heart rate control, but they have been difficult to zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso which controlled heart rate zzso by motion and respiratory rate was zzso After zzso assessment exercise protocol zzso tests were performed to collect activity and respiratory rate signals, the intrinsic heart rate was zzso from these two signals by a zzso zzso For 10 subjects the heart rate zzso using the zzso algorithm, gave zzso improved accuracy in comparison with the normal fuzzy table zzso zzso The zzso method was applied to a real zzso by reduced mapping of the zzso zzso zzso
