zzso techniques for peripheral MR zzso are receiving renewed interest because of safety concerns about the use of zzso in patients with zzso zzso One class of techniques involves zzso of zzso images acquired during fast zzso flow from zzso images obtained during slow zzso zzso The goal of this work was to determine whether the inherent zzso of the difference images could be exploited to achieve greater acceleration without loss of image quality in the context of generalized zzso partially parallel acquisition zzso It is shown that noise amplification at high acceleration factors can be reduced by performing zzso on the raw data, before calculation of the zzso zzso rather than on the final magnitude zzso Use of the difference data to calculate the zzso weights decreases the geometry factor zzso because the difference data represent a sparse image zzso This demonstrates an inherent property of zzso and does not require the use of compressed zzso Application of this approach to highly accelerated data from healthy volunteers resulted in similar depiction of large arteries to that obtained with low acceleration and standard zzso However, zzso of very small vessels and zzso branches was zzso
