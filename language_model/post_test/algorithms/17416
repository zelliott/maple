The zzso zzso acid composition is introduced to predict the secondary structure contents of a zzso Compared with the existing methods all based on zzso zzso acid composition as defined in a zzso zzso space, this represents a step forward to the consideration of the sequence zzso zzso The test results indicate that the introduction of the zzso zzso acid composition can significantly improve the prediction zzso It is anticipated that the concept of the zzso zzso acid composition can be used to simplify the zzso of sequence zzso (or sequence zzso effects and to study many other features of proteins as zzso
