The genetic zzso of complex human diseases has been commonly viewed as a process that involves multiple genetic zzso environmental factors, as well as their zzso zzso approaches, such as the zzso zzso reduction zzso and generalized zzso zzso have recently been proposed to test the joint association of multiple genetic zzso with either zzso or continuous zzso In this study, we propose a novel Forward zzso to evaluate the combined effect of multiple zzso on quantitative traits with consideration of zzso zzso In this new approach, a zzso forward zzso is first used to select potential zzso zzso and then a weighted zzso is used to test the joint association of the selected zzso with the zzso Through a simulation study, we found the Forward zzso outperformed zzso in terms of greater zzso Aside from that, our approach is less zzso zzso making it feasible for zzso zzso zzso We illustrate our method with a real data application to nicotine dependence zzso using three independent zzso from the Study of zzso zzso and zzso Our zzso interaction analysis of 155 zzso in 67 candidate genes identified two zzso zzso within gene zzso and zzso within gene zzso jointly associated with the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso The association, which involves essential interaction, is zzso in two independent zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Our finding suggests that joint action may exist between the two gene zzso
