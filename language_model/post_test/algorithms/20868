zzso cells like zzso cells and zzso cells are established models for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso these zzso are recognized by their electron dense zzso The analysis of zzso zzso distribution is usually performed zzso which is zzso and subject to human bias and zzso We have developed an zzso to analyze zzso zzso distribution and zzso in electron zzso Our zzso automatically detects the zzso and zzso their distance to the plasma membrane on basis of the zzso zzso ensuring that all zzso are counted and the shortest distance is zzso We validated the zzso on a several preparations of zzso zzso The zzso was highly accurate in recognizing zzso zzso and calculating their distribution including zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso enabled the extraction of parameters that cannot be measured manually like zzso zzso Taking together, the zzso zzso and expands the unbiased and efficient analysis of zzso zzso distribution and zzso
