The zzso has been known to be an important structure as a zzso for Alzheimer's disease zzso and other neurological and psychiatric zzso However, it requires accurate, robust and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study, an automated zzso zzso method based on a zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso opening was zzso First of all, the zzso zzso was applied to define initial zzso region for a zzso information on zzso The definition of initial seeds was further elaborated by incorporating zzso of partial volume probabilities at each zzso Finally, zzso opening was applied to reduce false positive of the result processed by zzso In the experiments with zzso healthy normal subjects, the proposed method showed more reliable results zzso zzso than the conventional zzso zzso method zzso Also as for zzso accuracy which is measured in terms of the ratios of false positive and false negative, the proposed method zzso zzso produced lower ratios than the conventional methods zzso zzso demonstrating its zzso for accurate, robust and reliable zzso of zzso
