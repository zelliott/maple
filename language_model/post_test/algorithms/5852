The zzso activity of some of the most zzso strains of zzso zzso is associated with a zzso protein zzso which forms zzso zzso pores and changes the zzso of zzso zzso We present here a model structure of the zzso pore of zzso based on sequence comparison with other zzso zzso zzso is suggested to form a zzso zzso pore with a relatively large trans zzso zzso zzso of the zzso profile within the pore zzso provide a rationale for the low zzso and selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso
