The zzso dance zzso is one of the most popular examples of information transfer in the animal zzso Today, more than 60 years after its discovery it still remains unknown how follower bees decode the information contained in the zzso In order to build a robotic zzso that allows a deeper investigation of the communication process we have recorded hundreds of videos of zzso zzso In this paper we analyze the statistics of visually captured zzso dance zzso of European zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were produced using a novel automatic tracking system and represent the most detailed zzso dance motion information zzso Although zzso dances seem very zzso some properties turned out to be zzso We use these properties as a minimal set of parameters that enables us to model the zzso dance zzso We provide a detailed statistical description of various dance properties that have not been characterized before and discuss the role of particular dance components in the zzso zzso
