This study compared the role of zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso and stress zzso zzso in the diagnostic zzso of patients with chronic chest zzso 

zzso was performed in 43 patients zzso men, 12 women, mean age zzso zzso with stable angina after a routine diagnostic zzso involving stress zzso and conventional zzso The following inclusion criteria were zzso zzso rhythm and ability to hold breath for 12 zzso zzso were administered in patients with heart zzso zzso In order to identify or exclude patients with significant zzso zzso zzso we determined zzso likelihood ratios of stress test and zzso separately and of zzso performed after the stress zzso 

The zzso probability of significant coronary artery disease zzso was zzso Positive and negative likelihood ratios were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the stress test and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso probability of significant zzso after a negative stress test from 50% to zzso and after a positive stress test from zzso to zzso zzso correctly detected all patients without zzso 

zzso zzso is a potentially useful tool in the diagnostic zzso of patients with stable angina zzso to its capability to detect or exclude significant zzso
