zzso in zzso and zzso influence patients' zzso zzso and zzso zzso dose zzso To provide physicians with tools to estimate the patient's individual dose, we aimed to develop zzso for zzso and zzso 

In two Dutch zzso clinics, data on age, sex, zzso weight, zzso zzso zzso doses, and international zzso ratio values were obtained from 624 patients taking zzso and zzso taking zzso Single zzso zzso relevant to zzso zzso dosing on the zzso and zzso genes were zzso Using multiple linear regression, we developed zzso and zzso zzso to predict the maintenance dose with patient characteristics and genetic zzso In addition, loading doses were derived from the calculated maintenance zzso We performed external validation in an independent data set with 229 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso weight, zzso sex, age, and zzso use contributed to the maintenance dose of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso explained zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso of the maintenance dose, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in an independent data set resulted in an explained variation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso without height and weight as zzso 

To our knowledge, these are the first zzso loading and maintenance dose zzso for zzso and zzso using large zzso The utility of these zzso will be tested in zzso controlled zzso
