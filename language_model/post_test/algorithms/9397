zzso protein structures into zzso is proven useful for more accurate structural and functional characterization of zzso Here, we develop a method, called zzso that divides structure into zzso using a zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso of zzso are compared to zzso zzso zzso definitions are given by the authors who solved protein zzso as well as to popular zzso and zzso zzso by human experts and automatic zzso zzso automatic zzso are most consistent with the zzso zzso zzso agreement in number of zzso and zzso agreement in both number of zzso and at least zzso overlap in domain assignment of zzso if its three adjustable parameters are trained by the zzso zzso By comparison, the agreement is zzso zzso with at least zzso overlap zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The agreement between zzso and zzso zzso goes beyond zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For an zzso data set of proteins whose zzso and zzso zzso agree with each other in number of zzso the agreement is zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The consistency between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is superior to two other recently developed, zzso automatic methods zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso We also tested a simple consensus method made of zzso zzso 2, and zzso and a different version of zzso based on a more sophisticated statistical energy zzso The zzso server and its zzso are available in the services section on zzso
