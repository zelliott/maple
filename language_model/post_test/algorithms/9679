zzso zzso is performed in many clinical and therapeutic zzso zzso displacement and needle zzso which result from zzso interaction make accurate targeting zzso For performing physicians to gain essential needle targeting skills, needle zzso zzso can be used for zzso An accurate needle zzso model is essential for such zzso These zzso models are also needed for needle path zzso In this paper, three different models are presented to simulate the zzso of a zzso The first two models use the finite element method and take the geometric zzso into zzso The third model is a series of rigid bars connected by angular zzso The models were compared to recorded zzso during experiments of applying lateral tip forces on a zzso zzso The model parameters were identified and the simulation results were compared to the experimental zzso The results show that the angular spring model, which is zzso the most efficient model, is also the most accurate in modeling the zzso of the zzso zzso
