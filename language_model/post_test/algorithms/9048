To test a magnetic resonance image zzso technique that uses an additional pulse in zzso zzso sequence that works to suppress the fat zzso in subjects with liver iron overload and zzso presence of fat in the liver, which have been revealed as a major drawback that compromises the correct iron zzso by zzso 

Fifty magnetic resonance images of the liver zzso zzso of individuals with blood zzso increases were zzso reviewed for the presence of zzso using the sequence in and out of phase, and iron zzso using two sequences zzso * zzso one standard and other with additional fat suppression zzso zzso * values and their standard zzso were analyzed zzso 

Our results showed that a significantly lower standard zzso of zzso values is obtained when the fat zzso pulse is applied in patients with zzso We found that zzso of fat signal on liver iron overload resulted in a different categorization of some zzso In one case, the patient was zzso within normal levels of liver zzso 

Our findings may contribute to a better measure of liver iron overload with relevant implications for patient treatment and zzso
