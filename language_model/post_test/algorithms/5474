zzso alignment (the grouping of zzso bases into one zzso is fundamental to almost any task in comparative zzso This translates to zzso gaps in the zzso sequences to account for events of insertions and deletions zzso The zzso between sequence alignment and zzso reconstruction has drawn substantial attention recently with works showing the significance of differences in zzso One of the plausible approaches in this direction is to grade the suitability of a tree to an associated alignment and vice zzso We here present a zzso (as opposed to zzso approach based on the zzso zzso We zzso by simulations and by using real biological data from the Encyclopedia of DNA zzso zzso this criterion is zzso The novelty of our approach is the distinguishing between insertions and zzso and zzso the analysis with a dimension of zzso extending it from the sequence space to the zzso zzso Using this approach, we perform a comprehensive study of zzso characteristic behavior among zzso in both coding and zzso zzso Our results show significant differences in zzso patterns between coding and zzso zzso We also show other characteristic patterns of zzso evolution in the depth of the underlying zzso
