A simple interface is proposed for combined quantum mechanical zzso molecular mechanical zzso calculations for the systems where the zzso and zzso regions are connected through zzso zzso Within this model, the atom that connects the two regions, called zzso atom here, serves as an ordinary zzso atom to other zzso atoms and as a zzso atom to other zzso zzso Only one new empirical zzso is introduced to adjust the length of the connecting bond and is zzso with the zzso zzso This model is tested with the zzso of equilibrium zzso and zzso energies for dozens of zzso Special attention is paid on the influence of zzso point charges on zzso geometry and zzso energy, and it is found that it is important to maintain local zzso in the zzso region in order for the accurate calculation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the simple zzso atom model yields comparable results to some other zzso zzso
