An automatic method for the zzso of the zzso wall is proposed for abdominal zzso zzso zzso of the cleansed and zzso zzso This zzso approach uses an zzso zzso zzso algorithm, with a zzso growing condition depending on local variations of the intensity at the zzso zzso The method was evaluated using zzso collected CT scans based on visual zzso of the colon by expert zzso This evaluation showed that the procedure identifies zzso of the colon zzso representing zzso of the colon surface, and accurately replicates the anatomical profile of the zzso zzso The zzso settings and performance of the method are relatively independent of the scanner and acquisition zzso The method is intended for application to the zzso detection of zzso in CT zzso
