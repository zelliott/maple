zzso methods which do not rely on multiple sequence alignments are important tools in zzso trees directly from completely zzso zzso Here, we extend the recently described Genome zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy to zzso zzso trees from all completely zzso zzso zzso currently available and from a selection of zzso zzso representing the major zzso zzso zzso zzso or combinations of both are used to locate zzso segment pairs zzso between two sequences from which zzso similarities and distances are zzso in different ways resulting in a total of 96 zzso zzso The suitability of these distance zzso for zzso reconstruction is directly estimated by computing a recently described measure of zzso the so-called delta value, from the respective distance zzso Additionally, we compare the trees zzso from these zzso using zzso NJ, zzso zzso or zzso respectively, with the zzso zzso tree of the zzso under zzso 

Our results indicate that, at this zzso level, zzso zzso are much more valuable for zzso zzso than are zzso zzso and that distances based on zzso are of little zzso zzso based on the proportion of zzso zzso length to average zzso length were best for tree zzso zzso we found that using zzso instead of zzso and, particularly, combining zzso and zzso leads to a small but significant increase in zzso Other factors do not significantly affect the zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in zzso most in accordance with the current zzso zzso with NJ and zzso performing zzso worse, and zzso performing as well if applied to high quality distance zzso delta values are found to be a reliable predictor of zzso zzso 

Using the most zzso distance zzso as judged by their delta values, distance methods are able to recover all major plant zzso and are more in accordance with zzso zzso being derived from zzso zzso than from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso methods can be used to reliably zzso zzso from different kinds of zzso zzso A framework is established to further develop and improve such zzso delta values are a zzso tool of general use for the development and assessment of distance methods for zzso zzso
