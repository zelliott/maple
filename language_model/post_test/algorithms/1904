In this paper, a new compounded direct zzso zzso zzso method is presented to remove blurring artifacts introduced by ultrasound scan zzso In zzso receive focusing is directly performed on each display zzso in Cartesian coordinates using the raw zzso data from adjacent transmit zzso so that artifacts from the scan conversion can be zzso In addition, the energy variations resulting from the distance between the transmit zzso and display zzso are compensated by utilizing the gain factor obtained from the ultrasound beam zzso The proposed zzso method was evaluated using simulation and in zzso liver data acquired by a commercial ultrasound machine equipped with a research zzso The experimental results showed that the proposed zzso method improved the information zzso contrast zzso by zzso compared with the conventional scan conversion method and it reduced the blocking artifacts factor zzso by zzso over the direct zzso focusing zzso These results indicate the proposed new direct zzso zzso method could be used to enhance image quality in medical ultrasound zzso
