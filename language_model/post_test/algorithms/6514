A major barrier to widespread clinical zzso of zzso Carlo dose calculation is the difficulty in characterizing the radiation source within a generalized source zzso This work aims to develop a generalized zzso source model zzso primary zzso zzso zzso for 6- and zzso zzso beams that match full zzso data zzso zzso by zzso comparison of dose zzso using either source zzso or the source model as zzso allows accurate source characterization and has the potential to ease the commissioning zzso since it is possible to obtain information about which zzso needs to be zzso This source model is unique in that, compared to previous source models, it retains additional correlations among zzso zzso which improves accuracy at zzso zzso distances zzso In our study, three-dimensional zzso dose calculations were performed for zzso ranging from 50 to 200 zzso and for field sizes from 1 zzso 1 to 30 zzso 30 zzso as well as a 10 zzso 10 zzso field 5 zzso off axis in each zzso The zzso dose zzso using either full zzso or the source model as zzso were compared in terms of zzso and zzso With this model, over zzso of the zzso agreed within zzso or 1 zzso for the target, within zzso or 2 zzso for the primary zzso and within zzso or 2 zzso for the zzso filter in all cases zzso For the dose zzso zzso of the dose zzso agreed within zzso or 1 zzso when the combined source zzso a charged particle source and the full zzso as zzso zzso The accurate and general characterization of each zzso source and knowledge of the zzso dose zzso should facilitate source model commissioning procedures by allowing zzso the zzso zzso representing the zzso to be zzso
