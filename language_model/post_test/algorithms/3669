There are two general methods for making zzso zzso one is to zzso a single test set of labeled targets to the probe, and measure the zzso intensity at each probe zzso the other is to zzso both a test and a reference set of zzso labeled targets to a single detector zzso and measure the ratio of the zzso zzso at each probe zzso Which method is better depends on the zzso in the cell system and the random factors resulting from the zzso zzso It also depends on the purpose for which the zzso is being zzso zzso is a fundamental application and it is the one considered zzso 

This paper describes a zzso simulation paradigm that compares the zzso accuracy provided by these methods over a variety of noise types and presents the results of a study modeled on noise typical of zzso zzso zzso The model consists of four zzso zzso the measurement equation for genes in the reference state; zzso the measurement equation for genes in the test state; zzso the ratio and zzso procedure for a zzso system; and zzso the intensity and zzso procedure for a single-channel zzso In the reference state, the mean zzso are modeled as a shifted exponential distribution, and the intensity for a particular gene is modeled via a normal distribution, zzso zzso about its mean intensity I, with alpha being the zzso of variation of the cell zzso In the test state, some genes have their zzso zzso by a random zzso The model includes a number of random factors affecting intensity zzso deposition gain zzso labeling gain, and zzso residual zzso The key conclusion resulting from the study is that the zzso of variation governing the randomness of the zzso and the deposition gain are the most important factors for determining whether a single-channel or zzso system provides superior zzso and the decision region in the zzso plane is approximately zzso
