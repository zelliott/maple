Line drawings and digital arts appear everywhere, from simple icons and logos to zzso zzso and zzso We define art patterns as the subset of line drawings and digital arts that are comprised of repeated zzso There exist textures that share characteristics with art zzso Examples of such textures include piled discrete elements with curved zzso Inspired by recent success of zzso texture zzso in this paper, we focus on zzso art patterns and textures with zzso features from zzso which we cast as a global zzso zzso Our energy function for this problem measures both the appearance similarity of color patterns and shape similarity of zzso features between an input zzso and a zzso zzso We develop an overall zzso zzso for minimizing this energy zzso The shape similarity part of the energy is minimized through an innovative application of the level set zzso We further zzso our energy function and zzso zzso to zzso pattern and texture zzso Our generalized zzso can effectively handle multiple layers and zzso valid instances of zzso
