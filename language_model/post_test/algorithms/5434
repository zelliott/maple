To describe a novel algorithm, based on the new display technology zzso developed to zzso diagnostic zzso and zzso planes of the fetal brain from volumes obtained by three-dimensional zzso zzso 

We developed an zzso to image standard zzso planes by drawing zzso lines through the zzso zzso view of zzso volume zzso acquired zzso The zzso was tested on 106 normal fetuses at zzso weeks of gestation and the zzso rates of brain diagnostic planes were evaluated by two independent zzso The zzso was also applied to nine cases with proven brain zzso 

The two zzso using the zzso on normal zzso found satisfactory images with zzso rates ranging between zzso and zzso for zzso planes and between zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The agreement rate between the two zzso as expressed by Cohen's zzso zzso was zzso zzso for zzso planes and zzso zzso for zzso zzso All nine abnormal volumes were identified by a single observer from among a series including normal zzso and eight of these nine cases were diagnosed zzso 

This novel zzso can be used to zzso standard zzso and zzso planes in the fetal zzso This approach may simplify the examination of the fetal brain and reduce dependency of success on operator zzso
