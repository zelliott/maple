A preliminary study to approach the problem of reliably detecting life threatening zzso zzso in real time is zzso An zzso zzso has been developed in order to zzso zzso signal records on the basis of the zzso of four simple parameters calculated from a representation in the frequency zzso This zzso uses a set of rules zzso an operative zzso scheme based on the comparison of the parameters with a set of zzso zzso This allows us to differentiate four general zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
