zzso structure plays the crucial role in proper gene zzso zzso it is very important to investigate zzso DNA properties and recognize zzso zzso positioning zzso Nevertheless, applying different sequence analysis methods separately is insufficient for complete zzso DNA zzso One of the most probable reasons for that is the weakness of zzso positioning zzso The present paper offers a set of methods to reveal the most important zzso DNA characteristics and to show a common pattern of zzso site zzso 

A complex approach was used to determine zzso and zzso properties that are most significant for zzso binding site zzso The integrated database of zzso DNA properties is zzso This database comprises different sections for description of DNA zzso zzso significant DNA characteristics allows the zzso of various samples of site sequences and the generation of programs for site zzso 

The current version of the database is available at zzso zzso zzso of the recognition program may be found in the section zzso zzso programs for testing arbitrary sequences are accessible at zzso zzso The links to the mirror zzso can be found at zzso zzso
