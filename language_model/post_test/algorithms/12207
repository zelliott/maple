The surface characteristics of zzso iron zzso and the efficiency of reductive zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso were zzso The experimental results indicated that the zzso of a metallic iron sample enhanced the efficiency of zzso degradation by zzso This occurred because zzso changed the zzso of zzso on the surface of iron from zzso zzso to the more hydrated zzso zzso as was confirmed by zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso were simultaneous with zzso in water, the zzso degradation rate decreased as the concentration of zzso zzso zzso This was due to the formation of passive zzso of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso that coated on the surface of zzso zzso which as a result inhibited the electron transfer and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, in an zzso system without the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso lattice which was then converted to zzso zzso Thus, the electrons were transferred from the iron surface and passed through the zzso allowing for the reductive zzso of zzso
