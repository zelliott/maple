The zzso ring has been advanced as a mechanical device for the correction of zzso The device may reduce zzso error, but the effect on the overall optical performance of the eye has been zzso This paper addresses this issue by presenting mathematical models that will predict the effect of the zzso ring on zzso error, zzso zzso and the zzso aberration of the zzso 

zzso are derived for predicting the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the change in zzso after inserting zzso rings of any thickness and zzso 

The model predicts that the magnitude of zzso reduction is a function of both ring thickness and zzso The large diameter (9 to 10 zzso thin zzso to zzso zzso zzso ring is less likely to adversely affect zzso zzso and therefore not significantly enhance the zzso aberration of the zzso 

An zzso ring cannot correct more than zzso zzso zzso of zzso without significantly increasing zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, will compromise the final visual zzso
