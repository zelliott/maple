zzso functional zzso theory zzso employs the electron density of a zzso and its related quantities such as zzso and zzso to describe its structure and zzso zzso Proper descriptions at both molecular zzso and atomic zzso levels are equally important and zzso In this work, we make use of zzso zzso partition scheme and consider atomic contributions for a few global zzso zzso in zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso effect and related zzso Earlier, we proved that these quantities are zzso correlated for atomic and molecular systems zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work, a new zzso integration zzso has been zzso whose reliability and effectiveness have been extensively zzso We also investigated a list of simple hydrocarbon systems and different scenarios of bonding zzso including zzso bending, and zzso zzso changing patterns for the atomic and molecular values of these quantities have been revealed for different zzso This work not only confirms the strong correlation between these global zzso zzso for molecular systems, as theoretically proven earlier by us, it also provides new and unexpected changing patterns for their atomic values, which can be employed to understand the origin and nature of chemical zzso
