In anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso the zzso zzso technique often creates a zzso placed zzso tunnel, which is a frequent cause of surgical failure and zzso knee zzso Several studies reported that drilling the zzso tunnel through an zzso portal zzso yields a more zzso tunnel position compared with the zzso zzso 

To compare the effectiveness of these two surgical techniques in restoring the intact knee joint zzso during a zzso loading zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 12; zzso zzso zzso 12; sex, weight, and height zzso and half with dominant leg zzso who underwent unilateral zzso zzso reconstruction by the same surgeon were zzso Twenty healthy patients with no history of lower limb injuries were recruited as the control zzso zzso joint motion in 6 degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 zzso was determined during level walking by using a least mean zzso zzso zzso A redundant marker set was used to improve the accuracy of the motion zzso zzso joint zzso as well as zzso parameters were compared between these two zzso 

The zzso technique restored the zzso translation of the knee joint, while the zzso technique resulted in significantly greater zzso zzso zzso vs controls, zzso zzso P zzso zzso anterior zzso translations than in the healthy controls during the swing zzso zzso zzso external zzso zzso rotation zzso P zzso zzso was found at zzso in the knees that were reconstructed using the zzso zzso using the zzso technique, the external rotation offset was greatly reduced during the stance zzso However, knees repaired using the zzso technique were significantly less extended zzso P zzso zzso compared with the knees of the controls during the late stance zzso Neither surgical technique restored the zzso zzso translation to the intact level during the swing zzso 

The zzso technique better restores the zzso translation during the swing phase and zzso external rotation at zzso than the zzso technique zzso However, the zzso technique is also correlated with an extension loss during the late stance zzso 

The zzso zzso tunnel drilling technique can improve overall knee joint stability, but the increased difficulty with full extension may need to be zzso
