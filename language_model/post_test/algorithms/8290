A zzso model for the perception of zzso motion is examined in detail and compared with various versions of the Reichardt motion detection model zzso zzso zzso zzso a principle for the evaluation of sensory information by the central nervous zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso communication zzso zzso New York: zzso The zzso model is composed of a pair of temporally zzso zzso at two retinal locations, one detecting decreases and the other increases in input zzso Motion is signaled when both zzso are simultaneously excited, as determined by the zzso combination of their transient zzso In contrast with the Reichardt zzso which effectively tracks motion energy and accounts solely for results obtained with standard apparent motion stimuli (a surface is visible at one location, then at zzso the zzso model also accounts for the generalized apparent motion perceived between pairs of simultaneously visible zzso This indicates that standard apparent motion can be perceived via the same zzso zzso mechanism as generalized apparent zzso There is no need for either an explicit delay mechanism to account for optimal motion perception at zzso zzso zzso or for zzso interaction between zzso to account for the absence of motion in the zzso zzso direction zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Both are emergent properties that result from the zzso states of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to apparent motion, the zzso principle potentially accounts for the perception of motion for drifting zzso the short range motion perceived for zzso zzso and the motion perceived for continuously moving zzso
