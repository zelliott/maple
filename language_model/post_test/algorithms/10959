The detection of zzso applied to the zzso skin of the hand varies with contact zzso Three experiments have been conducted to relate variations in the perception of zzso zzso to previously reported properties of tactile zzso The effects of a surround around the area of zzso the size of the area of zzso the location of the area of zzso the contact force, and the hand posture on perception of thresholds were determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso of a surround around a contact area on the fingertip elevated thresholds of the zzso II channel zzso I zzso at zzso less than zzso zzso and reduced thresholds of the zzso channel zzso II zzso at zzso greater than about 63 zzso When no surround was present, thresholds reduced systematically as the contact area increased from the fingertip to the whole hand at zzso from 16 to 125 zzso although the decrease was not zzso zzso to the increase in contact zzso The results are partly explained by spatial zzso in the zzso channel zzso II zzso and the involvement of the zzso II channel zzso zzso with some influence of zzso responses and contact zzso There were regional differences in sensitivity over the hand within the zzso I channel but not within the zzso zzso the zzso I thresholds (less than zzso zzso decreased from zzso to zzso regions of the hand, whereas the zzso thresholds zzso zzso were independent of contact location over the zzso
