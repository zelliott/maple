zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may enable better allocation of cardiac arrest treatment by discriminating which patients should receive immediate zzso versus alternate therapies such as zzso We derive a new measure based on the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso of the Absolute zzso zzso and assess and contrast how well the zzso and the previously published zzso zzso zzso predict the duration of zzso and the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation zzso under both optimal experimental and zzso sampling zzso 

We derived the zzso and zzso from two different zzso animal study of 44 zzso and a retrospective human sample of 158 zzso zzso arrests treated with a commercial zzso In the animal study, the zzso and zzso were calculated on 5s epochs of zzso recorded at 1000 zzso and then down sampled to 125 zzso In the human study, the zzso and zzso were calculated using 6s epochs recorded at 200 zzso that occurred immediately prior to the initial zzso We compared the zzso and zzso measures using the zzso correlation zzso zzso and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

In the animal study, the zzso and zzso were highly correlated at 1000 zzso zzso but not at 125 zzso zzso These correlations were reflected in how well the measures zzso zzso of zzso or zzso versus zzso zzso zzso at 1000 zzso was similar for zzso compared to zzso zzso versus zzso However zzso at 125 samples was greater for zzso compared to zzso zzso versus zzso In the human study, the zzso measure was a better predictor of zzso following initial zzso as reflected by an zzso of zzso for zzso compared to zzso for zzso 

The zzso is an improvement over the zzso because the zzso retains its zzso characteristics at lower zzso sampling rates typical of current clinical zzso zzso the zzso may have a role in better allocating treatment in resuscitation of zzso cardiac zzso
