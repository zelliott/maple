To facilitate zzso study, it is necessary to be able to derive zzso targets and associated substitution rates in the sequence of interest regardless of the availability of corresponding zzso It is also important to obtain these data depending on the specific aims of the zzso zzso The zzso server determines candidate positions for zzso and derives zzso substitution rates given only a protein zzso Different sets of complete zzso collected according to their zzso or specificity of environments along with compete set of zzso sequences can be used in calculations depending on the experimental zzso zzso server is available at: zzso
