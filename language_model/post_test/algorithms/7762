The Noise Power zzso zzso is a function that yields information about the spatial frequency composition of noise in images obtained by a zzso It is evaluated by calculating the absolute value squared of the noise image and zzso it with respect to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso has been one of the physical characteristics that is commonly used to zzso measure the physical performance of a zzso In this article, we evaluated the zzso of a zzso zzso CT Breast Imaging system by considering the following zzso First, we evaluated its symmetry around the zzso and zzso along with the influence of the cone angle and the zzso size on the zzso Then, an zzso curve was suggested to best represent the zzso Second, we analyzed the influence on the zzso of a set of seven zzso namely the zzso size, exposure level, zzso value, number of projections acquired, zzso size, back projection zzso and the reconstruction zzso zzso In addition, since the breast induced scattering in the image, we investigated the effect of the zzso zzso used in this zzso Finally, we evaluated the uniformity of the zzso as a function of zzso with the zzso center located at zzso zzso 0 zzso The results demonstrate that the proposed curve is an ideal candidate that best represents the zzso zzso two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso can be used to characterize the zzso The results also demonstrate that the zzso size and the cone angle are the only two parameters investigated in this study that do not affect the zzso On the other hand, the zzso and zzso sizes, the zzso filter and the reconstruction algorithm, the exposure level and the scattering zzso all influence the zzso Finally, the results of the last part of this investigation suggest that this imaging system does not have a zzso zzso noise distribution along the zzso yielding less noisy images at around zzso zzso zzso m and zzso zzso 80 zzso
