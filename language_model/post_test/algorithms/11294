zzso learning rules have received considerable attention because of their close relationships to both optimal theory and zzso zzso However, basic forms of these rules are effective under only a restricted set of conditions in which the environment is zzso Recent studies have defined optimal solutions to learning problems in more general, potentially zzso zzso but the relevance of these complex mathematical solutions to how the brain zzso these problems remains zzso Here, we show that one such zzso solution can be zzso by a zzso straightforward mixture of simple zzso zzso zzso This simpler model can make effective zzso in a dynamic environment and matches human performance on a zzso task using a mixture of a small number of Delta zzso This model represents an important conceptual advance in our understanding of how the brain can use relatively simple zzso to make nearly optimal zzso in a dynamic zzso
