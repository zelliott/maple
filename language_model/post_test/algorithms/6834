The complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared by reaction of zzso with zzso and zzso (where zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso at different zzso to metal zzso zzso Gold complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by reaction of zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso in zzso All the new compounds were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso methods, and for the zzso species zzso zzso and DC magnetic zzso zzso were also zzso The solid-state structure of 1 has been determined by X-ray zzso 1 zzso in the zzso space group zzso with a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A, V zzso zzso zzso Z zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure refinement zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Complex 1 displayed a zzso structure typical for zzso zzso The new compounds were tested for in zzso activity against cultures of zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso At zzso equivalent to zzso M of total zzso or zzso (in zzso all the complexes exhibited significantly higher growth zzso activity than their respective parental zzso
