The diesel engine is the main power source for most agricultural zzso The control of diesel engine emissions is an important global zzso Fuel injection control systems directly affect fuel efficiency and emissions of diesel zzso zzso faults, such as rack zzso zzso valve failure, and zzso sensor zzso are possibly in the fuel injection module of electronic diesel control zzso zzso Among these faults, zzso valve failure is most likely to occur for zzso diesel zzso According to the previous studies, this failure is a result of the wear of the zzso and sleeve, based on a long period of zzso zzso degradation, or engine zzso Due to the difficulty in identifying zzso valve zzso this study focuses on developing a sensor identification zzso that can clearly zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso without disassembling the fuel pump of an zzso system for zzso agricultural zzso A diagnostic zzso is proposed, including a feedback zzso a zzso zzso a linear variable differential zzso zzso zzso and a neural network zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso can accurately identify the zzso of zzso zzso
