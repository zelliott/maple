zzso of zzso zzso cells on zzso plates is most efficient when a maximum number of zzso contain a single zzso The zzso distribution has been used to derive a novel equation that relates the number of zzso containing a specified number of zzso and the total number of viable cells loaded on the zzso To test its zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells were zzso with a gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and screened on zzso zzso The observed and predicted numbers of zzso containing a single zzso were zzso This approach therefore can be used to zzso the conditions for screening zzso zzso
