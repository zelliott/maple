This report describes the zzso of bite force measurement in awake rats and software instruments zzso 2 script zzso that zzso and analyze the bite force zzso One script program employs zzso control of threshold bite force, which allows an easy adjustment of target force prior to training the zzso Furthermore, the interactive program allows zzso control of threshold bite force at anytime during the training zzso Upon detection of the bite force crossing the zzso it automatically triggers the external water delivery system for zzso Another script program detects successful biting attempts, compiles times stamps and force level for each attempted zzso and zzso the total number of zzso success rate and mean bite force per training zzso Using the new methodology, we trained five adult rats to produce the bite force of zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that all rats achieved the target force with a similar time course and exhibited little zzso in success rate and mean bite zzso The script programs provided instant review and analyses of the captured zzso These techniques simplify assessment of bite force in behaving zzso
