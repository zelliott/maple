Recent progress determining the structure of the zzso prion protein zzso and the role of auxiliary molecules in prion replication permits a more rational approach in the development of therapeutic zzso Our objective is to identify a new class of lead compounds that mimic the dominant negative zzso zzso which inhibit an abnormal zzso zzso zzso A zzso search was conducted on the Available zzso zzso for molecules that mimic both the spatial orientation and basic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso dominant negative zzso The search revealed 1,000 potential candidates that were visually analyzed with respect to the structure of this zzso zzso on zzso zzso compounds were tested for zzso of zzso formation in zzso mouse zzso cells zzso Two compounds, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation in a zzso manner and demonstrated low levels of zzso A zzso search of the Available zzso zzso based on zzso identified five related zzso three of which exhibited activities comparable to zzso zzso dominant negative zzso in the design of drugs that inhibit prion replication may provide a more general approach to developing zzso for deleterious zzso zzso
