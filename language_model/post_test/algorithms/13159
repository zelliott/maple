A new zzso zzso based on the so-called geometric distance sorting technique is proposed for solving the zzso map zzso with zzso constraints which is one of the most essential tasks for inverse planning in zzso The framework of the proposed method is basically an zzso process which begins with a simple linear constrained zzso zzso model without considering any zzso constraints, and then the dose constraints for the zzso violating the zzso constraints are gradually added into the zzso zzso model step by step until all the zzso constraints are zzso In each iteration step, an interior point method is adopted to solve each new linear constrained zzso zzso For choosing the proper candidate zzso for the current dose constraint adding, a so-called geometric distance defined in the transformed standard zzso form of the zzso map zzso model was used to guide the selection of the zzso The new geometric distance sorting technique can mostly reduce the unexpected increase of the objective function value caused inevitably by the constraint zzso It can be regarded as an upgrading to the traditional dose sorting zzso The geometry explanation for the proposed method is also given and a proposition is proved to support our zzso zzso In addition, a smart constraint zzso strategy is designed to ensure a stable iteration zzso The new zzso is tested on four cases including zzso a zzso a lung and an zzso and compared with the zzso based on the traditional dose sorting zzso Experimental results showed that the proposed method is more suitable for guiding the selection of new constraints than the traditional dose sorting method, especially for the cases whose target regions are in zzso zzso It is a more efficient zzso technique to some extent for choosing constraints than the dose sorting zzso By zzso a smart constraint zzso scheme within the iteration zzso the new technique builds up an improved zzso for solving the zzso map zzso with zzso zzso
