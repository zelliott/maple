We propose a mathematical framework and zzso both to build accurate models of zzso microscope time series, as well as to design intelligent acquisition systems based on these zzso Model building allows the information contained in the zzso and 3-D time series to be presented in a more useful and concise form than the raw image zzso This is particularly relevant as the trend in biology tends more and more towards zzso applications, and the resulting increase in the amount of acquired image data makes visual inspection zzso The intelligent acquisition system uses an active learning approach to choose the acquisition regions that let us build our model most zzso resulting in a shorter acquisition time, as well as a reduction of the amount of zzso and zzso incurred during zzso We validate our methodology by modeling object motion within a zzso For intelligent zzso we propose a set of zzso to evaluate the information contained in a given acquisition region, as well as the costs associated with acquiring this region in terms of the resulting zzso and zzso and the amount of time taken for zzso We use these zzso to determine an acquisition zzso where and when to zzso as well as when to stop zzso zzso both on synthetic as well as real data, demonstrate accurate model building and large efficiency gains during zzso
