zzso dioxide zzso is one of the most relevant and abundant species in zzso and atmospheric zzso In particular, CO2 ice is present in several solar system bodies, as well as in interstellar and zzso ice zzso The amount of CO2 in ice zzso and the presence of pure CO2 ice are significant indicators of the temperature history of dust in zzso It is therefore important to know if CO2 is mixed with other molecules in the ice zzso or zzso and whether it is present in an zzso or zzso zzso We apply a multidisciplinary approach involving zzso zzso in the laboratory, theoretical modeling of solid structures, and comparison with zzso zzso We generate an unprecedented highly zzso CO2 ice and study its zzso both by zzso zzso and by slow zzso of zzso from the gas phase under an zzso zzso zzso changes are followed by zzso zzso We also devise theoretical models to reproduce different CO2 ice zzso We detect a preferential zzso orientation of some zzso modes of zzso zzso We identify the zzso features of zzso CO2 ice, and, in particular, we provide a theoretical explanation for a band at zzso zzso that dominates the spectrum of the zzso phase and disappears when the zzso is zzso Our results allow us to rule out the presence of pure and zzso CO2 ice in space based on the observations available so far, supporting our current view of the evolution of CO2 zzso
