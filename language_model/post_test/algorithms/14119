zzso zzso zzso of the coronary arteries were acquired with an zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso technique on an zzso X-ray zzso 

During selective injection of contrast material in the left and right coronary artery, projection images were obtained in eight pigs during a continuous rotation of the X-ray zzso over an angular range of 180 degrees within 8 zzso 

zzso zzso reconstruction depicted the zzso zzso and zzso sections of the main arteries as well as the main zzso in multiple cardiac zzso in all zzso 

For the first time, this feasibility study shows that a three-dimensional zzso of the coronary arteries can be obtained zzso in a conventional zzso suite by means of zzso reconstruction from projection zzso
