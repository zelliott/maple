zzso zzso respiratory correlated zzso zzso zzso has been widely used for studying organ zzso Most current zzso imaging zzso use zzso techniques that are susceptible to artifacts and challenge the quantitative analysis of organ zzso In this paper, we develop an zzso for analyzing organ motion which uses the raw, zzso imaging data to reconstruct images while simultaneously zzso deformation in the zzso zzso This results in reduction of artifacts and zzso a reduction in dose to the patient during scanning while providing equivalent or better image quality as compared to zzso The framework also incorporates fundamental physical properties of organ motion, such as the conservation of local tissue zzso We demonstrate that this approach is accurate and robust against noise and irregular breathing zzso We present results for a simulated cone beam CT zzso as well as a detailed real zzso liver phantom study demonstrating accuracy and zzso of the zzso An example of applying this zzso to real patient image data is also zzso
