We evaluated one zzso and two linear models of the zzso system while zzso the respiratory zzso zzso zzso against a zzso A zzso method involving voluntary varying rib cage and abdominal contributions to tidal volume in a single body position was zzso The influence on accuracy of the choice of respiratory phase during zzso was zzso Both tidal and zzso volumes were zzso Ten adults with no history of respiratory disorders went through zzso zzso and validation in the sitting and zzso zzso A linear zzso model, relating lung volume changes from the start of inspiration or expiration to rib cage and abdominal excursions from initiation of respiratory motion, had the best zzso The choice of respiratory phase for zzso did not affect zzso zzso generally underestimated lung volume at the start of inspiration and overestimated lung volume at the end of zzso zzso was more accurate in the zzso than the sitting position, probably because of limited spine zzso in the zzso zzso
