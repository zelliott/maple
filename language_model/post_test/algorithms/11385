A hybrid model zzso the differential Mueller zzso zzso and the Mueller zzso decomposition method is proposed for zzso the linear zzso zzso linear zzso zzso circular zzso zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso properties zzso of zzso optical zzso In contrast to the zzso Mueller zzso method, the proposed hybrid model provides zzso zzso of all the zzso properties of the optical zzso Furthermore, compared to the zzso Mueller zzso method, the proposed model is insensitive to the zzso order of the constituent basis zzso The zzso of the proposed method is confirmed by zzso the zzso properties of a compound zzso sample with zzso properties and two zzso samples with zzso and zzso properties, zzso It is shown that the proposed hybrid model not only yields zzso zzso of all the zzso zzso but is also more accurate and more stable than the decomposition zzso Moreover, compared to the decomposition method, the proposed model more accurately reflects the dependency of the phase zzso angle and linear zzso angle on the direction of the external magnetic field for zzso zzso Overall, the results presented in this study confirm that the proposed model has significant potential for zzso the optical parameters of real-world samples characterized by either single or multiple zzso zzso
