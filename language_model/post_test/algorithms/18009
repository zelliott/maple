The objectives of this study are to zzso all models developed to predict survival of zzso patients and to identify the ones to be used in different zzso 

A systematic review was performed searching with a free text and zzso strategy 3 electronic zzso For each model, the following parameters were zzso number, features of the zzso evaluation zzso clinical and/or pathological variables zzso zzso indexes zzso 

The research retrieved 156 zzso Eleven articles proposed new models, 5 articles external zzso We retrieved 2 mathematical models including clinical variables only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso including also pathological variables zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim 2004, zzso zzso Kim 2005, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso for patients with zzso disease zzso zzso 

The zzso was the most accurate zzso for conventional zzso while the zzso allowed the evaluation of patients regardless of tumor zzso The zzso zzso is zzso only for patients with conventional zzso while the zzso and zzso zzso also provide information for other zzso zzso patients can be evaluated with zzso and zzso zzso Two models combine molecular markers and clinical features zzso zzso
