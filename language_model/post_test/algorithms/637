The objective of this study was to develop an zzso method to describe the three-dimensional zzso geometry of the gastric zzso gastric zzso and the whole zzso The zzso series method was used to simulate the organ surface geometry obtained from a 3-D ultrasound zzso Data generated from eight zzso and three whole zzso at pressures of approximately 7 zzso zzso were used for zzso zzso zzso The principal zzso spatial zzso were zzso in the gastric zzso gastric zzso and the stomach due to their complex zzso The maximum zzso principal zzso in the zzso zzso and total stomach were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the maximum zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study provides an zzso tool for characterizing the complex 3-D geometry of an zzso the human stomach reconstructed by clinical imaging zzso Providing an average tension for the stomach does not reflect the large variation in tension throughout the stomach zzso
