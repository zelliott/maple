A network of coupled chaotic zzso can switch spontaneously to a state of collective synchronization at some critical zzso zzso We show that for a locally coupled network of units with zzso zzso and chaotic zzso states, set slightly below the critical zzso value, the collective excitable or zzso states of synchronization arise in response to a stimulus applied to a single zzso We provide an explanation of this behavior and show that it is due to a combination of the zzso properties of a single zzso and the zzso zzso By the use of zzso as a collective zzso we present a new method for controlling the transient zzso
