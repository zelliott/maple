One of the pressing open problems of zzso systems biology is the zzso of the zzso of genetic regulatory networks zzso using high zzso zzso data, in particular zzso gene expression zzso The zzso for zzso Engineering zzso and zzso zzso challenge aims to evaluate the success of zzso zzso zzso on benchmarks of simulated zzso In this article, we present zzso a new zzso for the zzso of zzso that was best performer in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different zzso zzso In each of the zzso problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target zzso is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes zzso zzso using zzso ensemble methods Random zzso or zzso The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory zzso zzso regulatory links are then zzso over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is zzso In addition to performing well on the zzso In zzso zzso challenge simulated data, we show that zzso compares favorably with existing zzso to decipher the genetic regulatory network of zzso zzso It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with zzso and zzso zzso produces directed zzso and is fast and zzso In conclusion, we propose a new zzso for zzso zzso that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression zzso The algorithm, based on feature selection with zzso ensemble methods, is simple and zzso making it adaptable to other types of zzso data and zzso
