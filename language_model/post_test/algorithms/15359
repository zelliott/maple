When zzso radiation therapy is anticipated, delaying zzso reconstruction prevents radiation delivery issues and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast reconstruction may allow for maintenance of the breast skin envelope as compared with delayed reconstruction with the temporary zzso of a tissue zzso The authors compared zzso complications and revision surgery rates of comparative zzso to determine which method is zzso 

zzso reconstruction was defined as placement of a temporary tissue zzso in the first stage at the time of mastectomy before zzso zzso which occurred following zzso radiation zzso Delayed reconstruction was zzso as mastectomy with primary closure in the first stage followed by zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients and 192 breasts met the study criteria for this retrospective review zzso zzso 118 zzso zzso zzso breast zzso 74 zzso Patient age and body mass index were similar between groups zzso zzso zzso complication rates were zzso percent in the delayed group and zzso percent in the zzso cohort zzso Total zzso loss zzso versus zzso percent; zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso percent; zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso percent; zzso zzso revision rates were similar between the zzso zzso zzso surgery occurred in zzso percent versus zzso percent in the delayed and zzso zzso respectively zzso 

In comparing two treatment zzso zzso complication rates are zzso zzso surgery results in a slightly increased complication rate in the zzso zzso zzso overall results with zzso reconstruction are zzso given significantly decreased rates of revision surgery following zzso zzso
