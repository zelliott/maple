To present the preliminary results of a method for zzso detection of fat and zzso cells as well as zzso surfaces in bone zzso zzso in order to calculate the percentage of each type of tissue or cell area in relation to the whole zzso 

The results were derived from selected clinical zzso Twenty-six zzso were used, presenting varied zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The approach is based on digital image processing techniques and pattern recognition methods using textural features obtained from biopsy zzso The results were improved with mathematical zzso zzso 

A low zzso cost zzso is obtained that produces highly satisfactory zzso The method is faster and more zzso than conventional ones, such as region growing, edge zzso splitting and zzso 

The results with this zzso technique were compared to those obtained by visual inspection by 2 expert zzso and differences of zzso zzso were zzso
