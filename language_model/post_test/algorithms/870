zzso responses to auditory and visual stimuli and motor tasks were assessed for the zzso of response in each of the respective primary zzso Five stimulus or task zzso were used zzso 2, 4, 8, and 16 zzso and five male subjects zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso were zzso Two tests of zzso were zzso The first test consisted of using zzso responses to short stimuli to predict responses to longer zzso The second test consisted of fitting ideal impulse response functions to the observed responses for each event zzso Both methods show that the extent of the zzso varies across zzso zzso for the second method indicate that the zzso response is zzso for stimuli less than 10 s in the primary auditory cortex, zzso for tasks less than 7 s in the primary motor cortex, and zzso for stimuli less than 3 s in the primary visual zzso In addition, neural adaptation functions were characterized that could model the observed zzso
