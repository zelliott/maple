A basic requirement in virtual environments is the tracking of objects, especially zzso A real time zzso system was presented and evaluated in this zzso System sensors were built using zzso zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso A zzso fusion zzso was applied to obtain dynamic zzso and further positions of segments of the zzso zzso The system with the proposed zzso was evaluated via zzso measuring zzso orientation and comparing with other two conventional zzso An arm motion experiment was demonstrated using the developed system and zzso The results validated the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
