The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso and the zzso of zzso as zzso for zzso zzso zzso activity in human liver zzso zzso An zzso method was developed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed during incubation with zzso from human liver and from zzso zzso strains expressing 10 human zzso zzso formation complied with zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation followed zzso zzso with mean values of zzso zzso and zzso for the low affinity zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso or zzso formation, with Ki values comparable with previously reported zzso zzso significant correlations were observed between zzso content and zzso of zzso and zzso in 12 human liver zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso revealed that only zzso actively zzso the zzso zzso was the most active zzso in zzso formation, but zzso and zzso also zzso minor proportions of the zzso In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that only zzso is actively involved in the formation of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso is a specific probe for zzso activity in human liver zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso is a somewhat less specific marker reaction for zzso activity, because the presence of a low affinity zzso is demonstrated by different zzso
