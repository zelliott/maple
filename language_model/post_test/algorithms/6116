zzso features are widely used as low-level input for computer vision applications, even when color data is zzso The extension of feature detection to the color domain prevents information loss due to zzso and allows us to exploit the zzso zzso To fully exploit the extra information in the color data, the zzso nature of color data has to be taken into account and a sound framework is needed to combine feature and zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we focus on the structure zzso or color zzso which adequately handles the zzso nature of color zzso Further, we combine the features based on the color zzso with zzso zzso derivatives to arrive at zzso zzso zzso We circumvent the drawback of unstable zzso zzso by zzso an uncertainty measure to accompany the zzso zzso zzso The uncertainty is incorporated in the color zzso hereby allowing the zzso of robust zzso zzso zzso The combination of the zzso zzso theory and zzso features allows for detection of a variety of features such as zzso zzso edges, corners, optical flow, and zzso The proposed features are tested for noise characteristics and zzso to zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed features are robust to scene incidental events and that the proposed uncertainty measure improves the zzso of full zzso
