A zzso zzso technique based on the Mueller zzso method and the zzso parameters is proposed for zzso effective parameters of zzso optical materials in linear zzso zzso linear zzso zzso circular zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso This technique is essential in determining the optical properties of zzso or biomedical materials for the development of advanced inspection and/or diagnostic zzso The error and resolution analysis of the proposed approach is demonstrated by zzso the effective parameters given an assumption of errors ranging zzso zzso in the values of the output zzso zzso The results confirm the ability of the proposed method to yield zzso zzso of all the optical zzso The zzso nature of the zzso model yields several important advantages, including an improved accuracy and the ability to extract the parameters of optical samples with only zzso zzso zzso or CD property without using compensation technique or zzso Moreover, by decoupling the extraction process, the zzso zzso problem inherent in previous models presented by the current group is zzso
