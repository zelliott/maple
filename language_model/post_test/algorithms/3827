A simple and rapid automatic method for detection of gait events at the foot could speed up and possibly increase the zzso of gait analysis and evaluations of treatments for pathological zzso The aim of this study was to compare and validate a zzso zzso used in the detection of four gait events, heel zzso heel rise, toe contact and toe zzso Force platform data is often used to obtain start and end of contact zzso but not usually heel rise and toe contact zzso For this purpose zzso zzso kinetic and video data were captured from 12 healthy adult subjects walking both barefoot and zzso at slow and normal self-selected zzso The data were used to determine the gait events using three zzso force, visual inspection and zzso zzso zzso percent of all zzso given by the zzso were within one frame zzso zzso when compared to visual zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the visual and zzso zzso For both heel and toe contact the differences between the three methods were within zzso zzso whereas for heel rise and toe off the differences between the force on one side and the visual and zzso on the other were higher and more varied (up to 175 zzso In addition, the zzso method provided the duration of three zzso heel contact to toe zzso toe contact to heel rise and heel rise to toe off, which are not readily available from force platform zzso The ability to automatically and reliably detect the zzso of these four gait events and three intervals using zzso data alone is an asset to clinical gait zzso
