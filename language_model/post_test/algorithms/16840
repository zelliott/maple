zzso modeling and integration of zzso models carry challenges due to the complex nature of zzso zzso High zzso within and among scales present a significant challenge in constructing and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to deal with such challenges in a systematic way, there is a significant need for an information technology framework together with related zzso and zzso tools that will facilitate integration of models and simulations of complex biological zzso zzso Model zzso zzso and Modeling zzso zzso is an information technology framework providing the tools to facilitate development, integration and simulation of integrated models of human zzso zzso brings software level solutions to the challenges raised by the complex nature of zzso zzso The aim of zzso and this paper is to lay some foundation with the new approaches such as information flow and modular representation of the zzso zzso The ultimate goal is to enhance the development of both the models and the integration approaches of zzso zzso processes and thus this paper focuses on the design approaches that would achieve such a zzso
