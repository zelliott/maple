A method for assessing the preserved zzso of zzso secondary structures is zzso Frequently recurring zzso stems in a set of secondary structures resulting from the simulated folding process of a given zzso are assessed and consensus structural motifs can then be selected to construct a secondary structure of the zzso zzso it can be applied to a series of zzso and zzso secondary structures zzso using the dynamic program developed by Williams and zzso To demonstrate the power and the usefulness of the program we give examples of this zzso
