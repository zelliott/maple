The aim of the current study is to investigate whether zzso models of zzso zzso zzso that are based on bovine zzso are reliable enough to be used for virtual screening of chemical zzso Starting from the recently described zzso zzso X-ray structure of bovine zzso zzso models of an zzso form of three human zzso zzso D3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso models were used to screen three-dimensional databases using three different zzso programs zzso zzso zzso in combination with seven scoring functions zzso Dock, zzso Fresno, Gold, zzso zzso zzso zzso models turned out to be zzso indeed, for virtual screening since known zzso seeded in the test databases could be distinguished from randomly chosen zzso However, such models are not accurate enough for retrieving known zzso To generate zzso models better suited for zzso zzso we developed a new zzso and zzso modeling procedure that might partly simulate the zzso changes occurring in the active site during zzso zzso zzso coordinates generated by this new procedure are now suitable for zzso zzso We thus propose two alternative strategies for the virtual screening of zzso zzso relying on a different set of zzso coordinates zzso and zzso zzso
