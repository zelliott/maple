zzso are generally difficult to detect in zzso zzso zzso images as they can be of varying zzso and do not appear as clear structures on these zzso This difficulty is more prominent in MR zzso zzso which is the MR technology using a special sequence of zzso imaging to identify the zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and gallbladder in the liver region, as zzso images are more noisy in nature and are acquired for a more focused area with too much flexibility in position orientation for convenient zzso zzso Based on the principle that the tumor mass zzso itself as zzso of the zzso tree structure, this paper introduces a technique that uses a region growing zzso to identify zzso in the zzso tree as a means to preliminary detection of a possible zzso in a fashion similar to the visual observation used by most zzso in making their preliminary zzso Through the use of appropriate image zzso watershed zzso zzso zzso region growing, and region analysis, the proposed technique is shown in this paper to be successful in identifying zzso images with liver zzso from those with normal zzso Acquisition zzso interactive image selection, and optimum image orientation will further enhance the accuracy of this proposed scheme for use in aiding clinical diagnosis at medical zzso
