The recurrence of a tumor is a crucial problem in hormonal therapy of prostate zzso Recent studies suggest that intermittent zzso suppression administration may prolong or hopefully prevent the progression to the zzso It was shown that a simple mathematical model is useful to understand how and why intermittent administration can be effective and to seek a better medication zzso In this paper, we propose a new model for the intermittent zzso suppression zzso What is central in the new model is that the competitive effect between zzso and independent cancer cells is assumed to be essential for the decrease of zzso cells under a normal zzso zzso In the newly proposed model, the zzso in the phase space for a normal zzso level plays an important zzso There is crucial difference between the previous model and the new one in the phase zzso of success and failure of the permanent tumor control by intermittent zzso suppression zzso That means that the suggestions from the models for clinical problems can be zzso We also consider the combined model of the previous and newly proposed models, which can smoothly bridge two zzso
