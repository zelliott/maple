zzso design has been used to the zzso of separation and determination of two active components in traditional Chinese medicines by zzso zzso The concentration of zzso applied zzso organic modifier content and buffer pH were selected as variable zzso Their different effects on peak resolution were studied by the experimental design zzso zzso separation conditions were obtained and successfully applied to the separation and determination of zzso and zzso in zzso medicinal zzso Good separation was achieved within 7 zzso using a buffer system composed of 20 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at pH zzso The applied zzso was 14 zzso and the detection was set at 235 zzso In addition, a zzso basis function neural network with a zzso structure was developed based on the experimental results of zzso design and uniform design, and was applied to the prediction of peak resolution of the two active components under the optimum separation conditions given by zzso zzso The predicted results were in good agreement with the experimental values, indicating that zzso basis function neural network is a potential way for the selection of separation conditions in zzso zzso
