zzso zzso in three different zzso positions as well as zzso usage biases of all available DNA sequences of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso It was observed that zzso levels among the three zzso positions is zzso as observed in other extremely high AT rich zzso zzso zzso being an AT rich zzso is expected to have A and/or T at the third positions of zzso zzso zzso usage analyses indicate that A and/or T ending zzso are zzso in this zzso and some particular zzso acids are abundant in the coding region of zzso However, zzso statistical analysis indicates two major trends in the zzso usage variation among the zzso one being strongly correlated with the zzso contents at the third synonymous positions of zzso and the other being associated with the expression level of zzso Moreover, zzso usage biases of the highly expressed genes are almost identical with the overall zzso usage biases of all the genes of this zzso These observations suggest that zzso bias is the main factor in determining the zzso usage variation among the genes in zzso zzso
