DNA sequencing is used zzso from deciphering zzso to determining the primary sequence of small zzso zzso The cloning of zzso is currently the most conventional method to determine the actual sequence of these important regulators of gene zzso Typical zzso cloning projects involve the sequencing of hundreds to thousands of zzso clones that are zzso at their zzso and 3' ends by fixed sequence zzso These zzso result from the zzso protocol used to isolate and convert the zzso into zzso zzso zzso Recently we completed a zzso cloning project involving tobacco plants, where analysis was required for approximately 700 zzso zzso Finding no easily accessible research tool to enter and analyze zzso sequences we developed zzso to assist us with our zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso cloning data processing algorithm, which initially searches for any zzso within a DNA sequencing text file, which is flanked by two constant zzso The zzso also termed zzso or zzso is stored in a zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are then compared using zzso to locally installed databases allowing the rapid comparison of the insert to both the growing zzso database and to other zzso sequence zzso Our laboratory used zzso to analyze scores of DNA sequencing data originating from an zzso cloning zzso Through its built-in instant analysis of all zzso using zzso we were able to quickly identify 33 groups of zzso from approximately 700 database zzso This zzso allowed the easy identification of novel and highly expressed clusters of zzso zzso is available under zzso zzso and currently implemented on zzso 

zzso was designed for medium sized zzso cloning projects with about 1,000 database zzso zzso can be used for any type of sequence analysis where two constant primer regions flank a sequence of zzso The reliable storage of zzso and their zzso in a zzso database, zzso comparison of new zzso to dynamic and zzso databases make it a powerful new tool in any laboratory using DNA zzso zzso also prevents manual mistakes during the zzso process and speeds up zzso and zzso Once the server is installed locally, its access can be restricted to protect sensitive new DNA sequencing zzso zzso was primarily designed for zzso cloning projects, but can be applied to a variety of zzso and DNA cloning zzso
