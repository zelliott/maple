In this paper, a novel zzso mapping zzso based on an zzso differential evolution zzso algorithm, zzso zzso zzso mapping zzso is developed to perform the zzso mapping task for remote sensing zzso zzso mapping may provide a zzso map of class labels from zzso spectral zzso fraction images, with the assumption of spatial zzso In zzso to zzso zzso the zzso mapping problem is transformed into an zzso problem by maximizing the spatial dependence zzso The traditional DE zzso is an efficient and powerful zzso zzso global zzso in continuous zzso problems, but it cannot be applied to the zzso mapping problem in a discrete search zzso In addition, it is not an easy task to properly set control parameters in zzso To avoid these problems, this paper zzso an zzso strategy without zzso zzso and a zzso strategy between continuous space and discrete space, to improve the classical DE zzso During the process of evolution, they are further improved by enhanced evolution operators, zzso zzso zzso repair, exchange, zzso and an effective local search to generate new candidate zzso Experimental results using different types of remote images show that the zzso zzso consistently zzso the previous zzso mapping zzso in all the zzso Based on sensitivity analysis, zzso with its zzso control zzso setting, is better than, or at least comparable to, the standard DE algorithm, when considering the accuracy of zzso zzso and hence provides an effective new approach to zzso mapping for remote sensing zzso
