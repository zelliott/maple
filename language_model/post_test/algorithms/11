The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the advantages of designing computer-based motor controllers together with innovative motors, such that maximum zzso system benefits are zzso Specifically, this paper describes how a computer-based zzso system for powered wheelchairs has been designed and is being built and zzso This type of integral zzso system has been possible to build into a wheelchair only with the advent of the zzso feedback motor zzso The type of motor chosen for this project was a linear zzso motor zzso which is highly efficient zzso and could easily be made an integral part of a wheelchair wheel, providing a zzso drive zzso However, an zzso cannot be zzso without knowledge of, and controlled adjustment to, the absolute zzso versus zzso position at each point in zzso zzso feedback motor controllers make precise, efficient control of zzso possible at a reasonable zzso In addition, this combination of controller and motor provides a very flexible wheelchair zzso system that may be easily programmed to suit the needs and zzso of the wide variety of over 200,000 persons now using powered zzso
