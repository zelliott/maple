To zzso evaluate the ability of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging to be used to determine the T stage of zzso cancer and to measure the correlation between the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This study was approved by the local institutional review zzso All patients gave written informed zzso Forty patients with a total of 52 zzso tumors underwent MR imaging that included zzso zzso zzso grade was determined for all zzso Two zzso interpreted four image sets zzso zzso images alone, zzso plus zzso images, zzso plus dynamic contrast zzso images, all three image types zzso Conventional criteria were used for interpreting zzso and zzso zzso For zzso images, new staging criterion developed on the basis of the hypothesis that tumors, zzso zzso and muscles show high, low, and intermediate signal intensity, respectively, was zzso The zzso test was used to examine differences in zzso sensitivity, and zzso zzso in the performance were analyzed by comparing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso To compare zzso between three zzso grades, analysis of zzso was zzso 

The overall accuracy of T stage diagnosis was zzso for zzso images alone, zzso for zzso plus zzso images, zzso for zzso plus zzso images, and zzso for all three image types zzso The overall zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosing zzso or higher stages were significantly improved by adding zzso images zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso of zzso tumors was significantly lower than that of zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images provided useful information for evaluating the T stage of zzso cancer, particularly in zzso zzso or lower tumors from zzso or higher zzso The zzso may in part predict the zzso grade of zzso zzso
