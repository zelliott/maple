In this paper, we propose a novel approach to zzso noisy and complex data sets based on the zzso zzso Systems zzso The proposed approach, termed zzso has three main zzso zzso a learning process to evolve the rule population, zzso a rule zzso process to remove redundant rules after the learning process, and zzso a rule merging process to deal with the overlapping rules that commonly occur between the zzso In the first process, we have modified the zzso mechanisms of the current available zzso and developed a new accelerate learning method to improve the quality of the evolved rule zzso In the second process, an effective rule zzso zzso is zzso The rule merging process is based on our newly proposed zzso zzso rule merging algorithm, which comprises the following steps: zzso all the generated rules are modeled by a zzso with each rule representing a zzso zzso the zzso in the graph are merged to form a number of zzso zzso rule zzso under some zzso criteria, which generates the final rule set to represent the zzso zzso each data is zzso and assigned to a cluster that it belongs to, guided by the final rule zzso In our experiments, we compared the proposed zzso with zzso a benchmark zzso well known for its excellent performance, on a number of challenging data zzso The results show that the proposed approach zzso zzso in the successful rate, and also demonstrates good zzso
