Linear zzso analysis is considered the least zzso demanding method for mapping quantitative trait zzso zzso However, simultaneous search for multiple zzso the use of permutations to obtain empirical significance zzso and larger experimental studies significantly increase the zzso zzso This report describes an easily implemented parallel algorithm, which significantly reduces the computing time in both zzso mapping and zzso zzso In the example zzso the analysis time was decreased to less than zzso of a single zzso system by the use of 18 zzso We indicate how the efficiency of the analysis could be improved by distributing the zzso more evenly to the processors and how other ways of distributing the data facilitate the use of more zzso The use of parallel computing in zzso mapping makes it possible to routinely use permutations to obtain empirical significance thresholds for multiple traits and multiple zzso zzso It could also be of use to improve the zzso efficiency of the more zzso demanding zzso analysis zzso
