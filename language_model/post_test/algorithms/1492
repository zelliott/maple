Particularly in color flow zzso the detection of minor zzso is a significant outstanding zzso With the goal of zzso mapping changes in zzso and zzso rate to locate the source of the flow zzso two indicators of the magnitude of the signal correlation are presented and evaluated for known experimental flow zzso A zzso zzso is zzso which is zzso to the magnitude of the signal correlation evaluated over a set of received zzso Its performance is compared to that of a zzso correlation measure for the development of spatial maps that indicate zzso rate and zzso
