zzso zzso zzso at birth is commonly defined as zzso zzso zzso pH zzso zzso plus base deficit zzso zzso zzso zzso Base deficit is not a measured entity but is calculated from pH and zzso values, with the zzso zzso concentration zzso included in the calculation zzso as a fixed or measured zzso Various blood gas zzso use different zzso indicating variations in the MA zzso The objective was therefore to calculate the prevalence of MA in blood and zzso fluid with zzso from three blood gas zzso brands relative to the Clinical and Laboratory zzso Institute zzso zzso 

Comparative zzso 

University zzso 

zzso zzso blood from 15 354 zzso 

zzso of zzso 

Blood was analyzed in a zzso zzso 735 zzso Base deficit was calculated post hoc with zzso from zzso and zzso and Roche blood gas zzso and with measured and fixed zzso zzso values of zzso 

The prevalence of BD zzso zzso in blood was with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Roche zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test, p zzso zzso Likewise, MA zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso Base deficit zzso zzso zzso and MA rates were lower in zzso fluid than in blood zzso zzso zzso with measured or fixed zzso concentration made no differences to MA rates zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso rate varied significantly with blood gas zzso brand and fetal fluid compartment for calculation of zzso
