A new zzso zzso is presented for mapping zzso to locations along the zzso given noisy zzso distance data as zzso The model considered is quite general: The input consists of a collection of probe pairs and a confidence zzso for the zzso distance separating each zzso Because the distance intervals are only known with some confidence level, some may be erroneous and must be removed in order to find a consistent zzso A novel zzso technique for detecting and removing bad distance intervals is zzso The technique could be useful in other contexts where partially erroneous data is inconsistent with the remaining zzso These zzso were motivated by the goal of making probe maps with zzso distance confidence intervals estimated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was done on synthetic data sets (with and without zzso and FISH data from a region of human zzso zzso zzso with up to 100 zzso could be solved in several minutes on a fast zzso In addition to FISH zzso we describe some other possible applications that fall within the problem zzso These include: mapping a backbone structure in folded DNA, finding consensus maps between independent maps covering the same zzso region, and ordering clones in a clone zzso
