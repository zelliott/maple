zzso diffusion on curved biological zzso has been studied theoretically and zzso However, how membrane zzso influence the diffusion process remains zzso Here we show the significance of zzso zzso by zzso solving the diffusion equation in a zzso polar coordinate system with regard to several types of surfaces including zzso and zzso zzso On surfaces where zzso zzso has positive and negative values, diffusion is slower and faster than on the plane, zzso The zzso from the normal diffusion on the plane tends to get larger as the absolute value of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at a surface region where the normal zzso is zzso and zzso zzso has zzso zzso The zzso can be classified into several types according to whether diffusion is the fastest or the zzso in the principal zzso In the case of diffusion on zzso the limited area of a closed surface reduces the diffusion rate so greatly that the slowdown effects of positive values of zzso zzso are zzso Analysis of the diffusion equation suggests that zzso zzso causes slowed or accelerated diffusion and zzso diffusion in any type of zzso Furthermore, it is discussed the degree to which zzso zzso influences zzso phenomena taking place in real zzso through such zzso These results provide a different image of biological zzso that lateral diffusion of membrane molecules is usually zzso and the diffusion rate zzso changes according to zzso
