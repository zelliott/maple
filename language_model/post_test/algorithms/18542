zzso of zzso data generally contain a very large number of dots, making it difficult to get a good impression of their distribution in dense zzso 

We present a fast and simple zzso for two-dimensional zzso zzso to visually enhance zzso 

zzso for zzso and R are available from the corresponding zzso
