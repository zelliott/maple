We present a novel concept, zzso zzso to reconstruct and zzso continuous traffic flows from discrete zzso data provided by traffic sensors or generated artificially to enhance a sense of immersion in a dynamic virtual zzso Given the positions of each car at two recorded locations on a highway and the corresponding time instances, our approach can reconstruct the traffic flows zzso the dynamic motions of multiple cars over zzso between the two locations along the highway for immersive zzso of virtual cities or other zzso Our zzso is zzso to zzso traffic on highways with an arbitrary number of lanes and takes into account the geometric, zzso and dynamic constraints on the zzso Our method reconstructs the car motion that automatically zzso the number of lane changes, respects safety distance to other cars, and zzso the acceleration necessary to obtain a smooth traffic flow subject to the given zzso Furthermore, our framework can process a continuous stream of input data in real time, enabling the users to view zzso traffic events in a virtual world as they zzso We demonstrate our reconstruction technique with both synthetic and real-world zzso
