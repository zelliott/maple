It is currently not known whether zzso zzso is superior to partial liquid ventilation zzso for therapy of acute lung zzso In this study, the authors compared the effects of both therapies in zzso zzso lung zzso 

Lung injury was induced in 30 zzso and mechanically zzso pigs by means of central zzso infusion of zzso zzso Animals were assigned to one of the following groups: zzso control or gas ventilation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso (30 zzso Two hours after zzso lungs were recruited and positive zzso pressure was adjusted to obtain minimal zzso zzso was continued during 4 additional hours, when animals were killed for lung zzso zzso 

Gas exchange and zzso were comparable among zzso zzso zzso and zzso before the open lung approach was used and improved in a similar fashion in all groups after positive zzso pressure was adjusted to optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar behavior was observed in functional residual capacity zzso in animals treated with zzso zzso and zzso Lung resistance improved after recruitment zzso zzso zzso but values were higher in the zzso zzso and zzso groups as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, positive zzso pressure values required to obtain minimal zzso were lower with zzso zzso than with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, diffuse zzso damage was significantly lower in the zzso and zzso zzso vapor groups as compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although the use of zzso zzso zzso permitted the authors to reduce pressures needed to stabilize the lungs and was associated with better zzso findings than were zzso and zzso none of these zzso therapies improved gas exchange or lung mechanics as compared with zzso
