With the help of the most advanced zzso we obtained many dozens of zzso zzso mirror designs to zzso find limits for the maximum achievable negative value of the group delay zzso zzso This value depends on the total thickness of zzso and layer material zzso zzso and zzso combinations are studied in detail, for combinations zzso and zzso we obtained zzso for two zzso We also show that reasonable values of zzso zzso have no significant impact on the obtained zzso Current state-of-the-art technology allows to produce designs with total physical thicknesses slightly higher than 10 zzso and to achieve maximum negative zzso values corresponding to this total design zzso zzso with total physical thickness of 15 zzso and 20 zzso are not realized yet due to high sensitivity to deposition zzso
