zzso chain reaction zzso is a major DNA amplification technology from molecular zzso The quantitative analysis of zzso aims at determining the initial amount of the DNA molecules from the observation of typically several zzso zzso zzso The mainstream observation scheme of the DNA amplification during zzso involves zzso intensity zzso Under the classical assumption that the measured zzso intensity is zzso to the amount of present DNA zzso and under the assumption that these zzso are corrupted by an additive zzso noise, we analyze a single amplification curve using a hidden zzso model zzso The unknown parameters of the zzso may be separated into two zzso On the one hand, the parameters from the amplification process are the initial number of the DNA molecules and the replication efficiency, which is the probability of one zzso to be zzso On the other hand, the parameters from the zzso scheme are the scale zzso allowing to convert the zzso intensity into the number of DNA molecules and the mean and zzso characterizing the zzso zzso We use the maximum likelihood zzso procedure to zzso the unknown parameters of the model from the exponential phase of a single amplification curve, the main zzso of interest for quantitative zzso being the initial amount of the DNA zzso An illustrative example is zzso
