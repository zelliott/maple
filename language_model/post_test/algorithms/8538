of the second part of the investigation was the evaluation of a newly developed zzso zzso zzso in comparison to the system processing zzso of the wrist and ankle to further zzso the image quality with zzso zzso 

All 120 zzso of the wrist and all 100 zzso of the ankle used in the 1st part of this paper were processed with the zzso zzso zzso The evaluation was again performed by 5 zzso with zzso zzso For the data analysis a variation of the Visual zzso Analysis zzso was zzso 

Up to 19 % of the wrist zzso and 2 % of the ankle zzso processed with the system software had to be processed manually afterwards to get acceptable zzso By the application of the zzso zzso zzso a manual zzso was no longer zzso zzso significant zzso zzso zzso differences for all criteria to be evaluated were found for the wrist zzso and in the case of the ankle zzso for the bone contrast, the contrast in zzso regions, the fine details in the bone and the artifacts, the zzso zzso zzso performed always better than the system zzso 

Using half of the zzso dose on a flat-panel zzso an zzso zzso leads to comparable or better results compared to the conventional zzso concerning the image zzso
