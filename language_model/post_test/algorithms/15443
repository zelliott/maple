zzso and real-time information is critical for decision making, especially in medical applications, where any delay in diagnosis due to collection, transport and storage of zzso can have substantial ramifications for disease zzso 

We present a facile method for zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso analysis of zzso contents using a zzso zzso A zzso zzso was developed in order to understand the zzso behavior of different zzso pharmaceutical zzso based on the recorded spectral zzso Furthermore, we employed the zzso probe to detect antibiotics in a human urine zzso Our observations suggest that it is possible to provide quantitative concentration determination of zzso zzso by using cotton zzso as a sampling probe, which offers a wealth of possibility for real-time measurement in clinical zzso 

We envision that the intrinsic simplicity of the proposed approach in conjunction with its capability for accurate zzso determination in zzso will lead to its clinical translation and application in zzso settings in the near zzso
