The zzso zzso product intercept zzso has become an important figure of interest for zzso in zzso zzso zzso analog zzso With the desire for highly linear zzso comes the need to be able to accurately measure the device without additional zzso The purpose of this work is to redesign the current zzso setup to accurately measure the third order zzso zzso of the zzso and to also be able to measure the second order intercept point zzso using the same zzso The new setup will isolate equipment contributed zzso by maintaining a small zzso drive zzso zzso on the zzso and by zzso changing the zzso input zzso depth while maintaining a constant input optical power to the zzso The goal is to measure a specific knee point where different slopes will indicate the change to zzso dominated zzso
