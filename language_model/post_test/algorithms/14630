This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of line scan diffusion images zzso in normal prostate and prostate zzso zzso echo planner images zzso were used for zzso 

Twenty prostate tumors were examined by conventional zzso in 14 patients prior to radical zzso All patients were examined with a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso GE Medical System Milwaukee, zzso zzso zzso MR imaging zzso using zzso was performed with a pelvic zzso zzso with b values of 5 and 800 zzso zzso using zzso was performed with a body zzso with b values of 0 and 800 zzso The zzso of each sequence for 14 normal prostate and 20 prostate zzso were zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso on zzso was estimated and compared for each zzso 

The mean zzso zzso of normal peripheral zones zzso transition zones zzso and cancer (in zzso zzso that used zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Those that used zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso test zzso we found a significant difference in each sequence between normal tissue (both zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso test zzso also registered a significant difference between zzso and zzso Mean zzso for zzso using zzso was zzso while the zzso using zzso was zzso The difference between the zzso of each sequence was not statistically significant by paired zzso zzso 

We found that zzso using zzso and zzso showed similar tendencies in the same zzso However, in all regions, zzso zzso had smaller standard zzso than zzso zzso
