Important patterns can be found in strings of characters such as zzso in a DNA sequence by examining the frequency of occurrence of specific character combinations or zzso The abundance of words can reveal the presence of underlying trends governing the order of characters, even if the biological reasons for those trends remain zzso As an example of one way in which word zzso have provided insight, we describe the zzso a zzso zzso for analyzing zzso and their effect on gene zzso The zzso demonstrates that zzso located near the beginning of genes are zzso distinct from later zzso and that these differences are closely related to the ability of some zzso to increase gene zzso This zzso approach has proven more successful than deletion analysis at identifying the sequences responsible for zzso expression because they are dispersed throughout zzso zzso
