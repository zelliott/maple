zzso of markers of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso is still an open zzso The aim of this study was to assess the behavior of heart rate zzso and ejection time, expressed as the percentage of the corresponding cardiac cycle zzso in patients with zzso zzso with a view to providing an alarm before the zzso 

In 33 patients with zzso and positive tilt testing and in 33 control patients, we collected zzso data on HR, zzso stroke volume zzso and blood pressure zzso The trends of zzso and zzso were zzso A set of combined changes of zzso and zzso were tested in order to select the most appropriate zzso for detecting the zzso zzso within the 3 minutes preceding the zzso 

In patients with positive tilt testing, zzso significantly decreased at 3 minutes before and at the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slowly rose at 3 minutes before zzso and then suddenly decreased at the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso was r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased throughout tilt testing zzso zzso zzso The selected setting for the zzso provided sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso The theoretical alarm was generated at least 9 and 5 seconds before zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso of the zzso 

The combined trends in zzso and zzso may provide a marker of zzso zzso zzso in the majority of zzso
