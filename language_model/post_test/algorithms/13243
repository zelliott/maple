We present a zzso coherent optical receiver, which employs a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier phase and frequency offset zzso The zzso carrier zzso uses a CW zzso filter to generate a carrier reference zzso and the filter weights are automatically adapted zzso by linear zzso on the observed zzso A complete zzso reduced frequency offset zzso zzso range of zzso zzso is zzso independent of zzso format, where R is the symbol zzso zzso phase and frequency tracking is achieved zzso The acquisition speed of frequency offset in zzso zzso keying zzso signals is more than 5 times faster than that of differential zzso A constant penalty of approximately 1 zzso at zzso rate of zzso is demonstrated for all frequency zzso in zzso signals with zzso product of 8 zzso zzso
