The molecular dynamics expression of heat zzso originally derived by Irving and Kirkwood zzso zzso zzso 18, 817 zzso for zzso zzso is generalized in this paper for systems with zzso zzso The original formula consists of a kinetic part and a potential part, and the latter term is found in the present study to be zzso as a zzso of contributions from all the zzso zzso defined in the zzso The energy transfer among a set of sites for which a zzso potential is defined is discussed and evaluated by the rate of increase in the kinetic energy of each site due to the potential, and its zzso over all the zzso in the system is shown to make up the potential part of the generalized zzso A molecular dynamics simulation for liquid zzso was performed to demonstrate the zzso of the new expression obtained in this study to measure the heat flux and to zzso the contributions of zzso and zzso zzso to heat zzso
