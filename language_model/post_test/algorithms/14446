We assume that zzso frequency data have been extracted from several large DNA pools, each containing genetic material of up to hundreds of sampled zzso Our goal is to estimate the zzso zzso among the sampled individuals by combining the pooled zzso frequency data with prior knowledge about the set of possible zzso Such prior information can be zzso for example, from a database such as zzso We present a zzso zzso method for pooled DNA based on a continuous approximation of the zzso zzso The proposed method is zzso when the sizes of the DNA pools and/or the number of considered zzso exceed the limits of several earlier zzso In the example zzso the proposed model clearly zzso a deterministic greedy zzso on real data from the zzso zzso With a small number of zzso the performance of the proposed method is similar to that of an zzso which uses a zzso approximation for the pooled zzso zzso but which does not zzso prior information about the zzso The method has been implemented using zzso and the code is available upon request from the zzso
