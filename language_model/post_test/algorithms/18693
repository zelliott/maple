Finding the causality and strength of connectivity in zzso regulatory networks from zzso data will provide a powerful tool for the analysis of cellular zzso Presented here is the design of tools for the evaluation of the network's model structure and zzso The most effective tools are found to be based on evolution zzso We evaluate models of increasing complexity, from zzso zzso zzso models to Hill functions and zzso derived zzso These last functions provide the free energies of binding of zzso factors to their operators, as well as zzso zzso zzso results based on published experimental data from a synthetic network in zzso coli are zzso The free energies of binding and zzso found by our tools are in the same zzso ranges as those zzso derived in the zzso zzso zzso We also use zzso data from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso The zzso appropriately finds the parameters of pairs of regulated regulatory zzso zzso showing that for related genes an overall reasonable zzso effort is sufficient to find the strength and causality of the connectivity of large numbers of zzso
