zzso health literacy is important for people to maintain good health and manage diseases and zzso Educational text, either retrieved from the Internet or provided by a doctor's office, is a popular method to communicate zzso zzso Unfortunately, it is difficult to write text that is easy to understand, and existing approaches, mostly the application of zzso formulas, have not convincingly been shown to reduce the difficulty of zzso 

To develop an evidence-based writer support tool to improve perceived and actual text zzso To this end, we are developing and testing zzso that automatically identify difficult sections in text and provide appropriate, easier zzso zzso that effectively reduce text difficulty will be included in the support zzso This work describes the user evaluation with an independent writer of an automated zzso zzso using term zzso 

Term familiarity indicates how easy words are for readers and is estimated using term zzso in the Google Web zzso zzso words are zzso identified and zzso for potential zzso zzso alternatives consisting of zzso zzso zzso and semantic types are extracted from zzso the zzso Medical Language System zzso and zzso and ranked for a writer to choose from to simplify the zzso We conducted a controlled user study with a representative writer who used our zzso zzso to simplify zzso We tested the impact with representative zzso The key independent variable of our study is zzso zzso and we measured its effect on both perceived and actual text zzso Participants were recruited from zzso Mechanical zzso zzso zzso difficulty was measured with 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso difficulty was measured with 3 zzso 5 zzso questions alongside each text to measure understanding, 7 zzso questions without the text for learning, and 2 free recall questions for information zzso 

Ninety-nine participants completed the zzso We found strong beneficial effects on both perceived and actual zzso After zzso the text was perceived as simpler zzso with simplified text scoring zzso and original text zzso on the zzso zzso scale zzso 1: zzso It also led to better understanding of the text zzso with zzso more correct answers with simplified text zzso zzso compared to the original zzso zzso There was more learning with zzso more correct answers after reading simplified text compared to zzso more correct answers after reading the original text zzso There was no significant effect on free zzso 

Term familiarity is a valuable feature in simplifying zzso Although the topic of the text influences the effect size, the results were convincing and zzso
