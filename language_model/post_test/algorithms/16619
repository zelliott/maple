Breast masses exhibit zzso in margins, shapes, and dimensions, so their detection is a difficult task in zzso zzso zzso Mass detection is usually a zzso zzso mass identification and zzso zzso A new method to automatically detect mass zzso in zzso images with tuning according to the breast tissue density was developed and zzso 

A modified phase portrait analysis method was introduced, based on the zzso condition number and an zzso intensity zzso The method uses an zzso and tissue zzso zzso procedure with extraction of geometric zzso zzso reduction is accomplished using a fuzzy zzso zzso A zzso zzso procedure was zzso and zzso zzso analysis was used to automatically extract an optimal set of zzso Testing and validation were performed on two different data sets containing at least one zzso mass D1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a third data set zzso zzso zzso was used consisting of normal zzso These three data sets were taken from the Digital Database for zzso zzso 

For sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the best results on cancer images exhibit an zzso per Image zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using a zzso Linear zzso Analysis zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a fuzzy zzso system zzso for zzso zzso When the zzso is tested on normal images, an zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso 

A zzso study of an automatic breast mass detection zzso provided promising results in terms of sensitivity and low zzso zzso Further development and clinical testing are justified based on the zzso
