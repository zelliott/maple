In the feature selection of cancer zzso problems, many existing methods consider genes individually by choosing the top genes which have the most significant zzso statistic or correlation zzso However the information of the class distinction provided by such genes may overlap zzso since their gene expression patterns are zzso The zzso of including many genes with similar gene expression patterns results in highly complex zzso According to the principle of zzso zzso simple models are preferable to complex ones, if they can produce comparable prediction performances to the complex zzso In this paper, we introduce a new method to learn accurate and zzso zzso from gene expression zzso In our method, we use mutual information to measure the relation between a set of zzso called gene zzso and the class attribute of the zzso The gene zzso are in zzso spaces than individual zzso therefore, they are more diverse, or contain more information than individual zzso zzso gene zzso are more preferable to individual genes in describing the class distinctions between samples since they contain more information about the class zzso We validate our method on 3 gene expression zzso By comparing our results with those from literature and other well-known zzso methods, our method demonstrated better or comparable prediction performances to the existing methods, however, with zzso models than existing zzso
