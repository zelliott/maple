The increased zzso times which characterize zzso radiation therapy zzso could lead to an increase in the dose received by radiation therapists due to induced zzso To examine this, gamma ray zzso was used to identify the major zzso responsible for zzso at a representative location in the treatment room of an 18 zzso accelerator zzso zzso zzso These were found to be zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the dose rate measured at this location following zzso was analyzed in terms of the known zzso to yield zzso dose rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso was developed to estimate zzso dose zzso due to successive patient zzso cycles, characterized by the number of 18 zzso zzso per week, zzso the number of zzso per zzso M, the zzso time between zzso zzso zzso and the treatment delivery time zzso zzso The results are represented by the sum of two formulas, one for the dose from zzso zzso zzso zzso F M zzso and one for the dose from the other zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For conventional therapy doses are about 60 zzso for an 18 zzso workload of 60,000 zzso zzso for zzso purposes can significantly increase the zzso For zzso as currently practiced, lengthy treatment delivery times limit the number of zzso that can be delivered per week and hence limit the dose to values similar to those in conventional zzso However for an zzso regime designed to maximize patient zzso doses up to 330 zzso could be zzso To reduce dose it is recommended that zzso treatments should be delivered at energies lower than 18 zzso that in zzso zzso zzso treatments should be scheduled in the latter part of the day, and that equipment manufacturers should strive to minimize zzso in the design of zzso zzso
