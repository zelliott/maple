zzso resonance images are typically displayed as the absolute value of the discrete zzso transform of the zzso zzso However, zzso images, the real part of the discrete zzso transform of the data after applying an appropriate phase zzso have significant advantages over zzso zzso In a companion paper, the problem of zzso the phase parameters needed to produce an zzso image when the phase of the complex image varies zzso as a function of position, a situation common in magnetic resonance images, was zzso However, some magnetic resonance images have zzso that can vary in a complicated, zzso zzso dependent zzso To produce an zzso image from these data, one must first estimate the zzso dependent phase, and then use that phase estimate to produce an zzso zzso This paper addresses both of these problems by first using zzso probability theory to estimate the constant or zzso phase as a function of image position, and then the calculations are illustrated by using them to generate zzso images from data where the phase of the image is a zzso function of zzso
