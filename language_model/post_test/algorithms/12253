The zzso parameters zzso and zzso chemical shifts and zzso zzso for a series of naturally occurring molecules have been calculated mostly with zzso methods, and their zzso compared with available experimental zzso The comparison includes zzso as a test case, as well as some examples of recently isolated natural products zzso zzso zzso zzso featuring unusual and/or crowded structures and, in the case of zzso B, being the subject of a recent zzso Whenever experimental zzso were obtained in polar zzso the calculation of zzso parameters was also carried out with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Model zzso zzso zzso The zzso results generally show a good agreement with experiment, as judged not only by statistical parameters but also by visual comparison of line zzso The origin of the remaining discrepancies is attributed to the incomplete modeling of zzso and specific zzso zzso
