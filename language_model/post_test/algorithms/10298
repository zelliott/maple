zzso of patients into time sensitive clinical trials in intensive care units zzso poses a significant zzso Enrollment is limited by delayed recognition and late notification of research zzso The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the zzso of electronic screening zzso shock zzso regarding enrollment into a time sensitive (24 h after zzso clinical study of zzso in severe zzso and septic zzso 

We developed and tested a zzso time computerized alert system, the septic shock zzso based on established severe zzso shock diagnostic zzso A sniffer scanned patients' data in the electronic medical records and notified the research coordinator on call through an institutional zzso system of potentially eligible zzso 

The performance of the septic shock sniffer was zzso 

The septic shock sniffer performed well with a positive zzso value of zzso Electronic screening doubled enrollment, with 68 of zzso zzso admissions enrolled during the zzso after zzso versus 37 of zzso zzso admissions before sniffer zzso zzso Efficiency was limited by study coordinator availability (not available at nights or zzso 

zzso electronic medical records screening improves the efficiency of enrollment and should be a routine tool for the recruitment of patients into time sensitive clinical trials in the zzso zzso
