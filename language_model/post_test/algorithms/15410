To investigate the relationship between zzso zzso tape stripping from in zzso and in zzso using zzso zzso zzso topical cream as the model zzso 

In zzso and in zzso tape zzso were conducted on separated pig ear skin used as a biological membrane for zzso diffusion cell testing and the zzso skin area at the zzso zzso of healthy volunteers, zzso zzso zzso topical cream was applied to the skin for zzso 2, and zzso The drug profiles of zzso across the stratum zzso were determined immediately zzso zzso and at zzso 1, 2, and zzso after removing the zzso The amounts of zzso were analyzed by a validated zzso liquid zzso zzso The area under the curve zzso and the maximum amounts of zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso Partition zzso zzso and diffusion zzso zzso were derived from the zzso second law zzso During the schedule time of zzso the zzso of in zzso and in zzso data were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso There was insignificant difference of the zzso and the zzso between excised pig ear and human zzso In addition, zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso were used to predict the zzso presented the value of zzso zzso whereas the true value calculated from zzso software provided the value of zzso zzso differing from each other in approximate of zzso 

In zzso tape stripping using the separated pig ear skin as a viable membrane of the zzso diffusion cell testing demonstrates the potential to represent in zzso tape stripping in human for topical zzso study of zzso zzso zzso topical zzso
