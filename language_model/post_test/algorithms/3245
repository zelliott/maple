Contemporary zzso models of alcohol abuse propose that alcohol abuse develops because of zzso in the impulsive system, which generates automatic impulses to drink alcohol, and disruptions in the reflective system, which becomes unable to inhibit the influence of these automatic zzso Based on these zzso this study investigated whether individual differences in the ability of the reflective system to exert response zzso moderate the relationship between automatic cognitive processes and drinking zzso Specifically, it was examined whether the interaction between implicit alcohol-related associations and response zzso predicted drinking zzso 

Seventy-one university students completed the study online via the zzso zzso alcohol associations with positive affect and with zzso were assessed with zzso of the zzso Association zzso Response zzso was measured using the original zzso zzso Participants also reported their weekly alcohol use and alcohol-related zzso 

As predicted, implicit associations were unrelated to drinking behavior when response zzso was zzso In contrast, when response zzso was low, stronger implicit associations between alcohol and positive affect predicted increased alcohol use and alcohol-related zzso 

These findings indicate that the relationship between automatic cognitive zzso originating in the impulsive system, and drinking behavior depends on individual differences in response zzso exerted by the reflective zzso As prolonged alcohol abuse is known to impair response zzso alcohol abusers may benefit from interventions that increase response zzso thereby restoring zzso control over automatic zzso
