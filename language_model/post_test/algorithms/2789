In zzso the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso is considered as the master zzso zzso Each cell in the zzso contains an autonomous molecular clock, and the zzso is composed of multiple zzso zzso zzso The fundamental question is how the individual cellular zzso expressing a wide range of zzso interact and assemble to create an integrated zzso that can govern zzso and zzso zzso and be reset by environmental zzso The key is that the zzso network formed by the cellular clocks within the zzso must zzso to maintain zzso zzso To study the zzso mechanisms and the zzso rhythm generation, we propose a model based on the structural and functional zzso of the zzso The model is a zzso network of zzso zzso in which individual zzso are zzso The authors show that the zzso region can smooth the periodic zzso zzso signal curve and affect its wave zzso The authors also study the rhythmic process of the zzso zzso under the effect of the daily zzso cycle, including three zzso information zzso zzso zzso and information zzso zzso The zzso simulations are also given to demonstrate the theoretical zzso
