Left zzso zzso relaxation time constant zzso is a relatively zzso index of zzso function in the evaluation of heart zzso However, the requirement of zzso zzso pressure recording limits its clinical zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso could be estimated zzso 

zzso patients indicated for cardiac zzso were recruited for zzso zzso and cardiac zzso with zzso zzso pressure recording were performed zzso within 1 zzso The zzso zzso was derived from the formula: zzso zzso zzso - zzso where zzso is the zzso relaxation time measured by zzso zzso and Ps is zzso blood pressure measured during the zzso zzso The invasive zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso estimate technique, using the exponential zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso where zzso is the instantaneous zzso pressure, zzso is zzso pressure at minimal zzso and b is the theoretical zzso The difference between zzso and zzso was compared using paired zzso and their relation was evaluated using simple correlation and zzso correlation zzso 

zzso was significantly correlated with the zzso derived zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The completely zzso zzso was significantly correlated with the direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso correlation zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was significantly smaller than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso can be estimated zzso by zzso zzso zzso method with limited zzso The clinical utility of zzso remains to be zzso
