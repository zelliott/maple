zzso Carlo simulations have become a mainstream technique for environmental and technical risk zzso Because their results are dependent on the quality of the involved input zzso it is important to identify zzso that are flexible enough to model all relevant data yet efficient enough to allow thousands of evaluations necessary in a typical simulation zzso It has been shown in recent years that the zzso provides accurate representations for frequency data that are zzso or skewed to either zzso This flexibility makes the zzso an ideal candidate for zzso Carlo zzso To use the distribution zzso methods must be available for drawing zzso random zzso Such a method is proposed zzso It is shown that zzso random numbers can be efficiently generated from a simple zzso formula whose zzso are zzso The method is shown step by step and illustrated with a detailed zzso (The tables are accessible in electronic form in the zzso parent directory at zzso
