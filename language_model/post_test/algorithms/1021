The dynamics of zzso release and zzso zzso currents in two zzso but functionally distinct zzso cells, were studied to gain insight into how the molecular specialization of zzso zzso machinery are zzso to produce different zzso zzso in this case, fluid or zzso zzso Digital imaging and zzso methods were used to monitor the zzso and spatial properties of changes in zzso zzso concentration zzso and zzso currents following the controlled zzso release of zzso or zzso In zzso and pancreatic zzso cells, changes in zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso current occurred with close zzso zzso In zzso a rapid global zzso signal was invariably zzso even with low-level zzso release of threshold amounts of zzso In zzso threshold stimulation generated an zzso zzso zzso zzso while a stronger stimulus induced a global zzso signal which exhibited characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso was more effective in zzso where zzso signals initiated with shorter zzso and exhibited a faster zzso than in zzso The increased potency of zzso in zzso probably results from a zzso higher number of zzso receptors as measured by zzso zzso binding and western zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of the zzso channels in zzso and zzso was determined from the zzso relationship measured during a dynamic zzso zzso produced by the zzso low-level zzso of zzso In addition to a greater number of zzso zzso the zzso current density of zzso zzso cells was more than zzso greater than that of pancreatic zzso Whereas zzso of the current was tightly coupled to increases in zzso in both cell types, local zzso clearance was found to contribute substantially to the zzso of the current in zzso These data reveal zzso of common zzso of zzso machinery and subsequent zzso zzso that are specifically suited to the distinct functional roles of these two related cell zzso
