A mathematical model, of general character for the dynamic description of coupled neural zzso is zzso The population approach that is employed applies equally to coupled cells as to populations of such coupled zzso The zzso includes zzso and preserves details of precisely firing zzso Based on the generally accepted view of cortical zzso this zzso is applied to the retinal zzso cell zzso zzso nucleus zzso relay cell system, of the early zzso visual zzso The zzso of zzso zzso jumps at the retinal level permits a zzso approximation for the zzso zzso however, the zzso description requires the use of finite jumps, which for fast synaptic dynamics appears as finite jumps in the membrane zzso zzso of equilibrium zzso behavior for both the deterministic and zzso cases are zzso Green's function methods form the basis for the zzso and exact results that are zzso This determines the zzso ratio zzso the number of zzso arrivals per zzso zzso which is the zzso of the transfer ratio, under wide zzso zzso for zzso zzso in terms of the relatively few parameters of the model, are zzso Under reasonable zzso it is shown that the transfer ratio is zzso in the absence of input from other zzso Thus, the model suggests that the zzso system may be a relatively zzso spike zzso In the absence of other zzso the system is designed to fire an zzso spike only when two or more zzso spikes appear in a relatively short zzso Transfer ratios that briefly exceed 1/2 (but are less than 1) have been recorded in the zzso zzso of brain stem input has been shown to provide a signal that zzso the transfer ratio zzso & zzso zzso A model that includes this contribution is also zzso
