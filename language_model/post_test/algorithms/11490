The objective of this study was a thorough zzso within the framework of zzso mechanics and zzso zzso of the zzso interpreted relationships employed within the zzso damage analysis zzso in regards to zzso between barrier equivalent zzso zzso or peak collision force magnitude and residual damage zzso 

The zzso damage analysis zzso was considered, first in terms of the cases of zzso that produced no residual damage, in order to properly explain the damage onset speed and crush resistance zzso Under the modeling constraints of the collision partners representing a closed system and the a zzso assumption of zzso between zzso or peak collision force magnitude and residual damage depth, the equations for the sole realistic model were zzso 

zzso of the zzso relationships for zzso at or below the elastic limit revealed that the zzso or peak collision force magnitude relationships are zzso based upon the residual damage zzso Rather than being additive terms from the linear curve fits employed in the zzso damage analysis algorithm, the Campbell b 0 and zzso zzso terms represent the maximum values that can be ascribed to the zzso or peak collision force zzso respectively, for zzso that produce zero residual zzso zzso resulting in the production of zzso residual damage depth already account for the zzso of the elastic limit during closure and therefore the secondary addition of the elastic limit terms represents a double accounting of the zzso This evaluation shows that the current energy absorbed zzso zzso in the zzso damage analysis zzso zzso includes terms associated with the A and G zzso zzso This sole realistic model, however, is zzso secondary to reducing the zzso of zzso to a constant value for all cases in which the residual damage depth is zzso 

zzso between zzso or peak collision force magnitude and residual damage depth may be zzso for particular ranges of residual damage depth for any given region of any given zzso Within the modeling construct employed by the zzso damage algorithm, the case of uniform and ubiquitous zzso cannot be zzso zzso regarding the inclusion of internal work recovered and zzso for modeling the separation phase change in zzso magnitude should account for not only the effects present during the evaluation of a zzso collision of interest but also to the approach taken for modeling the zzso response for each collision zzso
