A pattern fitting procedure using X-ray powder zzso patterns was applied to study the zzso zzso of zzso zzso From the zzso parameters obtained by pattern fitting, a change in the quantity and quality of zzso zzso with zzso was also zzso 

zzso zzso was prepared by cooling the melts followed by zzso X-ray zzso patterns of zzso zzso were repeatedly measured every 20 zzso The observed pattern was separated into zzso zzso intensity and zzso scattering intensity by the zzso zzso zzso 

The fitting between the observed and simulated zzso patterns was zzso independent of the degree of zzso Since a good linear relationship was found in a plot of zzso scattering intensity against zzso zzso intensity, the degree of zzso can be determined according to zzso zzso The zzso peak zzso increased with higher zzso angles with zzso The zzso was zzso fast and slow zzso with the growth of low zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The pattern fitting procedure is a powerful tool to analyze the X-ray zzso patterns of zzso zzso This procedure can simultaneously analyze the degree of zzso and crystal disorder in zzso samples during zzso
