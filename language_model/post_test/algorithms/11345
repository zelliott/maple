We develop a zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso for zzso divergence times using zzso sampled molecular zzso This type of data is commonly collected during viral zzso and is sometimes available from different species in ancient DNA zzso We derive the distribution of ages of zzso in the tree under a zzso zzso model and use it as the prior for divergence times in the dating zzso We implement the prior in the zzso program in the zzso package for divergence zzso The zzso prior is very flexible and, with different zzso can generate trees of very different shapes, suitable for examining the sensitivity of zzso time zzso We apply the method to a data set of zzso genes in comparison with a zzso dating method, and to a data set of influenza zzso genes from different hosts in comparison with the zzso program zzso We examined the impact of tree zzso on time estimates and suggest that zzso consensus trees should be avoided in dating zzso We found zzso time estimates for old zzso to be sensitive to the zzso on times and rates and suggest that previous zzso dating studies may have produced zzso zzso
