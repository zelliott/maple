We consider different models of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels in order to fit nuclear membrane patch clamp data of the stationary open zzso mean open time, and mean close time of channels in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that rather than to treat the zzso zzso as four independent and identical zzso one should assume sequential zzso processes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our simulations also favor the assumption that a channel opens through a zzso transition from a close state to an active zzso
