zzso an zzso drug, has been shown to restore impaired zzso zzso zzso binding sites for zzso have been previously detected in liver zzso In the present study we confirm this observation and provide additional evidence for the involvement of these sites in the pharmacological effects of the zzso zzso experiments using a series of zzso derivatives revealed the presence of three classes of binding zzso An zzso zzso analogue of zzso exhibited a very high affinity zzso zzso for one of these classes of zzso zzso from different pharmacological classes were evaluated for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso Among the drugs tested zzso zzso zzso zzso haloperidol, and to a lower extent zzso zzso and zzso zzso with high zzso suggesting a similarity of high affinity zzso sites with zzso zzso zzso binding was modulated by zzso zzso zzso had about 10 fold higher affinity than zzso zzso for its zzso binding zzso Various zzso also affected zzso zzso zzso was the most potent inhibitor and totally suppressed the binding of zzso to the sites of medium zzso An zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso from its binding zzso Its activity was not affected by boiling for 15 zzso suggesting a zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso binding sites could have a zzso relevance and be involved in the zzso effects of the zzso
