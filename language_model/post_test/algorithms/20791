Researchers use a variety of behavioral tasks to analyze the effect of biological zzso on memory zzso This research will benefit from a systematic mathematical method for analyzing memory demands in behavioral zzso In the framework of reinforcement learning theory, these tasks can be zzso described as zzso zzso decision zzso While a wealth of evidence collected over the past 15 years relates the zzso zzso to the reinforcement learning zzso only recently has much attention been paid to including psychological concepts such as working memory or episodic memory in these zzso This paper presents an analysis that provides a quantitative description of memory states sufficient for correct choices at specific decision zzso Using information from the mathematical structure of the task descriptions, we derive measures that indicate whether working memory (for one or more zzso or episodic memory can provide zzso useful information to an zzso In particular, the analysis determines which observed states must be maintained in or retrieved from memory to perform these specific zzso We demonstrate the analysis on three simplified tasks as well as eight more complex memory tasks drawn from the animal and human literature zzso zzso tasks, two sequence zzso tasks, two zzso tasks, the zzso task, and the zzso zzso The results of these analyses agree with results from quantitative simulations of the task reported in previous publications and provide simple indications of the memory demands of the tasks which can require far less zzso than a full simulation of the zzso This may provide a basis for a quantitative behavioral zzso of memory zzso
