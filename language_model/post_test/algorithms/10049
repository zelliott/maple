zzso is a common property in zzso It can also be observed in time series representing dynamics of complex zzso Therefore zzso analysis could be a useful tool to describe the dynamics of brain electrical activities in zzso and pathological zzso In this study, we carried out a zzso analysis of zzso and zzso properties of zzso sleep zzso zzso We estimated the zzso zzso zzso and the range of zzso zzso zzso in 10 healthy zzso We found higher H values during zzso compared to zzso and zzso in all zzso Measure zzso showed an opposite zzso zzso of H and zzso between zzso and zzso reached zzso at circumscribed regions zzso Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the zzso nature of brain electrical activities and may have implications for automatic zzso of sleep zzso
