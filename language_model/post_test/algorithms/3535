We tested the hypothesis that escalating drug zzso of zzso are associated with a significant decline of cerebral blood flow in regions zzso conscious brain activity, including specifically the zzso 

Nine healthy human volunteers received three escalating doses using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso During baseline and each of the three levels of zzso one PET scan was performed after injection of zzso zzso and respiratory parameters were monitored and zzso and zzso index zzso were zzso 

zzso decreased the zzso values zzso No significant change in global cerebral blood flow zzso was zzso Increased regional zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso and decreased zzso in the zzso zzso were identified at all three levels of sedation compared to zzso zzso between adjacent levels zzso initially zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso significantly in the inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso At the next level zzso MAC zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in the middle zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso and decreased in the zzso At the last level zzso MAC zzso 1 zzso the zzso was increased in the zzso and decreased in the zzso cingulate, the zzso zzso zzso and in the frontal zzso 

At zzso zzso at zzso and zzso a significant decrease in relative zzso was detected in the zzso Interestingly, some of the most profound changes in zzso were observed in structures related to pain processing zzso zzso and zzso
