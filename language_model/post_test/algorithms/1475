The purpose of this study was to investigate contemporary methods of evaluating and treating abnormal Pap zzso in terms of their potential for excessive treatment and financial impact on health care delivery zzso 

Clinical zzso for the evaluation and treatment of abnormal Pap zzso were constructed, taking into consideration different zzso on the need for zzso zzso the role of zzso and zzso The zzso employed zzso zzso of all patients with zzso of mild zzso and zzso of moderate to severe zzso zzso zzso with observation of mild zzso treatment of moderate zzso by zzso and severe zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso before treatment and immediate zzso of zzso and zzso immediate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso was theoretically applied to a cohort of zzso clinic patients based upon referral Pap zzso with excessive treatment and costs zzso The zzso repeat Pap zzso zzso zzso and candidacy for zzso were included in the zzso The decision to use repeat Pap zzso in treatment planning, submit only diagnostic zzso pathology, and select immediate zzso candidates by zzso zzso Pap zzso was zzso Financial impact was calculated using nationwide zzso reimbursement costs for procedures and related zzso 

zzso provided little opportunity for excessive zzso In contrast, zzso of cases subjected to immediate zzso would theoretically not have required treatment, if initially evaluated by zzso The use of the subset of zzso cases encompassing severe zzso only identified patients suitable for immediate zzso with an excessive treatment rate of only zzso Traditional zzso zzso 2) would have been least expensive at zzso per zzso zzso 1 and 3 were intermediate at zzso and zzso per patient, zzso Immediate zzso of all abnormal zzso zzso 4) would have been most costly at zzso per zzso 

The abandonment of zzso and reliance on immediate zzso for evaluation and treatment of cervical zzso would have been expensive and had significant potential for excessive zzso Traditional zzso zzso coupled with observation of mild zzso appeared to be the most cost-effective means of treating cervical zzso and had a low potential for excessive zzso
