zzso about mechanical tissue properties is required for functional zzso and simulating of tissue and organ responses to external mechanical zzso To get the right properties especially for functional zzso of zzso tissue properties have to be determined in zzso There are only few described methods for characterization of internal zzso tissue mechanics that can be applied in zzso We introduce and evaluate a method to determine mechanical tissue properties, especially those of lung zzso zzso zzso finite element analysis zzso a zzso model for zzso zzso and image processing zzso are used to determine the zzso zzso of a soft zzso The resulting values for zzso zzso were normally zzso The zzso zzso of the artificial tissue sample was determined with a relative error of zzso compared to the value obtained by zzso zzso zzso
