The packing of zzso sized zzso beads inside a zzso was enabled by a novel method which avoids the complication and limitations of generating a zzso using conventional approaches and the restriction of flow using a zzso sized zzso A zzso sized zzso and two short columns of 5 zzso and 800 zzso zzso beads packed in succession behind the zzso together functioned as a high pressure zzso to allow the construction of a primary packed bed of 390 zzso zzso zzso This packed bed zzso was tested as an zzso zzso wherein it exhibited superior performance with regards to pressure zzso zzso sustaining good flow rate under extremely high back pressure, and zzso pressure zzso Under a modest applied electric field strength of 150 zzso the flow rate against a back pressure of 1200 zzso zzso zzso was 40 zzso and the zzso pressure reached zzso zzso zzso zzso This work has demonstrated that it is possible to create a high performance packed bed zzso zzso pump using zzso sized zzso zzso as long as proper care is taken during the packing process to minimize the zzso mixing of two different sized particles at the boundaries between particle segments and to maximize the packing density throughout the entire packed zzso
