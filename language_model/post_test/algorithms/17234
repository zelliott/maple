The zzso behavior of zzso zzso was investigated in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were performed at the pH of zero charge of the zzso and the existence of strong zzso and zzso interactions of zzso species with the zzso zzso could be zzso Their migration behavior was compared to the zzso partition zzso zzso zzso measured with zzso zzso and calculated with different zzso contribution zzso A partition model was proposed to understand the interactions of the three major zzso zzso zzso zzso and neutral zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the charged zzso zzso taken as model for charged natural zzso like zzso zzso These results strongly indicate that zzso are polarized in the presence of the charged zzso and that they are essentially present in their zzso form in the zzso phase (and zzso form in the water zzso confirming previous studies suggesting the presence of zzso resonance structures at a neutral pH around their zzso zzso
