pH and blood gases were measured in simultaneous samples of zzso blood from the zzso artery and mixed zzso blood from the pulmonary artery using an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso output was measured by zzso The patients were suffering from chronic zzso pulmonary disease or adult respiratory distress zzso The data indicate that patients respond to a decreased zzso oxygen availability by allowing the mixed zzso zzso to fall rather than by increasing the cardiac output to maintain a normal mixed zzso zzso In other words, the zzso oxygen extraction tension and the oxygen compensation factor were both highly correlated to the mixed zzso zzso but unrelated to the cardiac zzso For this reason the zzso oxygen extraction tension appears to be a more relevant zzso of the overall zzso oxygen availability than the oxygen compensation zzso zzso of the zzso and mixed zzso data confirms the accuracy of the zzso zzso Algorithm for calculating the various oxygen zzso including the zzso the estimated zzso zzso and the estimated zzso zzso on the basis of a single zzso blood zzso
