zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso could be considered an alternative to zzso zzso zzso In the cases of irregular flow conditions, it could be more advantageous than zzso zzso zzso in providing vessel definition and zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso three-dimensional fast zzso zzso sequences have been used to generate zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso zzso images often exhibit slab boundary artifacts zzso variation in the slice zzso which create dark bands interfering with the identification of dark blood zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso fail to zzso slow flowing or zzso blood in some zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso acquisition is used to approach zzso zzso This sequence simultaneously provides zzso weighted zzso and zzso zzso images which can be further integrated together to produce zzso zzso gained by utilizing complementary contrast and supplementary vascular zzso Additionally, a technique of suppressing slab boundary artifact has been incorporated into this zzso This approach zzso zzso good zzso measurement of anatomy for the zzso image and optimal zzso zzso from the zzso image; zzso scan time efficiency zzso image sets plus zzso zzso within one zzso and zzso suppressed slab boundary artifacts as well as minimized zzso zzso
