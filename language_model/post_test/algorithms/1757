Many proteins bear zzso zzso and this phenomenon is closely related to biological zzso However, most of the existing methods can only deal with zzso zzso zzso an automatic and reliable ensemble zzso for protein zzso zzso is zzso We propose a new ensemble zzso combining the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to predict the zzso zzso of zzso zzso bacterial and viral proteins based on the general form of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso GO zzso zzso zzso zzso composition and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso This ensemble zzso was developed by fusing many basic individual zzso through a voting zzso The overall prediction zzso obtained by the zzso ensemble zzso are zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso bacterial and viral zzso zzso Our prediction zzso are significantly higher than those by previous methods and reveal that our strategy better predicts zzso locations of zzso zzso
