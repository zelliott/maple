We describe zzso zzso zzso a new method for multiple alignment of biological zzso The major difference between zzso and existing multiple alignment methods is that zzso represents an alignment as a directed zzso possibly containing zzso This representation provides more flexibility than does a traditional alignment zzso or the recently introduced partial order alignment zzso graph by allowing a larger class of evolutionary relationships between the aligned zzso Our graph representation is particularly zzso to the alignment of protein sequences with shuffled and/or repeated domain structure, and allows one to construct multiple alignments of proteins containing zzso zzso that are not present in all zzso zzso zzso that are present in different orders in different zzso and zzso zzso that are present in multiple copies in some zzso In addition, zzso is useful in the alignment of zzso sequences that contain zzso and zzso We provide several examples illustrating the applications of zzso
