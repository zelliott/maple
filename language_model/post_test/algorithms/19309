Recent releases of the zzso and zzso zzso Carlo codes include the transport zzso and momentum profiles that are necessary for accounting for zzso broadening in Compton scattering zzso Such improvements might be particularly important in low-energy zzso dose zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are based on the zzso library with Compton momentum profiles, while zzso and zzso are based on the 1970's old library, with zzso including the Compton momentum zzso To isolate the zzso effects of zzso broadening by the transport zzso and Compton momentum profiles, we varied the choice of the above zzso databases, in the same simulation zzso using either version of zzso or zzso (no zzso zzso We zzso dose rate zzso and dose zzso for r zzso zzso zzso from a point source in a zzso sphere of zzso Nine discrete energies for primary zzso sources were chosen in the range of zzso zzso The results from both versions of zzso with zzso agreed with those of zzso within statistical uncertainties zzso over the entire ranges of energies and zzso distances zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso yielded almost identical data within statistical uncertainties zzso over the entire ranges of energies and zzso distances zzso This implies that in spite of the spectral broadening of scattered photons due to the zzso electron motion, the zzso effect of zzso broadening for Compton interactions in water appears to be insignificant in the energy range zzso The spectral dose analysis with and without the zzso broadening supported this zzso
