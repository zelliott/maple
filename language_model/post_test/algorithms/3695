We examine a cascade zzso model for neural response in which a linear filtering stage is followed by a zzso zzso zzso spike generation zzso This model provides a zzso more realistic alternative to models based on zzso zzso spike generation, and can effectively reproduce a variety of zzso behaviors seen in zzso We describe the maximum likelihood zzso for the model zzso given only zzso spike train responses (not zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we prove that the zzso function is zzso and thus has an essentially unique global maximum that can be found using zzso ascent zzso We develop an efficient zzso for computing the maximum likelihood solution, demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting zzso with zzso simulations, and discuss a method of testing the zzso zzso using zzso and density evolution zzso
