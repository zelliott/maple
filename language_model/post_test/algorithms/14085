In this paper an zzso for calculating 3-D dose zzso within the brain is introduced and adapted to the demands of modem zzso The dose calculation with this model is based on a 3-D distribution of the primary zzso intensity which is calculated with a ray casting zzso A zzso zzso takes into account field sizes as well as zzso elements as zzso positions zzso blocks, wedges and zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso kernels from zzso zzso to 50 zzso were at our zzso The components of the spectrum were either determined by zzso depth dose zzso measured in water or analyzed with a zzso detector system in the case of zzso The calculated zzso distribution has to be zzso to the complete kernel containing the spatial energy zzso zzso and tissue interface phenomena zzso zzso have been zzso The divergence of the rays and the curved surface of the patient are taken into zzso Assuming zzso media, it is possible to shorten the zzso time by using the Fast zzso Transformation zzso delivering a first overview within zzso The zzso was evaluated and verified under specific conditions of small fields as used in zzso and compared to dose zzso and zzso Carlo zzso In using both the fast zzso zzso for mainly zzso conditions on one hand and the very precise zzso for zzso cases on the other, this zzso can be a very helpful instrument especially for critical locations in the zzso
