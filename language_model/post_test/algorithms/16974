We introduce a zzso confidence set zzso zzso method that can be used in preliminary zzso association studies to obtain confidence sets of zzso that contribute a specific percentage to the additive genetic zzso of quantitative zzso 

Developed in the framework of generalized linear mixed models, the method zzso data from zzso families of arbitrary size and zzso Through our own simulation study and analysis of the zzso Analysis Workshop 16 simulated data, we study the properties of our method and compare its performance to that of the family association method described by Chen and zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso We also analyze the zzso Heart Study data to identify zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso 

The simulation studies demonstrated that zzso yields confidence sets with correct coverage and that it can outperform the method introduced by Chen and zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified five zzso that potentially regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso method provides confidence sets of zzso that contribute to the genetic zzso of quantitative traits and is a competitive alternative to currently used family association zzso The approach is particularly useful in zzso association studies as it significantly reduces the number of zzso investigated in follow-up zzso
