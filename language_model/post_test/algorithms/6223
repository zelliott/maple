One of the most important building blocks of the zzso interface zzso based on zzso spike trains is the decoding algorithm, a zzso method for the reconstruction of desired information from spike zzso Previous studies have reported that a simple linear filter is effective for this purpose and that no noteworthy gain is achieved from the use of zzso zzso In order to test this premise, we designed several decoding zzso based on the linear zzso and two zzso mapping zzso using zzso zzso zzso and support zzso machine zzso zzso Their performances were assessed using multiple zzso spike trains generated by a zzso zzso model and by a directional tuning model of the primary motor zzso The performances of the zzso zzso in general, were zzso The advantages of using zzso zzso were more profound for cases where zzso errors occurred in spike zzso When the zzso were trained using zzso they often showed disappointing performance comparable to that of the linear zzso The zzso zzso showed the highest performance, and this may be due to the superiority of zzso in training and zzso
