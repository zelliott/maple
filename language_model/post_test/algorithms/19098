By using a zzso infrared zzso contained in an zzso gas zzso system zzso and water zzso zzso zzso high-quality infrared zzso zzso have been observed for the radical zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso functional theory with the zzso zzso zzso functional and the zzso basis set has been used for the calculations of the structures and infrared zzso of the neutral species, radical zzso and zzso of zzso The observed infrared zzso of the radical zzso and zzso are in good agreement with those calculated by density functional zzso The origin of the strong infrared zzso zzso characteristic of the radical zzso and zzso are discussed in terms of changes in electronic structures induced by specific normal zzso zzso zzso zzso
