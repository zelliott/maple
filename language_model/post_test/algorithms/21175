In this paper we introduce a new method to characterize the zzso zzso based on zzso imaging zzso The proposed solution, under a fully zzso zzso deals with the problem of joint zzso Model selection and zzso zzso to reconstruct the principal diffusion profiles or primary fiber zzso in a zzso We develop an efficient zzso zzso based on the zzso jump zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso method in order to perform the zzso zzso zzso is a good choice for this problem because of its ability to jump between models of different zzso This methodology provides zzso estimates of the parameters of interest zzso orientation, zzso zzso unconditional of the model zzso It also gives an empirical zzso distribution of the number of primary nerve fiber zzso given the zzso zzso Different probability maps can be assessed using this zzso 1) the zzso fiber orientation map (or zzso distribution zzso that gives the probability of finding a fiber in a particular spatial zzso 2) a three-dimensional map of the probability of finding a particular number of fibers in each zzso 3) a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso map that provides the most probable number of fibers for each zzso In order to study the performance and reliability of the presented approach, we tested it on synthetic zzso an zzso phantom of zzso zzso and zzso data from a human zzso
