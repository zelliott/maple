This paper is concerned with the exponential state zzso for zzso jumping neural networks with zzso discrete and distributed zzso The parameters of the neural networks are subject to the switching from one mode to another according to a zzso zzso By constructing a novel zzso functional and developing a new convex combination technique, a new zzso exponential stability condition is proposed, such that for all admissible delay bounds, the resulting zzso error system is zzso zzso stable with a prescribed noise zzso level in the zzso zzso It is also shown that the design of the desired state zzso is achieved by solving a set of linear zzso zzso zzso The obtained condition implicitly establishes the relations among the maximum delay bounds, zzso noise zzso level and the exponential zzso rate of the zzso error zzso Finally, a zzso example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
