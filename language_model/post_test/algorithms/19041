The boundary condition, which has been used in the conventional zzso calculation in the thin double layer zzso has a flaw that it does not give the zzso zzso relation for the zzso of charged zzso We propose a new boundary condition, which zzso the zzso zzso and derive a general form for the mobility zzso for the motion of a charged particle under the action of external force, torque, and electric zzso We then calculate the mobility zzso explicitly for zzso charged zzso particle and discuss the effect of the surface zzso and the surface zzso on the particle mobility and electric zzso
