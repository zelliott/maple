Previously, the authors presented an zzso that identifies lung regions in a digitized zzso chest zzso zzso by labeling each zzso as either lung or zzso In this zzso the inherent flexibility of this zzso is demonstrated as the zzso is generalized to identify multiple anatomical regions in a zzso Specifically, each zzso is classified as belonging to one of six anatomical region zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso body, or zzso The zzso determines the optimal set of zzso zzso zzso for a given set of zzso zzso gray level values y via a zzso approach that defines zzso as the particular zzso that zzso the conditional distribution zzso A zzso varying zzso random field zzso model is used that incorporates spatial and textural information of each possible region zzso zzso modeling provides the form of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is used to zzso to the distribution maximum of zzso thus obtaining the optimal zzso for a given zzso zzso show the zzso being able to correctly zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in a zzso
