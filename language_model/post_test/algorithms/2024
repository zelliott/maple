zzso zzso input function zzso zzso in dynamic zzso zzso are crucial for zzso of the zzso zzso Often a single global zzso is selected near a large zzso zzso zzso local zzso zzso aim for zzso zzso from smaller zzso Because local zzso are measured higher in the zzso it is assumed that these will reflect the true input of the zzso much zzso However, do the measured local zzso reflect the true zzso zzso of small zzso To answer this question, in zzso data were used to evaluate local zzso candidates selected based on two different types of zzso For interpretation purposes, a zzso zzso model that simulated zzso effects in local zzso zzso was created and the simulated local zzso were compared to the ground zzso The findings are zzso First, the in zzso data showed that the zzso of local zzso are similar to the zzso of gray matter zzso zzso Second, these findings are supported by the simulations showing broadening of the measured local zzso compared to the ground zzso These findings are suggesting that local zzso zzso do not necessarily reflect the true zzso curve in small zzso
