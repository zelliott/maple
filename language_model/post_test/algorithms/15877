To predict the effect on zzso in zzso especially relating to irreversible effects, but also to realize the retrospective assessment the so called zzso is relied on at zzso Internal specific organ zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as external zzso so as D, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for determination of the biologically equivalent dose zzso While the external parameters are zzso with small zzso the internal parameters depend on biological varieties and zzso in some cases the lowest value is assumed to be delta zzso zzso zzso This margin of error goes on to the biologically equivalent dose by means of the principle of zzso of zzso In some selected cases zzso zzso skin, zzso these margins of error were calculated zzso The input errors especially of the internal parameters cause a mean error delta on the biologically equivalent dose and a zzso of the single fraction dose d dependent on the organ taking into consideration, of approximately zzso Hence it follows only a very critical and cautious application of those zzso in expert zzso and in zzso more experienced based decisions are recommended, instead of acting only upon simple two-dimensional zzso zzso
