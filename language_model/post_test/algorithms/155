Being central players in zzso and zzso zzso react in zzso and complex ways to zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions are mandatory for initial zzso as well as for final development of stable zzso zzso zzso for interactions are plasma membrane zzso of which many have been identified over the past decades in individual zzso However, due to their zzso structure, zzso are not accessible to large-scale zzso screens and thus a comprehensive inventory of membrane proteins is still zzso For this reason, we here present an advanced zzso setup for the detailed analysis of enriched zzso plasma zzso and the so far most complete collection of zzso membrane zzso In zzso zzso proteins were identified, of which more than half are termed to be of membrane zzso This study provides a brief overview of gene zzso zzso and functional zzso as well as interaction network zzso In addition, the mass zzso data were used to assemble a first tentative relative zzso of large-scale data on the protein zzso We therefore estimate the presented data to be of major interest to the zzso research field and to support rational design of functional zzso
