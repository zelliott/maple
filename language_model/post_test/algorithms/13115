zzso of an appropriate diet for zzso zzso experiments is critical and may have significant effects on mission zzso The National Aeronautics and Space Administration zzso zzso food bar zzso was reformulated and designated as the zzso zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso meets the 1995 National Research Council zzso zzso recommendations and whether the zzso can be used for short-term zzso and long-term zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and moisture analyses of the zzso were zzso Young (age zzso zzso male zzso rats zzso were individually zzso and fed a diet treatment consisting of 1) zzso 2) zzso or 3) modified zzso containing zzso instead of the zzso fat for zzso or zzso At the end of the study, zzso were zzso and serum clinical chemistry indicators of organ function and zzso zzso were zzso 

Chemical analysis of the diet ingredients showed that the zzso met the 1995 zzso zzso recommendations for zzso zzso animal feeding studies showed that zzso was comparable to zzso and modified zzso for supporting rat growth and body weight zzso In addition, the safety of the zzso for use as a zzso diet was indicated by the absence of changes in organ weight or zzso 

Based on the study results, the zzso performed similarly to the zzso and met the criteria necessary for short-term and long-term zzso zzso zzso
