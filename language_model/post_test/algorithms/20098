Whereas a variety of different zzso matching approaches have been reported in computer vision, few zzso matching approaches employed in images from zzso zzso human zzso have been zzso The present work is concerned with interior deformation field measurement of complex human zzso from three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso To improve the reliability of matching results, this paper proposes composite match index zzso as the foundation of zzso fusion methods to increase the reliability of these various zzso zzso we discuss the definition, zzso and weight determination of zzso To test the zzso of the proposed approach, it is applied to actual MR zzso images obtained from a zzso zzso The main result is consistent with the actual zzso
