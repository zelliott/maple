zzso the operating principles underlying cellular processes by using zzso data is often a difficult task due to the zzso of the solution space that spans all interactions among the zzso under zzso A rational way to overcome this problem is to use the zzso of zzso interaction networks in order to zzso the solution zzso Such approaches systematically integrate the existing biological knowledge with the zzso zzso 

Here we introduce a zzso method that zzso zzso network zzso with zzso data, thereby allowing the identification of key biological features zzso zzso around which zzso changes are significantly zzso We have combined zzso data with different biological networks in order to identify zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and use this to decipher the logic of regulatory circuits playing a key role in zzso zzso repression and human zzso 

zzso Features offer the opportunity to identify regulatory zzso in zzso interaction networks that are significantly affected between or across zzso zzso of the zzso Feature analysis not only provide a snapshot of the zzso regulatory program but also are biologically easy to interpret and provide a powerful way to generate new zzso Our zzso Features analyses of zzso zzso repression and human diabetes data brings hints towards the understanding of the principles of zzso regulation controlling these two important and potentially closely related zzso
