Four major problems can affect the efficiency of methods developed to estimate zzso between individuals from information of molecular zzso zzso some of them are dependent on the knowledge of the true zzso zzso in the base population; zzso they assume that all zzso are zzso and in zzso and linkage zzso zzso zzso methods can lead to incongruous zzso because they take into account only two individuals at a time; zzso most are usually constructed for particular structured populations zzso consider a few relationship classes, zzso zzso zzso zzso We have developed a new approach to estimate zzso that is free from the above zzso The method uses a zzso search zzso zzso simulated zzso to find the zzso that yield a zzso zzso with the highest correlation with the molecular zzso zzso calculated using the zzso Thus zzso and zzso it makes no direct assumptions about zzso zzso or zzso and linkage zzso zzso it always provide zzso zzso as it considers all individuals at a time; zzso degrees of zzso can be as complex as desired just increasing the zzso zzso number of zzso of the proposed zzso Computer simulations have shown that the accuracy and zzso against zzso errors of this new approach is comparable to that of other proposed methods in those particular situations they were developed for, but it is more flexible and can cope with more complex zzso
