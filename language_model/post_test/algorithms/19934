In order to reduce time and efforts to develop microbial strains with better capability of producing desired zzso zzso zzso simulations have proven useful in identifying gene knockout and amplification zzso zzso flux analysis has successfully been employed for such zzso but is limited in its ability to properly describe the complex nature of biological zzso Gene knockout simulations are relatively straightforward to zzso simply by constraining the flux values of the target reaction to zero, but the identification of reliable gene amplification targets is rather zzso Here, we report a new zzso which incorporates zzso data into a model to improve the zzso prediction capabilities and to capitalize on the relationships between genes and zzso zzso 

We developed an algorithm, flux zzso scanning based on enforced objective flux zzso with grouping reaction zzso constraints, in an effort to identify gene amplification targets by considering reactions that zzso flux values based on zzso zzso data via zzso zzso This method scans changes in the zzso of zzso zzso in response to an artificially enforced objective flux of product zzso The gene amplification targets predicted using this method were validated by comparing the predicted effects with the previous experimental results obtained for the production of zzso acid and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, new gene amplification targets for further enhancing zzso production were validated through experiments involving the zzso of each identified targeted gene under zzso batch zzso 

zzso with zzso constraints allows identification of gene amplification targets for zzso engineering of microbial strains in order to enhance the production of desired zzso The zzso was validated through the experiments on the enhanced production of zzso in zzso coli, in addition to the comparison with the previously reported experimental zzso The zzso strategy with zzso constraints will be generally useful for developing industrially important microbial strains having enhanced capabilities of producing chemicals of zzso
