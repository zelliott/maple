The zzso database of protein structures contains approximately zzso zzso organized according to their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between evolutionary related structures zzso within the database have been used to test the sensitivity of various sequence search methods in order to identify relatives in zzso and other sequence zzso zzso application of the most sensitive and efficient zzso gapped blast and the profile based method, zzso zzso zzso Basic Local zzso zzso zzso could be used to assign structural data to between 22 and 36 % of microbial zzso in order to improve functional zzso and enhance understanding of biological zzso However, on a cautionary note, an analysis of functional conservation within fold groups and zzso zzso in the zzso database, revealed that whilst function was zzso in nearly zzso of zzso families, function had zzso zzso in some highly populated zzso In these families, functional properties should be inherited far more cautiously and the probable effects of zzso in key functional zzso carefully zzso
