The study of zzso zzso and zzso outgrowth has been enhanced by the combination of imaging zzso and high content zzso in which thousands of images are acquired using robotic fluorescent zzso To understand the process of zzso outgrowth in the context of zzso we used mouse zzso zzso as our model zzso zzso zzso cellular images of four different culture conditions were acquired with zzso zzso fluorescent zzso We developed a software package called zzso It is a fully automatic solution for zzso length measurement and complexity zzso A novel approach based on zzso analysis is presented to segment zzso The detected zzso were used as references to zzso the level set zzso zzso and splitting of cells segments were prevented using dynamic watershed lines based on the constraint of zzso zzso A tracing zzso was developed to automatically trace zzso and measure their lengths zzso on a zzso zzso zzso analyzes three important biologically relevant features, which are the zzso branching complexity, and number of zzso The application of zzso on the experiments of zzso and serum zzso show that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso longer zzso with more complexities than serum zzso
