zzso shocks continue to be a problem for patients with zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso to discriminate between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Seven sets of zzso from patients having both zzso and VT documented during a single zzso interrogation were zzso The cardiac cycle was analyzed zzso in two parts, zzso and zzso zzso which were modeled separately using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These segments were then analyzed to determine which zzso zzso were most significant for rhythm zzso 

When analyzing the zzso segment during zzso there were statistically significant zzso correlations in 4 of 4 zzso of the zzso zzso when comparing normal zzso rhythm zzso to zzso and 2 of 4 zzso when comparing zzso to VT or zzso to zzso When analyzing the zzso segment during zzso there were statistically significant zzso correlations in 4 of 7 zzso of the zzso zzso when comparing zzso to zzso 5 of 7 zzso when comparing zzso to zzso and 3 of 7 zzso when comparing zzso to zzso Using a zzso value of 50% change from zzso the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was able to completely separate VT from zzso zzso in this series of zzso 

Our data demonstrate the feasibility of simple zzso equations that reproduce the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso shock zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was able to reliably discriminate between zzso and VT while reducing the zzso model to a zzso zzso The results of this pilot trial may serve as the basis for a larger prospective trial implementing a discrimination zzso for use in low zzso power zzso zzso
