zzso disease is caused primarily by bacteria that interact with zzso host zzso zzso treatment of zzso disease aims at the exclusion of bacteria from the root canal zzso This work focused on in zzso studies and modeling of a zzso device for delivering zzso agents in root zzso A zzso zzso device was prepared consisting of a zzso core and a zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso zzso The composition of the core, a blend of zzso zzso and the thickness of the coating were tailored to impart various release zzso A relatively steady release rate for over 40 days after an initial burst was achieved using a zzso for long-term release, which is desirable for establishing and maintaining the necessary therapeutic zzso zzso models were developed for both in zzso and in zzso drug release into a liquid of limited volume, taking into account a moving boundary of the dispersed drug and a zzso boundary zzso A zzso effective diffusion zzso was used to count increased zzso as the solid drug had zzso The finite element method and computer programs were applied to solve the differential equations and predict the in zzso and in zzso release zzso The model prediction agreed well with the in zzso experimental data and provided guidance for designing the device for in zzso release in root zzso The result of in zzso zzso tests, performed using a bovine tooth model, suggested that the device was effective in reducing growth of zzso
