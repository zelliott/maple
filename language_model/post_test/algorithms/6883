The zzso instability problem in the standard transfer zzso method has been resolved by introducing the layer zzso zzso and using an efficient zzso zzso to calculate the global zzso zzso for an arbitrary zzso layered zzso For general zzso the zzso zzso is formulated in zzso zzso In the plane of symmetry of an zzso layer the layer zzso zzso is represented zzso It is shown that the elements of the zzso zzso are as simple as those of the transfer zzso and only six of them are zzso zzso and transmission zzso for layered media bounded by liquid or solid zzso are formulated as functions of the total zzso zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that this zzso is unconditionally stable and more efficient than the standard transfer zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is convenient in satisfying boundary conditions for different layered media cases and in obtaining modal zzso Based on this method characteristic equations for Lamb and surface waves in multilayered zzso media have been zzso Due to the stability of the zzso zzso method, the solutions of the characteristic equations are zzso stable and zzso zzso examples are zzso
