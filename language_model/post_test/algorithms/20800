Recently, the extent of copy number variation zzso throughout the zzso has been shown to be far greater than previously zzso Further, it has been demonstrated that specific copy number variable regions zzso are associated with particular diseases, suggesting that these genetic variations may have an important biological zzso zzso calling zzso and subsequently zzso samples as zzso or zzso is of great zzso A number of papers have been published containing zzso of zzso and here we show how the presence of pedigree information can be used for assessing the performance of those zzso zzso In this article, by examining zzso zzso made in the zzso samples, we show that estimates of the number of zzso zzso per individual made by current approaches can be zzso Moreover, commonplace technologies for determining the locations of zzso zzso information across the maternal and paternal zzso at the locus of zzso Here, we show that copy number variation on each zzso can be zzso and, in particular, we discuss the existence of a class of zzso that are inevitably zzso and give an estimate of their zzso Although our focus is not on the development of calling zzso per se, we describe and provide an example of how our model might be incorporated into the initial zzso procedure to produce more robust zzso Finally, we discuss how this methodology might be applied to future studies to obtain better estimates of the extent of zzso across the zzso
