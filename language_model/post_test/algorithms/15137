Patients with zzso disease lack the normal zzso zzso zzso which can be studied with zzso zzso or zzso 

To see whether the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso with a modified contrast zzso thereby increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the contrast enema and reducing the number of zzso zzso 

zzso boys and 42 girls zzso age, 12 zzso with suspected zzso disease were examined with a modified contrast zzso supplemented with two injections of cold, zzso contrast zzso to induce the zzso Two zzso zzso evaluated the zzso examinations in zzso The contrast enema findings were correlated with the results of zzso biopsy or clinical zzso 

Five boys and one girl zzso age, zzso zzso were diagnosed with zzso zzso The negative zzso value of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso A contrast enema with signs of zzso disease in combination with an absent zzso zzso zzso had the specificity of zzso and sensitivity of zzso for zzso zzso 

The modified contrast enema improves the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso By demonstrating the zzso zzso zzso in children without zzso disease, we can reduce the proportion of unnecessary zzso zzso
