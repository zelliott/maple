zzso of required zzso lens zzso power with zzso zzso is common in zzso zzso surgery zzso A number of methods to minimize error have been proposed but most studies have been small and zzso 

We zzso reviewed 34 eyes that had undergone routine zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso or laser in zzso zzso Sixteen eyes were included in the final zzso Using known zzso and zzso data, four methods were used to obtain zzso values combined with three common zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso zzso and Koch's published zzso zzso The zzso method was also used in conjunction with the zzso 2 zzso Target zzso were calculated and then compared to actual zzso zzso 

The Clinical History method at the spectacle plane produced the lowest mean zzso zzso adjustment formula combined with the zzso 2 and zzso Q produced results closest to zzso The zzso methods produced the least number of zzso zzso Overall, all methods would have resulted in unacceptably high rates of zzso and zzso from target zzso 

No method produces zzso consistent results because modern zzso zzso were designed for zzso zzso zzso will only be improved when new zzso zzso based on the anatomy of zzso eyes become zzso zzso adjustment formula and zzso zzso are viable alternatives especially when there is a lack of zzso zzso The zzso methods are best suited to avoiding a zzso zzso
