We proposed a statistical modeling method for the quantitative evaluation of zzso methods used in image guided zzso A statistical model zzso on a zzso distribution was built upon the observations of the volume overlap between the segmented structure and the referenced zzso A statistical performance profile zzso was then estimated from the model using the generalized maximum likelihood zzso The zzso defines the probability density function characterizing the distribution of performance values and provides a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Different zzso approaches may be influenced by image quality or observer zzso Our statistical model was able to zzso the impact of these variations and displays the underlying statistical performance of the zzso zzso We demonstrated the efficacy of this statistical model using both simulated data and clinical evaluation studies in head and neck zzso Furthermore, the resulting zzso zzso the measurement of the correlation between quantitative metrics and clinical zzso decision, and ultimately is able to guide the clinicians in selecting zzso methods for zzso
