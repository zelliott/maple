This article develops a stationary cardiac single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system using a novel zzso zzso This stationary zzso system is inexpensive to build, small, and able to acquire true dynamic zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso systems with zzso technology already zzso The proposed approach is to replace the zzso zzso with the originally designed zzso zzso The motivation for replacing the pinhole technology by zzso technology is based on the following zzso The zzso zzso for the pinhole is excellent zzso resolution and good zzso only in small object zzso small zzso imaging when it operates in the image magnifying zzso However, in large object zzso zzso imaging, the zzso zzso is poor zzso resolution and poor zzso when the pinhole operates in the image reducing zzso In a stationary system, the number of angular views is zzso thus, image reduction is necessary to obtain more view zzso In this image reducing situation, zzso zzso is able to provide better resolution and detection sensitivity than pinhole zzso Computer simulations are carried out to verified the zzso
