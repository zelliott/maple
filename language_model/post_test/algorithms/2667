In coherent imaging systems, such as the synthetic zzso radar zzso the observed images are contaminated by zzso zzso Due to the zzso feature of the total variation zzso zzso models with TV zzso have attracted much interest in removing zzso zzso However, the zzso term of the zzso model, based on maximum a zzso zzso is not zzso and so, it is usually difficult to find a global zzso zzso the zzso function is used to transform the zzso zzso model to the convex zzso In this paper, instead of using the zzso we exploit the m zzso root function to relax the zzso of the zzso zzso An zzso based on the zzso zzso function, which has been applied to solve the log transformed convex zzso model, can be applied to solve our proposed zzso However, this zzso requires solving a zzso which does not have a zzso solution, at each zzso zzso we propose to adapt the zzso zzso alternating zzso algorithm, which does not require inner zzso for solving the zzso In addition, the proposed method is very simple and highly zzso thus, it is efficient to remove zzso noise in huge zzso zzso The proposed model for zzso noise removal shows overall better performance than the convex model based on the log zzso
