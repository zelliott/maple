To establish an early diagnostic system for hypoxic zzso zzso zzso in newborns based on artificial neural networks and to determine its zzso 

Based on published research as well as preliminary studies in our laboratory, multiple zzso indicators with high sensitivity and specificity were selected for the early diagnosis of zzso and employed in the present study, which incorporates fuzzy logic with artificial neural zzso 

The analysis of the diagnostic results from the fuzzy neural network experiments with 140 cases of zzso showed a correct recognition rate of zzso in all training samples and a correct recognition rate of zzso in all the test samples, indicating a zzso rate of zzso 

A preliminary model using fuzzy zzso neural networks based on a composite index of clinical indicators was established and its accuracy for the early diagnosis of zzso was zzso zzso this method provides a convenient tool for the early clinical diagnosis of zzso
