The purpose of this study was to investigate whether transport of zzso II zzso across zzso zzso cell line zzso cells is zzso by the organic zzso transport zzso zzso cell zzso cultured on permeable zzso were incubated with 100 zzso zzso on the zzso or zzso side, and the cellular zzso and the transport of zzso across the zzso were zzso The zzso from the zzso medium and the zzso transport of zzso were higher than the zzso from the zzso medium and the zzso zzso zzso The cell zzso were incubated with different zzso of zzso zzso approximately 3 zzso in the zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso zzso in the medium and in the cells revealed that zzso zzso tended to be zzso The zzso transport of zzso was increased when the pH of the zzso medium was zzso with a zzso decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso a typical zzso for the organic zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso and transport of zzso from the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso transport of zzso are zzso by not only simple diffusion but also by the organic zzso transport zzso
