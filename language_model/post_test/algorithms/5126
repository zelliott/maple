We study the role of short-range directional interactions in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol, and water) and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso liquids at normal zzso For this purpose, we introduce a new zzso method in which the average interactions between zzso molecules and zzso beads measured in an zzso ensemble are zzso We show that the zzso zzso effective zzso potential constructed according to our scheme is able to reproduce zzso properties of zzso zzso the heat of zzso and total bonding energy profile for zzso are reproduced with good zzso while the density and zzso distribution function are reproduced with fair accuracy within the proposed zzso In contrast, the zzso heat capacity is underestimated in the zzso simulation because some of the fluctuations have been washed out from zzso zzso zzso For zzso liquids, zzso zzso effective zzso potential produces more structure, enhanced packing of zzso and underestimated zzso heat capacity of zzso zzso This fundamental difference between zzso and zzso liquids can be explained by the presence of short-range directional interactions in the former zzso We conclude that some information during the zzso into zzso zzso interaction zzso of zzso liquids has to be zzso However, understanding how short-range directional interactions influence the structural and zzso properties of the zzso liquids seems to be the key for improving the zzso zzso
