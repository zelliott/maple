The electrical phenomena produced during the zzso impulses are analyzed using a digital zzso which enables the zzso with precision, of the energies consumed all along the curve or between chosen zzso Moreover, it enables the calculation of the corresponding zzso values and shows that the latter varies during all the zzso The explanation for these zzso variations is obtained thanks to rapid zzso showing the formation of the zzso zzso zzso one can observe an zzso variation which is quite distinctive from the one which would zzso to the simple passage of an electrical current in saline zzso Particularly at the end of the zzso an important increase in the zzso zzso to the loss of zzso of the zzso zzso by simply reading these electrical zzso it is possible to know the main stages of the zzso phenomenon for impulses situated around the zzso zzso
