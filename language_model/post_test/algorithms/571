To assess the zzso safety, and accuracy of zzso II zzso zzso Custom zzso treatments for the correction of high zzso aberrations and zzso error following previous zzso zzso 

Forty-eight eyes of 32 patients were included for zzso zzso for zzso II treatment included small optical zone, zzso zzso zzso visually significant higher order zzso and zzso irregular zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cataract surgery, and deep zzso zzso An zzso profile based on zzso topography data and zzso zzso and manifest refraction was created using the zzso software zzso zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso and zzso error zzso zzso assessments were performed at 1 week and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 zzso 

Mean attempted zzso equivalent refraction zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Mean attempted cylinder correction was zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso to zzso zzso Median age was 38 years zzso 19 to 68 zzso Median follow-up was zzso zzso zzso mean zzso from the intended zzso correction was zzso zzso zzso D, zzso of eyes were within zzso zzso D and zzso of eyes were within zzso zzso D of the intended zzso zzso the correction ratio was zzso zzso zzso and the error ratio was zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of eyes achieved zzso visual acuity of zzso or better and zzso achieved zzso or zzso 

zzso of eyes gained one or more lines of best zzso visual zzso zzso lost one line, and no eye lost two or more zzso zzso zzso for the subset of eyes with below normal contrast sensitivity zzso there was a statistically significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at 3 cycles per degree zzso 6 zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the average change in refraction between 3 months and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher order zzso the average higher order zzso decreased by zzso and the average zzso aberration decreased by zzso 

The zzso 80 zzso zzso II software appears to be an effective treatment for zzso optical zone enlargement, and reduction of higher order zzso The zzso outcome was satisfactory after one zzso
