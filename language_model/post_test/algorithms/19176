zzso zzso activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on the blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast can be problematic since the contrast reflects changes in blood zzso which can be distant from the activated site, zzso in the presence of large zzso In this work, a novel approach is presented to increase zzso zzso to zzso the origin of the zzso contrast to the zzso by predicting the average zzso vessel radius in activated zzso and to filter out those zzso whose contrast is dominated by large zzso The average vessel radius is derived from the combined change in zzso relaxation rates upon zzso which are measured by a zzso zzso zzso sampling of spin echo zzso Due to the high zzso and spatial resolution, this sequence is suitable for routine zzso zzso In addition, the technique provides additional insight into the origin of the zzso contrast, such as the impact of the significance threshold on the zzso contribution to the zzso zzso
