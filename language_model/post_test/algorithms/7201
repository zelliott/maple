This paper is devoted to the study of a directional lifting transform for zzso zzso A zzso lifting structure is developed to maintain the translation zzso as it is an important property in image zzso Then, the zzso of the zzso tight frame is explicitly discussed, followed by a specific translation zzso directional zzso transform zzso The zzso has two zzso zzso zzso with vanishing moments of order two and one respectively, which are able to detect zzso in a given direction zzso It provides an efficient and sparse representation for images containing rich textures along with properties of fast zzso and perfect zzso In addition, an zzso zzso orientation zzso method based on zzso filters is presented instead of the conventional zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso is zzso to exploit the capability of image zzso incorporating the zzso zzso for zzso exponential zzso zzso the zzso is able to eliminate the noise effectively while preserving the textures zzso Experimental results show that the zzso zzso some other zzso zzso methods, such as zzso and zzso and is competitive to the state-of-the-art zzso zzso
