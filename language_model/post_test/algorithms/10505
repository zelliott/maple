In this study, we propose a novel approach for accurate 3-D organ zzso in the CT scan zzso Instead of using the zzso prior information directly in the zzso process, here we zzso the knowledge of the organ to validate a large number of potential zzso outcomes that are generated by a generic zzso zzso For this, an organ space is generated based on the principal component analysis approach using which the zzso of each segment to the organ is zzso We detail applications of the proposed method for the 3-D zzso of human kidney and liver in zzso zzso scan zzso For zzso the public database of the zzso 2007 grand challenge workshop has been zzso Implementation results show an average zzso similarity measure of zzso for the zzso of the zzso For the liver zzso the proposed zzso achieves an average volume overlap error of zzso % and an average surface distance of zzso zzso
