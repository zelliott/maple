The purpose of this study is to present a framework for quantitative analysis of spinal zzso in zzso In order to study the properties of such complex zzso structures, we propose two zzso that capture the characteristics of spinal zzso in zzso The zzso are the geometric zzso zzso and zzso angle zzso which are independent of the orientation and size of spine zzso We demonstrate the two zzso that characterize the spinal zzso in zzso on 30 zzso zzso zzso images of normal spine and on a zzso zzso The zzso are determined from zzso zzso body lines, which are obtained by two different zzso The first method is based on the zzso technique that zzso the manually identified vertebra zzso while the second method searches for vertebra zzso in an automated zzso zzso based on zzso image zzso zzso functions of the fourth and fifth degree were used for the description of normal and zzso spinal zzso in zzso zzso The mean distance to vertebra zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the second zzso The zzso of zzso and CA values were obtained along the 30 images of normal spine at each zzso level and show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso junction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on average occur at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main advantage of zzso and CA is that the zzso are independent of the orientation and size of the spine, thus allowing objective zzso and zzso zzso The positions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be easily identified by observing the zzso and CA zzso at different zzso zzso The obtained courses of the zzso and CA for the zzso spine were compared to the zzso of zzso and CA for the normal zzso The significant difference in values indicates that the zzso of zzso and CA may be used to detect and zzso zzso spinal zzso The proposed framework may therefore improve the understanding of spine anatomy and aid in the clinical quantitative evaluation of spinal zzso
