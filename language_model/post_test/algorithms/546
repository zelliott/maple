zzso of a chronic disease can lead to the development of secondary zzso An example is the development of active tuberculosis zzso in zzso zzso zzso disease zzso as indicated by declining zzso + zzso count zzso increases both the risk of zzso and the risk of AIDS-related zzso This means that zzso is a zzso zzso for the effect of zzso on AIDS-related zzso Part of the effect of zzso on AIDS-related mortality may be indirect by causing a drop in zzso zzso the total zzso effect of zzso on AIDS-related mortality using standard statistical techniques, conditioning on zzso to adjust for zzso then gives an underestimate of the true zzso Marginal structural models zzso can be used to obtain an unbiased zzso We describe an easily implemented zzso that uses zzso to fit an zzso as an alternative to inverse probability weighting zzso Our zzso is simplified by utilizing individual baseline parameters that describe zzso zzso zzso confirms that the zzso can produce an unbiased estimate of the effect of a secondary illness, when a marker for primary disease progression is both a zzso and zzso for the effect of the secondary zzso We used the zzso to estimate the total zzso effect of zzso on AIDS-related mortality in zzso individuals, and found a hazard ratio of zzso (95 per cent confidence zzso zzso
