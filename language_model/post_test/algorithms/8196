zzso markers have been extensively studied in lung cancer, reporting some relationship to the zzso but their clinical utility is not zzso 

zzso zzso zzso CA zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied zzso in 155 patients with zzso suspicion of lung cancer and in zzso patients with lung zzso 182 zzso 205 zzso 19 zzso lung cancer zzso 175 zzso lung cancer zzso and 66 unspecific zzso lung cancer zzso 

zzso tumor marker serum levels were found in less than zzso of the patients with benign diseases, excluding CA 125 zzso zzso markers were related to zzso type and tumor extension with significantly higher zzso zzso zzso and CA 125 zzso zzso serum levels in zzso SCC zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso markers may be useful in the zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso Patients with SCC serum levels zzso zzso were always zzso while those with SCC zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were all zzso zzso The sensitivity was zzso and zzso specificity was zzso and zzso with a positive zzso value of zzso and zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso and zzso in the differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso marker determination in patients with suspicious signs of lung cancer suggests, in a few hours, the zzso diagnosis in the majority of lung cancer zzso
