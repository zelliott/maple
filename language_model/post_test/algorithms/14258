The basic purpose of electrical zzso zzso zzso is the reconstruction of zzso zzso While zzso zzso are of common use, the majority of reconstructed images are still zzso zzso from one single zzso More interesting than zzso at each frequency are electrical tissue zzso which describe the zzso zzso changes of zzso These parameters give information about zzso or electrical properties of zzso By using this spectral information, a zzso of different tissue types is zzso To get a distribution of tissue zzso usually a zzso fitting of a tissue model to the zzso zzso obtained with classical reconstruction zzso at various zzso is zzso In this work, a zzso reconstruction zzso for differential imaging was developed for the direct zzso of Cole zzso This method is termed differential zzso zzso The Cole model was used as the underlying tissue model, where only the relative changes of the two zzso parameters zzso and zzso were reconstructed and the other two parameters of the model which are less identifiable were set to constant zzso The reconstruction zzso was tested with simulated noisy zzso and real measurement data from zzso zzso on the human zzso These zzso were taken from healthy subjects and from patients with a serious lung zzso The new method yields a good image quality and higher zzso against noise compared to conventional reconstruction zzso
