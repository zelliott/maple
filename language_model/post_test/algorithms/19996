In the present work we extend and analyze the scope of our recently proposed zzso model for zzso regulation, which considers an arbitrarily complex zzso system using only elementary zzso Previously, we determined the role of zzso on the intrinsic fluctuations of gene expression for zzso zzso zzso by means of master equation zzso and computer zzso This model allowed us to distinguish between two cooperative binding mechanisms and, even though the mean expression levels were not affected differently by the acting zzso we showed that the associated fluctuations were zzso In the present generalized model we include other regulatory functions in addition to those associated to an zzso zzso zzso we introduce repressive regulatory functions and two theoretical mechanisms that account for the zzso response that some zzso systems show to the zzso factor zzso We have also extended our previous master equation zzso in order to include protein production by zzso translation of zzso Furthermore, we examine the zzso scenarios in the context of the interaction energy between zzso zzso In this sense, this is the first report to show that the cooperative binding of zzso factors to DNA promotes the zzso phenomenon observed in zzso zzso In addition, we confirm that gene expression fluctuation levels associated with one of two cooperative binding mechanism never exceed the fluctuation levels of the zzso
