The local concentration of an zzso zzso that binds to a specific cellular zzso according to the zzso law is zzso The zzso concentration zzso remains bounded in an zzso that contains the zzso zzso The current study is a more detailed examination of a control model that we previously proposed in which the feedback is a function zzso of the concentration zzso of the zzso zzso Previously we showed that if zzso zzso less than or equal to 0 at a critical point then that point is zzso zzso at an unstable critical point zzso zzso greater than zzso We now show that if zzso zzso is continuous in zzso where zzso and zzso are adjacent critical points, and if zzso zzso less than or equal to 0 then the critical point at zzso is zzso The distance between these adjacent critical points is crucial for maintaining control in response to a dose (or zzso of zzso It is further shown that the difference in the slopes of the binding and control zzso at their intersection on the zzso portrait is an indicator of stability and of the characteristic frequency of zzso in the zzso Together these findings provide new insights needed in the zzso of specific zzso zzso
