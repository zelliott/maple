Since proteins carry out their functions through interactions with other zzso accurately identifying the zzso binding site plays an important role in protein functional zzso and rational drug zzso In the past two decades, a lot of zzso were present to predict the zzso binding zzso In this paper, we introduce statistical depth function to define negative samples and propose an zzso method which zzso sequence and structural information to predict binding zzso The results show that the present method performs better than the zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity, and specificity on training set are zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the independent test set, the zzso sensitivity, and specificity are zzso zzso and zzso zzso
