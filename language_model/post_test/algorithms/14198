In this article, the effect of zzso interactions of zzso zzso sized zzso protected gold clusters zzso zzso during zzso double layer zzso charging has been investigated using zzso zzso zzso and scanning zzso zzso have been used to compare their electron transfer zzso Furthermore, since the zzso process is diffusion controlled, the diffusion zzso values have been estimated at various charge steps using two independent zzso techniques, zzso zzso and zzso These results show that higher core charge zzso higher diffusion zzso values, and indicate that repulsive interactions dominate for charged zzso compared to those of its neutral zzso which are mainly attractive in zzso Additionally, the electron transfer rate zzso at various charge steps have been estimated from the zzso results, showing comparatively faster electron transfer rate at higher charge zzso
