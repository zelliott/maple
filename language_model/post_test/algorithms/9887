zzso waves zzso are used to zzso cover concrete and mortar in the frequency range zzso zzso At these zzso the wavelength is comparable to the size of the zzso and waves zzso in a multiple scattering zzso zzso signals are then difficult to interpret due to an important incoherent zzso The method proposed here is the study of the coherent waves, obtained by averaging signals over several zzso of zzso zzso waves give information on an equivalent homogeneous zzso To acquire a large amount of zzso with zzso an zzso zzso source is used with a laser zzso for zzso Adapted signal processing technique are presented to evaluate the coherent phase and group zzso and also the coherent zzso zzso The sensitivity of these three parameters with the properties of concrete is discussed, as well as the necessity to use coherent waves to obtain accurate zzso
