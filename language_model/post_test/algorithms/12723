zzso zzso commonly uses either the zzso or a zzso of the DC approach for modeling of zzso zzso zzso There is an ongoing discussion about the respective merits and limitations of both methods, frequently on the basis of zzso reasoning or simulated zzso We performed a qualitative and quantitative comparison of DC and zzso by using identical source zzso and zzso zzso 

From the zzso data of 50 patients with acute zzso stroke, color maps of zzso zzso and various zzso parameters were calculated with software implementing both DC and zzso zzso Color maps were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made in zzso zzso and zzso suspected zzso and suspected zzso zzso zzso results, quantitative results, and zzso zzso sizes from DC and zzso were statistically zzso 

zzso and zzso color maps based on DC and zzso were of comparably high zzso zzso zzso and zzso values calculated by DC and zzso were within the same range in zzso zzso In suspected zzso regions, average zzso was lower than zzso In suspected zzso core regions, average zzso was similar to zzso Using adapted zzso zzso we found excellent correlation of DC and zzso zzso zzso 

DC and zzso yielded comparable qualitative and quantitative zzso zzso sizes indicated by DC and zzso showed excellent agreement when using adapted zzso In all cases, the same therapy decision would have been zzso
