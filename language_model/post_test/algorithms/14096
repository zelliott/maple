We explored the cortical pathways from the primary zzso zzso to the primary visual zzso zzso by zzso zzso data in the zzso monkey using zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the close relationship of the zzso visual stream and the zzso zzso It was shown that prefrontal area 46 and zzso areas zzso and zzso occupy a central position between the different clusters in the zzso zzso Among these structures all the shortest paths from primary zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2) to zzso pass through zzso and then reach zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the input and output fields suggested a larger specificity for the zzso pathways among the alternative zzso A reinforcement learning zzso was used to evaluate the importance of the aforementioned zzso The results suggest a higher role for zzso in relaying more direct zzso information to zzso zzso zzso which identify areas with the strongest zzso in the network, supported the role of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These findings indicate that areas zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso play a major role in shaping the tactile information reaching zzso in both sighted and blind zzso Our observations greatly support the findings of the experimental studies and provide a deeper insight into the network architecture underlying zzso integration in the zzso cerebral zzso
