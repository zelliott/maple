zzso zzso zzso are artificial systems that aim to restore sensation and movement to paralyzed zzso So far, zzso have enabled only one arm to be moved at a zzso Control of zzso arm movements remains a major zzso We have developed and tested a zzso zzso that enables zzso monkeys to control two avatar arms zzso The zzso zzso was based on the zzso activity of 374 to 497 zzso recorded from several frontal and zzso cortical areas of both cerebral zzso zzso activity was transformed into movements of the two arms with a decoding zzso called a zzso zzso Kalman filter zzso The zzso was trained either during a manual task performed with two zzso or by having the monkeys passively observe the movements of avatar zzso Most cortical zzso changed their zzso patterns when both arms were engaged zzso zzso the two arms jointly in a single zzso decoder resulted in improved decoding performance compared with using separate zzso for each zzso As the zzso performance in zzso zzso control improved over time, we observed widespread plasticity in frontal and zzso cortical zzso zzso representation of the avatar and reach targets was enhanced with learning, whereas zzso correlations between zzso initially increased and then zzso These results suggest that cortical networks may zzso the two avatar arms through zzso zzso These findings should help in the design of more sophisticated zzso capable of enabling zzso motor control in human zzso
