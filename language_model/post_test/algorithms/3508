We present a methodology for correcting color images taken in practical indoor zzso such as laboratories, factories, and studios, that explicitly models zzso location, surface zzso and zzso and camera zzso We explicitly model surfaces by taking our color images with corresponding registered three-dimensional zzso range images, which provide surface orientation and location information for every point in the zzso We automatically detect regions where color correction should not be applied, such as zzso coarse texture regions, and jump zzso This correction results in objective color measures of the zzso zzso This kind of zzso comprehensive system of color correction has not existed until zzso zzso it is the first of its kind in computer zzso We demonstrate results of applying this methodology to real images for applications in zzso zzso skin zzso zzso burn zzso color zzso and general color image zzso We also have tested the method under different lighting zzso and with three different range zzso
