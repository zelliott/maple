To determine whether the zzso optical quality is correlated to the visual discrimination capacity of patients treated with zzso using two different zzso zzso 

Visual discrimination was evaluated by the zzso index under low zzso zzso zzso software, Laboratory of Vision Sciences and zzso in two groups of patients who underwent zzso with two different zzso zzso using the zzso Wave zzso 400 zzso laser zzso zzso In the first group zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso were performed with the standard zzso zzso zzso equivalent refraction zzso zzso zzso In the second group zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso equivalent refraction zzso zzso the zzso were made with the zzso zzso zzso zzso quality of the eye was calculated by the zzso ratio measured with a zzso device zzso zzso zzso 

After zzso both the zzso ratio as well as visual discrimination capacity diminished in both groups, although the changes were significantly greater in the standard group than in the zzso zzso 

A high correlation was found between the zzso ratio and the zzso index in patients who underwent zzso regardless of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual deterioration were greater after standard zzso
