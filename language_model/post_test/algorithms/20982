zzso determined protein structures are classified to belong to a new fold, if the structures are sufficiently dissimilar from all other so far known protein zzso To analyze structural similarities of zzso structure alignment tools are zzso We demonstrate that the usage of zzso structure alignment tools, which neglect the zzso chain zzso can yield structure alignments with significant similarities between proteins of known three-dimensional structure and newly determined protein structures that possess a new zzso The recently introduced protein structure alignment zzso zzso is specialized to perform zzso alignments with proper assignment of the secondary structure types by focusing on zzso and strands zzso In the new version, zzso the underlying zzso were completely zzso yielding enhanced quality of structure zzso offering alignment against a larger database of protein structures, and being more zzso We applied zzso zzso and zzso on three protein crystal structures considered to be novel zzso zzso zzso to these novel zzso we find proteins in the zzso database, which possess significant structural similarities, albeit the alignments are zzso and in some cases involve secondary structure elements aligned in reverse zzso A web server is available at zzso for zzso zzso zzso and database zzso
