An accurate zzso with linguistic zzso using a small number of relevant genes is beneficial to zzso data analysis and development of inexpensive diagnostic zzso Several frequently used techniques for designing zzso of zzso data, such as support zzso machine, neural networks, zzso neighbor, and zzso zzso model, suffer from low zzso This paper proposes an zzso gene expression zzso (named zzso with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for zzso data zzso The design of zzso has three objectives to be simultaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso minimal number of rules, and minimal number of used zzso An zzso genetic zzso zzso is used to efficiently solve the design problem with a large number of tuning zzso The performance of zzso is evaluated using eight zzso data zzso It is shown that zzso has an accurate, concise, and zzso rule base zzso rules per class) on average in terms of test zzso accuracy zzso rule number zzso and used gene number zzso Moreover, zzso not only has better performance than the existing fuzzy zzso zzso in terms of the zzso zzso but also is more accurate than some existing zzso zzso
