While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady zzso over relatively long zzso it is widely believed that the early stages are the most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible zzso loss zzso zzso a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease zzso However, since the early stages are for the most part zzso obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is zzso zzso databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated zzso are becoming available, allowing the use of zzso zzso We propose a widely zzso statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score zzso using multiple zzso for subjects with a neurodegenerative zzso The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease zzso using the publicly available zzso zzso Initiative zzso database, yielding an Alzheimer's zzso or zzso score for each subject and each zzso in the zzso In addition, a common description of zzso changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest zzso to become zzso The group of zzso zzso the volume of the zzso and the protein concentration zzso beta and zzso were next in the zzso and these were followed by three cognitive zzso The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of zzso in the disease zzso
