The study was conducted based on two objectives as zzso The first objective is to determine the point of zzso signal reflection while penetrating into the simulation models and, the second objective is to analyze the reflection pattern when the signal penetrate into the layers with different relative zzso zzso Thus, several zzso models were developed to make a close proximity of the in zzso human zzso The study proposed two different layers on two different characteristics zzso The zzso on the second layer and the corresponding antenna positions are the factors for both zzso The zzso for model 1 is 60 zzso with an antenna position of 10 zzso away, in contrast, model 2 is 10 zzso larger in size with a closely adapted antenna without any zzso The layers of the models were developed with different combination of materials such as zzso Sandy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show the combination of zzso + Brain and Brain + Sandy zzso are the best proximity of the in zzso human brain zzso and white zzso The results could benefit subsequent studies for further enhancement and development of the zzso
