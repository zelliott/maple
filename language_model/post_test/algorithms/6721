Researchers often measure stress using questionnaire data on the occurrence of potentially zzso life events and the strength of reaction to these events, characterized as negative or positive and assigned an zzso zzso In studying the health effects of stress, one needs to obtain measures of an zzso negative and positive stress levels to be used as zzso zzso by data of this type, we propose a zzso variable model, which is characterized by zzso negative and positive reaction zzso If the positive reaction score dominates the negative reaction score for an event, then the zzso reported response to that event will be positive, with an zzso ranking determined by the value of the zzso zzso of overall positive and negative stress can be obtained by summing the zzso scores across the events that occur for an zzso By incorporating these measures as zzso in a zzso model and fitting the stress and outcome models jointly using zzso methods, zzso can be conducted without the need to assume known weights for the different zzso We propose an zzso zzso for zzso zzso and apply the approach to study the effects of stress on zzso zzso
