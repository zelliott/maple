Finding the minimum energy zzso acid zzso zzso is a fundamental problem in both zzso modeling and protein zzso To address this issue, numerous zzso zzso have been zzso However, there have been few quantitative comparisons between methods and there is very little general understanding of the types of problems that are appropriate for each zzso Here, we study four common search zzso zzso Carlo zzso and zzso Carlo plus zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso mean field zzso and dead-end elimination zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso and if zzso zzso it is guaranteed that its solution is the global minimum energy zzso zzso This provides a means to compare the accuracy of zzso and the zzso zzso For the zzso placement calculations, we find that zzso rapidly zzso to the zzso in all the test zzso The other zzso zzso on significantly incorrect zzso the average fraction of incorrect zzso for zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the protein design calculations, design positions are progressively added to the zzso placement calculation until the time required for zzso zzso zzso As the complexity of the problem increases, the accuracy of each method is determined so that the results can be zzso into the region where zzso is no longer zzso We find that both zzso and zzso perform reasonably well on core calculations zzso zzso acids incorrect is zzso zzso zzso zzso but fail considerably on the boundary zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface calculations zzso zzso zzso zzso
