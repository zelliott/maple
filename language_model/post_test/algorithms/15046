Clinical applications of spiral CT zzso are mainly based on zzso CT scans which can be completed by several categories of additional zzso in order to provide the most accurate evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso are the second most frequent category of reconstructions generated from a spiral data set, enabling the creation of zzso zzso zzso or zzso or curved views of given zzso zzso displays can also be generated from most zzso zzso namely surface shaded displays zzso maximum intensity projections zzso and images using the volume rendered technique zzso zzso surface displays are based on a zzso selection of zzso using a single or double zzso whereas zzso images result from the selection of the zzso of highest zzso zzso Volume rendered images are generated by means of a zzso zzso of zzso consisting of a systematic zzso of the amount of the zzso in each zzso In addition, a variable degree of zzso (or zzso can be chosen for the vascular structures and/or the surrounding anatomical structures, thus avoiding interpretive difficulties due to zzso A fourth category of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be applied to the evaluation of peripheral zzso zzso
