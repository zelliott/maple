zzso zzso with magnetic induction zzso is an emerging approach for zzso imaging electrical zzso properties of biological zzso The zzso imaging system measures ultrasound waves generated by the zzso force, having been induced by magnetic zzso which is related to the electrical zzso distribution in tissue zzso zzso promises to provide fine spatial resolution for biological tissue imaging as compared to ultrasound zzso In the present study, we first estimated the imaging spatial resolution by calculating the full zzso at half maximum zzso of the system point spread function zzso The actual spatial resolution of our zzso system was zzso determined to be zzso zzso by a zzso phantom with zzso zzso zzso images made from zzso gel zzso as well as animal tissue samples, were consistent with the zzso structures of the zzso The electrical zzso value of the samples was determined directly by a zzso zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso is able to image the electrical zzso properties of biological zzso with better than 2 zzso spatial zzso These results suggest the potential of zzso for application to early detection of zzso diseased zzso zzso small breast zzso
