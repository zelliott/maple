In recent years, zzso laser scanning zzso has been developed into a zzso tool to probe zzso profiles of protein in zzso zzso A necessary prerequisite when using this technique lies in the labeling of proteins with fluorescent zzso The quality of the obtained results is thus strongly dependent on the zzso used, its sensitivity on experimental parameters and the change of protein characteristics upon zzso In this review, the fundamental issues when using fluorescent zzso are zzso before giving a critical evaluation on published literature in the field of zzso laser scanning zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso
