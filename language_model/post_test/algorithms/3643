The pattern of zzso acid zzso and sequence conservation over many zzso alignments of protein sequences was analyzed as a function of percentage sequence zzso The statistics of the zzso acid zzso were converted into the form of zzso zzso acid substitution zzso to which zzso decomposition was zzso It was found that the most important component of the substitution zzso exhibited a sharp transition at the sequence identity of zzso which zzso with the twilight zzso Above the transition point, the most dominant component is related to the zzso of zzso acids and it acts to zzso any zzso whereas below the transition point, the most dominant component is related to the zzso of zzso acids and zzso between zzso of similar zzso character are positively zzso zzso for protein evolution and sequence analysis are zzso
