Drug discovery research often relies on the use of virtual screening via molecular zzso to identify active hits in compound zzso An area for improvement among many state-of-the-art zzso methods is the accuracy of the scoring functions used to differentiate active from zzso zzso Many contemporary scoring functions are influenced by the physical properties of the zzso zzso This bias can cause molecules with certain physical properties to incorrectly score better than zzso Since variation in physical properties is inevitable in large screening libraries, it is desirable to account for this zzso In this paper, we present a method of zzso zzso scores using virtually generated decoy sets with matched physical zzso First, our method generates a set of zzso zzso for every zzso in the screening zzso Each library zzso and its decoy set are zzso using a state-of-the-art method, producing a set of raw zzso zzso Next, the raw zzso score of each library zzso is zzso against the scores of its zzso The zzso score represents the probability that the raw zzso score was drawn from the background distribution of zzso zzso zzso Assuming that the distribution of scores of active molecules differs from the zzso score distribution, we expect that the score of an active compound will have a low probability of having been drawn from the zzso score zzso In addition to the use of zzso in zzso zzso scores, we suggest that decoy sets may be a useful tool to zzso improve, or develop scoring zzso We show that by analyzing zzso scores of library molecules with respect to the zzso scores of their virtually generated zzso zzso one can gain insight into the advantages, limitations, and reliability of scoring zzso
