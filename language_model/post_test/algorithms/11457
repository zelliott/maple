We hypothesized that cochlear implant zzso users are able to discriminate tones consisting of 1 and 2 zzso zzso when the stimuli are applied through direct electrical zzso 

Music perception is a very challenging task for zzso zzso In music, multiple tones often occur zzso an essential feature of zzso Proper zzso of simultaneous tones is crucial to musical perception and zzso With current implant processing strategies, zzso users are severely impaired in the perception of pitch and zzso 

The ability of zzso users to identify the number of simultaneous tones was zzso zzso were applied with direct electrical zzso zzso with 1 zzso frequency were applied on a zzso a middle, and an zzso zzso to determine if there was an effect of cochlear zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso were applied on combinations of an zzso zzso together with a zzso or a middle zzso Additionally, 2 zzso zzso were presented at the same time on an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrate that subjects were generally able to identify the number of zzso zzso in the presented zzso Performance for 1 zzso frequency stimuli was significantly above chance level on all 3 zzso zzso Performance was best on the zzso and the middle zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso were also able to identify 2 zzso zzso significantly above chance level on all 3 combinations zzso Performance was best on combination zzso followed by zzso Performance was worst when 2 zzso zzso were applied on an zzso zzso only, but it was still significantly above chance zzso 

If sound processing strategies were to use concurrent zzso zzso on multiple or single electrodes, then possibly zzso tones would be better perceived by zzso users yielding better music and language zzso
