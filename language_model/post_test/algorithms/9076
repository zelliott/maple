Current standard methods of monitoring fetal heart function are mainly based on zzso which provides indirect information (through mechanical assessment) of the fetal heart zzso Fetal zzso zzso allows a reliable zzso of the zzso structure of fetal heart zzso However, its application in clinical studies is difficult because zzso the fetal heart signal for most current applications requires user zzso To overcome this zzso we developed a completely automated extraction zzso 

The zzso recordings were acquired using a zzso zzso zzso To perform an automated analysis, a combination of zzso projection and independent component analysis was zzso zzso recordings from 69 healthy uncomplicated singleton zzso with normally developing fetuses were included in the zzso 

The normal values achieved by the automated zzso were comparable to previously published zzso The majority of the cardiac time intervals were positively correlated with zzso age zzso The ST segment, T wave and zzso zzso did not show any zzso 

The automated detection of fetal heart signals was possible beginning at a zzso of 19 zzso This automated analysis of zzso recordings might be an objective and easily zzso approach for clinicians to analyze fetal heart zzso
