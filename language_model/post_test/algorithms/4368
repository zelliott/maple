High content zzso screens are rapidly gaining popularity in the context of zzso zzso zzso To analyze zzso zzso automatic image analysis pipelines have been conceived, which accurately zzso the shape changes of zzso in cell cultures with zzso zzso zzso However, most existing methods show poor performance for well-connected and differentiated zzso networks, which may serve as valuable models for zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a fully automated method for zzso the zzso of zzso and the density of zzso networks, in dense zzso cultures, which are grown for more than 10 zzso zzso written as a script for zzso zzso based zzso automatically determines various zzso parameters of the zzso and the zzso zzso shape, starting points, and fractional zzso The image analysis pipeline consists of a zzso approach in which the zzso are segmented by zzso region growing using zzso as seeds, and the zzso are delineated by a combination of various intensity and edge detection zzso zzso comparison showed a superior performance of zzso to existing analysis tools, especially for revealing subtle changes in thin zzso which have weak zzso intensity compared to the rest of the zzso The proposed method will help determining the effects of compounds on cultures with dense zzso networks, thereby boosting zzso relevance of zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso
