The initial process for creating a flexible three-dimensional computer-generated breast phantom based on empirical data is zzso Dedicated breast zzso data were processed to suppress noise and scatter artifacts in the reconstructed image zzso An automated zzso was developed to zzso the breast into its primary zzso A preliminary phantom defined using subdivision surfaces was generated from the segmented zzso To demonstrate potential applications of the zzso simulated zzso image data were acquired of the phantom using a simplistic zzso model and an zzso projection zzso directly on the surface zzso The simulated image was generated using a model for a zzso zzso projection of the compressed zzso The methods used to create the breast phantom generate resulting images that have a high level of tissue structure detail available and appear similar to actual zzso zzso dimension zzso of simulated images of the phantom are comparatively similar to zzso from images of real human zzso A realistic and zzso defined breast phantom that can accurately simulate imaging data may have many applications in breast imaging zzso
