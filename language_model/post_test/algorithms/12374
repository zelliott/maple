A zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for solving the inverse electromagnetic problem is zzso The application we have in mind is zzso breast cancer detection but the results are of general interest to the field of zzso zzso zzso have been made from experimental and zzso simulated data for objects of different sizes in order to investigate the relation between the spectral content of the illuminating pulse and the quality of the reconstructed zzso We have found that the spectral content is crucial for a successful zzso The work has further shown that when imaging objects with different scale lengths it is an advantage to use a multiple step zzso Low frequency content in the pulse is used to image the large structures and the reconstruction process then proceed by using higher frequency data to resolve small scale zzso Good agreement between the results obtained from experimental data and simulated data has been zzso
