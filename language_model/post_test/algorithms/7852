The tolerance of bacterial populations to zzso or zzso treatment has been well documented in both zzso and zzso zzso However, there is still very little known about the mechanisms that produce this zzso Evidence that small, zzso zzso of bacteria are not affected by an zzso challenge has been accumulating and provides an attractive explanation for the failure of typical dosing zzso Although a dosing challenge can kill the susceptible bacteria, the remaining zzso cells can serve as a source of population zzso We give a condition for the failure of a periodic dosing protocol for a general zzso model, which supports the simulations of an earlier, more specialized batch zzso Our condition implies that the treatment protocol fails globally, in the sense that a mixed bacterial population will ultimately persist above a level that is independent of the initial composition of the zzso We also give a sufficient condition for treatment success, at least for initial population compositions near the steady state of interest, corresponding to bacterial zzso Finally, we investigate how the speed at which the bacteria are wiped out depends on the duration of administration of the zzso We find that this dependence is not necessarily zzso zzso that optimal dosing does not necessarily zzso to continuous administration of the zzso Thus, genuine periodic protocols can be more advantageous in treating a wide variety of bacterial zzso
