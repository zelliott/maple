zzso methods are used to assemble separate zzso trees with shared zzso into larger trees zzso in an effort to construct more comprehensive zzso zzso In spite of much recent interest in zzso there are still few methods for zzso zzso The flip zzso problem is an error correction approach that seeks to find a minimum number of changes zzso to the zzso representation of the set of input trees to resolve their zzso A previous flip zzso zzso was limited to finding exact solutions and was only feasible for small input zzso We developed a zzso zzso for the flip zzso problem suitable for much larger input zzso We used a series of zzso and zzso simulations to compare zzso constructed with the flip zzso zzso zzso with zzso constructed using other approaches, including zzso zzso modified zzso zzso and zzso representation with zzso zzso Flip zzso are generally far more accurate than zzso constructed using zzso or zzso zzso and are at least as accurate as zzso built with zzso The flip zzso method is therefore a viable alternative to other zzso methods when the number of zzso is zzso
