The National zzso Foundation zzso recommends considering treatment in women with a zzso or higher 10-year probability of a major zzso However, zzso reduces both the risk of zzso fractures and invasive breast cancer so that zzso treatment may be clinically appropriate and cost-effective in women who do not meet a zzso threshold zzso The aim of this study was to identify cost-effective scenarios of zzso treatment compared to no treatment in younger zzso women at increased risk of invasive breast cancer and fracture risks below zzso 

A zzso model populated with data specific to American Caucasian women was used to zzso the costs and benefits of zzso zzso zzso The population evaluated was selected based on 10-year major fracture probability as estimated with zzso being below zzso and zzso invasive breast cancer risk as estimated with the Gail risk model ranging from zzso to zzso 

The cost per zzso gained ranged from US zzso in women age 55 with zzso invasive breast cancer risk and zzso fracture zzso to zzso in women age 55 with zzso invasive breast cancer risk and zzso fracture zzso zzso was progressively cost-effective with increasing fracture risk and invasive breast cancer risk for a given age zzso At lower fracture risk in combination with lower invasive breast cancer risk or when no preventive zzso effect on invasive breast cancer was zzso the zzso of zzso worsened markedly and was not cost-effective given a zzso of US zzso At fracture risk of zzso zzso was cost-effective also in women at lower invasive breast cancer zzso 

zzso is potentially cost-effective in zzso of young zzso women, who do not meet the suggested zzso 10-year fracture risk zzso The zzso is contingent on their zzso invasive breast cancer zzso The result highlights the importance of considering a woman's full risk profile when considering zzso zzso
