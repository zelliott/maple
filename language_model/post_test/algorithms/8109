Two zzso multiple quantum zzso zzso zzso experiments have become popular due to the wide zzso of this technique to structural questions in materials science, the abundance of zzso spin zzso in the periodic table, and the ease of zzso on typical solid state zzso zzso In spite of the high-resolution theoretically possible from such experiments, the homogeneous and zzso broadening factors inherent in many samples of interest can make spectral analysis zzso We present several possible spectral zzso schemes that may be useful for spectral analysis, and in particular we introduce zzso in the directly detected zzso We suggest that for zzso or zzso samples that give broad spectral features, zzso may be used as a general tool for optimal positioning of these features relative to one another and for the characterization of zzso chemical and zzso zzso
