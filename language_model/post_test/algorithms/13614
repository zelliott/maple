This paper proposes a technique, called zzso zzso zzso Network zzso that presents many interesting features, including incremental learning, evolving architecture, the capacity to learn continually throughout its existence and requiring that each training sample be used only once in the training phase without zzso A series of experiments was performed on data sets in the public zzso the results indicate that zzso is superior or equal to the other incremental neural networks evaluated in this zzso These results also demonstrate the advantage of the small zzso architecture and show that its architecture is more stable than the other incremental neural networks zzso zzso thus appears to be a promising alternative for a quick learning system and a fast zzso with a low zzso zzso
