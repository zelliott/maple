A control strategy to avoid development of zzso growth in zzso limited zzso zzso zzso is proposed and zzso zzso The basic idea is to control the zzso flux through the pathways by manipulating the zzso feed rate to keep the ethanol concentration at a low zzso An zzso and a fixed zzso controller were investigated zzso Both controllers were zzso at the target conditions for the continuous zzso where the uncontrolled process is known to be marginally zzso The latter fact renders it zzso to attempt open loop operation at the critical dilution zzso The zzso controller turned out to be superior to the fixed zzso zzso The superiority of the zzso controller is ascribed to its ability to identify the process under varying cell zzso The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the desired operating point is zzso zzso However, after prolonged operation under different types of disturbances the zzso seemed to adapt towards an increased respiratory activity for the same low level of ethanol in the zzso
