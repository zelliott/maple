The zzso zzso zzso is a PET zzso of the zzso zzso receptors in the human zzso It is zzso so rapidly in the circulation that it behaves more as a chemical zzso than as a zzso subject to continuous exchange between the circulation and brain zzso Although reference tissue methods are useful as analyses of zzso of some zzso with indeterminate zzso input functions, their use to analyze zzso zzso and binding is challenged by the rapid plasma zzso which violates the assumption that regions of interest and reference regions continue to exchange zzso with the circulation during the entire zzso zzso Here, we proposed a method of calculation zzso that specifically uses the zzso rather than the zzso of zzso to determine binding zzso zzso without the use of zzso zzso 

A total of 19 healthy volunteers (age range, zzso zzso underwent PET to test the zzso application of the chemical zzso properties of zzso to identify regions of binding and zzso on the exclusive basis of the rate of zzso of zzso 

The results of the zzso method were compared with the simplified but zzso reference tissue method zzso The distribution of zzso zzso obtained with zzso was consistent with previous zzso of zzso brain zzso with the highest values of zzso recorded in the zzso zzso lobe and decline of zzso availability with zzso The values in the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso in contrast, yielded lower zzso in all regions and only zzso revealed the decline with zzso 

The simple and zzso efficient zzso method gave reliable values of zzso without the use of zzso The zzso on the other hand, appeared to be affected by the early disappearance of the zzso from the circulation and the associated uncertain late presence of zzso in the zzso
