An analysis system was developed to evaluate the sliding behavior of a liquid zzso on a zzso zzso This system enables continuous and simultaneous measurement of both the sliding acceleration and shape deformation during the sliding of a liquid zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of the internal fluidity of a sliding zzso was obtained by employing particle image zzso in the analysis zzso This evaluation method pioneers the measurement of the dynamic zzso of a zzso solid zzso
