An efficient zzso largely depends on optimal design of the zzso In recent studies, zzso zzso were found to be more potent than classical synthetic zzso zzso suggesting a zzso of the zzso processing step to the efficient assembly of the zzso complex, zzso We describe the fundamental principles and experimental results leading to optimal zzso zzso
