Analysis of sequence complexities of proteins is an important step in the characterization and zzso of new zzso A new measure has been proposed to zzso sequence complexity in protein sequences based on linguistic zzso The zzso requires a single zzso is zzso simple and provides a framework for comparative zzso zzso zzso sequences were classified into groups of high or low complexity based on a quantitative measure termed zzso which is zzso to the fraction of low complexity sequence present in the zzso The zzso was tested on sequences of 196 zzso proteins whose crystal structures are available at zzso A zzso zzso sequences of high complexity had zzso structures zzso zzso whereas those of low complexity had zzso structures zzso zzso Application of this measure to proteins of unknown zzso from different zzso revealed that the sequences of high complexity constitute the majority in all zzso (about zzso in zzso about zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso and zzso zzso among zzso have the lowest fraction of high complexity proteins zzso and zzso zzso Further, it was observed that a few bacterial pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso have high fraction of low complexity zzso The program zzso is available from the authors as a zzso script zzso zzso
