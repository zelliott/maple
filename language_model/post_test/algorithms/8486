zzso zzso is a vital part of zzso resuscitation zzso This paper demonstrates how the zzso depth can be estimated using the principles of inertia zzso The proposed method uses zzso sensors, one placed on the patient's chest, the other beside the zzso The zzso conversion is performed using zzso digital signal processing zzso zzso problems due to integration are zzso using a set of boundary zzso The proposed zzso is tested on a mannequin in harsh zzso where the patient is exposed to external forces as in a boat or car, as well as improper zzso zzso The overall performance is an zzso depth error of zzso zzso in these zzso which is reduced to zzso zzso in a regular, zzso controlled zzso
