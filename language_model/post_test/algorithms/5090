We zzso here the zzso statistical zzso approach as an alternative to zzso networks and we give an effective zzso zzso analogous to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso signal zzso network when the set of data is zzso We proved the convergence of our zzso that we called zzso zzso and we apply it to simulated data for a simplified signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
