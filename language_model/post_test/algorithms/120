In this study, we compared the efficacy of 8 months of zzso zzso and a zzso program in zzso zzso zzso zzso women were randomly assigned into two groups: zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso performed three zzso a zzso exercise on a zzso platform (6 sets of zzso with 1 zzso of rest, with a zzso zzso of frequency and an zzso of 3 zzso zzso program zzso group zzso zzso zzso performed three zzso a zzso of walk activity at zzso of zzso heart zzso A zzso battery of tests was zzso zzso unilateral concentric and eccentric zzso zzso of the knee zzso was recorded by an zzso zzso Physical fitness was measured using the following zzso vertical jump test, chair rise test and zzso walking speed test over 4 zzso zzso unilateral zzso strength was measured in the knee zzso in concentric actions at 60 and 300 degrees zzso and eccentric action at 60 degrees zzso After 8 months, the zzso improved the time spent to walk 4 m zzso and to perform the chair rise test zzso compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the comparison of the changes in vertical jump showed the higher effectiveness of the zzso exercise in zzso zzso zzso zzso None of exercise programs showed change on zzso zzso These results indicate that both programs differed in the main achievements and could be complementary to prevent lower limbs muscle strength decrease as we age zzso
