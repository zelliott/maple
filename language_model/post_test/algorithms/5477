In this study, zzso analysis is applied to the zzso signals of the normal and patient subjects and the obtained zzso zzso are used as zzso in zzso zzso Network zzso The differences shown by the zzso random signals such as zzso signals in cases of health and sickness zzso were evaluated and tried to be analyzed under zzso conditions by using artificial neural zzso zzso zzso zzso architecture is used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso learning zzso and the best performance was tried to be attained by ensuring the zzso with the use of genetic zzso of the zzso learning rates, zzso numbers of hidden layer in the training zzso This study shows that the artificial neural network increases the zzso performance using genetic zzso
