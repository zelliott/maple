Increased loop gain (a function of both controller gain and plant zzso which results in instability in feedback control, is of major importance in producing zzso central zzso during sleep but its role in causing zzso zzso is not zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of loop gain in producing zzso sleep zzso zzso to the complexity of factors that may operate to produce obstruction during sleep, we used a mathematical model to sort them zzso The model used was based on our previous model of zzso control of breathing, which included the effects of chemical stimuli and changes in alertness on respiratory pattern generator zzso To this we added a model of the upper airways that contained a narrowed section which behaved as a zzso elastic tube and was zzso during inspiration by the contraction of the upper airway zzso zzso These muscles in the model, as in life, responded to changes in zzso zzso and alertness in a manner similar to the action of the chest wall muscles, opposing the zzso action caused by the negative zzso pressure generated during inspiration which was magnified by the zzso zzso As the zzso of zzso zzso increased, with sufficiently large increase in zzso zzso obstruction zzso Changes in breathing after sleep onset were zzso The simulations showed that increases in controller gain caused the more rapid onset of zzso zzso zzso episodes were terminated by zzso With a constant controller gain, as zzso zzso zzso breaths appeared and periods of obstruction recurred longer after sleep onset before zzso zzso controller gain produced, for example, by breathing oxygen eliminated the zzso zzso resulting from moderate reductions in zzso segment zzso This became less effective as zzso was reduced zzso zzso of the upper airway muscles with zzso and zzso could prevent zzso zzso with moderate but not with severe reductions in zzso zzso in controller gain, as might occur with zzso converted zzso to central zzso zzso CO2 eliminated zzso when the activity of the upper airway muscles was considered to change as a function of CO2 to some zzso Low zzso thresholds and increased upper airway resistance are two factors that promoted the occurrence and persistence of zzso sleep zzso
