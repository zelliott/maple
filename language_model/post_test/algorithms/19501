Ever since the advent and development of treatment planning systems, the uncertainty associated with calculation grid size has been an zzso Even to this day, with highly sophisticated zzso zzso and zzso radiation therapy zzso treatment planning systems zzso dose uncertainty due to grid size is still a zzso A phantom simulating head and neck treatment was prepared from two zzso solid water zzso and a zzso film was inserted between the two zzso for zzso Plans were generated for a 5,400 zzso prescribed dose using Philips zzso zzso for two targets, one shallow ( approximately zzso zzso zzso and one deep ( approximately 6 zzso zzso zzso grid sizes of zzso 2, 3 and 4 zzso were zzso Three clinical cases were also zzso The dose differences for the varying grid sizes (2 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso from zzso zzso in the phantom study were 126 zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso respectively for the shallow target zzso It was found that the dose could be varied to about 100 zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the 5,400 zzso dose zzso for 2 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso grid sizes, respectively, simply by shifting the calculation grid zzso zzso difference with a different range of the relative dose zzso was evaluated and we found that the relative dose difference increased with an increase in the range of the relative dose zzso When comparing varying calculation grid sizes and zzso the variation of the dose difference zzso was zzso but a local effect was observed in the dose difference zzso Similar results were observed in the case of the deep target and the three clinical cases also showed results comparable to those from the phantom zzso
