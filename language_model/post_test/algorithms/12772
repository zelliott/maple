A number of recent research studies have focused on theoretical and experimental investigation of a bottleneck in a zzso reaction zzso However, there is no study on how the bottleneck affects the performance of a zzso process when a product is highly toxic and remarkably influences the growth and death of zzso The present work therefore studies the effect of bottleneck on product zzso under different product toxicity zzso A generalized bottleneck model in a zzso zzso is constructed including both the bottleneck and the product influences on cell growth and zzso The simulation result reveals that when the toxic product strongly influences the cell growth and death, the final product concentration is hardly changed even if the bottleneck is removed, whereas it is markedly changed by the degree of product zzso The performance of an ethanol zzso process is also discussed as a case example to validate this zzso In conclusion, when the product is highly toxic, one cannot expect a significant increase in the final product concentration even if removing the zzso rather, it may be more effective to somehow protect the cells so that they can continuously produce the zzso
