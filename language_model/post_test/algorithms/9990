The dynamics of an initially localized wave packet is studied for the generalized zzso zzso equation with a random potential, where the zzso term is zzso and p is zzso zzso short times for which the zzso calculations can be performed accurately are zzso Long time calculations are presented as zzso In particular, the zzso behavior where the average second moment of the wave packet is of the form zzso approximately zzso is zzso zzso to former zzso arguments, no evidence for any critical behavior as function of p is zzso The properties of zzso for relatively short times are zzso a zzso property and a zzso value for p approximately 1/2 are zzso
