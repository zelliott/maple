In this paper a new zzso is proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of solutions of the zzso zzso inverse zzso zzso the zzso enhancement zzso zzso the present zzso provides a zzso solution, which is a function of the high order zzso estimate of an unbiased smooth estimate of the zzso zzso inverse zzso The order of the high order zzso function is determined by the blurring level of the actual source distribution as represented by a zzso blurring zzso The proposed zzso zzso may be used to enhance the spatial resolution of an inverse solution obtained by any inverse reconstruction zzso Computer simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the zzso and to compare its performance to that of the zzso and the zzso zzso
