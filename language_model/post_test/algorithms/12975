zzso of three-dimensional zzso with a zzso function as frequently employed in optical zzso to reconstruct true three-dimensional distribution of objects are extended to holographic zzso Two such schemes have been developed and are zzso an instant zzso using the Wiener filter as well as an zzso zzso zzso The instant zzso can be applied to restore the positions of zzso objects such as small zzso The zzso zzso can be applied to restore the distribution of complex and extended zzso zzso and experimental examples are presented and demonstrate artifact and noise free three-dimensional reconstructions from a single two-dimensional holographic zzso
