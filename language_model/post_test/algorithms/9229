To discover remote evolutionary relationships and functional similarities between zzso biologists rely on comparative sequence analysis, and when structures are available, on structural alignments and various measures of structural zzso The zzso that have most commonly been used for this purpose include: alignment zzso percent sequence identity, zzso zzso and their different zzso More recently, we have introduced the zzso core structure overlap zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Along with these we also consider the zzso structural alignment zzso zzso which was introduced earlier by other zzso 

We analyze the performance of these and other conventional measures at the task of ranking structure neighbors by zzso and we show that the zzso zzso and zzso scores display considerably improved performance over the conventional measures of sequence or structural zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso scores are easily zzso quantities that allow users of zzso databases to more easily identify interesting structural similarities between zzso
