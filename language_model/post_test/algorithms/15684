The zzso Feature zzso zzso is a new molecular zzso for zzso similarity zzso Depending on the requirements, it is based on a distance or geometry zzso Thus, the zzso permits zzso and three-dimensional comparisons of zzso In contrast to the common distance zzso the zzso is based on features instead of zzso Each kind of these features may be weighted zzso depending on its zzso contribution to the biological effect of the zzso In this work, we show that the zzso allows us to adapt similarity evaluations to particular zzso as well as to zzso zzso The zzso method is analyzed regarding zzso zzso and zzso zzso the basic setting of feature zzso the similarity evaluations using the zzso on the one hand and the zzso zzso together with zzso zzso on the other yield similar zzso However, in contrast to the latter method, the zzso even permits us to focus on small parts of molecules to serve as a basis for zzso zzso we have achieved striking results not only by readjusting the feature weights with regard to the scaffold but also to the side chain of the respective zzso The results of the latter run turned out to be rather independent of the molecular zzso zzso the zzso is suitable not only for common similarity zzso but also for techniques such as lead or scaffold zzso Figure Chemical structure, feature graph and zzso zzso of zzso
