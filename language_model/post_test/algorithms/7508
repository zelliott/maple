Assessing airway wall surfaces and the zzso from high resolution zzso zzso zzso scans are of great importance for diagnosing pulmonary zzso However, accurately determining inner and outer airway wall surfaces of a complete 3-D tree structure can be quite challenging because of its complex zzso In this paper, we introduce a zzso framework to accurately zzso airways through zzso a precise zzso of the zzso and zzso a zzso constrained zzso random walk method to estimate the airway zzso Our results demonstrate that the proposed airway analysis platform identified the inner and outer airway surfaces better than methods commonly used in clinics, such as full zzso at half maximum and phase zzso
