The independent component analysis zzso zzso method has improved the ability to isolate zzso crossing zzso however, the accuracy of zzso is limited in cases with zzso in local clusters lacking sufficient numbers of fibers with the same zzso To overcome this zzso the zzso was combined with a zzso model zzso zzso An zzso approach is applied to identify crossing fiber components in zzso of small zzso which are zzso independent in zzso The zzso of these components are zzso zzso via the subsequent zzso zzso zzso studies for two or three crossing fibers demonstrate that zzso overcomes the limitation of the original zzso method by refining regional zzso solutions in diffusion measurement of a single zzso It shows zzso of angular errors to isolate two or three zzso providing a better recovery of simulated fibers compared with zzso zzso Human studies show that zzso achieves high anatomical correspondence of zzso tracts compared with zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso true positive detection including both lateral and zzso projections, compared with zzso for zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso crossing fiber problem in clinical diffusion zzso may be sorted out more efficiently by combining zzso with zzso
