Linear zzso systems are a fundamental tool in systems theory, and have been used to design complex circuits and control systems in a variety of zzso Here we present a zzso design method for implementing arbitrary linear zzso systems with zzso zzso This method relies on two levels of zzso first, an zzso of linear zzso systems using zzso chemical zzso and second, an approximate zzso of the ideal chemical reactions with zzso zzso DNA zzso The ideal linear dynamics are shown to be closely zzso by the chemical reactions model and the DNA zzso We illustrate the approach with integration, gain and zzso as well as with the ubiquitous robust zzso zzso
