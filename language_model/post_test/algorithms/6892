The zzso zzso zzso for zzso was zzso at its C zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso and expressed in zzso cells, which normally express this zzso zzso The binding affinity of the zzso zzso was not significantly affected by the presence of the zzso tag, whereas the affinity of the zzso for the zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the zzso zzso was slowly zzso and became partially zzso with the zzso marker Texas zzso after 30 zzso There was little zzso with the zzso marker zzso even after 60 zzso of zzso Finally, the zzso zzso unlike the zzso zzso failed to zzso to the plasma membrane on removal of the zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not traffic normally in zzso cells, most likely because of its gross zzso
