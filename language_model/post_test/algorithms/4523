Network zzso times in distributed simulation environments can be reduced by performing data analysis at the remote source, if the zzso technique does not require the entire set of data at zzso This novel zzso zzso zzso allows zzso data records to be processed in zzso distributed segments and combined at a later point in zzso The new approach agrees with zzso results performed by zzso the discrete segments before zzso but it operates with significantly shortened processing zzso The zzso zzso also benefits from reduced memory requirements since it does not require access to the entire data record at once, and from improved zzso since the zzso zzso has order zzso while fast zzso transform zzso zzso have order zzso log zzso This distributed zzso has particular utility in simulations of zzso correlation zzso or zzso correlation zzso
