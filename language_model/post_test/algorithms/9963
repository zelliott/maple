The new generation of zzso parallel DNA zzso combined with the challenge of whole human zzso zzso result in the need for rapid and accurate alignment of billions of short DNA sequence reads to a large reference zzso Speed is obviously of great importance, but equally important is maintaining alignment accuracy of short reads, in the zzso base range, in the presence of errors and true biological zzso 

We introduce a new zzso specifically zzso for this task, as well as a freely available zzso zzso which can align data produced by any of current sequencing platforms, allows for zzso levels of speed and zzso supports paired end data, and provides for efficient parallel and zzso zzso on a computer zzso The new method is based on creating flexible, efficient whole zzso indexes to rapidly map reads to candidate alignment locations, with arbitrary multiple independent indexes allowed to achieve zzso against read errors and sequence zzso The final local alignment uses a zzso method, with gaps to support the detection of small zzso 

We compare zzso to a selection of large-scale alignment tools -- zzso zzso zzso and zzso -- in terms of both speed and zzso using simulated and real-world zzso We show zzso can achieve substantially greater sensitivity of alignment in the context of errors and true zzso especially insertions and zzso and minimize false zzso while maintaining adequate speed compared to other current zzso We show zzso can align the amount of data needed to fully zzso a human zzso one billion reads, with high sensitivity and zzso on a modest computer cluster in less than 24 zzso zzso is available at zzso
