The natural history of primary zzso zzso zzso is one of slowly progressive zzso with liver damage, development of zzso with its zzso zzso and death unless the patient zzso liver zzso Natural history studies have identified several variables associated with a decreased survival in patients with zzso The course of the disease can be divided into three time zzso zzso a zzso phase, probably lasting up to 20 years; zzso a symptomatic phase, with zzso or mild zzso lasting up to 5 to 10 years; and zzso a zzso or accelerated phase with marked zzso lasting up to 2 zzso Since the course of the disease is one of slow progression leading to liver failure and death unless liver transplantation zzso several investigators have developed statistical models to predict zzso The ability to predict survival for individual patients with zzso has been valuable in the management of these patients, particularly in patient selection and timing of liver zzso In addition, survival estimates can be zzso in education and counseling patients and their zzso These models may also be used to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments by comparing natural history survival with the survival achieved by therapeutic zzso Over the past several decades, the natural history models of zzso have been developed in the absence of effective medical zzso The efficacy of liver transplantation and survival following liver transplantation has now been zzso zzso Future efforts should be aimed at determining not only survival of patients with primary zzso zzso in the presence of effective medical therapy but also at assessing the quality of life and zzso of medical therapy and liver transplantation in the management of patients with primary zzso
