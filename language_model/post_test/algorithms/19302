A modern approach to studying the detailed dynamics of zzso is to simulate them on zzso zzso models have been developed to incorporate information from these simulations in order to calculate properties of the zzso on much longer time scales than can be achieved by the zzso They also provide a simple way to think about the simulated zzso This article develops a method for the solution of framework models, which zzso the zzso method of zzso zzso The generalized method is used to construct solutions of two framework models which have been introduced zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The solution of the zzso model is greatly simplified in comparison with direct zzso In addition, a new framework model is introduced, zzso the shaking stack model of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
