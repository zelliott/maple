zzso Carlo zzso simulations are often at the heart of the testing procedure in biomedical zzso One of the critical points in zzso simulations is to define the new zzso direction after each scattering zzso One of the most popular solutions is to use the zzso phase function or some linear combinations of zzso In this note, we demonstrate that randomly generating the angle defining the new direction of a zzso after a zzso by means of the zzso phase function, is not equivalent to generating the zzso of this angle, as is classically zzso In practice, it is demonstrated that for a nearly zzso medium zzso zzso g approximately zzso this zzso is not large, however for an zzso medium as is typically found in zzso zzso g zzso zzso the two methods give completely different zzso
