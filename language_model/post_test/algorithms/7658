zzso analysis of anatomical trees is hard to perform due to differences in the zzso structure of the zzso In this paper we define statistical properties of zzso anatomical trees with geometric edge attributes by considering the anatomical trees as points in the geometric space of zzso zzso This zzso is a zzso metric space where any two trees are connected by a unique shortest path, which zzso to a tree zzso However, zzso is not a zzso and the usual strategy of performing statistical analysis in a zzso space and projecting onto zzso is not zzso Using zzso and its shortest zzso a variety of statistical properties, such as mean, principal zzso hypothesis testing and linear zzso analysis can be zzso For some of these properties it is still an open problem how to zzso zzso others (like the zzso can be zzso but efficient alternatives are helpful in speeding up zzso that use means zzso like hypothesis zzso In this paper, we take advantage of a very large zzso (N zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso under the assumption that the data trees zzso the relevant parts of zzso zzso Using the developed approximate statistics, we illustrate how the structure and geometry of airway trees vary across a population and show that airway trees with zzso zzso Pulmonary Disease come from a different distribution in zzso than healthy zzso Software is available from zzso
