zzso and localized zzso zzso have been reported in isolated populations of many animal species around the zzso In zzso southern Brazil, a subset of resident zzso dolphins zzso zzso uses a zzso tactic involving cooperative interactions with local, zzso zzso We used individual zzso data to assess whether cooperative and zzso dolphins were socially zzso The social structure of the population was found to be a zzso system with few zzso associations, typical for this zzso However, association values were greater among cooperative dolphins than among zzso dolphins or between dolphins from different zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso social network was divided into three zzso zzso individuals that shared or lacked the cooperative zzso zzso zzso patterns were not sufficient to explain this zzso indicating a zzso zzso The segregation of dolphins using different zzso tactics could result from zzso zzso driving social structure, while the closer association between dolphins engaged in the cooperation could facilitate the transmission and learning of this zzso trait from zzso This unique case of a zzso interaction represents a valuable opportunity to explore hypotheses on the role of social learning in wild zzso
