The recent interest sparked due to the discovery of a variety of functions for zzso zzso molecules has highlighted the need for suitable tools for the analysis and the comparison of zzso zzso Many zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso regulatory elements present zzso zzso both in structure and zzso that can be hardly detected by primary sequence analysis zzso We present an zzso that takes as input a set of zzso zzso sequences expected to share a common zzso and zzso the regions that are most zzso throughout the zzso according to a similarity measure that takes into account both the sequence of the regions and the secondary structure they can form according to zzso and zzso zzso Only a single zzso is needed as zzso which denotes the number of distinct zzso the motif has to zzso No further constraints on the size, number and position of the single elements zzso the motif are zzso The zzso can be split into two zzso first, it extracts from each input sequence a set of candidate regions whose predicted optimal secondary structure contains the number of zzso given as zzso Then, the regions selected are compared with each other to find the groups of most similar ones, formed by a region taken from each zzso To avoid exhaustive zzso of the search space and to reduce the execution time, a greedy zzso is introduced for this zzso We present different experiments, which show that the zzso is capable of characterizing and discovering known regulatory motifs in zzso like the iron responsive element zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso We also show how it can be applied to corrupted zzso in which a motif does not appear in all the input zzso as well as to the discovery of more complex motifs in the zzso zzso
