In this paper, we address the problem of finding the zzso of a feature zzso in the feature space induced by a zzso This is of central importance in some kernel applications, such as on using kernel principal component analysis zzso for image zzso Unlike the traditional method which relies on zzso zzso our proposed method directly finds the location of the zzso based on distance constraints in the feature zzso It is zzso involves only linear algebra and does not suffer from zzso instability or local minimum zzso zzso on performing kernel zzso and kernel zzso on the zzso data set show much improved zzso
