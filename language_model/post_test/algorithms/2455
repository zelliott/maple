To evaluate the ability of four magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to correct for metallic zzso These techniques consisted of 3 zzso techniques and one zzso zzso In zzso imaging the techniques View zzso zzso zzso Slice zzso for Metal zzso Correction zzso and a technique that employed a combination of the first two zzso were zzso In zzso imaging the technique Multiple zzso acquisition with zzso based on a SPACE sequence was evaluated zzso 

zzso zzso and tissue zzso with two commonly used metal implants zzso steel and zzso as well as two volunteers with metal implants were zzso at zzso All zzso and volunteers were zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques, as well as zzso and zzso conventional imaging zzso Each technique was zzso for different image contrast zzso zzso reduction was zzso assessed in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Image quality was zzso assessed by blinded reads employing two zzso Each reader independently viewed the tissue phantom images and in zzso human zzso zzso analysis was performed using a Friedman test, zzso test and weighted Cohen's zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and STIR image contrasts were successfully implemented with the evaluated artifact reduction sequences in both the phantom experiments and in zzso zzso For all evaluated image contrasts and both metal zzso a reduction in the volume of metal artifacts was seen when compared with zzso conventional zzso The zzso metal artifact volumes on average were reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso acquisitions zzso When Friedman and zzso tests were applied the difference in metal artifact volume was found to be statistically significant when zzso zzso and zzso were compared with the zzso conventional zzso In zzso imaging on average zzso reduced metal artifact volume compared with the zzso conventional imaging technique by zzso zzso zzso for all evaluated image contrasts and both metal zzso The metal artifact volume differences were statistically significant when zzso was compared with the zzso conventional zzso The blinded reads demonstrated that zzso and zzso had distinctly superior quality compared with conventional zzso Quality was measured in terms of artifact size, zzso image quality and zzso of bone zzso and soft zzso adjacent to metal zzso This was the case for both tissue phantom images and human images with good zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a consistent, marked reduction of metal artifacts for different metal implants and offered flexible image contrasts zzso zzso zzso and zzso with high image zzso These techniques likely will improve the evaluation of zzso patients with metal zzso
