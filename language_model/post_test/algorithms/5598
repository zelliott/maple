We investigated sensitivity to orientation zzso using visual stimuli with zzso filtered noise zzso We characterized the relationship between the spatial parameters of the zzso and the carrier using a zzso detection zzso The relationship between these two parameters is potentially zzso of the underlying zzso between zzso and second-stage filtering mechanisms, which, in turn, may bear on the zzso between zzso and zzso cortical zzso Our previous experiments on analogous motion stimuli found an optimum sensitivity when the ratio of the carrier and zzso spatial frequency parameters zzso was approximately zzso The current results do not exhibit an optimum sensitivity at a given value of the ratio zzso Previous experiments involving zzso zzso sensitivity show an inconsistent range of estimates of optimum sensitivity at values of r between 5 and zzso Our results, using a complementary approach, confirm these zzso demonstrating that the zzso between carrier and zzso frequency parameters depends on a number of zzso factors, such as contrast sensitivity, stimulus zzso and absolute values of the carrier and zzso spatial frequency zzso We show that these observations are true for a stimulus limited in zzso and that this zzso stimulus does not exhibit scale zzso Such processing can not be modeled by a generic zzso zzso
