The purpose of this study was to assess the radiation dose and associated image noise of previously suggested calcium scoring protocols using zzso zzso 

One hundred consecutive patients underwent coronary calcium scoring using zzso zzso Patients were randomly assigned to five different zzso retrospective zzso and tube current reduction to zzso outside the pulsing window at 120 zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso prospective zzso at 120 zzso and 100 zzso zzso and prospective zzso at 100 zzso with zzso tube current zzso zzso zzso dose parameters and image noise were determined and zzso 

zzso A resulted in an effective dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol B in zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol C in zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol D in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protocol E in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso doses were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso with 100 zzso when compared to 120 zzso zzso and were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso for prospective versus retrospective zzso No significant difference was found between protocol D and zzso zzso negative correlations were found between the zzso and heart rate for both retrospective zzso protocols zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso protocol B: r zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean image noise was zzso zzso zzso zzso with no significant differences between the five zzso The image noise was significantly correlated with the body weight zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso dose of calcium scoring using zzso CT ranges from zzso to zzso zzso Prospective triggering and lower tube zzso significantly reduces the radiation but yield similar image zzso
