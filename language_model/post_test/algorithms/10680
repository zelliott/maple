A comparison of two zzso approaches, zzso and reverse zzso is described for the quantitative resolution of a zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in veterinary zzso for injection without any chemical zzso These two approaches were specified as zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso respectively, after testing the signal analysis parameters for the overlapping zzso zzso and ratio zzso In the first step zzso (a zzso zzso was applied to the original zzso data zzso of zzso and zzso In the second step zzso (a zzso zzso was applied to the ratio zzso data zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso The same approach was also subjected to the ratio zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed using the transformation values obtained in the zzso zzso In the method zzso the zzso zzso functions were tested using synthetic zzso and the standard addition zzso The simultaneous quantitative analysis of zzso and zzso in the commercial veterinary preparation was achieved by the elaborated zzso The zzso results were compared with each other and good agreement was zzso
