To study the effect of motion zzso on image quality to determine the requirements for zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso musculoskeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A phantom with resolution targets in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso planes was attached to a motion device and scanned with zzso CT using a zzso gated CT protocol with pitch values of zzso and zzso Data were acquired with the phantom at rest and while moving periodically along the zzso axis at several zzso zzso resolution and motion artifacts were assessed both for the zzso and zzso zzso 

A linear relationship was found between motion artifact severity and phantom zzso zzso resolution was better preserved in the zzso zzso However, zzso images displayed zzso artifacts, with band zzso being zzso related to motion zzso 

The zzso CT imaging of periodically moving objects with zzso up to 20 zzso is feasible using a pitch value of zzso and a motion frequency of 30 cycles per zzso
