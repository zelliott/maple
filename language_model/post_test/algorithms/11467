zzso zzso volume as observed in follow-up CT is an important zzso outcome measure of the effectiveness of treatment of patients with acute zzso zzso However, manual measurement of zzso is time-consuming and zzso The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a robust automated measurement of the zzso 

The zzso in early follow-up CT images of 34 consecutive patients with acute zzso stroke was segmented with an automated zzso zzso algorithm, which includes partial volume effect correction near the skull, zzso determination, and zzso and zzso zzso Two observers manually delineated the zzso zzso zzso of the manual assessments and the accuracy of the automated method were evaluated by using the zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso The accuracy was defined as the correlation with the manual assessment as a reference zzso 

The zzso correlation for the automated method compared with the reference standard was similar to the manual correlation (R zzso zzso The accuracy of the automated method was excellent with a mean difference of zzso zzso with limits of agreement of zzso zzso which were more consistent than the zzso zzso of the 2 observers zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso were higher for the manual zzso 

The automated method showed a strong correlation and accuracy with the manual reference zzso This approach has the potential to become the standard in assessing the zzso volume as a secondary outcome measure for evaluating the effectiveness of zzso
