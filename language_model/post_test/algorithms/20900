zzso attention enhances our ability to detect stimuli at restricted regions of the visual zzso This enhancement is thought to depend on the difficulty of the task being performed, but the underlying zzso mechanisms for this dependency remain largely zzso We found that task difficulty zzso zzso firing rate at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing zzso zzso in monkey zzso zzso These zzso were zzso zzso increasing task difficulty enhanced zzso zzso firing rate at the focus of attention and suppressed it in regions surrounding the zzso Moreover, we found that response enhancement and suppression are zzso by distinct populations of zzso that differ in direction zzso spike zzso zzso distribution and contrast zzso Our results provide strong support for zzso models of spatial attention and suggest that task difficulty zzso the activity of specific populations of zzso in the primary visual zzso
