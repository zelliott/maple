Many research works deal with chaotic neural networks for various fields of zzso Unfortunately, up to now, these networks are usually claimed to be chaotic without any mathematical zzso The purpose of this paper is to zzso based on a rigorous theoretical zzso an zzso between chaotic zzso according to zzso and a particular class of neural zzso On the one hand, we show how to build such a network, on the other hand, we provide a method to check if a neural network is a chaotic zzso Finally, the ability of classical zzso zzso zzso to learn sets of data obtained from a zzso system is zzso Various zzso functions are zzso on finite zzso zzso of some of them are proven to be chaotic as it is defined by zzso In that context, important differences occur in the training process, establishing with various neural networks that chaotic behaviors are far more difficult to zzso
