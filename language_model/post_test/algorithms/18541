Some zzso islands contain zzso transferred zzso which play critical roles in altering the zzso and zzso of organisms, and horizontal gene transfer has been recognized as a universal event throughout bacterial zzso A zzso method to display the distribution of zzso zzso content, the cumulative zzso profile, is proposed to identify zzso islands in zzso whose complete zzso sequences are zzso Two new zzso are proposed to assess the zzso usage bias and zzso acid usage bias in zzso zzso 

A 211 zzso zzso island zzso has been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso and three zzso islands zzso zzso and zzso with lengths zzso 40 and 33 zzso respectively, have been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is flanked by two approximately 500 zzso direct repeats, and zzso a zzso as the integration zzso For the zzso and zzso each has an zzso gene at zzso zzso All the identified zzso islands show unusual zzso content, zzso usage and zzso acid zzso compared with the rest of the zzso In addition, it is found that zzso islands are fairly zzso in terms of zzso content zzso An index, zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso content for zzso islands is proposed, and it is shown that h is less than zzso for all the zzso islands zzso The cumulative zzso profile, as well as various zzso to assess the zzso usage bias, zzso acid usage bias and zzso of the zzso islands, will be useful in the analysis of other zzso 

Programs used in this work and zzso results are available upon zzso
