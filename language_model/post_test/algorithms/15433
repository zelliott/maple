zzso zzso stems from an abnormal shape of the zzso and zzso zzso It is treated by zzso of damaged soft tissue and by the shaping of bone to resemble normal zzso The zzso treatment of zzso zzso has many advantages, including minimal zzso rapid recovery, and less zzso However, in some cases, revision is needed zzso to the insufficient zzso of damaged bone from a zzso of the surgical zzso The limited view of zzso is the major reason for the zzso In this research, a navigation method for the zzso treatment of zzso zzso is zzso The proposed navigation system consists of zzso zzso measurement device and user zzso The bone mounted measurement devices measure points on zzso junction for registration and position of surgical zzso zzso interface shows the three-dimensional model of patient's zzso and surgical instrument position that is tracked by measurement zzso zzso can know the three-dimensional anatomical structure of hip joint and surgical instrument position on surgical site using navigation zzso Surface registration was used to obtain relation between patient's coordinate at the surgical site and coordinate of three-dimensional model of zzso In this research, we evaluated the proposed navigation system using plastic model zzso It is expected that the surgical tool tracking position accuracy will be less than 1 zzso
