Case zzso 

The optimum zzso power was calculated by ray tracing using a zzso eye model in cataract surgery zzso The calculation can be performed with or without inclusion of the patient's zzso zzso Standard predictions were also generated using current state-of-the-art zzso power calculation zzso The results for all predictions were compared with the optimum zzso power after cataract zzso 

For patients without previous zzso zzso zzso zzso the standard approaches and the zzso procedure gave a similar mean absolute residual error and zzso The incorporation of zzso aberrations did not improve the accuracy of the zzso prediction in these zzso For zzso patients zzso zzso 10), the zzso prediction incorporating zzso aberrations generated the most accurate zzso The difference between the prediction with and without considering zzso aberrations correlated with the amount of zzso zzso aberration zzso zzso zzso resulting in a difference of up to zzso zzso in zzso power in some zzso 

Ray tracing using zzso eye models was a robust procedure for zzso power zzso The incorporation of zzso aberrations is crucial in zzso eyes, primarily because of the elevated zzso zzso zzso
