In this paper, we present a zzso Search zzso zzso for predicting zzso structures of proteins based on zzso angles zzso Given the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso our zzso produces a zzso structure that aims to zzso the energy function associated with the zzso SS is an evolutionary approach that is based on a population of candidate zzso These candidates undergo evolutionary operations that combine search zzso and diversification over a number of zzso We evaluate our zzso on three proteins taken from a zzso Data Bank zzso The results show that our zzso is able to produce zzso structures with good zzso energy zzso Also, the Root Mean Square zzso zzso of these structures from the reference proteins are promising within limits imposed by the assumptions zzso
