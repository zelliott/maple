We investigated the quantitative accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructions that use zzso expressions to estimate the scattered zzso contributions to the projection zzso Our objective was to examine the ability of the method to recover the absolute activities pertaining to both zzso zzso and zzso We validated our method through a series of phantom experiments performed using a clinical hybrid zzso camera zzso zzso GE zzso Different activity ratios and different attenuating media were used in these experiments to create zzso effects of varying severity, which can occur in clinical zzso zzso zzso corrections for scatter and zzso with CT zzso maps allowed for the recovery of the absolute activities from zzso scans with errors that ranged zzso for both zzso The zzso activity ratios increased the zzso burden but practically did not affect the resulting zzso The visual analysis of zzso patient data demonstrated that our zzso processing improved zzso contrast and enhanced zzso of small or faint zzso
