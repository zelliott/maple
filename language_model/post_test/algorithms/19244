To establish the efficacy of a zzso zzso control algorithm, right zzso temperature and heart rate were measured for zzso hours in eight patients zzso zzso 17 zzso and in one normal volunteer zzso zzso during a variety of activities including exercise, rest, sleeping, eating, drinking, and zzso A zzso variation in heart rate and temperature was zzso zzso caused transient temperature changes (less than one zzso during eating, increases of zzso degrees C over zzso minutes were zzso An increase of zzso degrees C over zzso minutes was observed in one patient during zzso An abrupt drop in temperature was typically observed at the onset of exercise, followed by a steady temperature zzso During treadmill exercise, after a drop zzso degrees C, Bruce zzso zzso 4; zzso degrees C, Naughton, zzso zzso 3) during the first 1-2 minutes, temperature rose steadily through the end of peak exercise zzso degrees C, zzso zzso degrees C, zzso A temperature dip was also observed when a patient was told exercise would start but the treadmill failed to turn zzso The dip is probably secondary to changes in blood flow from the peripheral circulation to the central system at the onset of zzso zzso exercise separated by short rests caused progressive zzso of the initial zzso Right zzso temperature changes in a predictable manner with daily activity, allowing a temperature zzso to detect rest and zzso
