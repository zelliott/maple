This paper presents a method for learning decision zzso models of human behaviors from video zzso Our system learns relationships between the movements of a person, the context in which they are acting, and a utility zzso This learning makes explicit that the meaning of a behavior to an observer is contained in its relationship to actions and zzso An agent wishing to capitalize on these relationships must learn to distinguish the behaviors according to how they help the agent to maximize zzso The model we use is a partially zzso zzso decision process, or zzso The video observations are integrated into the zzso using a dynamic zzso network that creates spatial and zzso zzso amenable to decision making at the high zzso The parameters of the model are learned from training data using an a zzso constrained zzso technique based on the zzso zzso The system automatically discovers classes of behaviors and determines which are important for choosing actions that zzso over the utility of possible zzso This type of learning zzso the need for labeled data from expert knowledge about which behaviors are significant and removes bias about what behaviors may be useful to recognize in a particular zzso We show results in three zzso a single player zzso game, a zzso robotic control problem, and a card game played by two zzso
