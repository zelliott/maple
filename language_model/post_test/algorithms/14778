The trend to use large amounts of simple sensors as opposed to a few complex sensors to monitor places and systems creates a need for zzso pattern mining zzso to work on such zzso The methods that try to discover zzso and zzso patterns in zzso event data have several zzso We contrast several recent approaches to the problem, and extend the zzso algorithm, which was previously applied for detection of sequential patterns in zzso zzso The zzso complexity of the zzso approach is prohibitive in the scenarios we zzso We remedy this with a statistical model to obtain a fast and robust zzso to find patterns in zzso zzso We test our zzso on a recent database collected with passive infrared sensors with millions of zzso
