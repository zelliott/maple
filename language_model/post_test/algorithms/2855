Over the last two decades, much research effort has been spent on nearest neighbor search in zzso data zzso Most of the approaches published thus far have, however, only been tested on rather small zzso When large collections have been considered, zzso environments have been used, in particular systems with a large main zzso zzso data on disk has largely been avoided because disk operations are considered to be too zzso It has been zzso however, that using large amounts of memory is generally not an economic zzso zzso we propose the zzso which is a very efficient zzso data structure that can give good approximate answers to nearest neighbor queries with a single disk operation, even for very large collections of zzso zzso Using a single zzso the returned results have high recall but contain a number of false zzso By combining two or three zzso most of those false zzso can be avoided while retaining the high zzso Finally, we compare the zzso to zzso Sensitive zzso a popular method for zzso zzso We show that they return results of similar quality, but the zzso uses many fewer disk zzso
