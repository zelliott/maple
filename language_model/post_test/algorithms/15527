This paper describes an improved zzso approach to remove baseline wander from zzso zzso zzso signals, with particular emphasis on preserving the ST segment of the original zzso The zzso consists of two stages of zzso zzso First, the zzso complex and impulsive noise component due to skeletal muscle zzso zzso are detected and removed from the input zzso Second, the corrected zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are used to determine a structuring zzso With this structuring element, the same zzso operation as in the first stage is then applied to the zzso signal to obtain and remove the baseline zzso The performance of the zzso is evaluated with simulated and real zzso Compared with an existing zzso method, there is a substantial improvement, especially in reducing distortion of the baseline zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso
