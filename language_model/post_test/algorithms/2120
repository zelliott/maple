The task of visual object recognition is often complicated by the fact that a single 3-D object can undergo a number of transformations which can substantially alter its projection onto a zzso surface, such as the zzso Such transformations include translation of the object in the visual field, changes in the size of the object, its orientation in the zzso plane and the viewing zzso For a general pattern recognition system to detect and recognize and object after such zzso it must be able to associate widely differing patterns with the same object zzso In this paper, a novel zzso model, called the Multiple zzso zzso zzso is presented which attempts to solve this problem by searching a zzso space, where each axis is defined by one of the transformations zzso scale, translation, zzso zzso A particular object of a specific size, orientation and spatial location is mapped onto a single point in this zzso Of course, zzso and minor variations in an zzso image will expand this point to a small localized area in this zzso zzso Such a powerful representation scheme comes at a cost of high zzso demand due to the zzso large search zzso The zzso approach to solving this problem efficiently partitions the solution space to search the most promising areas for the correct zzso zzso results are presented on detecting a zzso object under translation, zzso scale, and rotation transformations in a cluttered zzso
