zzso is essential in zzso zzso data analysis to remove zzso variations and systematic zzso Many zzso methods have been used to remove such biases within slides zzso zzso and across slides zzso zzso and zzso However, all these popular approaches have critical assumptions about data distribution, which is often not valid in zzso 

In this study, we propose a novel zzso zzso method based on the zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso Using experimental and simulated normal zzso data and boutique array data, we zzso evaluate the ability of the zzso method in zzso compared with six other popular zzso methods including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one boutique zzso zzso gene zzso The assessment of these methods is based on three different empirical criteria: zzso zzso the zzso zzso statistic and the mean square error zzso Compared with other methods, the zzso method performs effectively and consistently better in reducing zzso zzso and removing systematic zzso 

The zzso method is an effective zzso approach for zzso data zzso In particular, it is free from the statistical and biological assumptions inherent in other zzso methods that are often difficult to zzso zzso the zzso method has a major advantage in that it can be applied to diverse types of array sets, especially to the boutique array where the majority of genes may be zzso zzso
