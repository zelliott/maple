Using a combination of experimental and zzso approaches, we have tested two different approaches to calculating the zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso which gives rise to cardiac muscle zzso zzso By using zzso excited spot zzso of zzso known zzso release flux time courses were generated to provide the first experimental validation of spark flux reconstruction zzso These artificial zzso zzso show that it is possible to calculate the zzso zzso release zzso with reasonable zzso provided the flux equations reasonably reflect the properties of the experimental zzso Within cardiac muscle cells, we show that zzso flux reconstruction is complicated by the substantial dye binding to zzso a factor that has not been adequately addressed in previous flux reconstruction zzso Furthermore, our zzso experiments suggest that the calculated time course of release flux zzso based on conventional flux reconstruction zzso is likely to be in zzso We therefore developed novel zzso based on an explicit dye binding zzso When these zzso were applied to evoked zzso zzso in rat cardiac zzso zzso the reconstructed zzso release zzso peaked in zzso zzso and decayed with a halftime of approximately 5 zzso The peak flux magnitude was zzso zzso suggesting that zzso must arise from clusters of zzso zzso zzso
