By adapting a well-known zzso linkage model that can incorporate zzso or zzso information zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso we have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for identifying zzso and zzso groupings that interact with the evidence for zzso This strategy is designed to identify zzso of affected relative pairs demonstrating increased evidence for linkage, where zzso are defined by zzso or zzso zzso After growing a full tree, we identified optimal tree size through a form of tree pruning and chose the best zzso at each split by using zzso zzso zzso studies showed that power to detect linkage can increase in the presence of zzso zzso depending on the magnitude of the zzso As expected, however, power can decrease by examining more zzso despite the pruning to zzso tree zzso The zzso model correctly identifies tree structure in a large proportion of zzso We applied the zzso model to a zzso of families with bipolar affective disorder zzso where linkage regions on zzso 18 have been previously zzso Using the zzso score in zzso the zzso tests showed no regions with strong linkage evidence on zzso zzso However, using the zzso model, several suggestive regions were found on zzso zzso Two zzso appeared to influence the degree of zzso the type II zzso zzso and a pattern of displaying mania before or after a depressive zzso The zzso model has the potential to identify previously unknown zzso zzso here we have demonstrated the practical utility and potential this new methodology zzso
