zzso the cardiac zzso in magnetic resonance zzso images is required for cardiac function zzso Numerous zzso methods have been developed and applied to MR zzso zzso validation of these zzso methods with ground truth is needed prior to clinical use, but requires manual zzso of hundreds of zzso We applied a well-established method to this problem and rigorously validated the zzso 

An automatic method based on active contours without edges was used for left and the right zzso cavity zzso A large database of zzso MR images obtained from 59 patients who gave informed consent was zzso Two standard metrics were used for quantitative error zzso 

zzso results are comparable to previously reported values in the zzso Since different points in the cardiac cycle and different slice levels were used in this study, a detailed error analysis is zzso Better performance was obtained at end zzso than at end zzso and on zzso slices than zzso zzso zzso of zzso errors were highlighted through a study of their spatial zzso 

zzso zzso based on zzso active contours provided satisfactory results in zzso without the use of a zzso zzso The study of error distribution allows identification of potential improvements in zzso zzso
