Few zzso objective methods exist to zzso physical activity and predict energy expenditure zzso during zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso of the zzso Mini zzso monitor zzso zzso Pittsburgh, zzso to estimate zzso in pregnant zzso 

Thirty healthy pregnant women zzso zzso of zzso completed a series of activities of daily living zzso laundry, zzso and treadmill zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso was estimated by the zzso and measured by indirect zzso zzso The zzso data were processed using both the zzso zzso and the newer zzso zzso The estimated zzso values were compared with the measured zzso values using a three-way zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed model zzso zzso square means zzso zzso were estimated in the zzso zzso was set at P zzso zzso 

The analyses revealed a significant method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with significantly smaller error zzso for the newer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the older zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso significantly overestimated zzso for all activities, except inclined zzso The average mean absolute percentage error was considerably lower for the new zzso zzso than that for the older zzso zzso The average individual correlation zzso revealed good overall agreement between the zzso and the zzso zzso mean r zzso zzso zzso mean r zzso zzso 

Overall, the zzso correlated well with zzso however, zzso was significantly overestimated during most zzso Future studies should develop zzso zzso and assess zzso of the zzso at all stages of pregnancy to further improve prediction of zzso in this zzso
