zzso are presented of what could be specified by genes to enable the different functional zzso of the neural networks found in the brain to be built during zzso It is suggested that for each class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a small number of genes specify the generic properties of that zzso class zzso the number of zzso in the class, and the firing zzso while a larger number of genes specify the properties of the zzso onto that class of zzso from each of the other classes that makes zzso with zzso These properties include not only which other zzso classes the zzso come from, but whether they are zzso or zzso the nature of the learning rule implemented at the zzso and the initial strength of such zzso In a demonstration of the feasibility of the hypotheses to specify the architecture of different types of zzso network, a genetic zzso is used to allow the evolution of zzso which are capable of specifying neural networks that can learn to solve particular zzso tasks, including pattern association, zzso and competitive zzso This overall approach allows such hypotheses to be further tested, improved, and extended with the help of zzso network simulations with genetically specified zzso in order to develop further our understanding of how the architecture and operation of different parts of brains are specified by zzso and how different parts of our brains have evolved to perform particular zzso
