Lead zzso is a molecular zzso zzso zzso uses an original zzso of the genetic zzso that involves a number of additional zzso zzso Lead zzso scoring functions employ a set of zzso molecular mechanics zzso that have been zzso independently for zzso binding energy predictions and zzso for virtual zzso zzso and scoring both zzso a staged approach, moving from fast but less accurate zzso versions to zzso more intensive but more accurate zzso Lead zzso includes tools for the preparation of full atom protein and zzso zzso In this exercise, Lead zzso achieved zzso zzso success rate on the zzso test set when the original zzso full atom models were used, and zzso success rate when the structures were prepared by Lead zzso The major cause of zzso failures were scoring errors resulting from the use of imperfect zzso zzso In many cases, zzso errors could be corrected by the proper zzso and the use of correct zzso zzso of zzso In virtual screening experiments on the zzso test set the early enrichment factor of several tens was achieved on zzso However, the area under the zzso curve zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso depending on the screening protocol used, and the separation from the zzso model was not zzso units of zzso zzso We assume that effective virtual screening in the whole range of enrichment curve and not just at the early enrichment stages requires more accurate zzso modeling and accounting for the protein backbone zzso
