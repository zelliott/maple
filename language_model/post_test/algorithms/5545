The stationary phase characteristics of the material obtained through zzso of zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso via zzso formation were zzso The material was characterized in terms of zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso pH point of zero charge zzso zzso zzso and contact angle zzso zzso of zzso bonded to zzso was determined from the zzso analysis results, and found as 170 zzso zzso of the material was studied in zzso media at different pH values, and amount of zzso released at zzso did not exceed zzso of the total immobilized zzso zzso phase characteristics of the zzso material were investigated in an zzso system by using some zzso weight polar compounds zzso some zzso and zzso as test zzso Effect of some experimental variables such as column zzso composition of mobile phase, and temperature on the zzso behavior of the studied compounds was zzso Role of ammonium solutions at different pH values on zzso properties of the species was also zzso zzso factors zzso versus volume percentage of organic modifier exhibited a zzso which was evaluated as an indication for zzso zzso behavior of the stationary zzso zzso between zzso and zzso modes was analyzed through geometric approach, and found as zzso zzso separation for the studied groups of compounds was achieved under each studied mode, and some zzso were observed in zzso order of the compounds depending on the zzso mode zzso zzso recorded under zzso and zzso modes were compared with those recorded on zzso under similar conditions, and thus the zzso of zzso zzso process was evaluated in zzso In light of the obtained results, immobilized zzso is represented as a useful stationary phase for zzso zzso
