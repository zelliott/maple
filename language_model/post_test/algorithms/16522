Organic light-emitting zzso zzso usually exhibit a low light zzso efficiency because a large fraction of power is lost to surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this paper it is demonstrated that periodic grating structures with almost zzso can be used to extract zzso as well as zzso modes and therefore enhance the zzso efficiency in light-emitting thin film zzso The zzso are zzso by zzso zzso using a commercially available zzso grating as a mold which is pressed into a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso modes is detected in fluorescent organic films adjacent to a thin metal layer in angular dependent zzso zzso zzso up to zzso is observed and the extracted modes are identified by comparison to the SP and zzso zzso obtained from optical zzso In order to demonstrate the low-cost, high quality and large area zzso of grating structures in zzso devices, we also present SP extraction using a grating structure zzso by a common DVD zzso
