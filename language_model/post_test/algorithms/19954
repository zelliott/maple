This paper is concerned with the zzso zzso fuzzy zzso output feedback control scheme for zzso zzso zzso fuzzy zzso systems with distributed zzso zzso To begin with, the zzso fuzzy zzso system is transformed to an equivalent switching fuzzy zzso zzso Then, based on novel zzso decoupling technique, improved zzso zzso technique and zzso zzso function zzso a new zzso zzso fuzzy zzso output feedback controller design approach is first derived for the switching fuzzy zzso zzso Some drawbacks existing in the previous papers such as zzso zzso zzso coordinate zzso the same output zzso diagonal structure constraint on zzso zzso and zzso problem have been zzso Since only a set of zzso is involved, the controller parameters can be solved directly by the zzso zzso zzso Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the zzso of the proposed zzso
