In this paper we explore the feasibility of using DNA molecules as a zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA molecules were zzso with different gamma radiation zzso The strand breakage produced by zzso radiation within zzso zzso DNA molecules zzso yields relaxed circular DNA molecules zzso and linear DNA molecules zzso as a result of zzso breaks and zzso breaks, zzso The zzso samples were subjected to zzso on zzso gels to separate the three zzso A proprietary fluorescent dye was used to detect DNA bands within the zzso which was photographed under zzso zzso The negative was scanned with a computerized imaging zzso system for DNA band zzso The relative zzso of the three molecular forms are dose dependent, and can be modeled zzso with five zzso The values of the parameters were determined by zzso the fit of the model to the data, using a zzso zzso procedure of a commercial statistical analysis zzso Once the parameters of DNA breakage have been determined, absorbed dose can be measured by this technique, which we have termed zzso relaxation zzso The average accuracy of dose determination for our system over the range of zzso zzso was about zzso zzso relaxation zzso may be well suited to certain difficult zzso zzso
