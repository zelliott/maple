zzso methods for analysis of functional zzso data acquired as zzso designed experiments are described and zzso The F ratio was estimated for main effects and interactions at each zzso in standard zzso Critical values corresponding to probability thresholds were derived from a zzso distribution sampled by appropriate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso test statistics were generated by applying a preliminary probability threshold to the zzso F maps and then computing the sum of zzso statistics in each of the resulting three-dimensional zzso zzso cluster zzso Using simulations zzso two zzso or zzso factors each with two or three levels, contaminated by zzso and zzso noise, the zzso zzso test was compared to the standard zzso F test and to the performance of the zzso informed statistic using receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and software is endorsed by almost identical performance of zzso and zzso tests of the zzso F zzso zzso testing of zzso zzso cluster mass, however, was found to provide consistently superior sensitivity to detect simulated signals than either of the zzso zzso The methods are also illustrated by application to an experimental zzso designed to investigate effects of zzso drug treatment on brain zzso by implicit sad facial affect perception in patients with major zzso zzso drug effects in left zzso and zzso zzso were detected by this software for an interaction between time zzso zzso and group zzso zzso in a representative zzso zzso zzso
