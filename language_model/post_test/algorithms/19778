A two-dimensional bisexual branching process has recently been presented for the analysis of the zzso evolution of the number of carriers of a zzso zzso In this model, preference of females for males with a specific genetic characteristic is assumed to be determined by an zzso of the zzso It has been shown that the behavior of this kind of zzso gene is strongly related to the reproduction law of each zzso In practice, the corresponding offspring zzso are usually unknown, and it is necessary to develop their zzso theory in order to determine the natural selection of the zzso Here we deal with the zzso problem for the offspring distribution of each zzso of a zzso gene when the only zzso data are each zzso total numbers of males of each zzso and of zzso We set out the problem in a non zzso framework and obtain the maximum likelihood zzso of the offspring zzso using an zzso zzso From these zzso we also derive the zzso for the reproduction mean of each zzso and forecast the distribution of the future population zzso Finally, we check the accuracy of the zzso by means of a simulation zzso
