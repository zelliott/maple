To investigate zzso zzso decomposition zzso zzso zzso for assessment of regional lung zzso in patients with zzso Lung Cancer zzso in comparison to dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images of the lungs were acquired zzso in 15 patients using a zzso balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso After zzso registration of the native image data, zzso images were calculated by separating periodic changes of lung zzso density at the cardiac frequency using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired as standard of zzso Both zzso were analyzed visually for zzso zzso Then zzso analyses were performed to describe zzso of pulmonary zzso zzso as percentages of total lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal was compared to zzso flow zzso in the pulmonary trunk as an additional fully quantitative zzso 

Image quality ratings of zzso zzso were significantly inferior to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso for visual detection of zzso defects were zzso zzso and zzso zzso evaluation of zzso zzso provided high agreement between zzso zzso and zzso zzso for both entire lungs and upper zzso but less agreement in the lower parts of both zzso zzso zzso signal showed high linear correlation with pulmonary zzso blood zzso 

zzso zzso is a promising technique that allows for assessing regional lung zzso in zzso patients without contrast media or zzso zzso However, for being applied in clinical routine, image quality and zzso of the technique need to be further zzso
