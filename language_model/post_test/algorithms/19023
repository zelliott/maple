The potential of zzso zzso zzso techniques for the zzso of target sound sources in a background noise was investigated and contrasted with traditional zzso transfer function zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso was theoretically derived to estimate the zzso pressure at the center of a zzso microphone array and verified by comparing simulated frequency response functions with directly measured zzso The results show that there is good agreement in the frequency range of zzso A listening experiment was conducted to evaluate the zzso method zzso A set of ten environmental and product sounds were processed for headphone presentation in three different ways: zzso zzso synthesis using dummy head zzso zzso the same with background noise, and zzso zzso of the noisy condition in combination with zzso zzso Two levels of background noise zzso 72 zzso zzso were used and two independent groups of subjects zzso evaluated either the zzso or annoyance of the processed zzso The results indicate that zzso almost entirely restored the zzso (or zzso of the target sounds to unmasked levels, even when presented with background noise, and thus may be a useful tool to zzso analyze composite zzso
