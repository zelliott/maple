Identification of good zzso spreads is an important step in zzso analysis for identifying individuals with genetic zzso The process of finding suitable zzso zzso for accurate clinical analysis is, however, very time consuming since they are selected zzso The selection of suitable zzso zzso spreads thus represents a major bottleneck for conventional zzso zzso Although many zzso have been developed for zzso none have adequately addressed the critical bottleneck of selecting suitable zzso zzso In this paper, we present a software tool that uses a simple zzso system to efficiently identify zzso spreads suitable for zzso 

The zzso shapes can be classified by the software into four main zzso The first and the second classes refer to individual zzso with straight and skewed shapes, zzso The third class is characterized as those zzso with overlapping bodies and the fourth class is for the zzso zzso Good zzso spreads should largely contain zzso of the first and the second classes, while the third class should be kept zzso Several image parameters were examined and used for creating zzso zzso The threshold value for each zzso is determined using a statistical zzso We observed that the zzso model can represent the empirical probability density function of the parameters and, zzso the threshold value can be easily zzso The proposed rules can efficiently and accurately zzso the individual zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

The software zzso termed zzso was zzso Using the zzso rules, the tool can be used to quickly rank hundreds of zzso spread images so as to assist zzso to perform zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso offers an zzso yet comprehensive, zzso to assist zzso including tools for editing zzso zzso merge and zzso and a zzso editor zzso zzso and pairing zzso zzso The program can be freely downloaded from zzso
