The Young's zzso of an zzso segment, a measure of the elastic properties of the zzso wall, requires the simultaneous and local assessment of pulse pressure, wall zzso diameter, and zzso zzso increase in zzso area per change in blood zzso The diameter and relative increase in zzso area can be obtained with a wall track system, processing the zzso zzso ultrasound signals received along a single line of observation zzso zzso It will be demonstrated that it is feasible to combine, in a single zzso the assessment of wall thickness and the zzso change zzso diameter involving a minimum of user zzso Phantom tests show a standard error of the estimate for zzso thickness zzso of less than 20 zzso in zzso registrations exhibit a variation on the order of 45 zzso It is concluded that processing of the zzso ultrasound zzso acquired along an zzso provides an accurate and zzso alternative for zzso of zzso zzso ultrasound images to estimate artery wall zzso
