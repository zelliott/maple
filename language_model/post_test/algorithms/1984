zzso vision is traditionally treated as two zzso the fusion of similar images, and the zzso suppression of dissimilar images zzso zzso zzso Recent work has demonstrated that zzso suppression is zzso whereas zzso zzso occurs only when stimuli are in zzso But how do these processes affect our perception of zzso zzso We measured perceived contrast using a matching paradigm for a wide range of zzso phase zzso zzso and matching contrasts zzso Our results revealed a complex interaction between contrast and zzso zzso At low zzso perceived contrast reduced zzso with increasing phase zzso by up to a factor of zzso At higher contrasts the pattern was zzso perceived contrast was zzso for zzso and zzso conditions, and zzso zzso but increased a little at intermediate phase zzso These findings challenge a recent model in which contrast perception is zzso The results were predicted by a zzso contrast gain control zzso The model involves zzso gain controls with zzso suppression from positive and negative phase channels, followed by zzso across eyes and then across zzso zzso this zzso to conditions with vertical zzso only a single zzso disparity channel and embodies both fusion and suppression processes within a single zzso
