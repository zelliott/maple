In abdominal trauma patients, monitoring zzso zzso and oxygen consumption is essential during the resuscitation zzso zzso is an optical technique potentially capable of monitoring these changes in real time to provide the medical staff with a timely and quantitative measure of the zzso of zzso The challenges for using optical techniques in monitoring zzso in zzso tissue are discussed, and the solutions to these challenges are presented using a combination of zzso Carlo modeling and theoretical analysis of light propagation in zzso In particular, it is shown that by using visible zzso zzso 470 and 525 zzso the zzso signal is enhanced and the background contribution is decreased compared with using traditional zzso zzso leading to an order of magnitude enhancement in the zzso zzso It was further shown that, using the visible zzso similar sensitivity to zzso changes could be obtained (over 50% compared with that of zzso zzso This is mainly due to the increased contrast between tissue and blood in that spectral region and the confinement of the photons to the thickness of the small zzso Moreover, the modeling results show that the source to detector separation should be limited to roughly 6 zzso while using traditional zzso light, with a few zzso source to detector separation leads to poor zzso zzso Finally, a visible wavelength system is tested in an in zzso zzso study, and the possibility of monitoring zzso zzso changes is zzso
