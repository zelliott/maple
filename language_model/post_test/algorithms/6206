zzso images push to their limits classical analysis methods, since gene spots are often poorly zzso ill defined and of irregular zzso These characteristics hinder a robust zzso of corresponding values for red and green zzso as well as their zzso zzso New approaches are thus needed to ensure accurate data extraction from these zzso zzso we present an automatic zzso zzso for a fast and accurate spot data extraction from DNA zzso The method is based on a split and merge algorithm, relying on a Delaunay zzso process, allowing an incremental partition of the image into homogeneous zzso Geometric properties of zzso as well as zzso criteria are defined according to the zzso of zzso image zzso The method is first assessed on simulated data, and then compared with zzso and Jaguar zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are superior to those obtained from a number of standard techniques for spot zzso
