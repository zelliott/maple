zzso of a nascent zzso chain inside the zzso exit tunnel, before it leaves the zzso has been proposed to accelerate the folding of newly zzso proteins following their release from the zzso Thus, we used zzso zzso Carlo simulations of a minimalist zzso model to explore the effect that zzso zzso through a variety of channels has on protein folding zzso Our results demonstrate that tunnel confinement promotes faster folding of a zzso protein relative to its folding in free space by zzso the unfolded state towards more compact structures that are closer to the transition zzso Since the tunnel only forbids rarely visited, extended zzso it has little effect on a zzso zzso protein whose unfolded state is largely composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso The beneficial effect of the tunnel depends on its zzso for example, a zzso tunnel zzso unfolded states with limited or no access to the transition state, while a zzso tunnel has no effect on the unfolded state zzso We speculate that such effects are likely to play an important role in the folding of some proteins or protein zzso in the cellular environment and might dictate whether a protein folds zzso or zzso
