In this paper, some new zzso are proposed to estimate zzso functions in zzso zzso population models by practical zzso These zzso together with a zzso method are applied to zzso the human population using the data provided by the United Nations zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso using statistical data are integral components of mathematical population models and their zzso solutions for the projection of population growth or zzso Data from the UN zzso zzso are used to estimate parameters in the zzso zzso population models proposed by zzso and zzso The population of Japan was chosen for prediction of population zzso The zzso techniques applied could also be used for any population provided the requisite data sets are zzso The data considered for parameters functions zzso 25 years from 1955 to 1979 derived from the data set of zzso The zzso model was also used for zzso of population with a much larger margin of error between actual and predicted population size: in 1985 the actual figure was zzso 920 zzso zzso predicted by the zzso model, an error of zzso In contrast, the zzso model predicted zzso an error of zzso The actual newborn population of Japan in 1985 was zzso and the zzso model predicted zzso and error of zzso Such information was not available from the zzso zzso The zzso could become more refined with further zzso
