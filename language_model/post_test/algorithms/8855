To reconstruct images from truncated projections collected along a spiral zzso the most common approach is to smoothly extrapolate each projection to suppress zzso zzso Based on the work of zzso a local reconstruction zzso is developed for spiral cone beam zzso zzso zzso which does not need explicit projection zzso This zzso is a zzso zzso format and contains three major steps: zzso weight, zzso and zzso While the zzso weight and zzso steps are the same as the classical zzso - Davis - zzso zzso zzso the filtering step contains two steps: zzso filtering and zzso zzso zzso zzso simulation results show that the proposed zzso has a better performance than zzso zzso for zzso zzso reconstruction of spiral zzso zzso
