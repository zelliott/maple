A zzso zzso zzso model for zzso steroids, zzso a separate characterization of 1) the zzso zzso process and 2) the zzso relationship, was applied to various zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso (six zzso one zzso one zzso and one zzso were determined in rats in conjunction with plasma zzso zzso zzso modeling revealed zzso zzso effect relationships with large differences in potency zzso and intrinsic activity between the zzso The data were analyzed on the basis of the zzso zzso model for zzso zzso steroids on the assumption of a single and unique zzso zzso The model zzso yielding estimates of both the apparent in zzso zzso affinity zzso and the in zzso intrinsic efficacy zzso The values of zzso ranged from zzso zzso 0 zzso for zzso to zzso zzso 72 zzso for zzso and the values for zzso from zzso zzso 0 for zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso linear correlations were observed between zzso for zzso zzso and the affinity in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings of this investigation show that the in zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso steroids can be described on the basis of a single unique zzso zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso behave as partial zzso relative to zzso zzso
