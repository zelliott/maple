The zzso affinity of plasma zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso zzso techniques have been widely used to zzso zzso zzso affinity for studying biological function, but the approach requires rapid and reliable zzso affinity zzso to compare the zzso Here, we describe a novel method that measures zzso binding to a standardized preparation of small zzso zzso zzso containing trace zzso and fluorescent zzso After a 30 zzso incubation at various zzso zzso zzso protein is rapidly separated from free protein on columns of immobilized zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso are zzso and measured in a zzso zzso reader for calculation of a zzso constant and the maximum number of potential binding sites on the zzso Using human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of each, we show that the zzso generates binding zzso that are comparable to other methods and is zzso across time and zzso zzso The zzso is easy to perform and can measure zzso binding parameters for up to 10 separate zzso in zzso zzso consuming only 120 zzso of zzso in zzso The benefits and potential drawbacks of the zzso are zzso
