zzso dynamics simulations are used to study the zzso process of zzso of zzso zzso into long filaments containing up to 1000 zzso zzso In order to overcome the large separation of time scales between the zzso motion of the free zzso and the relatively slow attachment and detachment processes at the two ends of the zzso we introduce a novel zzso procedure by which we speed all zzso processes related to zzso zzso and zzso up by the same zzso In general, the zzso zzso within a filament can attain three different states corresponding to a bound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The simplest situation that has been studied zzso is provided by the zzso of zzso for which all zzso are zzso This case is used to unravel certain relations between the zzso physical properties and the model parameters such as the attachment rate constant and the size of the capture zone, the detachment rate and the probability of the detached event, as well as the growth rate and waiting times between two successive zzso zzso When a single filament is allowed to grow in a bath of constant concentration of free zzso zzso its growth rate increases zzso with the free zzso concentration in quantitative agreement with in zzso zzso The results also show that the waiting time is governed by exponential zzso and that the two ends of a filament undergo biased random zzso The filament length fluctuations are described by a length diffusion constant that is found to attain a constant value at low zzso concentration and to increase zzso with this zzso It is straightforward to apply our simulation code to more complex processes such as zzso of zzso coupled to zzso zzso force generation by zzso formation of filament zzso and zzso zzso
