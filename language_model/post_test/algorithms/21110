We present here a detailed study of the controlled release of zzso acid derived zzso molecules from the internal pore structure of zzso zzso drug delivery systems with different structural zzso namely cubic and zzso structures of various degrees of zzso The internal pore surface of the zzso presented has been zzso with zzso zzso through a one pot zzso zzso profiles obtained by zzso zzso Current zzso are interpreted in terms of specific structural and textural parameters of the porous zzso such as pore geometry and zzso zzso indicate that diffusion zzso are lower by as much as four orders of magnitude in zzso structures in comparison to zzso zzso zzso A fast release in turn is observed from zzso materials zzso and zzso where the presence of structural defects is thought to lead to a slightly lower diffusion zzso in the zzso zzso of pore wall zzso and number of binding sites on the model drug are found to have little effect on the drug release zzso
