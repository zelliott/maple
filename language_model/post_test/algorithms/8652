Previous studies have indicated that zzso heart sounds may contain information useful in the detection of zzso coronary zzso In this study, recordings of zzso heart sound segments were modeled by zzso zzso methods including the zzso zzso zzso lattice zzso and the zzso lattice predictor zzso Application of the zzso criterion demonstrated that between 5 and 15 zzso zzso are required to completely describe a zzso zzso The reflection zzso prediction zzso zeros of the zzso of the inverse zzso and the zzso spectrum were determined over a number (N zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso results indicate that the averaged zzso spectrum and the zeros of the inverse filter zzso can be used to distinguish between normal patients and those with coronary artery zzso
