zzso in optical zzso zzso zzso images originates in the high spatial zzso of incident light that enables interference of light zzso from zzso zzso tissue zzso We report results of a zzso simulation and an experiment to test zzso reduction using a partially zzso coherent zzso A zzso model for a partially zzso coherent source is used in the zzso zzso For the experiment, such a source was generated by a zzso coherent zzso light source and a zzso zzso The advantage of using a zzso fiber in combination with a broadband source is the large number of photons per zzso zzso To illustrate zzso reduction with a partially zzso coherent source, we record zzso zzso of a scattering surface using zzso and zzso source zzso zzso recorded using a zzso source fiber are indicative of those observed using conventional zzso zzso in zzso images recorded using a zzso source fiber is substantially zzso
