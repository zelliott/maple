We compare the changes in side chain zzso that accompany the formation of zzso complexes, in zzso forming either the interface or the remainder of the zzso surface of the proteins in the zzso Benchmark zzso We find that the interface zzso undergo significantly more changes than other surface zzso and these changes are more likely to convert them from a zzso zzso angle state to a zzso one than the zzso Moreover, in both the zzso proteins and the complexes, the interface zzso are more frequently found to be in a zzso zzso angle state than the zzso zzso As these differences exist before the binding step, they may be relevant to specificity and help in identifying binding sites for zzso zzso
