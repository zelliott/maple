We describe the application of quantitative zzso methodology to study expression of zzso and zzso in zzso fetal zzso We applied real-time zzso using the fluorescent zzso zzso Green, to establish a very reliable, sensitive, specific, zzso and rapid zzso that was linear over a wide dynamic range of starting target gene copy zzso The main point of this paper is to provide a detailed description of how to zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and, most importantly, to provide solutions for some of the commonly observed problems encountered when employing quantitative zzso zzso We establish that use of zzso Green for detection of zzso products was a powerful and reliable tool in our investigation of zzso gene expression in zzso fetal zzso and demonstrate the zzso of induction of zzso and zzso in crosses between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate for the first time the induction of zzso zzso expression in fetal lung and liver zzso following in zzso exposure to zzso zzso a zzso aromatic zzso This zzso for zzso and zzso expression could be zzso equally well to detect other genes of interest in a variety of zzso zzso
