zzso is the destruction of zzso biological zzso by zzso For internal zzso multiple zzso are inserted into the tissue with the goal of maximizing zzso within a zzso target region, while minimizing zzso to the surrounding zzso The objective of this study is to develop a computerized planning tool to determine the best locations to insert the zzso based on zzso transfer zzso This tool is general and suitable for all available cooling techniques and zzso The planning procedure employs a novel zzso zzso technique based on a zzso zzso In each zzso a single transient zzso transfer simulation of the zzso is zzso At the end of the zzso regions of tissue that would have zzso temperatures apply zzso to the zzso directly moving them to better zzso This method is more efficient than traditional zzso zzso techniques, because it requires significantly fewer zzso transfer simulations for each iteration of zzso For demonstration purposes, zzso examples on cross sections typical of prostate zzso are zzso
