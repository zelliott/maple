Single slice zzso magnetic resonance zzso images were taken from a volume of interest zzso which was zzso using the point resolved zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso profile of the zzso within the image plane were accounted for using a uniformity correction zzso zzso images were divided on a zzso basis with a water image obtained from a zzso of the same spatial dimensions from a phantom zzso zzso procedures carried out on phantom zzso images were needed to account for the spatial shift in the zzso profile of the zzso which varies zzso with the chemical shift of the zzso Patient zzso images were then zzso using a zzso water image from a phantom zzso which was zzso shifted according to the zzso chemical zzso In a study of 14 stroke patients, zzso maps of the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The spectral signal zzso from these zzso in the zzso and in the zzso region were calculated using the raw maps and zzso with the same maps after the B1 zzso zzso In the initial analysis only the zzso zzso showed a significant decrease, whilst all three zzso showed a significant reduction in the zzso zzso These results confirm that zzso of PRESS zzso images does have a significant bearing upon any quantitative zzso made using such zzso
