zzso zzso is a complex medical procedure in which a zzso tube is inserted into the human zzso zzso positioning carries potentially fatal consequences and therefore confirmation of correct positioning is zzso This paper introduces a novel system for zzso tube position zzso The proposed system comprises a miniature complementary metal oxide silicon sensor zzso attached to the tip of a zzso rigid zzso and connected to a digital signal zzso zzso with an integrated video acquisition zzso Video signals are acquired and processed by a confirmation zzso implemented on the zzso The confirmation approach is based on video image zzso zzso identifying desired expected anatomical structures zzso trachea and main zzso of the zzso and zzso structures zzso The desired and zzso images are indicators of correct or incorrect zzso tube zzso The proposed methodology is comprised of a continuous and zzso image representation scheme using zzso mixture models zzso estimated using a greedy zzso A zzso feature space, which consists of several zzso features, is zzso to represent the zzso The performance of the proposed zzso was evaluated using two zzso a zzso of 1600 images extracted from 10 videos recorded during zzso on dead cows, and a zzso of zzso images extracted from 8 videos recorded during zzso performed on human zzso Each one of the video images was classified by a medical expert into one of three zzso upper zzso zzso correct zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results, obtained using a zzso method, show that the system correctly classified zzso out of 1600 zzso of the cow zzso images, and zzso out of the zzso human images zzso zzso of an image of the esophagus as zzso or zzso which is potentially zzso was extremely rare zzso one case when in the animal zzso and no cases when in the human zzso zzso The zzso results of the cow zzso zzso compare favorably with a state-of-the-art zzso method tested on the same zzso
