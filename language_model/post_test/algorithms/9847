zzso changes in zzso control during quiet standing likely result from underlying pathological conditions or from the low specificity of classical zzso zzso which are vulnerable to base of support zzso and zzso zzso This study focuses on the identification of changes in zzso control with natural aging by using conventional and recent zzso analysis, and on the interpretation of the zzso parameters according to a recently proposed framework of zzso zzso Quiet standing zzso tests were applied to 57 subjects equally divided into young, middle-aged and aged groups zzso zzso and zzso years, zzso with eyes open and closed zzso In addition to zzso of classical zzso center of pressure time series were approached according to a zzso process and the recently proposed sway density zzso Two out of 10 estimated zzso identified zzso zzso Aged subjects exhibited higher sway zzso possibly resulting from the increase of zzso bursts produced by the zzso zzso and stronger negative correlation between consecutive center of pressure zzso observed for long time zzso likely due to higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso Aging itself does not result in major changes of zzso stability, but reflects a small increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and frequency of zzso adjustments, probably to compensate for the lower zzso of calf muscle zzso in aged zzso
