Recently, Lake et zzso zzso zzso zzso have proposed an approach based on the zzso zzso for zzso zzso of trait associations with zzso and environmental zzso in generalized linear zzso In this short report, we describe an extension to accommodate missing zzso zzso zzso We also discuss differences in the calculation of standard errors between their zzso and our zzso Finally, we present results indicating that zzso is robust to low levels of dependence between zzso and zzso factors, but that biased zzso can result when there is moderate to strong zzso Overall, the method is found to perform well in the models we zzso
