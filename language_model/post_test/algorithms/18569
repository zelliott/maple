The purpose of the paper is an experimental study of the formation of class descriptions, taking place during learning, in assembly neural zzso The assembly neural network is artificially zzso into several zzso according to the number of classes that the network has to zzso The features extracted from input data are represented in neural column structures of the zzso zzso neural zzso are formed in the column structure of the zzso by weight zzso A specific class description is formed in each zzso of the assembly neural network due to zzso between the neural zzso The process of formation of class descriptions in the zzso is interpreted as feature zzso A set of special experiments is performed to study this process, on a task of character recognition using the zzso zzso
