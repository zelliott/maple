zzso is a zzso in zzso skin imaging technique that assists dermatologists in diagnosing zzso However, the use of zzso for diagnosis requires extensive training since this approach often provides extremely complex and zzso zzso The presence of an zzso color difference in zzso images is one of the serious problems associated with the use of this zzso This zzso color difference leads to inaccurate zzso extraction at the borders and zzso the assessment of zzso zzso zzso objective and quantitative assessment based on zzso color differences is important for the diagnosis of melanoma using zzso 

In this study, we developed a method for assessing colors in a zzso zzso zzso color regions based on the zzso method in each color channel were constructed, and dominant color region zzso zzso dominant region zzso and the number of colors were assessed as three diagnostic parameters from these zzso color regions on 150 zzso zzso 

zzso accuracy was calculated by combination of three diagnostic parameters derived from zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso accuracy with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity was obtained in case of positive features in more than two zzso
