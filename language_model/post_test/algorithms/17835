zzso isotope ratios act as chemical zzso of animal diet, and are used to study food web zzso Because carbon stable isotope values are influenced by tissue zzso content, a number of extraction methods have been used to remove zzso bias, but, in some species and zzso zzso also alter nitrogen isotope zzso We have analyzed zzso and zzso in Atlantic zzso tuna liver and white muscle, and whole Atlantic zzso fish zzso covering a wide range of zzso content zzso zzso zzso In order to compare zzso and zzso values from traditional zzso zzso with zzso zzso alternatives, we analyzed samples following zzso no treatment, zzso zzso removal using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced the lowest zzso values and highest zzso zzso In zzso tuna, zzso and zzso zzso significantly altered liver zzso and all methods significantly altered zzso values in white zzso Whole Atlantic zzso zzso was not altered by any extraction method, while the zzso zzso extraction most completely removed fish tissue zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso effects are not limited to common zzso zzso and suggest that zzso is the most effective extraction for zzso zzso Given evidence for zzso zzso among all tested methods, mathematical correction approaches should be further explored as an alternative to zzso zzso
