In recent years, Independent zzso Analysis zzso has become a standard to identify relevant dimensions of the data in zzso zzso is a very reliable method to analyze data but it is, zzso very zzso The use of zzso for online analysis of the data, used in brain computing zzso results are almost completely zzso We show an increase with almost no cost (a rapid video zzso of speed of zzso by about 25 zzso The zzso data, which is a repetition of many independent signals in multiple channels, is very suitable for processing using the zzso processors included in the zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of this zzso and detected two main types of operations responsible of the processing bottleneck and taking almost zzso of computing time: zzso and zzso zzso By replacing function calls to basic linear algebra functions to the standard zzso routines provided by zzso manufacturers, it does not increase performance due to zzso kernel launch zzso Instead, we developed a zzso solution that, comparing with the original zzso and zzso versions, zzso a zzso increase of performance for the zzso zzso
