This study aims to develop an automatic zzso for risk assessment in patients suffering from zzso heart failure zzso The proposed zzso separates lower risk patients from higher risk ones, using standard long-term heart rate zzso zzso zzso Patients are labeled as lower or higher risk according to the New York Heart Association zzso zzso A retrospective analysis on two public zzso databases was performed, analyzing the data of 12 patients suffering from mild zzso zzso I and zzso labeled as lower risk, and 32 suffering from severe zzso zzso III and zzso labeled as higher zzso Only patients with a fraction of total zzso intervals zzso classified as zzso zzso intervals zzso higher than zzso were selected as eligible in order to have a satisfactory signal zzso zzso and zzso tree zzso was employed to develop the zzso A total of 30 higher risk and 11 lower risk patients were included in the zzso The proposed zzso trees achieved a sensitivity and a specificity rate of zzso and zzso respectively, in identifying higher risk zzso Finally, the rules obtained by zzso are comprehensible and consistent with the consensus showed by previous studies that depressed zzso is a useful tool for risk assessment in patients suffering from zzso
