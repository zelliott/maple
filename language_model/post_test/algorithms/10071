We carried out two experiments to test the relationship between real-time perception of structural change in stylistically unusual musical sounds, and perception of its affect zzso and zzso Computer music was used because of its zzso and our capacity to control it in ecologically appropriate zzso In experiment 1, thirteen participants zzso for musical training participated in tasks to detect zzso and changes in zzso Changes in affect occurred upon detection of zzso but not all zzso distinct segments conveyed distinct zzso Short segments followed by long segments led to greater changes in zzso and zzso at the point of zzso than vice zzso In experiment 2, zzso sound transitions were zzso Sixteen musicians performed the same affect task as in experiment 1, and a novel change in sound zzso Participants were slow to respond to a continuous transition, but quick to respond to instantaneous zzso zzso to literature on the perception of affect in more familiar music, the musician participants in experiment 2 differed more in their ratings of zzso than of zzso in spite of a strong correlation of zzso with the composition of the zzso These findings are discussed in relation to the positive zzso attributed to the more familiar sounds in both zzso
