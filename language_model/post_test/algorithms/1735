zzso based zzso methods are a useful tool for predicting protein functions from zzso interaction zzso zzso Although various zzso prediction zzso have been proposed, unsatisfactory prediction results have occurred on many zzso The purpose of this type of zzso is to predict functions of an zzso protein from the functions of those proteins that are similar to the zzso zzso zzso the prediction quality largely depends on how to select a set of proper proteins zzso a prediction zzso from which the functions of an zzso protein are predicted, and how to measure the similarity between zzso Another issue with existing zzso is they only believe the function prediction is a one-off zzso ignoring the fact that interactions amongst proteins are mutual and dynamic in terms of similarity when predicting zzso How to resolve these major issues to increase prediction quality remains a challenge in zzso zzso 

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to predict protein functions of zzso proteins zzso from a zzso zzso The zzso approach takes into account the mutual and dynamic features of protein interactions when predicting functions, and addresses the issues of protein similarity measurement and prediction domain selection by introducing into the prediction zzso a new semantic protein similarity and a method of selecting the zzso prediction zzso The new protein similarity is based on the zzso information carried by protein zzso The evaluations conducted on real protein interaction zzso demonstrated that the proposed zzso function prediction method outperformed other similar or zzso methods, and provided better prediction zzso 

The new protein similarity derived from zzso information of protein functions more reasonably reflects the intrinsic relationships among zzso and significant improvement to the prediction quality can occur through incorporation of mutual and dynamic features of protein interactions into the prediction zzso
