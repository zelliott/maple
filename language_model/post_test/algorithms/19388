The objective of this study was to evaluate a high spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso protocol for evaluation of zzso zzso system using highly accelerated parallel imaging at zzso zzso 

Ten patients (4 male, 6 zzso age, zzso zzso with suspected cerebrovascular disease were zzso studied on a zzso zzso T MR zzso After a single intravenous contrast injection, high spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso of the entire zzso arteries was performed followed immediately by zzso cerebral zzso zzso By using a fast zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso zzso ordering and highly accelerated parallel acquisition zzso factor 3 and 2 in phase and slice zzso direction, respectively), zzso cerebral zzso zzso was acquired with zzso dimensions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 24 zzso Image evaluation was performed independently by 2 zzso for overall image quality, presence of noise, and zzso The image quality of 30 zzso segments was evaluated in each subject using a 1 to 4 scoring zzso In 2 patients, zzso zzso was available for zzso zzso analysis of data was performed by using zzso rank sum test and zzso zzso 

All studies were determined to be of diagnostic image quality by both zzso The majority zzso of cerebral zzso segments were evaluated to be of diagnostic image quality zzso 3; range, zzso by both readers and with excellent zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso One zzso invading the superior zzso zzso and one superior zzso zzso zzso were detected subsequently confirmed by conventional zzso 

High spatial resolution zzso cerebral zzso zzso is feasible and zzso Using a zzso zzso T system combined with zzso array coils effectively supports highly accelerated parallel imaging, enabling subsequent acquisition of both high spatial resolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso after a single contrast injection without zzso the image zzso More extensive clinical studies are warranted to establish the range of applications and confirm the accuracy of this zzso
