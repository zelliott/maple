A loop zzso sequential algorithm, zzso was developed to match zzso zzso onto a scaffold for zzso design in zzso The zzso complexity of this zzso is zzso with respect to the number of active sites, the number of zzso zzso and the zzso iteration number of zzso coordinate descent zzso This matching zzso is independent of a zzso library that enables the zzso zzso to take any required zzso during the reaction zzso The zzso geometric parameters defined between functional groups of transition state zzso and the zzso zzso are continuously zzso to identify the accurate position of the zzso zzso are introduced for surrounding zzso which make the zzso take binding into account as early as during the matching zzso zzso of native zzso zzso sites was used as a benchmark to evaluate the novel zzso The calculation results for the test set show that the native zzso zzso sites were successfully identified and ranked within the top 10 designs for 7 of the 10 chemical zzso This indicates that the matching zzso has the potential to be used for designing industrial zzso for desired zzso
