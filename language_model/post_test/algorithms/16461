zzso of nuclear spins is gaining increasing interest as a tool for improving the zzso ratio of zzso and zzso While in principle, zzso samples are amenable to the same or similar experiments as are used in conventional zzso the large spin polarization may give rise to unexpected zzso Here, spontaneous zzso of signal was observed from zzso spin systems, which were zzso to negative spin temperature by dynamic nuclear polarization zzso An unexpected feature of these emissions is that, without any zzso zzso multiple beats arise that cannot be explained by the Bloch equations with radiation zzso However, we show that a simple modification to these zzso which takes into account an additional supply of zzso zzso from a zzso outside of the active detection region, can zzso describe the observed zzso The observed effect demonstrates that even well-known mechanisms of spin evolution can give rise to unexpected effects when working with zzso samples, which may need to be addressed through the development of new experimental zzso
