We present an efficient zzso for the structural alignment of zzso organic zzso The zzso has been developed for applications in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The method assumes one of the zzso the reference zzso to be presented in the zzso that it adopts inside the zzso zzso The second zzso the test zzso is considered to be flexible, and is assumed to be given in an arbitrary low-energy zzso zzso flexibility is modeled by zzso the test zzso into molecular fragments, such that ring systems are completely contained in a single zzso zzso of fragments and zzso angles of single bonds are taken from a small finite set, which depends on the zzso and bond, zzso The zzso zzso a distinguished base zzso of the test zzso onto a suitable region of the reference zzso and then zzso the remaining fragments of the test zzso in a zzso zzso During this process, a scoring function is zzso that encompasses bonding terms and terms accounting for zzso overlap as well as for similarity of chemical properties of both zzso The zzso has been implemented in the zzso zzso To validate the quality of the produced results, we have selected a number of examples for which the mutual zzso of two zzso is zzso given by the comparison of the binding zzso known from the crystal structures of their corresponding zzso zzso On more than two-thirds of the test examples the zzso produces zzso zzso of the predicted versus the observed zzso of the test zzso below zzso zzso The run time of the zzso on a single problem instance is a few minutes on a zzso zzso The overall goal of this research is to drastically reduce run times, while limiting the zzso of the model and the zzso to a tolerable zzso
