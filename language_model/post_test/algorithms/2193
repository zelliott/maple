This article describes a strategy to explore zzso diversity while incorporating drug motif knowledge into the design and selection of zzso for zzso zzso The process involves collecting from available electronic databases all those molecules that potentially could be zzso In this manner we have assembled five zzso databases, each containing one of the common functional groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso and secondary zzso The molecules in the databases are then subjected to fingerprint and cluster analysis using the zzso zzso and profiles of the compounds are calculated relating to molecular weight, zzso counts, and zzso bond zzso The cluster information and profiles of the molecules are stored back into the databases for similarity and diversity searches, and for profile zzso of zzso To apply drug motif knowledge to a selection an application to an zzso set is discussed, in which representatives of each cluster in the zzso database are compared with drug molecules in the Standard zzso File zzso in one of three ways to select drug zzso zzso for purchase or zzso
