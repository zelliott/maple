zzso zzso zzso is a presumed zzso factor that can suppress T cell activity, at least zzso through the repression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is thought to be associated with zzso diseases and/or other inflammatory zzso To investigate the association between single zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and allergic zzso we scanned the whole human zzso zzso including the promoter region, by direct sequencing of DNA from 32 zzso We identified seven zzso three of which zzso zzso and zzso were chosen for large sample size zzso zzso and to assess the zzso zzso of these zzso between controls and allergic zzso zzso We also investigated the relationships of each zzso with serum total zzso levels in allergic zzso patients, and compared the zzso of zzso constructed by these zzso between the two zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the human zzso gene might be associated with zzso to allergic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main zzso zzso also revealed a significant association with allergic zzso zzso However, no significant association was found between serum total zzso levels and the zzso of these zzso
