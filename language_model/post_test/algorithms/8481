zzso zzso images were made using the ACT 3 zzso which applies currents simultaneously to 32 zzso and measures the resulting zzso on those same zzso A reconstruction zzso was written for a three-dimensional cylinder having zzso in two or four zzso using current patterns that pass current among different planes of electrodes, as well as within each zzso We have previously reported useful vertical resolution by the use of added layers of zzso The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that zzso useful information can be obtained by examining zzso differences in three-dimensional zzso zzso changes throughout the cardiac cycle are seen to be markedly different at the heart compared to lung region, both above and beside zzso We formed zzso zzso each 3 zzso tall and 7 zzso wide and applied them to the zzso of an upright human subject in four horizontal zzso each row contained eight zzso During zzso cardiac activity was seen in all zzso With zzso zzso in the anterior of the lowest layers zzso but not in the upper zzso In the upper zzso zzso increased with zzso in many zzso These observations are consistent with the opposite changes in blood volume of the heart and lungs and the locations of these zzso This paper demonstrates the feasibility of producing and displaying zzso zzso three-dimensional images of the chest in real zzso
