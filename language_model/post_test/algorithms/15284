zzso the in zzso 3-D zzso of the zzso requires a zzso anatomical coordinate system zzso The purpose of this study was to develop an zzso to determine an zzso using the zzso unique zzso An zzso was automatically constructed that aligned the zzso zzso axis with the zzso vertical zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by registering all zzso and their associated zzso to a reference zzso The mean angle between the reference zzso zzso and each zzso axes was less than zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso Here, we presented an anatomical coordinate system that is independent of the zzso zzso zzso or orientation of the knee within the zzso
