zzso of zzso peak prominence, using the smoothing zzso and linear zzso analysis software developed by zzso have been shown to be reliable zzso of zzso in voice zzso Recently, the zzso Speech Laboratory zzso Kay zzso zzso New zzso has introduced zzso analysis as a component of that software zzso The zzso peak, in this instance, is calculated by the voice zzso analyzing the zzso sample by zzso the value of the peak from the apparent baseline zzso This study compares the ability of zzso peak values calculated from the zzso software to predict zzso reliably with that of the values produced by the smoothing zzso and linear zzso analysis of zzso The results of this study show that linear zzso analysis is an important step in calculating the zzso peak prominence, thus limiting the usefulness of software programs that do not employ this zzso
