zzso zzso or time series image zzso is important for image analysis in a wide range of zzso zzso of the zzso is commonly performed using local image information causing the segmented image to be locally smooth or zzso zzso A new spatial zzso method, incorporating zzso information, was developed and zzso 

Our spatial zzso method applies to feature space zzso in zzso images such as color images and MR image zzso The spatial zzso involves local edge properties, region boundary zzso as well as zzso zzso The method is implemented in a discrete zzso setting allowing fast zzso 

The method was tested on zzso zzso recordings from human kidney and brain in addition to simulated zzso zzso 

The proposed method successfully segment regions with both smooth and complex zzso shapes with a minimum of user zzso
