When accounting for structural fluctuations or measurement zzso a single rigid structure may not be sufficient to represent a zzso One approach to solve this problem is to represent the possible zzso as a discrete set of observed zzso an zzso In this work, we follow a different richer approach, and introduce a framework for zzso probability density functions in very high dimensions, and then apply it to represent ensembles of folded zzso This proposed approach combines techniques such as kernel density zzso maximum likelihood, zzso and zzso We present the underlying theoretical and zzso framework and apply it to artificial data and protein ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics zzso We compare the results with those obtained zzso illustrating the potential and advantages of this zzso
