The aim of this study was to assess zzso the degrading effect of zzso caused by beam zzso on the microscopic computerized zzso zzso zzso of an in zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso method was zzso with which the degrading effect of zzso zzso on certain parameters of the observed structure could be zzso zzso were carried out with zzso and zzso X-ray source, and a zzso method with a zzso zzso fit zzso was used in specific cases to correct the beam zzso zzso The virtual test object was a zzso of a tooth with an artificial zzso zzso 

For simulation with zzso X-ray source, the relative error of zzso depth and thickness zzso of the zzso layer was found to be zzso For zzso X-ray source, and omitting beam zzso zzso the relative error exceeded zzso After appropriate zzso zzso the relative error of the measurement could be reduced to zzso 

With the adjustment simulated in this study, zzso having zzso X-ray source resulted in the same level of error as with zzso source if the zzso method to correct the beam zzso was zzso The presented zzso method is a useful way to determine zzso zzso for other studies testing objects with different material and zzso
