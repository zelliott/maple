This paper introduces a three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso of the brain stem zzso based on fast zzso zzso The research is based on methods and theories of computer stereo vision, and by image information processing zzso pattern local search, registration and zzso for the zzso of the brain stem zzso were zzso We adopt zzso zzso edge detection and zzso image enhancement to extract contours of the zzso zzso The experimental results obtain the spatial structure information and zzso image of the brain stem zzso show spatial relationship between 14 pairs of zzso and zzso zzso parameters of each type of zzso zzso zzso This work is significant to zzso research and clinic zzso Furthermore, a software system named zzso is zzso
