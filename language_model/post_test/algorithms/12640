The zzso process zzso approaches to zzso zzso zzso methods and kernel techniques, which are developed for the purpose of small sample zzso Here we propose a zzso model and investigate it for the facial expression recognition in the Japanese female facial expression zzso By the strategy of zzso cross zzso the accuracy of the zzso zzso reaches zzso without any feature zzso Even when tested on all expressions of any particular zzso the zzso zzso trained by the other samples zzso some frequently used zzso zzso In order to survey the zzso of this novel method, the random trial of zzso cross zzso is repeated many times to provide an overview of recognition zzso The experimental results demonstrate a promising performance of this zzso
