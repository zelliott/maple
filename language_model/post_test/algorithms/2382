zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a method for flexible zzso of high zzso zzso The model takes the form of an expansion in product zzso basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one zzso degree and knot zzso are automatically determined by the zzso This procedure is motivated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and shares its ability to capture high order zzso However, it has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few zzso and produces continuous models with continuous zzso In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with different multivariable zzso This paper summarizes the basic zzso algorithm, as well as extensions for zzso response, zzso zzso zzso variables and missing zzso It presents tips on interpreting the output of the standard zzso zzso of zzso and provides an example of zzso applied to a set of clinical zzso
