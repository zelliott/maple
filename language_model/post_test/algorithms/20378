A new protocol is proposed which allows the spatial registration of a prosthetic hip stem solid model with the CT data set of the host bone collected zzso using a limited number of reference landmarks taken from zzso zzso Although based on well know zzso such as the Single Value zzso this method opens new possibilities to the three-dimensional zzso of operated zzso In a preliminary experiment based on a synthetic human zzso replica the proposed protocol achieved a global accuracy of zzso zzso zzso mean square error of the zzso location of ten control zzso using only six CT zzso zzso This methodology allows an accurate three-dimensional zzso of operated bone which have been implanted with high density metallic devices which produce relevant zzso in zzso CT zzso
