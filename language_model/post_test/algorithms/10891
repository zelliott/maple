The majority of the existing models describing the behavior of zzso ultrasound contrast agents consider single, isolated zzso suspended in infinite zzso The behavior of a zzso population is predicted by summing the results for single zzso and ignoring multiple scattering zzso The aim of this investigation is to determine the significance of multiple scattering in zzso populations and establish whether an alternative approach is zzso In the first part of the work, linear models are derived to identify approximately the conditions under which multiple scattering may be zzso A zzso model for sound propagation in a zzso suspension then is developed and used to examine multiple scattering at higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are described for two different types of zzso suspension zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to ascertain whether or not multiple scattering may be observed zzso The results from the simulation work indicate that multiple scattering effects would be discernible at moderate zzso zzso zzso such as may be present in zzso The effect upon zzso in the suspension would be zzso however, only if the population contained a sufficient proportion of relatively large zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso excited at their resonance zzso This also is found to be the case zzso These findings may have important implications for the characterization of ultrasound contrast agents and their use in quantitative diagnostic zzso
