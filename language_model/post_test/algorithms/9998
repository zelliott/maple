We exhibit a remarkable zzso between the dynamics of an intermittent zzso map and the electronic transport properties zzso via the scattering zzso of a crystal defined on a double zzso zzso This strict zzso reveals in detail the nature of the mobility edge normally studied near (not zzso the zzso transition in electronic zzso We provide an zzso expression for the zzso as a function of the system size that at the transition obeys a zzso zzso This zzso as zzso zzso or few and far between large spike zzso according to different kinds of boundary zzso
