zzso analysis is one of the most effective approaches for studying mathematical models of zzso zzso A stiff zzso zzso has been developed for sensitivity analysis using a direct sensitivity zzso zzso sparse zzso and zzso calculations of the coupled system (the original model equations and the sensitivity zzso have been implemented in the freely available software package zzso The accuracy and efficiency of the zzso are tested extensively on the complex zzso protein zzso zzso zzso model of zzso and zzso Both zzso concentration and zzso sensitivity zzso are measured using several integration zzso The method is shown to perform sensitivity analysis in a manner that is cost effective with moderate zzso The error control strategy between the zzso direct method and the zzso with direct method is discussed and their zzso zzso are zzso The method is used to zzso the positive feedback loop within the zzso signal zzso zzso
