In this paper, a zzso model of episodic hormone zzso is used to zzso the effect of the sampling rate on the frequency of zzso that can be detected by objective computer methods in time series of plasma hormone zzso zzso times of zzso zzso are modeled as zzso events, with zzso intervals described by zzso zzso In this way, a variety of zzso patterns, ranging from zzso events to periodic zzso can be zzso The notion of visible and invisible zzso is introduced and the relationship between true zzso frequency and mean visible pulse frequency is zzso zzso It is shown that a given visible pulse frequency can zzso to two distinct true zzso In order to compensate for the zzso zzso an zzso based on the analysis of the original series and its zzso zzso is proposed and the derived computer program is tested on simulated and clinical zzso
