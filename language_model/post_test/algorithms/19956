In framework of traditional zzso zzso there are only three parameters available to tune, as a result, performance of the resulting system is always zzso As for Cartesian regulation of robot zzso with uncertain zzso zzso a scheme of zzso controllers with zzso integral action is zzso Compare with traditional zzso zzso the zzso integration is employed in the proposed zzso zzso in which more parameters are available to be zzso It provides additional flexibility for controller characteristics and tuning as well, and hence makes better transient zzso In addition, zzso stability of the resulting zzso system is zzso All signals in the system are bounded when zzso disturbances and measurement noises are zzso zzso example demonstrates the superior transient performance of the proposed controller over the traditional one via Cartesian space zzso manipulation of zzso robotic zzso
