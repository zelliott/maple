zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso requires synchronization to overcome motion related artifacts caused by the heart's zzso and the chest wall movements during zzso Achieving good image quality zzso combining cardiac and respiratory gating to produce, in real time, a trigger signal that sets off the consecutive image zzso This guarantees that the data collection always starts at the same point of the cardiac cycle during the exhalation zzso In this paper, we present a real time zzso for zzso a zzso trigger signal using only one, adequately placed, zzso zzso First, an zzso calculation phase, based on zzso decomposition, is run to zzso an optimal zzso zzso This filter is used, afterwards, to accomplish R peak zzso while a low pass filtering process allows the retrieval of the zzso zzso The zzso synchronization capabilities were assessed during mice cardiac zzso sessions employing three different imaging zzso and three specific zzso zzso The prominent image enhancement gave a good proof of correct zzso zzso detection was almost flawless for all zzso As for the zzso cycle retrieval it was evaluated on contaminated simulated signals, which were artificially modulated to imitate zzso The results were quite zzso
