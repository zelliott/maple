On the basis of a formal zzso with the zzso moments, zzso definitions are proposed for the zzso of both the zzso and the zzso component of zzso zzso fields at the focal plane of a zzso optical zzso The beam zzso of the whole field is also zzso The zzso beam size is thus associated with the overall spatial structure of the zzso The zzso definitions are applied to an illustrative example, which enables us to show that, at the focal plane, the power contained within a circle whose radius is given by the proposed beam zzso represents the main part of the total zzso
