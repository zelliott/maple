A rapid calculation method of zzso zzso zzso using zzso table and zzso plane zzso methods toward three-dimensional zzso display is zzso The method consists of two steps: the first step is the calculation of a zzso that is placed between a zzso object and a zzso In the second step, we obtain an zzso or zzso zzso to execute zzso calculation from the zzso to the zzso The first step of the previous zzso method was difficult to calculate in real-time due to the calculation zzso In this paper, in order to obtain greater zzso we apply a zzso table method to the first zzso In addition, we use a graphics processing unit in the second zzso The total zzso complexity is dramatically reduced in comparison with conventional zzso zzso We show optical reconstructions from a zzso zzso zzso generated by about zzso object points over 10 frames per zzso
