The ability to provide the best treatment for breast cancer depends on establishing whether or not the cancer has spread to the zzso zzso under the zzso Conventional assessment requires tissue zzso preparation, and expert microscopic zzso In this study, elastic scattering zzso zzso is used to interrogate excised zzso with zzso broadband zzso and collection of the zzso zzso Multiple zzso are taken from 139 excised zzso zzso containing zzso in 68 patients, and spectral analysis is performed using a combination of principal component analysis and linear zzso analysis to correlate the zzso with conventional zzso The data are divided into training and test zzso In test sets containing zzso from only normal zzso and zzso with complete replacement by cancer, zzso detects the zzso from zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity zzso zzso In test sets that included normal zzso and zzso with partial as well as complete replacement by cancer, zzso detects the zzso with cancer with an average sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso These results are comparable to those from conventional touch imprint zzso and frozen section zzso but do not require an expert pathologist for zzso With automation of the technique, results could be made available almost zzso zzso is a promising technique for the zzso accurate, and straightforward detection of zzso in excised zzso zzso zzso
