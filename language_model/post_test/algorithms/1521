zzso is a safe and inexpensive method for accurate left zzso volume zzso However, accuracy of zzso is limited by the requirement of geometric assumptions and volume zzso zzso zzso is diminished by erroneous image plane zzso which is due to the necessity of standardized reference zzso The degree of variation can influence clinical decision zzso zzso has overcome those zzso Volume zzso is performed without the need of geometric zzso zzso zzso or reference zzso The shape of a zzso is defined by acquired data, not by calculated zzso Since the recent development of sophisticated zzso and software techniques the method can be zzso under clinical zzso For data acquisition zzso planes are acquired either in a random or in a sequential zzso For random acquisition the zzso is positioned at various acoustic windows at the zzso wall and spatial orientation of the corresponding plane is localized by a spark gap zzso By this way zzso zzso zzso images of the left zzso are zzso The spatial position of the planes is displayed by lines in a zzso zzso view, each representing a zzso of zzso When zzso planes are acquired in a sequential manner, mostly zzso scanning is zzso Here, multiple zzso views of the left zzso are acquired during zzso and zzso gated rotation of the zzso over a span of 180 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
