We propose a new approach to register the subject image with the template by leveraging a set of training images that are zzso to the zzso We argue that, if zzso in the subject and the training images share similar local appearances and zzso they may have common correspondence in the zzso In this way, we learn the sparse representation of certain subject zzso to reveal several similar candidate zzso in the training zzso Each selected training candidate can bridge the correspondence from the subject zzso to the template space, thus predicting the transformation associated with the subject zzso at the confidence level that relates to the learned sparse zzso Following this strategy, we first predict transformations at selected key points, and retain multiple predictions on each key point (instead of allowing a single correspondence zzso Then, by utilizing all key points and their predictions with varying zzso we zzso reconstruct the dense transformation field that zzso the subject to the zzso For zzso and zzso speed, we zzso the zzso protocol above into a zzso zzso In the final, we efficiently refine our estimated transformation field via existing registration zzso We apply our method to registering brain MR images, and conclude that the proposed method is competent to improve registration performances in terms of time cost as well as zzso
