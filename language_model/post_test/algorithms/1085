Although zzso zzso zzso zzso have been the subject of many studies, a clear identification of the zzso characteristics of a zzso zzso network is still zzso zzso we present a method for the extraction of a new zzso namely the mean induced potential zzso which allows the identification of the zzso characteristics of induced zzso zzso The zzso calculation was applied to the zzso component of the zzso rhythm in order to obtain a zzso zzso induced potential zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the zzso bursts seen after median nerve stimulation and zzso finger movements were extracted by means of current source density reconstruction and synchronization zzso A cortical network including the zzso primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the zzso zzso zzso was found to generate the zzso zzso and the various activated areas were found to be highly zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a zzso cortical network in the human zzso region whose constituents zzso zzso
