To build new zzso for zzso of comatose cardiac arrest patients using clinical examination, and investigate whether therapeutic zzso influences the value of the clinical zzso 

From 2000 to 2007, 500 consecutive patients in zzso coma were zzso zzso 200 of whom were zzso zzso zzso was determined by modified Rankin zzso zzso score at 6 months, with zzso indicating good zzso The clinical examination was performed on days 0, 1, 3 and 7 zzso and clinical variables analyzed for importance in zzso of zzso A zzso and zzso tree analysis zzso was used to develop a zzso zzso 

Good outcome was achieved in zzso of zzso In zzso analysis, motor response was often chosen as a root zzso and spontaneous eye movements, zzso zzso eye opening and zzso zzso were often chosen as splitting zzso Over zzso of patients with absent or zzso motor response on day 3 achieved a good outcome, as did 2 patients with zzso status zzso The odds of achieving a good outcome were lower in patients who suffered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but some still achieved good zzso The absence of zzso and zzso zzso on day 3 remained highly reliable for predicting poor outcome, regardless of therapeutic zzso zzso 

The clinical examination remains central to zzso in comatose cardiac arrest patients in the modern zzso Future studies should incorporate the clinical examination along with modern technology for accurate zzso
