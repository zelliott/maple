Multiple alignments of proteins are an effective way of identifying zzso zzso acids that provide clues to functional relationships among zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso acids found at each position in a sequence motif can provide a basis for understanding the structural and functional constraints at each zzso Distribution of information across a motif has been used zzso but the zzso nature of the analysis has limited its zzso 

Here, we introduce a quantitative measure of zzso acid sequence diversity zzso that has a simple, intuitive zzso zzso as a measure of sequence conservation or variation, is inextricably linked to the probability of selecting identical pairs from a zzso We demonstrate its utility through the analysis of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso light zzso signal zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides a simple means to generate hypotheses concerning the contribution of individual zzso to the functional and evolutionary relationships among zzso 

Access to zzso software is available at zzso zzso
