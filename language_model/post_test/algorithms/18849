zzso and functional zzso of the large and growing database of zzso sequences is a major problem in modern zzso zzso structure prediction by detecting remote zzso to known structures is a well-established and successful zzso zzso However, the broad spectrum of evolutionary change that accompanies the divergence of close zzso to become remote zzso cannot easily be captured with a single zzso Recent advances to tackle this problem have involved the use of multiple zzso zzso available on the zzso Here we demonstrate how such ensembles of zzso can be designed in-house under controlled conditions and permit significant improvements in recognition by using a concept taken from protein loop zzso and applying it to the general problem of zzso zzso We have developed a stringent test that simulates the situation where a protein sequence of interest is submitted to multiple different zzso and not one of these zzso can make a confident zzso correct zzso A method of zzso prediction zzso that exploits the benefits of a controlled environment for the component methods was zzso At zzso precision or higher, zzso identified zzso of all correct zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the individual test query proteins could be accurately zzso In comparison to the improvement that the single best fold recognition zzso zzso to zzso has over zzso this represents a zzso increase in the number of correct zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in the number of accurately zzso zzso It has been well zzso in fold zzso other zzso applications, and in many other areas, that ensemble predictions generally are superior in accuracy to any of the component individual zzso However there is a paucity of information as to why the ensemble methods are superior and indeed this has never been systematically addressed in fold zzso Here we show that the source of ensemble power stems from noise reduction in filtering out false positive zzso The results indicate greater coverage of sequence space and improved model quality, which can consequently lead to a reduction in the experimental workload of structural zzso zzso
