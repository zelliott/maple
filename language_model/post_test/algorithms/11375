This paper surveys modeling approaches for studying the evolution of gene regulatory networks zzso Modeling of the design or zzso of zzso has become increasingly common in zzso and medical biology, as a means of zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso and the overall dynamic motifs of zzso Drawing from developments in zzso zzso zzso a number of groups are now using simulations to study how zzso evolve, both for comparative zzso and to uncover general principles of evolutionary zzso Such work can generally be termed evolution in zzso zzso to these zzso approaches, a now well-established field of computer science is zzso zzso zzso in which highly efficient zzso techniques are inspired from evolutionary zzso In surveying biological simulation approaches, we discuss the considerations that must be taken with respect to: zzso the precision and zzso of the data zzso are the simulations for very close matches to anatomical data, or are they for more general exploration of evolutionary zzso zzso the level of detail to model (we proceed from zzso evolution of simple zzso interactions to zzso evolution at the DNA sequence zzso zzso to what degree is it important to include the zzso cellular zzso and zzso the efficiency of zzso With respect to the latter, we argue that developments in computer science zzso offer the means to perform more complete simulation searches, and will lead to more comprehensive biological zzso
