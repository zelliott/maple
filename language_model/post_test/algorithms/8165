zzso network models zzso are zzso models that have demonstrated in many previous studies their abilities to capture overall the important internal motions, with comparisons having been made against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have become an increasingly important tool and have been widely used to comprehend protein zzso function, and even zzso zzso However, reliance upon an arbitrary zzso distance to zzso the range of interactions has presented a drawback for these models, because the optimal zzso values can differ somewhat from protein to protein and can lead to zzso such as some zzso in the order of the normal modes when applied to structures that differ only zzso Here, we have replaced the requirement for a zzso distance and introduced the more physical concept of inverse power dependence for the zzso with a set of elastic network models that are zzso with the distance zzso zzso For small fluctuations about the native forms, the power dependence is the inverse square, but for larger zzso the power dependence may become inverse 6th or 7th zzso These models maintain and enhance the simplicity and zzso of the original zzso and at the same time yield better predictions of zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso and of the directions of zzso zzso Thus, these zzso zzso can be models of choice whenever elastic network models are zzso
