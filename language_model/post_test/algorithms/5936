Although most current applications of the zzso element method are formulated for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be modeled with zzso elements using the well-known coordinate transformation where one coordinate axis is scaled by the square root of the zzso zzso If the standard zzso solution for steady zzso flow to a well is used with this coordinate zzso the resulting solution correctly models the far field but it does not meet the constant head boundary condition at the well zzso This could be a significant shortcoming if you are interested in the flow field close to the well or want to estimate the head at the pumping zzso A new solution for two-dimensional steady flow to a well in an zzso domain is zzso This solution zzso the governing equations exactly and meets the constant head boundary condition at the well radius zzso It was derived using a zzso zzso
