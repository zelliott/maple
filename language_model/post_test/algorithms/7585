The zzso zzso model has been known as an effective method for large-scale image search and zzso Recent work shows that the performance of the model can be further improved by using the embedding zzso While different zzso of the zzso model and embedding method have been developed, less effort has been made to discover their underlying working zzso In this paper, we systematically investigate the image search performance variation with respect to a few factors of the zzso model, and study how to employ the embedding method to further improve the image search zzso zzso we zzso several observations based on the experiments on zzso zzso To validate these observations in a real image search, we propose an effective and efficient image search zzso in which the zzso model and embedding method are jointly zzso in terms of effectiveness and efficiency by following these zzso Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that it is beneficial to employ these observations to develop an image search algorithm, and the proposed image search scheme zzso zzso art methods in both effectiveness and zzso
