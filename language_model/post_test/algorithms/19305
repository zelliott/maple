To better understand how the avian zzso zzso and zzso transport properties affect the urine concentrating mechanism zzso an inverse problem was solved for a mathematical model of the quail zzso In this model, a zzso zzso decreasing population distribution of tubes, as a function of zzso zzso was used to represent the zzso of zzso which reach to varying levels along the avian zzso zzso A measure of concentrating mechanism efficiency - the ratio of the zzso zzso rate zzso to the total zzso active transport rate zzso - was zzso by varying a set of parameters within bounds suggested by zzso zzso Those parameters include zzso transport properties of zzso zzso length of the zzso enlargement of the descending limb zzso DL and collecting duct zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso length of the cortical thick ascending zzso central core zzso zzso and population distribution of zzso of zzso and of CDs along the zzso zzso By selecting zzso values that increase urine flow rate zzso maintaining a sufficiently high zzso zzso ratio zzso and that reduce zzso the zzso zzso identified a set of zzso values that increased efficiency by approximately zzso above zzso zzso Thus, higher efficiency can be achieved by increasing urine flow rather than increasing zzso The zzso also identified a set of parameters that reduced efficiency by approximately zzso via the production of a urine having zzso zzso at zzso zzso In separate studies, maximum efficiency was evaluated as selected parameters were varied over large zzso zzso cones were found to be more efficient than longer ones, and an optimal loop of zzso distribution was found that is consistent with experimental zzso
