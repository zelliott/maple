zzso tests that can be used in place of liver biopsy to diagnose zzso have major zzso They either leave a significant proportion of patients without a definitive diagnosis or produce inaccurate zzso Moreover, the performance of these tests is lower in zzso C virus zzso zzso Against this background, we examined the utility of serum zzso zzso 2 zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso 1 zzso zzso in combination with routine clinical data to predict zzso in zzso zzso 

Patients with a liver biopsy who had not received zzso therapy were included in the zzso A model including variables independently associated with zzso was zzso zzso accuracy was determined by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso Positive zzso and negative zzso zzso values were zzso 

zzso patients were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso count and zzso were zzso of significant zzso zzso and zzso zzso A score constructed using these variables yielded an zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso and excluded zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso Thirty-one patients zzso were correctly diagnosed using these zzso with four zzso incorrect zzso zzso was excluded with a certainty of zzso and diagnosed with a probability of zzso Two zzso of 12 patients were zzso as having zzso The zzso to zzso count index and zzso levels were zzso applied to detect zzso zzso patients zzso were identified with this approach, with six zzso zzso 

zzso levels can be used in combination with zzso and zzso count to aid the diagnosis of liver zzso in zzso zzso
