Factor based methods for absorbed dose or monitor unit calculations are often based on separate data sets for open and wedged zzso The determination of basic beam parameters can be rather time zzso unless equivalent square methods are zzso When considering irregular wedged beams shaped with a zzso zzso zzso methods for zzso zzso zzso output ratios or wedge factors as a function of field size and shape, become even more zzso A practical method is presented to derive wedged output ratios in air zzso for any zzso field and for any irregular zzso shaped zzso This method was based on open field output ratios in air zzso for a field with the same zzso setting, and a relation zzso between zzso and zzso The relation zzso can be determined from measured output ratios in air for a few open and wedged fields including the maximum wedged field zzso The function zzso and its zzso were dependent on wedge angle and treatment head design, zzso they were different for internal and external zzso The proposed method was tested for zzso wedged fields on three zzso with internal wedges zzso zzso zzso and two zzso with external wedges zzso For zzso regular beams the average zzso between calculated and measured zzso zzso zzso ratios was zzso for external wedges and about zzso for internal zzso zzso zzso of zzso were obtained for zzso zzso fields on the GE and zzso zzso with an internal zzso The same accuracy was achieved for irregular zzso shaped wedged beams on the zzso with zzso and internal wedges zzso and zzso with an average zzso zzso zzso for the fields zzso The proposed method to determine output ratios in air for wedged beams from output ratios of open beams, combined with equivalent square approaches, can be easily integrated in empirical or zzso methods for monitor unit zzso
