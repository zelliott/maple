We have developed a computer program zzso and an zzso for the identification of zzso sites of human zzso zzso The zzso is based on a linear zzso function zzso trained to discriminate real zzso signal regions from the other regions of human genes possessing the zzso sequence which is most likely zzso As the parameters of zzso various significant contextual characteristics of sequences surrounding zzso signals were zzso An accuracy of method has been estimated on a set of 131 zzso regions and zzso regions of human genes having the zzso zzso When the threshold was set to predict zzso of zzso regions correctly, specificity of 51% and correlation zzso of zzso had been zzso The precision of this approach is better than for the other methods and has been tested on a larger data zzso zzso can be used through World Wide Web (at zzso Home zzso zzso zzso zzso or by sending files with zzso human sequences to the University of Houston or Weizmann Institute of Science e-mail zzso
