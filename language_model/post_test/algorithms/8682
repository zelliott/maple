Steady flow of an zzso zzso fluid through a zzso zzso rigid channel was zzso analyzed by solving the three-dimensional zzso zzso The upstream Reynolds number ranged from 100 to zzso The zzso was symmetrical with a branch angle of 60 zzso and the area ratio of the daughter to the mother vessel was zzso The zzso procedure zzso a coordinate transformation and a control volume approach to zzso the equations to finite difference form and incorporated the zzso zzso in performing the zzso The predicted zzso pattern was in qualitative agreement with experimental zzso available in the zzso The results also showed the effect of secondary flow which can not be predicted using previous two-dimensional zzso A region of reversed flow was observed near the outer wall of the branch except for the case of the lowest Reynolds zzso zzso trajectory was examined and it was found that no fluid particles remained within the zzso zzso The zzso stress was calculated on both the inner and the outer wall of the zzso The largest wall zzso stress, located in the vicinity of the zzso of the branch, was of the same order of magnitude as the level that can cause damage to the vessel wall as reported in a recent zzso
