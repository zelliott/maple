A complete texture image retrieval system includes two zzso texture feature extraction and similarity zzso Specifically, similarity measurement is a key problem for texture image retrieval zzso In this paper, we present an effective similarity measurement zzso The zzso vision texture database, the zzso texture database, and the zzso texture database were used to verify the retrieval performance of the proposed similarity measurement zzso zzso complex zzso transform and zzso zzso transform were used to extract texture zzso Experimental results show that the proposed similarity measurement method achieves better retrieval performance than some existing similarity measurement zzso
