It is often desirable to perform digital image analyses on sections prepared for human zzso zzso nuclear zzso texture analysis or three-dimensional reconstructions using sections requiring human zzso of structures of zzso Unfortunately such analyses are often more effective using zzso with less complex zzso Here an automated selective zzso method for digital images is zzso The method separates an image into its red, green and blue and zzso zzso and intensity zzso A mask of stained tissue is prepared by automatic zzso zzso A single weighted zzso zzso channel is then added to each of the three primary zzso channels separately by an zzso zzso that adjusts the weights to give minimum zzso within the zzso The modified red, green and blue channels are then zzso This method is automatic requiring no zzso of stain zzso or special zzso The method is demonstrated to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso sections (and a separate zzso image can be derived from zzso An image of isolated brown reaction product is produced with zzso preparations zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso zzso and other common zzso may be separated into their components with modifications of the same zzso Although other methods for zzso separation do exist zzso spectral pathology and zzso zzso these require special apparatus or precise zzso and zzso of pure dye zzso zzso The present method of digital stain separation is fully automatic with no such zzso
