zzso sequencing technology provides us with vast amounts of sequence zzso It is efficient and cheaper than previous sequencing technologies, but deep zzso of entire samples is still zzso zzso sensible strategies for choosing zzso of samples to sequence are zzso Here we describe an zzso for selection of a zzso of an existing sample if one has either of two possible goals in mind: maximizing the number of new zzso sites that are zzso or improving the efficiency with which the remaining zzso individuals can have their types zzso at newly discovered zzso We then describe a variation on our zzso that is more focused on detecting rarer zzso We demonstrate the performance of our zzso using simulated data and data from the 1000 zzso zzso
