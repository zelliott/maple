We propose a suite of novel zzso for image analysis of protein expression images obtained from zzso zzso These zzso are a zzso zzso for protein spot zzso and an zzso for matching protein spots from two corresponding images for differential expression zzso The proposed zzso zzso employs the watershed zzso zzso analysis, and distance transform to locate the zzso and to extract the regions of the proteins zzso The proposed spot matching zzso is an integration of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso method is first used to find corresponding pairs of protein spots satisfying the local zzso and overlapping zzso The matching energy function based on local structure zzso image zzso and spatial constraints is then formulated and zzso Our new zzso suite has been extensively tested on synthetic and actual zzso gel images from various biological experiments, and in quantitative comparisons with zzso Platinum the proposed zzso exhibit better spot detection and spot zzso
