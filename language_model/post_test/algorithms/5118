Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applying genetic zzso zzso in dynamic zzso Inspired by the complementary and dominance mechanisms in nature, a zzso zzso zzso has been proposed for dynamic zzso problems zzso In this paper, an important operator in zzso zzso the zzso mapping zzso zzso is further investigated to improve the zzso and zzso of zzso in dynamic zzso In the improved zzso two different zzso zzso operators, where the mapping probability of each zzso in the zzso string is calculated through the statistical information of the distribution of zzso in the corresponding gene locus over the population, are effectively combined according to an zzso zzso learning zzso In addition, an zzso dominant replacement zzso which can zzso accept inferior zzso is also introduced into the proposed zzso to enhance the diversity level of the zzso Experimental results on a series of dynamic problems generated from several stationary benchmark problems show that the proposed zzso is a good zzso for zzso
