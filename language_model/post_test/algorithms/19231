This paper reports the experimental and the zzso techniques that were specifically developed to provide dose response data for a new method of beta zzso which is reported in an accompanying article zzso The specific experimental techniques consist of setting up, zzso and obtaining zzso and resolution corrections for a zzso beta zzso The zzso techniques involve zzso adapting a zzso Carlo electron transport computer code to use measured beta energy zzso as input data and zzso using the code to calculate the energy deposition of these zzso of electrons in a slab of zzso The energy deposition of zzso electrons incident on the slab is also taken into zzso zzso which were developed to calculate the energy deposited by photons in zzso are used to derive a theoretical value for the zzso response zzso zzso This factor compares well to the zzso derived result which was obtained by exposing zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso
