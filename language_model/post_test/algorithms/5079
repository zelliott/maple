The zzso has been a convenient choice in response time zzso on test zzso However, motivated by a zzso of the Medical College Admission Test where the zzso model violated the zzso zzso the possibilities of the broader class of zzso transformations for response time zzso are zzso After an introduction and an outline of a broader framework for zzso responses and response times zzso the performance of a zzso normal model for describing response times is investigated using simulation studies and a real data zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso information zzso zzso is developed that allows for comparing model fit between models with different transformation zzso zzso an enhanced description of the shape of the response time zzso its application in an educational measurement context is discussed at zzso
