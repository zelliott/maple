The question of how the structure of a zzso network affects its functionality has gained a lot of attention in zzso However, the vast majority of the studies on zzso relationships consider few types of network structures and assess limited numbers of structural zzso In this in zzso study, we employ a wide diversity of network zzso and search among many possibilities the aspects of structure that have the greatest effect on the network zzso The network activity is simulated using two zzso models, where the zzso are activated by noisy fluctuation of the membrane potential and their connections are described by chemical zzso models, and statistics on the number and quality of the emergent network bursts are collected for each network zzso We apply a prediction framework to the obtained data in order to find out the most relevant aspects of network zzso In this zzso zzso that use different sets of zzso measures are trained to estimate the activity properties, such as burst count or burst zzso of the zzso The performances of these zzso are compared with each zzso We show that the best performance in prediction of activity properties for networks with sharp zzso distribution is obtained when the prediction is based on zzso zzso By contrast, for networks with broad zzso distribution, the maximum zzso of the connectivity graph gives the most accurate zzso The results shown for small zzso see zzso networks hold with few exceptions when different zzso models, different choices of zzso population and different average degrees are zzso We confirm our conclusions using larger zzso see zzso networks as zzso Our findings reveal the relevance of different aspects of network structure from the viewpoint of network zzso and our zzso method could serve as a general framework for zzso studies in zzso
