zzso testing by coronary CT zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained on zzso scanners may be needed to diagnose coronary artery disease in zzso zzso We have developed an automated technique for zzso registration and demonstrate its utility for improved zzso zzso by guiding the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso registration of zzso left zzso zzso surfaces with zzso coronary trees was accomplished by zzso zzso of zzso differences between zzso zzso volumes and zzso zzso zzso Studies of 35 sequential patients zzso zzso mean age, 67 zzso 12 zzso with zzso coronary zzso zzso and available results of the invasive coronary zzso performed within 3 zzso were zzso zzso zzso coronary vessels and zzso slices were extracted and fused with quantitative zzso results mapped on zzso surfaces and zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso images and extracted trees were used to correct the zzso contours and to adjust the standard vascular region definitions for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and coronary zzso had the success rate of zzso as assessed zzso the average errors were zzso zzso zzso zzso in translation and zzso zzso zzso degrees in rotation on stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso in translation and zzso zzso zzso degrees in rotation on zzso zzso vascular region definition was adjusted in 17 studies, and zzso contours were adjusted in 11 studies using zzso zzso images as a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, compared with standard zzso analysis, resulted in improved area under the zzso zzso zzso for the detection of right coronary artery zzso and left zzso artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso P zzso zzso 

Software image zzso of zzso coronary zzso and zzso obtained on separate scanners can be performed rapidly and automatically, allowing zzso zzso and vascular territory adjustment on zzso for improved quantitative zzso zzso
