This chapter describes the development of a zzso zzso digital imaging system based on a zzso zzso and transmitted light zzso and a cooled zzso device zzso zzso The three main parts of this imaging system are Nikon zzso zzso zzso zzso cooled zzso camera, and zzso digital imaging zzso This chapter presents various design criteria for the instrument and describes the major features of the microscope zzso cooled zzso camera and the zzso digital imaging zzso The Nikon zzso upright microscope can produce high resolution images for both zzso and transmitted light zzso without switching the objective or moving the zzso The functional aspects of the microscope zzso can be considered in terms of the imaging zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the focus control, and the zzso isolation zzso This instrument is somewhat specialized for zzso and zzso studies, and it is also zzso to a variety of problems in cellular imaging, including tracking proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein in live zzso The instrument is also valuable for zzso the assembly dynamics of individual zzso zzso (labeled by zzso zzso to zzso with the dynamics of zzso of the zzso zzso (labeled with zzso and the dynamics of the cell zzso (by differential interference zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This imaging system also plays an important role in the analysis of zzso zzso in the powerful zzso genetic system zzso zzso
