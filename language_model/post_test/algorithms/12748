We present a robust 3-D zzso zzso tracking system designed to follow the upper limb of stroke survivors during zzso zzso This system fits a zzso model of the arm to sequences of images taken from multiple zzso The arm model defines shapes and colors of limbs and limb zzso that are more or less zzso We demonstrate that the system is 1) robust to cluttered scenes and temporary zzso 2) accurate relative to a commercial motion capture device, and 3) capable of capturing zzso that correlate with concurrent measures of zzso limb zzso To evaluate the zzso system, the functional motion of seven stroke survivors was measured zzso with the zzso system and a commercial motion capture zzso In addition, functional motion was assessed by an expert using the zzso Assessment zzso and related to recorded zzso Standard zzso of differences in measured elbow angles between systems was zzso zzso in hand zzso estimates was zzso zzso Several statistics, moreover, correlated strongly with zzso zzso Standard zzso in shoulder zzso had a significant correlation zzso with zzso score below zzso when measured with all zzso
