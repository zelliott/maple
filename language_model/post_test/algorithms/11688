The risks and costs of zzso are a great concern in the area of pediatric spine surgery, because it is a zzso procedure with a high risk for zzso zzso determining the zzso of zzso in this patient population is an important first step and has the potential to improve upon the current approaches to reducing zzso zzso In this study, we reveal several zzso of zzso in a pediatric patient population undergoing spine zzso In turn, we present a general rule of thumb zzso of zzso for gauging zzso risk, thus enhancing the zzso approach to avoiding zzso in certain clinical zzso 

This study was conducted to determine the main factors of zzso in a population of pediatric patients undergoing zzso zzso The goal was to present an zzso for zzso the true risk of zzso for various patient groups that would highlight patients zzso high zzso for zzso This is especially important in light of the various risks associated with undergoing a zzso as well as the costs involved in maintaining and disposing of zzso blood zzso 

This is a retrospective review of a group of children who underwent zzso surgery between 1988 and 1995 at an academic zzso 

A total of 290 patients were analyzed in this study, of which 63 were zzso and 227 were zzso 

No outcomes measures were used in this zzso 

A retrospective review of 290 patients presenting to our institution for zzso surgery was conducted, with a focus on zzso data related to zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso were used to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis identified many factors that were associated with the risk of zzso However, it is clear that several of these factors are dependent on each other, obscuring the true issues driving zzso zzso We used zzso analysis to control for the various zzso zzso of zzso Our zzso zzso model suggested that the type of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were the main zzso of zzso risk for our zzso 

The main risk factors of zzso were used to formulate a simple algorithm, which can be used to zzso zzso risk and to guide efforts to avoid zzso in children undergoing spinal zzso Given a zzso baseline risk for zzso our zzso of zzso indicates that each risk factor approximately doubles the chance of zzso whereas the administration of zzso human zzso roughly halves the risk of zzso
