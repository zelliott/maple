We propose in this paper a computer zzso posture recognition method for home monitoring of the zzso The proposed system performs human detection prior to the posture zzso posture recognition is performed only on a human zzso The human detection approach has been designed to be robust to different environmental zzso Thus, posture is analyzed with simple and efficient features that are not designed to manage constraints related to the environment but only designed to describe human zzso The posture recognition method, based on fuzzy logic, identifies four zzso postures and is robust to variation in the distance between the camera and the person, and to the person's zzso With an accuracy of zzso of satisfactory posture recognition, this approach can detect emergency situations such as a fall within a health smart zzso
