zzso signals coming from rotary zzso sensors in a robot gives us several features about the zzso This enables us to locate and zzso the objects in the scenario of the zzso Each object and zzso produces a series of zzso in the zzso of the zzso The zzso and angular position of the zzso sensor gives information about location and their zzso offer information about the nature of the zzso Early works showed that the zzso can be modeled and used to zzso objects with very good results at short zzso average success in zzso both walls and corners at distances less than zzso zzso In this paper, a new set of geometric features derived from the zzso analysis of the echo is zzso These features constitute a set of characteristics that can be used to improve the results of zzso at distances from zzso m to 4 zzso Also, a comparative study on zzso zzso widely used in pattern recognition techniques has been carried out for sensor distances ranging between zzso to 4 zzso and with zzso angles ranging between zzso to zzso Experimental results show an enhancement on the success in zzso rates when these geometric features are zzso
