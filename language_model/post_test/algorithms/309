We present an experimental and theoretical evaluation of an zzso energy filter based on the chromatic properties of a zzso lens zzso It is intended for small-scale applications such as medical zzso The PAL zzso a zzso lens and allows for high efficiency compared to filters based on ordinary zzso lenses, however at the cost of a lower energy zzso zzso zzso was found to provide a good approximation for the performance of a flawless zzso but a zzso model was used for quantitative zzso The model predicted a zzso zzso energy resolution and an intensity gain of zzso for a silicon PAL at zzso zzso zzso with an zzso tube showed good agreement with the model in energy resolution and peak energy, but a blurred focal line contributed to a zzso gain zzso We believe the blurring to be caused mainly by lens zzso in particular at the periphery of the zzso
