In zzso zzso video coding, zzso parts of the frame are zzso with higher quality than zzso zzso At low bit rates, such zzso may produce zzso coding artifacts, which may draw zzso attention away from zzso thereby degrading visual zzso In this paper, we present a zzso video zzso method for zzso video zzso The proposed method aims at reducing salient coding artifacts in zzso parts of the frame in order to keep user's attention on zzso Further, the method allows zzso to increase in high quality parts of the frame, and allows zzso to reduce in zzso zzso Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to improve visual quality of zzso video relative to conventional rate distortion zzso video coding, as well as two zzso art zzso video coding zzso
