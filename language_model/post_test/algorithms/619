As in our previous publications in this journal zzso zzso zzso 258 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 260 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 267 zzso zzso this paper is concerned with the zzso of poorly soluble drugs in zzso mixed zzso In the previous publications, the zzso of drugs were assumed to be low enough for the so-called infinite dilution approximation to be zzso In contrast, in the present paper, the zzso are considered to be finite and the dilute solution approximation is zzso As before, the fluctuation theory of solutions is used to express the derivatives of the activity zzso of a zzso in a zzso solution zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso with respect to the zzso of the zzso and zzso The expressions obtained are combined with a theoretical equation for the activity zzso of the zzso As a result, the activity zzso of the zzso was expressed through the activity zzso of the zzso at infinite zzso zzso mole zzso some properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso volume and activity zzso of the zzso and parameters reflecting the zzso of zzso zzso The expression thus obtained was used to derive an equation for the zzso of poorly soluble drugs in zzso zzso zzso which was applied in two different zzso First, the zzso parameters were considered as adjustable zzso determined from experimental zzso zzso Second, the obtained equation was used to correct the zzso of drugs calculated via the infinite dilution zzso It was shown that both procedures provide accurate correlations for the drug zzso
