zzso has been widely used to probe superficial tissue structures, but the penetration depth properties of this method have not been completely zzso This study employs a zzso zzso Carlo method to characterize the penetration depth statistics of zzso The analysis demonstrates that the penetration depth depends on both the zzso geometry zzso area zzso and collection angle zzso and on the optical properties of the sample, which include the scattering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and the type of the phase zzso We develop a mathematical expression relating the average penetration depth to the zzso beam properties and optical properties of the zzso Finally, we zzso the sensitivity of the average penetration depth to changes in optical properties for different zzso of zzso and zzso The penetration depth model derived in this study can be applied to zzso zzso fiber-optic zzso to target a sampling depth of interest with minimal sensitivity to the optical properties of the zzso
