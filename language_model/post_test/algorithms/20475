A new protein fold recognition method is described which is both fast and zzso The method uses a traditional sequence alignment zzso to generate alignments which are then evaluated by a method derived from zzso zzso As a final step, each threaded model is evaluated by a neural network in order to produce a single measure of confidence in the proposed zzso The speed of the method, along with its sensitivity and very low zzso rate makes it ideal for automatically predicting the structure of all the proteins in a translated bacterial zzso zzso The method has been applied to the zzso of zzso zzso and analysis of the results shows that as many as 46 % of the proteins derived from the predicted protein coding regions have a significant relationship to a protein of known zzso In some cases, however, only one domain of the protein can be predicted, giving a total coverage of 30 % when calculated as a fraction of the number of zzso acid zzso in the whole zzso
