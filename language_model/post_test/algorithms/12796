We updated our zzso zzso benchmark to include complexes that became available since our previous zzso As before, we only considered high-resolution complex structures that are zzso at the zzso pair level, for which the X-ray or zzso zzso structures of the constituent proteins are also zzso Benchmark zzso adds 52 new complexes to the 124 cases of Benchmark zzso representing an increase of zzso Thus, benchmark zzso provides 176 zzso cases that can be used for zzso zzso method development and zzso zzso of the newly added cases are zzso complexes, and we found no new zzso zzso zzso the new cases according to expected difficulty for zzso zzso zzso gives 33 rigid body cases, 11 cases of medium difficulty, and 8 cases that are zzso Benchmark zzso listings and processed structure files are publicly accessible at zzso
