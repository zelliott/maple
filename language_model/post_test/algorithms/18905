We define a zzso filtering based on correlations on unit spheres to obtain both zzso and zzso three-dimensional zzso object zzso zzso is expressed in terms of range zzso The phase zzso transform zzso of a range image provides information about the zzso of the zzso object zzso When the object is zzso zzso the zzso of the different zzso form a unit radius zzso On the other hand, a scale change is equivalent to a zzso of the zzso of the zzso by a constant zzso The effect of both rotation and scale changes for zzso objects means a change in the intensity of the unit radius zzso We define a zzso filtering based on zzso operations between zzso correlations to achieve both zzso and zzso zzso object zzso
