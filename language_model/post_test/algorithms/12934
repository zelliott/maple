A measurement system for quantitative determination of both surface and bulk contributions to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso It is based upon a zzso zzso sensor with a sensitivity of zzso zzso accomplishing precise zzso monitoring of zzso zzso of a zzso test laser beam transmitted perpendicular through the zzso zzso site of a zzso zzso Caused by the temperature dependence of the zzso index as well as zzso expansion, the initially plane zzso of the test laser is distorted into a zzso shape, with zzso ends towards the zzso Sign and magnitude depend on index change and zzso By comparison with zzso theory, this transient zzso distortion yields a quantitative absolute measure of bulk and surface zzso losses in the zzso First zzso for fused zzso are zzso
