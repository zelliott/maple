zzso speed of sound zzso cause significant degradation of medical ultrasound zzso In certain cases these zzso can be modeled as a thin, zzso varying time delay screen located at the face of the zzso Correction of such zzso requires the addition of zzso time delays to the normal system focusing zzso These zzso delays are estimated from the arrival time differences between echoes received on different array zzso The accuracy with which these arrival time differences can be estimated is limited by the level of correlation between received zzso zzso This paper derives zzso expressions predicting the correlation between zzso signals acquired by a pulse echo system with either point or larger receive elements in the presence of zzso phase zzso zzso are presented which are in good agreement with theoretical zzso zzso between the derived expressions and the Van zzso zzso are zzso These results indicate that zzso phase aberration correction may be far more difficult than previous analyses suggest because of the low correlation between echoes received by adjacent elements in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new translating zzso technique are presented as methods for improving zzso zzso
