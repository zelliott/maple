zzso spectrum disorders zzso are highly zzso yet relatively few associated genetic zzso have been zzso Copy number variations zzso have been implicated in zzso however, the majority of zzso contribute to zzso of the disease zzso zzso independent studies are important to refine associated zzso regions and discover novel zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso array was zzso for zzso detection by two distinct zzso in a European ancestry zzso data zzso We identify a significantly higher burden in the number and size of zzso and zzso more genes in zzso zzso Moreover, 18 deletions larger than 1 zzso were detected exclusively in cases, implicating novel regions at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided further evidence for pathways previously implicated in zzso revealing new candidate genes within the zzso signaling and neural development zzso These include zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso We also identified zzso in zzso deletions of which cause defects in zzso zzso zzso in model zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso Moreover, we found evidence of genetic overlap between zzso and other zzso and zzso zzso These genes include zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso synaptic regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso protein zzso Taken together, these zzso may be a few of the missing pieces of zzso zzso and lead to discovering novel zzso zzso
