To determine whether zzso tree techniques used on survey data collected at enrollment from older adults in a Medicare zzso could predict the likelihood of an individual being in a low, zzso high, or very high cost group in the subsequent zzso 

Data from comprehensive health risk assessment zzso screening of 11 zzso new zzso (age zzso or zzso 65 zzso continuously enrolled in a Medicare zzso for at least 24 months between 1997 and 2002 were combined with complete zzso service zzso data for each zzso in the zzso period to create cost zzso An original clinically devised zzso and a zzso and zzso Tree zzso that used the zzso data were compared with respect to their ability to correctly place an individual within the cost groups over 12 months of zzso 

The variables that best classified zzso into 12-month cost groups included quality of life, age, and zzso health zzso zzso was best for zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso was achieved for very high cost zzso Compared with the clinical algorithm, zzso also zzso only one third as many predictor variables to define risk zzso 

zzso self-report survey data collected at enrollment can be modeled to provide moderate sensitivity in predicting very high costs in the zzso zzso The ease of zzso of software to create zzso derived profiles of zzso zzso zzso the need to rely on clinically devised zzso to identify zzso at risk for very high zzso
