In zzso and zzso structural information about emergent zzso that progressively develop during the formation of zzso or biologically zzso solid zzso from solution is fundamental for understanding of the mechanisms driving complex zzso zzso for example, during zzso In this brief chapter, we present the use of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering zzso and zzso techniques and show how zzso can be used to gather structural information on the zzso properties of the de zzso zzso We base the discussion on several worked examples of zzso materials such as calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso
