Literature data on the clinical zzso of various zzso zzso along with in zzso potency data were correlated and a linear relationship was established in spite of limited data zzso In this work, a model set comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The in zzso zzso of the model set compounds were correlated with the published zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso The established linear zzso zzso equation was used to predict zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using in zzso potency and zzso protein free zzso zzso and zzso of prediction set were closely matched zzso fold of zzso demonstrating the usefulness of such predictions for tracking the target related zzso and/or efficacy signals within the clinically zzso population zzso In case of zzso where correlation was least anticipated, the predicted values were within zzso fold of those zzso Such predictions of appropriate parameters would provide rough estimates of whether or not zzso relevant zzso have been administered when clinical investigations of novel agents of this class are being zzso zzso it may aid in increasing clinical doses to a desired level if safety of the compound does not compromise such dose zzso In conclusion, the proposed model may zzso guide the dosing strategies and would greatly aid the development of novel compounds in this zzso
