zzso of synonymous zzso represents a characteristic pattern of preference in each zzso It has been zzso that such bias of zzso usage has evolved as a result of adaptation for efficient synthesis of zzso Here we examined synonymous zzso usage in genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared zzso usage bias with expression levels of the zzso In this zzso synonymous zzso usage bias was correlated with expression levels of the zzso the bias was most obvious in zzso zzso zzso A similar pattern of the zzso usage bias was also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but was not obvious in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Homo zzso As zzso of the highly expressed genes have greater influence on zzso efficiency than zzso of genes expressed at lower levels, it is likely that zzso usage in the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by zzso selection through zzso
