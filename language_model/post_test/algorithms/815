zzso circulating zzso can be detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso ultrasound signals are short duration transient like zzso The zzso transform is an ideal method for analysis and detection of such signals by zzso zzso zzso We propose a detection system based on the discrete zzso transform zzso and study some zzso which might be useful for describing zzso signals zzso We used a fast zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso filters with eight zzso In order to evaluate feasibility of the zzso of zzso two independent data sets, each zzso of short segments containing an zzso (N zzso zzso artifact (N zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso (N zzso zzso were zzso After applying the zzso to the data, several parameters were zzso The threshold values used for both data sets were zzso using the first data zzso While the zzso zzso resulting from artifacts zzso appear at the higher scales zzso six, seven, and zzso the zzso zzso at the lower scales zzso two, three, and four) are mainly dominated by zzso and zzso The zzso is able to filter out most of the artifacts inherently during the transform zzso For the first data set, 98 out of 100 zzso were detected as zzso For the second data set, 95 out of 100 zzso were detected as zzso when the same threshold values were zzso The zzso was also tested with a third data set zzso 202 normal zzso 198 signals were detected as zzso
