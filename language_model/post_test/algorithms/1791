A zzso zzso scheme is described for selective zzso polarization transfer between two dilute spins in double cross polarization zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso During the second zzso cross zzso the zzso zzso zzso is modulated zzso while the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This zzso zzso an effective zzso field in two selective frequency bands in either side of the zzso zzso carrier frequency, allowing for simultaneous polarization transfers from zzso to zzso in those two selective frequency zzso It is shown by experiments and simulations that this zzso zzso allows one to selectively zzso from zzso to its zzso bonded zzso and zzso zzso in neighboring zzso planes zzso which is useful for establishing the backbone connectivity between two sequential zzso in protein structural zzso The selectivity and efficiency were zzso demonstrated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain of protein G zzso
