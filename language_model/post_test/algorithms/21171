Modern zzso technologies afford a zzso view into the functions of the human brain with great spatial zzso and zzso resolution zzso However, common signal zzso methods require averaging over many trials, which limits the potential for practical application of these zzso In this paper we advance a novel zzso analysis method for zzso and demonstrate this approach with a target detection zzso The method zzso a framework consisting of multiple processing zzso that can be applied in whole or in part, including noise zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and performance zzso The framework introduces an enhanced noise zzso technology based on Directed zzso Analysis zzso that improves upon existing spatial filtering zzso zzso zzso utilizing a finite difference model zzso of the human head, estimates activity measures of the cortical sources involved in task zzso Such a zzso discrimination provides measurement zzso between training and testing sessions and holds the promise of providing a degree of zzso not possible with zzso zzso The framework's discrimination zzso interface with performance evaluation zzso to generate zzso performance zzso When applied to zzso acquired during performance of a target detection task, this method demonstrated that neural signatures of target recognition correctly classified up to zzso of targets in a rapid serial visual presentation zzso of zzso zzso On average, the zzso zzso method resulted in greater than zzso improvement over behavioral performance for target zzso
