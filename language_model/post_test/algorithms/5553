The zzso zzso zzso extraction systems zzso based on zzso zzso liquids were used to extract zzso zzso zzso of the zzso chain length of the zzso liquid zzso concentration of zzso zzso temperature and pH on the extraction efficiency have been zzso The zzso parameters zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso two phase systems were zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso of zzso was driven by both zzso and zzso interactions in the extraction zzso Under the optimum conditions, experiment results showed that zzso of the zzso c could be extracted into the zzso zzso phase in a zzso zzso The structural characterization of zzso in the zzso zzso was investigated by zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that no direct bonding interaction observed between zzso liquid and zzso zzso while the native properties of the zzso c were not zzso Compared with traditional zzso zzso based on toxic organic zzso zzso zzso two phase extraction offers clear advantages due to no use of volatile organic zzso and low consumption of zzso zzso zzso
