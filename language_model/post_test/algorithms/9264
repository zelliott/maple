zzso virtual screening today is basically organized as a sequential process where the molecules of a screening library are evaluated for instance with respect to their fit with a biological zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso screening paradigm avoiding sequential searching and therefore enabling zzso zzso zzso We implemented the novel paradigm in the virtual screening tool zzso and successfully applied it in screening experiments on four targets from relevant therapeutic zzso With the screening paradigm implemented in zzso we propose some important extensions and modifications to traditional virtual screening zzso Instead of processing all compounds in the screening library zzso zzso first analyzes the geometric and zzso binding site characteristics and then draws compounds with matching features from a compound zzso The catalog organizes the compounds by their zzso and geometric features making use of zzso database technology with zzso tables in order to support efficient queries for compounds with specific zzso A key element of the compound catalog is a highly selective geometric zzso that carries information on the type of functional groups of the compound, their zzso distance, the preferred interaction direction of each functional group, and the location of zzso bulk around the zzso In a zzso experiment with 200 zzso complexes, we could show that zzso is able to correctly predict the location of zzso functional groups in zzso zzso In a retrospective virtual screening experiment for four different targets, the enrichment factors of zzso are comparable to the enrichment factors of zzso and zzso With computing times clearly below one second per compound, zzso counts among the fastest virtual screening tools currently available and is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than standard zzso
