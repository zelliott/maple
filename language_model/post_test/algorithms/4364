zzso recognition in biological systems relies on the existence of specific attractive interactions between two partner zzso zzso drug design seeks to identify and zzso such interactions between zzso and their protein zzso The approach followed in medicinal chemistry follows a combination of careful analysis of structural data together with experimental and/or theoretical studies on the zzso This chapter focuses on the fact that a protein is not fully characterized by a single structure, but by an ensemble of states, some of them represent zzso zzso with cryptic binding zzso We highlight case studies where both experimental and zzso methods have been used to mutually drive each other in an attempt to improve the success of the drug design zzso in both experimental techniques and zzso methods have greatly improved our zzso understanding of the functional mechanisms in zzso and opened a debate about the interplay between molecular structure and zzso zzso The beautiful zzso pictures of protein structures may have led to zzso the intrinsic protein flexibility, however we are entering a new era where more sophisticated methods are used to exploit this ability of zzso and this will definitely lead to the inclusion of the notion in the pharmaceutical field of drug zzso
