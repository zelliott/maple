zzso analysis has been studied for zzso imaging, but few methods have been developed for functional zzso zzso zzso zzso frequently appears in brain single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, but objective zzso is zzso An automatic method, based on random walk zzso theory, has been developed to zzso zzso zzso We assess the zzso of our zzso in zzso levels of diffuse zzso even when focal defects are zzso 

zzso is zzso by counting R zzso the mean rate of visited zzso in a fixed number of steps of the zzso RW zzso The zzso has been tested on the zzso zzso zzso head zzso Seven diffuse cortical zzso levels were simulated with an adjustable zzso function and 6 zzso focal defects simulating zzso zzso leading to 42 zzso Data were projected and smoothed (full zzso at half zzso zzso zzso and zzso noise was added to the 64 zzso The zzso data were reconstructed using filtered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso R values for different levels of zzso zzso and diffuse zzso were evaluated on 3 zzso the number of slices studied (20 vs zzso the use of zzso zzso versus original space, and the use of a cortical mask within the zzso zzso For each zzso zzso lines for zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso R values were also evaluated on zzso images performed on 25 subjects with suspected focal zzso and on 15 normal zzso zzso were blindly ranked by 2 experienced nuclear physicians according to the degree of diffuse zzso 

zzso of R was smaller than zzso for repeated zzso R was more particularly influenced by diffuse zzso compared with focal zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a significant influence on the zzso zzso The number of slices visited by the RW and the cortical masking have a weak influence on the zzso zzso but only for very low zzso zzso The zzso zzso between zzso consensus and RW automatic ranking is zzso in the same order of magnitude as the zzso zzso between the rankings of the 2 senior physicians zzso 

Random walk is an original and objective method and is able to zzso zzso brain zzso even in presence of cortical zzso This method is zzso zzso and mainly influenced by spatial zzso
