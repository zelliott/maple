Central transition zzso sensitivity enhancement schemes that transfer polarization from satellites to the CT through selective zzso or inversion of neighboring satellite transitions have provided a welcome improvement for zzso spinning zzso of zzso zzso zzso While many researchers have investigated and developed different methods of creating enhanced CT zzso here we investigate the conversion of these enhanced CT populations into zzso CT zzso We show a somewhat unexpected result that a conversion pulse length zzso for maximum sensitivity on equilibrium populations may not be optimum for an enhanced zzso zzso Furthermore, CT enhancements can be lost if excessive zzso field strength is used to convert this enhanced polarization into CT zzso While a zzso enhanced CT signal is expected when using a perfectly selective CT conversion pulse, we have found that significant sensitivity loss can occur when using surprisingly low zzso field strengths, even for sites with relatively large zzso zzso zzso We have systematically investigated these issues, and present some general guidelines and expectations when zzso the conversion of enhanced zzso CT populations into zzso CT zzso
