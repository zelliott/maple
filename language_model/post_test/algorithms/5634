zzso bacterial infections are highly regulated and complex processes that are orchestrated by numerous zzso zzso Genes that are zzso controlled by the set of regulators required for systemic infection are potentially required for zzso 

In this study we present a systems biology approach in which zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulator zzso were coupled with zzso network analysis to efficiently identify zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments verified zzso zzso factors and a subset was determined to be zzso into the host zzso suggesting that they are zzso factors directly interacting with host cellular zzso Two of these, zzso and zzso were required for full mouse zzso and were shown to be zzso independent of either of the type III zzso systems in zzso or the type III zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso lacking zzso regulators not only identified novel zzso factors but also defined a new class of zzso zzso involved in zzso The success of this strategy at discovery of known and novel zzso factors suggests that the approach may have zzso for other bacterial zzso
