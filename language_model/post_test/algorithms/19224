A system for three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamic zzso vascular bed structures has been developed and is zzso zzso images are obtained from zzso zzso or zzso zzso X-ray zzso A target structure consisting of vessel branch points zzso and lines between the branch points is entered on the first of a sequence of images in one zzso The movement of the zzso is indicated on subsequent images and on the images of the second zzso The target is zzso warped according to the motion of the zzso zzso Automatic edge detection (with subsequent operator zzso is used to detect zzso and edges of zzso zzso reconstruction is accomplished using a distance minimizing point matching zzso Finally, zzso zzso methods are used to refine the vessel cross zzso Standard shaded surface display techniques are then used to display the moving zzso zzso zzso zzso are obtained by tracking the leading edge of the zzso down the three-dimensional zzso zzso
