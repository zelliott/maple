zzso techniques are presented for the transformation of digital anatomical textbooks from the ideal to the individual, allowing for the representation of the zzso manifest in normal human zzso The ideal textbook is constructed on a fixed coordinate system to contain all of the information currently available about the physical properties of zzso This information is obtained via sensor zzso such as magnetic zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with symbolic information such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso associated with individuals is zzso by defining zzso transformations on the textbook coordinate system, the transformations forming mathematical translation groups of high zzso The ideal is applied to the individual patient by finding the transformation which is consistent with physical properties of zzso elastic zzso and which brings the coordinate system of the textbook to that of the zzso zzso zzso and fusion all result automatically because the textbook carries symbolic values as well as zzso zzso
