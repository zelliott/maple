The biological central pattern generator zzso zzso open and closed loop control to produce zzso zzso The goal of this study was to develop a zzso based zzso capable of mimicking the biological system to control multiple zzso in the lower zzso for producing zzso zzso The zzso used zzso models of the step cycle each of which produced different stimulation zzso Two zzso were implemented to restore zzso walking in five adult zzso cats using intramuscular stimulation zzso of the main hip, knee and ankle zzso and zzso muscles in the hind zzso An open loop controller relied only on intrinsic timing while a zzso controller added sensory feedback from force plates (representing limb zzso and zzso and zzso (representing limb zzso zzso applied to hind limb muscles caused extension or zzso in the hips, knees and zzso A total of 113 walking trials were obtained across all zzso Of these, 74 were successful in which the cats traversed zzso of the zzso m zzso zzso In these trials, the average peak step length decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the median number of steps per trial increased from 7 zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso 9) to 9 zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Moreover, within these trials, the zzso controller produced more successful steps zzso length zzso 20 zzso ground reaction force zzso zzso body zzso than the open loop zzso zzso of 544 steps zzso versus 65 of zzso steps zzso zzso This supports our previous preliminary findings, and affirms that zzso based zzso approaches produce more successful stepping than open loop zzso The zzso provides the foundation for a neural prosthetic controller and a framework to implement more detailed control of locomotion in the zzso
