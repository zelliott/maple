DNA zzso zzso computing that is a new zzso model based on DNA molecules for information storage has been increasingly used for zzso and data analysis in recent zzso However, DNA computing zzso has some limitations in terms of convergence speed, zzso and zzso In this paper, a new approach for improvement of DNA computing is zzso This new approach aims to perform DNA computing zzso with zzso parameters towards the desired goal using zzso particle swarm zzso zzso Some contributions provided by the proposed zzso based on zzso DNA computing zzso are as zzso zzso parameters of population size, crossover rate, maximum number of operations, zzso and virus zzso rate, and fitness function of DNA computing zzso are simultaneously tuned for zzso process, zzso zzso zzso is performed using zzso zzso for zzso progress, faster operation, and flexibility in data, and zzso zzso realization of DNA computing zzso with proposed approach is implemented in system zzso Two experiments with different systems were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with comparative zzso Experimental results obtained with zzso and zzso demonstrate ability to provide effective zzso considerable convergence speed, and high accuracy according to DNA computing zzso
