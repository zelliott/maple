To assess the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and specialized imaging software in the evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso heart zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this zzso zzso Thirty-four consecutive zzso identified patients in whom a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was performed as part of routine clinical cardiac MR imaging between March 2010 and August 2011 and who had undergone zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso were developed and implemented in zzso and zzso Two zzso independently reviewed zzso zzso studies for each of 34 patients zzso age, 6 years; age range, 10 months to 21 zzso and tabulated visible zzso and zzso zzso These results were compared with color zzso zzso and cardiac MR imaging reports, which were generated without zzso zzso zzso Cohen zzso statistics were zzso to assess zzso agreement and agreement with zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso acquisitions were performed, on average, in less than 10 zzso Among 123 valves seen in 34 zzso zzso studies, 29 zzso valves were identified, with good agreement between observers zzso There was also good agreement with the presence of at least mild zzso at zzso zzso 1, zzso observer 2, zzso with high sensitivity zzso 1, zzso observer 2, zzso and specificity zzso 1, zzso observer 2, zzso relative to the reference zzso Eight zzso zzso were identified, four of which were not visible with conventional cardiac MR imaging but were detected with zzso No zzso zzso were found with zzso zzso 

With zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence can augment conventional cardiac MR imaging by improving sensitivity for and depiction of zzso significant zzso and zzso zzso
