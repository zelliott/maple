The zzso score is an effective means for zzso the extent of zzso zzso in a patient from low-cost zzso zzso zzso of such a system is deemed to help implementing low-cost high-volume screening mechanisms of zzso in the primary zzso This paper zzso for the first time to the best of our knowledge, an automated zzso of the updated zzso scoring system for that purpose, where zzso zzso zzso and patterns are identified and classified using a novel stationary zzso transform zzso zzso detection zzso This stage informs the two principal steps of the updated zzso scoring zzso zzso zzso and the point awarding zzso The complete system is validated on 51 zzso records of patients detected with zzso heart zzso zzso has been carried out using manually detected zzso classes and zzso of the actual score by expert zzso as the ground zzso Our results show that as a zzso system it is able to zzso different zzso with zzso accuracy whereas it exhibits zzso accuracy in computing the actual zzso When coupled with our previously proposed automated zzso zzso algorithm, that provides the input zzso zzso the overall system shows zzso accuracy in zzso zzso and zzso accuracy in computing the actual score and thereby showing comparable performance to the zzso system proposed here, with the added advantage of complete automated analysis without any human zzso
