zzso systems are investigated using zzso of the zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso volume ratio and relaxation rate are derived from the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso and connected to the parameters in the zzso zzso an expression often used to describe the zzso diffusion zzso in porous zzso The zzso length is identified for systems with large pore to zzso volume zzso The results are compared with zzso
