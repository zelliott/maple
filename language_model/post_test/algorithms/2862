zzso mortality is a major public health problem in the State of Michigan and the United zzso The primary adverse zzso outcome underlying infant mortality is low zzso zzso and exploring the spatial patterns of low zzso and infant mortality rates and standardized zzso and mortality ratios is important for generating zzso zzso targeting high-risk neighborhoods for monitoring and implementing maternal and child health intervention and prevention programs and evaluating the need for health care zzso This study investigates the spatial patterns of low zzso and infant mortality in the State of Michigan using automated zone matching zzso methodology and minimum case and population threshold recommendations provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau to calculate stable rates and standardized zzso and mortality ratios at the zzso Code zzso zzso zzso zzso The results from this analysis are validated using zzso Vital statistics birth zzso zzso zzso and linked infant death zzso zzso zzso records obtained from the Michigan Department of Community Health and zzso for the years 2004 to 2006 are zzso 

For a majority of zzso zzso the relative standard errors zzso of rates calculated prior to zzso were greater than zzso zzso results were the result of too few case and birth zzso zzso zzso with a target population of 25 cases and minimum threshold of 20 cases resulted in the reconstruction of zones with at least 50 zzso and zzso of rates zzso and below respectively, demonstrating the stability reliability of these new zzso Other zzso parameters included zzso constraints on maternal race and maximum shape zzso of zones to minimize potential zzso zzso identified areas with elevated low zzso and infant mortality rates and standardized zzso and mortality zzso Most but not all of these areas were also detected by zzso 

zzso the spatial patterns of low zzso and infant deaths in Michigan was an important first step in conducting a geographic evaluation of the State's reported high infant mortality zzso zzso proved to be a useful tool for visualizing and exploring the spatial patterns of low zzso and infant deaths for public health zzso Future research should also consider zzso as a tool for health services zzso
