zzso navigation through an environment requires precise monitoring of direction and distance traveled zzso zzso or zzso zzso Previous studies in blindfolded human subjects showed that zzso information arising from zzso and zzso signals can be used to reproduce passive linear zzso In these studies, visual information was excluded as sensory zzso Yet, in our everyday life, visual information is very important and usually dominates zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether visual signals can be used to discriminate and reproduce simulated linear zzso In a first set of experiments, subjects viewed two sequences of linear motion and were asked in a zzso task to judge whether the travel distance in the second sequence was larger or shorter than in the zzso zzso in either movement sequence could be forward zzso or backward zzso zzso were very accurate in discriminating travel zzso Average error was less than zzso and did not depend on zzso being into the same zzso zzso or opposite direction zzso zzso In a second set of experiments, subjects had to reproduce a previously seen forward motion zzso zzso either in light or in darkness, zzso with or without visual zzso zzso zzso had different zzso profiles zzso zzso zzso and speeds and were performed across a zzso ground plane, a zzso plane of dots or through a 3-D cloud of zzso With visual feedback, subjects reproduced distances zzso zzso did not depend on the kind of zzso profile in the passive zzso zzso tended to reproduce distance by replicating the zzso profile of the passive zzso Finally, in the condition without visual feedback, subjects reproduced the shape of the zzso profile, but used much higher speeds, resulting in a substantial zzso of travel zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and zzso signals are used for path integration, following a common zzso the use of the zzso profile during zzso
