zzso zzso is a well-known phenomenon for therapeutic accelerator beams passing through matter in narrow beam zzso This study zzso zzso the magnitude of beam zzso of therapeutic beams in zzso A formal concept of beam zzso is proposed which is based on the decrease of the mean zzso zzso with zzso On the basis of this concept calculations of beam zzso effects are easily performed by means of a commercial spreadsheet zzso Published accelerator zzso and the tabulated values of zzso zzso serve as input for these zzso It is shown that the mean zzso zzso starts at depth zero with an almost linear decrease and then slowly levels off to a limit zzso A similar behavior is found for the beam zzso zzso A physically reasonable, zzso model is given which fits the data better than previously published zzso The energy dependence of the initial zzso zzso is evaluated and zzso It fits well to published experimental zzso The initial beam zzso zzso however, shows no energy zzso Its mean value zzso approximately zzso zzso is also in close agreement to the measured zzso
