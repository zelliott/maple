This study zzso the zzso zzso for zzso in Toddlers, zzso with zzso zzso a screening tool for low-risk zzso and demonstrates improved utility compared with the original zzso 

zzso (N zzso zzso were screened during zzso and zzso zzso care visits in metropolitan Atlanta and zzso Parents of toddlers at risk on zzso completed zzso those who continued to show risk were zzso 

The reliability and zzso of the zzso were demonstrated, and optimal scoring was determined by using receiver operating characteristic zzso Children whose total score was zzso 3 initially and zzso 2 after follow-up had a zzso risk of being diagnosed with zzso spectrum disorder zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso risk of any zzso delay or concern zzso zzso zzso Total score was more effective than alternative zzso An zzso based on 3 risk levels is recommended to maximize clinical utility and to reduce age of diagnosis and onset of early zzso The zzso detects zzso at a higher rate compared with the zzso while also reducing the number of children needing the zzso Children in the current study were diagnosed 2 years younger than the national median age of zzso 

The zzso detects many cases of zzso in zzso physicians using the zzso screener can be confident that most zzso cases warrant evaluation and referral for early zzso zzso zzso of universal screening can lower the age of zzso diagnosis by 2 years compared with recent surveillance findings, increasing time available for early zzso
