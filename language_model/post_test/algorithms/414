Maintaining zzso zzso is essential and involves keeping models developed on an instrument zzso to predicting new samples over zzso Sometimes a primary instrument model is needed to predict samples measured on secondary zzso This situation is referred to as zzso zzso This paper reports on using a zzso zzso zzso based method in both zzso A distinction of the zzso design for zzso maintenance and transfer is a defined weighting scheme for a small set of new zzso or zzso samples zzso to the full set of zzso zzso Because straight application of basic zzso theory is not always possible with zzso maintenance and transfer, this paper develops a generic solution to always enable application of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso considerations for zzso are compared with the same zzso format applied to partial least squares zzso showing that both approaches are viable solutions to the zzso maintenance and transfer zzso
