The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of the N form zzso zzso , zzso zzso and organic N) and N concentration on plant zzso zzso and on the contribution of the different N sources to the plant N budget, in order to evaluate the feasibility of using plant zzso N values for discriminating between conventional and organic zzso To this end, different N zzso zzso as zzso zzso ), N forms zzso zzso versus zzso zzso ), and increasing zzso zzso applications to an organic zzso zzso regime were zzso 

When using zzso zzso as N source, zzso zzso was significant and tended to increase when zzso zzso concentration increased in the root zzso However, negligible net zzso zzso was observed when comparing theoretical and measured plant zzso N zzso On the other hand, when plants are zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso , differences in zzso patterns for both zzso could result in variation in plant zzso N regarding to the expected zzso Finally, the application of zzso zzso to plants was detected when it was combined with high levels of organic N sources, from zzso zzso N zzso 

Under certain conditions and following some considerations concerning zzso zzso N values can be considered to be a potential tool to guarantee the authenticity of organic zzso
