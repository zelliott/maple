The effects of a drug on the zzso scale can be assessed in a zzso zzso zzso with the three color zzso represented through the so-called zzso In our recent study, we have shown that the zzso zzso zzso applied to the zzso can be used to detect groups of zzso genes in the zzso zzso However, the standard zzso is not well suited for the purpose because 1) the zzso genes need first to be zzso into equally and zzso expressed zzso with zzso ignoring possible information in the former zzso 2) the zzso coordinates are zzso correlated and there is no direct way of expressing this in the standard zzso and 3) it is not clear how to zzso the association of zzso genes with the line along which they zzso We address these deficiencies by zzso a dedicated zzso zzso zzso The approach is demonstrated by assessing effects of the drug zzso on zzso human zzso vein zzso zzso Compared with our previous study, we robustly detect stronger natural groupings of zzso zzso Moreover, the gene groups show coherent biological functions with high significance, as detected by the Gene zzso zzso
