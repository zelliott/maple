Mechanical parameters obtained from the frequency response at tooth zzso informs of various zzso tissue zzso An electromagnetic zzso device was investigated for measuring tooth mobility using mechanical parameters obtained from the frequency response characteristics of an experimental tooth zzso This electromagnetic zzso device was able to assess the overall condition of zzso tissue associated with the zzso of each zzso In this study, reliability and effects of bottom thicknesses of simulated zzso ligament relative to mechanical parameters were zzso 

zzso of tooth zzso was performed by an electromagnetic zzso device on experimental tooth models with different bottom thicknesses of simulated zzso zzso Using an electromagnetic zzso device, the mechanical parameters resonant frequency, elastic zzso and zzso of zzso were calculated from the frequency response characteristics derived from tooth zzso by an electromagnetic zzso Variation of those parameters was investigated under four different experimental conditions and the implications of the results were zzso 

An electromagnetic zzso device clearly detected three mechanical parameters in all experimental zzso The resonant frequency and the elastic zzso decreased with increasing bottom zzso However, no significant difference in the zzso of zzso was observed among the experimental zzso 

Assessment of tooth mobility using mechanical parameters of an electromagnetic zzso device reproduced fine details of various simulated zzso ligament zzso Variation in the parameters resonant frequency, elastic zzso and zzso of zzso might be useful in evaluating changes of components in zzso zzso
