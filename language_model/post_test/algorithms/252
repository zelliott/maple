We demonstrate that zzso decoupling using a zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso is very efficient at high spinning zzso zzso and high magnetic fields zzso for zzso at zzso even with moderate zzso decoupling zzso zzso despite the wide range of zzso chemical shifts of the zzso and the increased effect of their chemical shift zzso
