The atomic force microscope zzso is now an established and valuable tool for the study of biological zzso in zzso zzso In this paper we form a patterned boundary via the zzso printing of individually isolated zzso zzso attached to a solid zzso We use this boundary to investigate zzso interactions that can occur between an zzso tip and a protein surface during imaging in zzso The observed height variations of the protein film are found to be a combination of not only structural considerations and thickness of the protein film, but also the repulsive contribution from zzso interactions between the zzso tip and the zzso These variations in measured heights of the protein surface can be described by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our experimental results show that height zzso can be manipulated either zzso or positively by adjusting the pH and concentration of the zzso buffer that is zzso
