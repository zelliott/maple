Most zzso proteins can be classified into one of four structural zzso zzso alpha + beta and zzso upon the type, amount and arrangement of secondary structures zzso In this work a new method, based upon fuzzy zzso is proposed for predicting the structural class of a protein from its zzso acid zzso Here, each of the structural classes is described by a fuzzy cluster and each protein is characterized by its membership degree, a number between zero and one in each of the four zzso with the constraint that the sum of the membership degrees equals zzso A given protein is then classified as belonging to that structural class corresponding to the fuzzy cluster with maximum membership zzso zzso of membership degrees is carried out using the fuzzy zzso zzso on a training set of 64 zzso zzso obtained for the training set show that the fuzzy zzso approach produces results comparable with or better than those obtained by other zzso A test set of 27 proteins also produced comparable results to those obtained with the training zzso The success of the present preliminary work on protein structure class prediction suggests that further refinements of method may lead to improved predictions and this is currently being zzso
