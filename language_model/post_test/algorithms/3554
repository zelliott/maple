The zzso zzso zzso of many integral membrane proteins are composed of zzso zzso zzso determination at high resolution zzso zzso of TM zzso is still zzso difficult zzso zzso some zzso structures have only been solved at intermediate zzso zzso or low zzso zzso resolutions zzso for example, zzso zzso zzso These structures reveal the packing arrangement of the TM domain, but cannot be used to determine the positions of individual zzso zzso The observation that typically, the zzso faces of TM proteins are zzso more variable and less charged than their core provides a simple rule for zzso their constituent zzso Based on this rule, we developed score functions and automated methods for zzso TM zzso for which locations and tilt angles have been determined zzso zzso zzso zzso The method was zzso with the aim of retrieving the native structure of zzso among zzso and zzso zzso It was then tested on proteins that differ from zzso in their zzso zzso and functions, such as the zzso zzso and zzso The predicted structures were within zzso A from the native state in all zzso We conclude that the zzso method can be used in conjunction with zzso data to obtain approximate model structures of TM zzso of proteins for which a sufficiently zzso set of zzso is zzso We also show that in those proteins in which relatively short zzso connect neighboring zzso the scoring functions can discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso even without the constraints imposed on zzso locations and tilt angles that are derived from zzso
