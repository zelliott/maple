zzso techniques for zzso analysis have been widely zzso particularly for the study of marker genes expressed to a specific type of zzso Most of the machine learning methods that have been applied to significant gene selection focus on the zzso ability rather than the selection ability of the zzso These methods also require the zzso data to be zzso before analysis takes zzso The objective of this study is to develop a hybrid genetic zzso network zzso model that zzso feature selection and can operate on zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso is a hybrid model where the fitness value of the genetic zzso zzso is based upon the number of samples correctly zzso by a standard zzso artificial neural network zzso The model is evaluated by using two benchmark zzso zzso with different array platforms and differing number of classes (a zzso zzso zzso data for acute zzso and a zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso round blue cell zzso The underlying concept of the zzso zzso is to select highly zzso genes by zzso both the zzso fitness function and the ANN weights at the same zzso 

The novel zzso selected approximately 50% of the same genes as the original zzso This may indicate that these common genes are more biologically significant than other genes in the zzso The remaining 50% of the significant genes identified were used to build zzso models and for both zzso the models based on the set of genes extracted by the zzso method produced more accurate zzso The results also suggest that the zzso method not only can detect genes that are exclusively associated with a single cancer type but can also explore the genes that are zzso expressed in multiple cancer zzso 

The results show that the zzso model has successfully extracted statistically significant genes from the zzso zzso data as well as zzso known biologically significant zzso We also show that assessing the biological significance of genes based on zzso accuracy may be misleading and though the zzso set of extra genes prove to be more statistically significant than those selected by other methods, a biological assessment of these genes is highly recommended to confirm their zzso
