zzso spray cooling zzso is an effective technique to protect the zzso during zzso laser zzso zzso a zzso onto the skin surface creates a zzso heat zzso effectively cooling the skin during and following the zzso zzso In previous studies mathematical models were developed to predict the human skin temperature profiles during the zzso zzso zzso However, no studies have accounted for the additional cooling due to residual zzso left on the skin surface following the spurt zzso We formulate and solve an inverse heat zzso zzso problem to predict the zzso surface heat flux both during and following a zzso zzso The zzso zzso uses measured temperature profiles from within a medium to estimate the surface heat zzso We implement a one-dimensional sequential function zzso method zzso to estimate the surface heat flux from internal temperatures measured within an in zzso model in response to a zzso zzso zzso accuracy and experimental errors are examined using simulated temperature zzso Heat flux following spurt termination appears zzso however, it is less than that during the zzso zzso The estimated zzso heat flux can subsequently be used in forward heat zzso models to estimate temperature profiles in skin during and following a zzso spurt and predict appropriate timing for onset of the laser zzso
