An automated zzso for tissue zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the brain is zzso A mixture model composed of a large number of zzso is used to represent the brain zzso Each tissue is represented by a large number of zzso components to capture the complex tissue spatial zzso The intensity of a tissue is considered a global feature and is incorporated into the model through tying of all the related zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso to learn the zzso constrained zzso mixture zzso An elaborate zzso scheme is suggested to link the set of zzso per tissue type, such that each zzso in the set has similar intensity characteristics with minimal overlapping spatial zzso zzso of the brain image is achieved by the affiliation of each zzso to the component of the model that zzso the a zzso zzso The presented zzso is used to segment zzso zzso simulated and real MR images of the brain into three different zzso under varying noise zzso zzso are compared with state-of-the-art zzso in the zzso The zzso does not use an zzso for zzso or zzso zzso Registration processes are therefore not required and the zzso of the framework can be extended to diseased brains and zzso zzso
