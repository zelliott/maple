zzso the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis by using zzso landmarks is a simpler clinical procedure than locating the zzso zzso horizontal zzso however, accuracy may vary depending on individual patient zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate an arbitrary zzso horizontal axis relative to the zzso zzso edge and to examine the magnitude of zzso error produced when this arbitrary zzso horizontal axis is used to mount casts in an zzso 

zzso adults zzso men, 30 zzso participated in this zzso The distance of the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge was measured for each zzso A zzso linear zzso was used to analyze the effect of sex on the distance of the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge by using statistical software zzso zzso zzso zzso A linear correlation analysis was used to compare the distance from the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge with the zzso height zzso Four distances from the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge zzso 90, zzso zzso and 3 zzso record thicknesses zzso 2, 3 zzso were zzso calculated to examine the magnitude zzso error at the central zzso zzso 

The mean distance from an arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge position was zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso Overall, zzso of the participants fell within 5 zzso of the zzso zzso No significant differences in the distance of the arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge position were identified between men and women or with the zzso zzso The magnitude of zzso error at the central zzso contact ranged from zzso to zzso zzso 

The distance from an arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge position was zzso by the sex or height of the participants zzso Variations in the distance from an arbitrary zzso horizontal axis to the zzso central zzso edge resulted in minor zzso discrepancies at the central zzso zzso
