zzso zzso zzso zzso are special zzso zzso whose generators are also the centers of mass zzso of the zzso regions with respect to a given density function and zzso zzso have been proven to be very useful in many diverse applications in science and zzso In the context of image processing and its simplest form, zzso zzso reduce to the well-known k zzso zzso and are easy to zzso In this paper, we develop an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model for image zzso and propose some efficient zzso for its zzso Our zzso model can overcome some deficiencies possessed by the basic zzso zzso in particular, the new model appropriately combines the image intensity information together with the length of cluster zzso and can handle very sophisticated zzso We demonstrate through extensive examples the efficiency, effectiveness, zzso and flexibility of the proposed zzso
