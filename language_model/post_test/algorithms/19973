zzso tract resonance characteristics in acoustic speech signals are classically tracked using frame-by-frame point estimates of zzso zzso followed by candidate selection and smoothing using dynamic programming methods that minimize ad hoc cost zzso The goal of the current work is to provide both point estimates and associated uncertainties of center zzso and zzso in a statistically zzso zzso zzso zzso Kalman zzso zzso take advantage of a zzso mapping to zzso zzso and zzso parameters from zzso estimates of zzso moving average zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso is accomplished in the zzso case using a manually marked zzso database and zzso speech zzso zzso zzso tracks exhibit lower overall zzso error relative to the two benchmark zzso with the ability to modify parameters in a controlled manner to trade off bias and zzso zzso tracking performance of zzso is illustrated using zzso and spoken zzso zzso The simultaneous tracking of uncertainty levels enables practitioners to recognize zzso confidence in parameters of interest and adjust zzso settings zzso
