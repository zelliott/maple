We investigate the propagation properties of zzso zzso of a metallic zzso with zzso zzso By taking the small radius and the huge relative zzso into account, we establish an approximate zzso description for this kind of surface zzso It is shown that the main propagation properties are closely related to the product of the radius of the metallic zzso and the complex wave number of the zzso In addition, when the radius of the metal wire is smaller than the zzso the size of the modal field is simply zzso to the radius of the metal zzso We also carefully verify these zzso predictions with rigorous zzso zzso
