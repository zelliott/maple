zzso have determined that the control and regulation of gene expression is primarily determined by relatively short sequences in the region surrounding a zzso These sequences vary in zzso position, zzso orientation, and zzso Finding these short sequences is a fundamental problem in molecular biology with important zzso Though there exist many different approaches to signal zzso short zzso finding, some new study shows that this problem still leaves plenty of room for zzso In 2000, zzso and zzso proposed the Challenge Problem of motif zzso They reported that most current motif finding zzso are incapable of detecting the target motifs in their Challenge zzso In this paper, we show that using an zzso design, our new zzso can correctly find the target zzso Furthermore, taking into account the fact that some zzso factors form a zzso or even more complex structures, and zzso process can sometimes involve multiple factors with variable zzso in between, we extend the original problem to an even more challenging one by addressing the issue of zzso signals with gaps of variable zzso To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we tested it on a series of the new challenge problem as well as real zzso and compared it with some current representative zzso zzso
