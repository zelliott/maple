A spectral imaging system consisting of a zzso zzso zzso a high-speed infrared camera, and a bundle of zzso fibers zzso infrared radiation images was zzso zzso transmission zzso were obtained by carefully processing multiple zzso taken by high-speed zzso zzso spectral images of a variety of samples captured by the system were zzso We successfully detected existence maps of the oil and fat of biological samples by mapping the transmission of specific zzso in the zzso
