The development of technology capable of zzso performing large-scale zzso of biological systems has generated a wealth of zzso zzso analysis of these data holds the promise of uncovering gene function, regulation, and, in the longer run, understanding complex zzso However, their analysis has proved very challenging, as it is difficult to quickly and effectively assess the relevance and accuracy of these data for individual biological zzso Here, we identify biases that present challenges for the assessment of functional zzso data and zzso We then discuss evaluation methods that, taken together, begin to address these zzso We also argue that the funding of systematic zzso experiments and of high-quality zzso efforts will further improve evaluation metrics so that they zzso assess functional zzso data and zzso Such metrics will allow researchers in the field of functional zzso to continue to answer important biological questions in a zzso zzso
