A zzso model of the lower spine was designed and used to obtain a robust zzso of the zzso zzso during torso movements from zzso markers recorded by zzso zzso were placed in correspondence of the anatomical landmarks of the pelvic bone and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and acquired during zzso lateral zzso and zzso zzso In the model zzso stage, a zzso approach was used to zzso the rotation axes and zzso of the functional zzso zzso zzso were mirrored into virtual points located on the model surface, expressed in the local reference system of zzso The spine motion assessment was solved into the domain of extended Kalman zzso at each frame of the zzso the model pose was updated by minimizing the distances between the measured zzso marker projections on the cameras and the corresponding zzso of virtual points located on the model zzso The novelty of the proposed technique rests on the fact that the varying location of the rotation zzso of the functional zzso units can be tracked directly during motion zzso In addition, we show how the effects of skin zzso on orientation data can be taken into zzso As a result, the zzso zzso of simulated motions shows that orientation zzso were reduced by a factor of at least zzso zzso experiments on real motion confirmed the reliability of the proposed method with results in agreement with classical studies in zzso
