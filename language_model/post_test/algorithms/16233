zzso zzso zzso with up to zzso spin polarization zzso zzso signal enhancement at zzso zzso was obtained after separation from the zzso vapor of the zzso optical pumping zzso zzso The zzso was applied for several minutes in a zzso mode, and the fast, zzso zzso relaxation of this spin I zzso zzso noble gas isotope required a rapid subsequent zzso removal and swift transfer into the high magnetic field region for zzso zzso Because of the xenon density dependent zzso zzso relaxation in the gas phase, the zzso polarization zzso exhibits an even more pronounced dependence on xenon partial pressure than that observed in zzso zzso zzso is the only stable noble gas isotope with a positive zzso ratio and shows therefore a different relative phase between zzso signal and zzso signal compared to all other noble zzso The gas phase zzso zzso spectrum displays a surface and magnetic field dependent zzso splitting that was found to have additional gas pressure and gas composition zzso The splitting was reduced by the presence of water vapor that presumably influences zzso zzso The zzso zzso spectrum shows differential line zzso suggesting the presence of strong zzso zzso Beyond zzso zzso zzso zzso studies, a general equation for the high temperature, zzso spin zzso zzso for spin I zzso 1/2 zzso is zzso
