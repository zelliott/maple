As the pace of zzso sequencing has accelerated, the need for highly accurate gene prediction systems has zzso zzso systems for identifying genes in zzso zzso have sensitivities of zzso or higher zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 27, zzso zzso These accuracy figures are calculated by comparing the locations of verified stop zzso to the zzso zzso the accuracy of start zzso prediction is more problematic, however, due to the relatively small number of start sites that have been confirmed by independent, zzso zzso Nonetheless, the accuracy of gene zzso at predicting the exact gene boundaries at both the zzso and 3' ends of genes is of critical importance for microbial zzso zzso especially in light of the important signaling information that is sometimes found on the zzso end of a protein coding zzso In this paper we propose a zzso method to improve the accuracy of gene identification systems at finding precise translation start zzso The new system, zzso is tested on a validated set of genes from zzso coli, for which it improves the accuracy of start site locations predicted by zzso gene finding systems from the range zzso to zzso zzso
