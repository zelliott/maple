We report the use of zzso radiation pressure with phase contrast zzso imaging to give an image zzso to the space zzso of a conventional phase contrast image in the direction of propagation of an zzso zzso zzso ultrasound is used to exert forces on objects within a body giving zzso of the order of tens to hundreds of zzso zzso of images made with and without the ultrasound field gives an image that removes low spatial frequency features and highlights high frequency zzso The method acts as an acoustic zzso zzso for phase contrast zzso imaging, which in soft tissue acts to highlight small density zzso
