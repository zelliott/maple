zzso changes of the zzso tissue at zzso are studied in zzso using optical zzso zzso The 200 to 600 zzso fat tissue slices are used in the zzso The observed change in the tissue structure was associated with fat cell zzso and destruction caused by the zzso zzso It is found that overall heating of a sample from room to zzso temperature leads to deeper and faster zzso tissue changes if other processing conditions are kept zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso treatment zzso fat cell zzso during some period after zzso
