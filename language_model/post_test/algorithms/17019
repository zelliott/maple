A procedure to detect similar local structures of proteins from C alpha coordinates is zzso First, the zzso of zzso zzso segments are zzso by a limited number of representatives, each of which is assigned a zzso Thus, the overall zzso of a protein is represented by a symbol zzso The comparison of these symbol strings using a sequence alignment technique then gives pairs of similar local zzso These pairs are considered candidates of structural zzso The application of the procedure to the analysis of 93 proteins gave zzso pairs of similar local structures, which included several well-known structural motifs such as the zzso beta alpha zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The characterization of zzso acid patterns of similar local structures given by the procedure should be useful for the development of protein structure prediction based on the acquisition of empirical rules from a large-scale zzso
