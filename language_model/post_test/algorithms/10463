zzso significant groups of zzso distribution zzso zzso units that are fuzzy by zzso This quality has been referred to in the literature but has not been analyzed in depth or zzso zzso The present work zzso zzso as fuzzy sets from a pragmatic perspective and basically focuses on the zzso and zzso implications of this zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso Peninsula was used as an example to explore the fuzzy nature of zzso The method on which this article is based is a widely used technique to define zzso This method involves the fuzziness that is inherent to the identification between degree of similarity and degree of membership and includes a zzso analysis of the zzso for the objective zzso of zzso The main innovation of this paper is a procedure to analyze zzso as fuzzy zzso zzso A set of fuzzy parameters to deal with the zzso interpretation of fuzzy zzso is also zzso A computer program has been developed and is freely zzso History may be related to the degree of fuzziness of zzso In our example, with zzso zzso in zzso less fuzzy zzso could have a historical explanation, and the internal fuzziness of zzso increases with their distance to hypothetical zzso zzso
