An inverse zzso model is presented that was employed to determine the optimum zzso joint zzso for a given zzso posture of the human zzso The zzso spine was zzso as an zzso zzso chain of five links that represented the five zzso zzso zzso An zzso equation with zzso constraints was employed to determine the zzso joint zzso zzso movements were measured from zzso X-ray films of 22 zzso The mean difference between the X-ray zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso plane and the values predicted by the zzso model was less than zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation R was used to measure the relationship between the measured and predicted zzso The zzso were found to be high, ranging from zzso to zzso for prediction of zzso zzso but poor for zzso translation zzso zzso It is concluded that the inverse zzso model will be clinically useful for predicting zzso rotation when X-ray or invasive zzso are zzso It will also be useful to zzso zzso which requires accurate zzso information as model input zzso
