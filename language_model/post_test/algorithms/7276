zzso zzso can be viewed as the surface of a zzso zzso In this paper, we seek to develop a zzso zzso interpretation of zzso by projecting it onto a zzso and subsequently modeling the zzso signal via zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso basis, we zzso derive several quantitative zzso and zzso estimate the diffusion zzso zzso we derive the integral transform describing the relationship between the diffusion signal and zzso on a zzso We also show that the zzso basis zzso less fitting parameters than other well-established methods to achieve comparable signal and better zzso zzso All in all, this work provides a new way of looking at zzso
