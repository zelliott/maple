zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have an important role in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess zzso the pattern of protein expression for these genes in 68 patients with zzso zzso and to determine the relation of protein expression to cancer development or coexistence of zzso Loss of expression of these genes also was evaluated as potential tumor markers for clinical zzso zzso and zzso both showed loss of expression in zzso of specimens from 18 patients with subsequent or zzso zzso zzso specimens from 50 patients who did not develop cancer (10 patients underwent zzso within 2 years; 40 had no zzso follow-up of zzso zzso expressed protein at a much higher frequency zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso with the strongest independent relation to subsequent or zzso zzso in a zzso multiple zzso zzso analysis was zzso zzso of the investigated factors as zzso markers for tumor development showed high specificity zzso for zzso zzso for zzso at the expense of sensitivity zzso for zzso zzso for zzso The results were compared with the results of the computerized image analysis algorithm, the zzso
