The use of zzso search data has been demonstrated to be effective at predicting influenza zzso This approach may be more successful for dengue which has large variation in annual zzso and a more distinctive clinical presentation and mode of zzso 

We gathered zzso dengue zzso data from Singapore zzso zzso zzso and Bangkok zzso zzso zzso Internet search data for the same period were downloaded from Google zzso for zzso Search terms were chosen to reflect three categories of zzso search: zzso zzso and zzso We compared three models to predict zzso a zzso linear regression, generalized zzso regression, and negative zzso zzso zzso zzso and Support zzso zzso zzso models were used to predict a zzso outcome defined by whether dengue zzso exceeded a chosen zzso zzso prediction models were assessed using zzso and zzso correlation between predicted and observed dengue zzso zzso and zzso model performance were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso Models were validated using multiple zzso zzso 

The linear model selected by zzso zzso was found to be superior to other models zzso In Bangkok, the model has an zzso zzso zzso and a correlation of zzso between fitted and zzso In Singapore, the model has an zzso zzso zzso and a correlation of zzso In both Singapore and Bangkok, zzso models outperformed zzso zzso in predicting periods of high zzso The zzso for the zzso models using the 75th zzso zzso is zzso in Singapore and zzso in zzso 

Internet search terms predict zzso and periods of large zzso of dengue with high accuracy and may prove useful in areas with zzso surveillance zzso The methods presented here use freely available data and analysis tools and can be readily adapted to other zzso
