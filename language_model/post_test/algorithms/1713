Our previous experience with colon injuries suggested that operative decisions based on a defined zzso improve zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso of this zzso in the face of an increased zzso of destructive injuries observed in recent zzso 

zzso patients with zzso penetrating colon injuries over an zzso period were zzso zzso algorithm, patients with zzso injuries underwent primary zzso Those with destructive wounds underwent zzso plus zzso in the absence of zzso or large zzso or zzso zzso requirements (more than 6 units packed zzso otherwise they were zzso Outcomes from the current study zzso zzso were compared with those from the previous study zzso zzso 

There were 252 patients who had zzso penetrating colon zzso 150 zzso patients had zzso colon wounds treated with primary repair and 102 patients zzso had destructive wounds zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar between zzso and zzso zzso Of the 102 patients with destructive injuries, zzso underwent zzso plus zzso and zzso underwent zzso Despite more destructive injuries managed in the zzso group zzso vs zzso zzso rate zzso vs zzso and zzso mortality zzso vs zzso were lower in the zzso zzso line failure was similar in zzso compared with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso to the zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso 

Despite an increase in the zzso of destructive colon injuries, our management zzso remains zzso zzso injuries associated with zzso or zzso zzso requirements of more than 6 units packed zzso and/or significant zzso are best managed with zzso By managing the majority of other destructive injuries with zzso plus zzso zzso low morbidity and mortality can be zzso
