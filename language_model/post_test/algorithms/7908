zzso and zzso reliability study for the identification of the zzso zzso zzso modifier by a panel of experts compared with a computer zzso 

To measure the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso modifier and determine if computer assistance using zzso spine models can improve the reliability of zzso 

The zzso modifier has been proposed to zzso zzso zzso curve types into A, B, and C on the basis of the relationship between the central zzso vertical line zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Landmarks for identification of the zzso have not been clearly zzso and the reliability of the actual zzso position and zzso modifier selection have never been tested zzso zzso the value of the zzso modifier for curve zzso remains zzso 

The zzso zzso of 68 patients with adolescent idiopathic zzso presenting a zzso type 1 curve were measured manually twice by 6 members of the zzso Research Society zzso zzso committee at 6 months zzso zzso and zzso reliability was zzso using the percentage of agreement and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso curve of all subjects was reconstructed in zzso using a zzso technique and was submitted to a computer zzso to zzso the zzso modifier according to zzso from the zzso 

zzso rates for the first trial showed a mean zzso value of zzso Second trial rates were higher with a mean zzso value of zzso zzso rates were evaluated at a mean zzso value of zzso The computer zzso was successful in identifying the zzso curve type and was in agreement with the observers by a proportion up to zzso 

zzso between and within observers for the zzso zzso modifier is only moderate to substantial with manual zzso Computer assistance with zzso models of the spine has the potential to decrease this zzso
