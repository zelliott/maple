Although most zzso interface zzso studies have focused on decoding zzso parameters of motion such as hand position and zzso it is known that motor cortical activity also zzso with kinetic signals, including active hand force and joint zzso Here, we attempted to reconstruct zzso zzso of the shoulder and elbow zzso from the activity of simultaneously recorded units in primary motor zzso zzso as monkeys zzso zzso made reaching movements in the horizontal zzso Using a linear filter decoding approach that considers the history of zzso activity up to one second in the past, we found zzso reconstruction performance nearly equal to that of Cartesian hand position and zzso despite the considerably greater bandwidth of the zzso zzso Moreover, the addition of delayed position and zzso feedback to the zzso decoder substantially improved the zzso zzso suggesting that simple zzso feedback may be useful to zzso zzso zzso These results may be relevant for zzso applications that require controlling devices with zzso physical dynamics or applying forces to the zzso
