Ensemble zzso activity was recorded in each layer of the zzso area of the primary zzso zzso zzso while rats performed a zzso tactile discrimination zzso zzso of this activity with zzso activity evoked by similar passive zzso stimulation revealed fundamental differences in tactile signal processing during active and passive zzso Moreover, significant zzso functional differences in zzso activity were observed during active zzso These differences could not be explained solely by variations in ascending zzso input to zzso Instead, these results suggest that zzso influences during active discrimination may alter the overall functional nature of zzso as well as zzso mechanisms of tactile zzso
