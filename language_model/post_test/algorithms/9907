One of the most commonly used tests to distinguish zzso from organic zzso dysfunction zzso is to monitor nocturnal penile zzso using the zzso device and its new software called zzso zzso To give a true estimate of the zzso ability of the new zzso software zzso zzso activity units zzso and rigidity activity units zzso we conducted this study on zzso zzso night records of 416 zzso zzso For study purposes, these records were transferred to a personal computer and classified as normal and zzso We recorded the zzso and zzso provided by the zzso software for each event separately and also for the total zzso We then estimated the diagnostic performance of these two parameters using zzso values with highest accuracy plotted against the previously reported normal and abnormal zzso We then made four new calculations to improve the diagnostic accuracy of zzso and zzso for the total zzso On zzso the highest diagnostic accuracy of zzso and zzso it ranged from zzso to zzso for the single best event and from zzso to zzso for the total zzso When using the newly zzso units, the highest diagnostic accuracy did not exceed zzso
