In zzso zzso zzso function to compact DNA and to regulate access to it both by simple physical zzso and by providing the zzso for numerous zzso zzso zzso While competition with other zzso factors and action of zzso zzso zzso significantly affect zzso formation in zzso zzso positions in zzso are determined by zzso exclusion and sequence zzso We have developed a zzso model, zzso for the sequence dependence of DNA zzso zzso and validated it against a collection of in zzso free energies of zzso formation and a set of in zzso zzso positions mapped at high zzso We have also made a first zzso zzso prediction of zzso DNA zzso and checked its accuracy against the zzso crystal zzso We have used zzso to design both strong and weak zzso binding zzso and measured the corresponding free energies of zzso zzso We find that zzso can successfully predict in zzso zzso positions and free zzso providing a physical explanation for the intrinsic sequence dependence of zzso zzso
