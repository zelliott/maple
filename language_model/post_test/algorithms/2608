To determine the repeat rate zzso of chest zzso acquired with portable zzso zzso zzso and installed direct zzso zzso and to develop and assess strategies designed to decrease the zzso 

The zzso and reasons for repeated digital chest zzso were documented over the course of 16 months while a task force of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and information technology specialists continued to examine the zzso for underlying zzso zzso decreasing the zzso were designed and zzso 

The initial zzso of digital chest zzso was zzso zzso for portable zzso and zzso zzso for installed DR zzso By combining zzso measurement with zzso analysis, targets for technical and teaching interventions were zzso The interventions decreased the zzso to zzso zzso for portable zzso and to zzso zzso for installed zzso 

We found the zzso of direct digital chest zzso to be significantly higher than that of zzso chest zzso We believe this is due to the ease with which repeat images can be obtained and discarded, and it suggests the need for ongoing surveillance of zzso We were able to demonstrate that strategies to lower the zzso which had been developed in the era of zzso imaging, can be adapted to the digital zzso On the basis of our findings, we encourage zzso to assess their own zzso zzso for direct digital chest zzso and to consider similar interventions if necessary to achieve acceptable zzso for this zzso
