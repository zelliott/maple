zzso is a common method to estimate the duration of zzso laser zzso In the ultraviolet zzso regime it is challenging to employ the process of zzso generation, most prominently due to zzso in zzso zzso at very short zzso Here we show how to zzso spontaneous zzso zzso zzso to generate an zzso signal in the infrared zzso for zzso zzso Our method zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso process, which occurs for low pumping powers zzso to the zzso power of the zzso zzso Thus, counting zzso zzso photons directly yields the zzso zzso The method, now with detection of zzso zzso is applied to the first direct measurement of zzso zzso zzso circulating inside a zzso enhancement zzso
