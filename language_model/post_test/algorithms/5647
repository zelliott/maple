A class of zzso zzso zzso filtering zzso is proposed based on locally zzso zzso zzso zzso To circumvent the stringent standard zzso conditions which are prohibitive to the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso models, we use the fact that zzso zzso learning zzso require only local zzso at the operating point in the zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso exponential function is locally zzso and, since local zzso extends to zzso products, and ratios, we show that a class of zzso zzso functions can serve as zzso functions in zzso and neural zzso zzso This provides a unifying framework for the derivation of zzso learning zzso in the zzso domain, and the derived zzso are shown to have the same generic form as their zzso and zzso zzso To make such models zzso optimal for the zzso of zzso signals (both circular and zzso we use recent developments in zzso zzso statistics to introduce widely linear versions of the proposed zzso zzso zzso valued zzso This allows full exploitation of zzso information in the data, contained both in the zzso and zzso to cater rigorously for zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding power mismatch in the signal zzso zzso over a range of circular and zzso synthetic processes and a real world 3-D zzso wind signal support the zzso
