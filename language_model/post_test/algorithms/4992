The first reported hybrid artificial neural zzso zzso zzso approach for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso More specifically, genetic zzso proved valuable in the determination of effective network structure with three defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection volume, zzso time of injection, and zzso zzso for the maximum conversion of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso obtained from the hybrid approach proved superior to an ANN model without zzso zzso in terms of training data and zzso zzso The model developed will likely prove useful for the analysis of other zzso reaction zzso
