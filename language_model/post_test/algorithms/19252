The zzso visual system has a zzso structure with extensive zzso zzso A model is proposed in which the feedback pathways serve to modify zzso sensory stimuli in ways that enhance and complete sensory input patterns, suppress irrelevant features, and generate zzso patterns when zzso stimulation is weak or zzso Such inversion of sensory coding and feature extraction can be achieved by zzso processes in which zzso responses derived from high-level neural zzso are used as cost functions to modify the filter properties of more peripheral sensory zzso An zzso algorithm, zzso which is used in the model, is readily implemented with known neural zzso The functioning of the system is investigated by computer zzso
