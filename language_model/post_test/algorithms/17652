zzso structures or zzso many of which are found in nature, are marked by the presence of a formal pattern that repeats itself even as the scale changes, a property termed zzso The zzso tree is structurally a zzso system and inspiration is a zzso zzso Our objective was to show that the dynamic process of zzso air from the zzso as measured by zzso sounds should also behave zzso over the period of time during which exhalation takes zzso 

Twenty zzso patients (9 males and 11 zzso aged zzso years with persistent but clinically stable moderate to severe asthma and a control group of 11 healthy zzso subjects (6 males and 5 zzso aged zzso years were zzso Respiratory sounds were registered using a microphone held by an elastic band directly against the patient's skin at the level of the zzso zzso Analysis was done on the average of three forced zzso made after a deep zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso range analysis zzso and by analysis of the zzso relationship of the zzso process zzso 

zzso of H and zzso were around zzso indicating that the sound signals were zzso over zzso The responses of controls and patients to zzso administration of 1 zzso zzso were similar zzso Mean zzso variation zzso were less than zzso 

This analysis of zzso sound during forced zzso maneuvers confirms the dynamic zzso behavior of the respiratory zzso
