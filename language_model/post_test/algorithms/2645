In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the distortion in zzso coding zzso Specifically, we analyze the prediction structure used to achieve zzso zzso and quality zzso of zzso video coding zzso and show that the average peak zzso ratio zzso of zzso is a weighted combination of the bit rates assigned to all the zzso Our analysis zzso the end user's preference for certain zzso We also propose a zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare its performance with that of a state-of-the-art zzso bit allocation zzso The reported experiment results demonstrate that the zzso zzso significantly zzso the compared approach in terms of the average zzso
