In quantitative zzso zzso selection of zzso outlines and background regions may account for considerable zzso This study of differential zzso function with zzso zzso zzso compares zzso background zzso with the zzso routine zzso the latter involves zzso zzso on data integrated over 1-3 minutes after zzso Other techniques considered were omission of background zzso and use of 1-2 minute zzso The normal range was established in 24 zzso patients who had a normal zzso and a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso The test set of 52 other zzso patients included 27 with zzso artery zzso All techniques correlated well with the routine method zzso zzso or zzso zzso however the zzso background technique was unique in preserving the depiction of zzso asymmetry but reducing the zzso of replicate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function increased the zzso of routine zzso but the zzso background zzso method performed better in this instance zzso zzso zzso Thus, the new technique appears to improve the definition of zzso outlines and increase the reliability of zzso of differential zzso zzso
