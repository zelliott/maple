zzso information in indoor environments can be procured using diverse zzso Due to the ubiquitous presence of zzso networks, positioning techniques in these environments are the scope of intense zzso This paper explores two strategies for space zzso when utilizing zzso zzso zzso Networks zzso structures for indoor zzso zzso A set of zzso ANN structures with different space zzso strategies are compared mutually and to the single ANN zzso The benefits of using zzso zzso structures are shown and discussed in terms of the size of the environment, number of zzso and zzso zzso The optimal zzso ANN structures with space zzso show up to 50% decrease in median error and up to zzso decrease in the average error with respect to the single ANN zzso Finally, the single ANN and the optimal zzso ANN model are compared against other well-known positioning zzso
