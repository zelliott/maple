The aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of titanium dioxide zzso zzso to a conventional zzso zzso on physical and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were incorporated into the powder component of zzso Plus zzso Czech zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso powder was used as zzso zzso zzso zzso strength, zzso strength and zzso bond strength were evaluated using a universal testing zzso Surface zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso Setting time was determined as specified in the zzso zzso The zzso activity was evaluated using direct contact test against zzso zzso zzso release and zzso analysis were carried zzso Data were zzso using zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso improved the fracture zzso zzso strength and zzso strength compared to the unmodified zzso However, a decrease in the mechanical properties was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compromised the surface zzso Setting time of zzso zzso zzso decreased but the values remained within zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to the conventional zzso did not compromise its bond strength with zzso or zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed a potent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso material with improved mechanical and zzso zzso This novel experimental zzso may be potentially used for higher zzso site zzso such as Class I and zzso
