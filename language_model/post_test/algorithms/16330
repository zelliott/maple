There are sometimes occasions when ultrasound zzso is performed with only a subset of the total data that will eventually be zzso The most obvious example is a zzso zzso probe in which the three-dimensional data block is formed from a set of individual zzso In these circumstances, zzso zzso can be used to improve the resolution of the zzso Unfortunately, most of these situations involve large blocks of three-dimensional zzso Furthermore, the ultrasound blur function varies zzso with distance from the zzso These two facts make the zzso process time-consuming to zzso This paper is about ways to address this problem and produce zzso zzso of large blocks of three-dimensional data in a matter of zzso We present two approaches, one based on hardware and the other based on zzso We compare the time they each take to achieve similar results and discuss the zzso resources and form of blur model that each zzso
