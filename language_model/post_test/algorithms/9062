This paper presents simulation of zzso activity through controlling a moving zzso We present two procedures to extract the initial movement frequency and zzso either through correlation calculus or through processing the zzso history of the zzso zzso We compare and discuss these two methods in terms of efficiency and the ability to retrieve motion zzso The correlation technique seems to be more suitable for monitoring zzso activity as it provides more reliable zzso zzso than the zzso history of the zzso zzso The evolution of zzso history of the zzso pattern parameters and their response sensibility with zzso and frequency variations have been studied and zzso zzso contrast appears to depend only on movement zzso whereas inertia moment varies with zzso and zzso
