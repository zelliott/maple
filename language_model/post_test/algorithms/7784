zzso of language regions in the dominant zzso can result in primary progressive zzso zzso a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive deficits in speech and/or language zzso Recent studies have identified three zzso of zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso semantic zzso zzso and zzso progressive zzso zzso Each zzso is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain zzso and different zzso of particular underlying zzso zzso which makes correct differential diagnosis highly clinically zzso zzso of linguistic behavior can be challenging for zzso and zzso findings in single subjects are often difficult to evaluate by zzso We investigated the utility of automated structural MR image analysis to discriminate zzso zzso zzso from each other and from normal controls zzso zzso images were zzso to obtain modulated zzso matter zzso zzso Feature selection was performed with principal components analysis zzso on zzso images as well as images of zzso zzso PC zzso were classified with linear support zzso machines, and a zzso scheme was used to obtain accuracy rates for zzso to novel zzso The overall mean accuracy in discriminating between pairs of groups was zzso For one pair of groups, zzso and zzso we also investigated the utility of including several linguistic variables as zzso Models with both imaging and linguistic features performed better than models with only imaging or only linguistic zzso These results suggest that automated methods could assist in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso enabling therapies to be targeted to likely underlying zzso
