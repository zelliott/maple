We are witnessing rapid progress in the development of zzso for building the zzso gene regulatory networks involving both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There are a few tools available to do these jobs but most of them are not easy to use and not accessible zzso A web server is especially needed in order to allow users to upload experimental expression zzso and build zzso regulatory networks corresponding to their particular zzso 

In this work, we compiled putative zzso zzso and zzso regulatory relationships from zzso pipelines and curated them as built-in data zzso We streamlined the R codes of our two separate zzso engineering zzso for zzso gene regulatory network construction and zzso them as two major functional zzso As a result, we released the zzso zzso Gene Regulatory Networks zzso a web server for constructing zzso gene regulatory networks through integrated engineering of zzso sequence information and gene expression zzso The zzso enables two major zzso zzso one for zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and the other for parallel zzso expression zzso A zzso zzso zzso regulatory cascade is the output of the first module and a comprehensive zzso network involving all three types of zzso regulations zzso zzso and zzso are the output of the second zzso 

In this article we propose zzso a web server for building zzso gene regulatory networks through integrated engineering of zzso sequence information and gene expression zzso Since parallel zzso expression zzso are rapidly accumulated by the advance of next-generation sequencing techniques, zzso will be very useful tool for researchers to build zzso gene regulatory networks based on expression zzso The zzso zzso is free and available online at zzso
