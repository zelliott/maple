The goal of this study is to develop a matching zzso that can handle large geometric changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso lung geometry occurring during deep breath zzso These geometric relationships are further zzso to build a dynamic lung airway model for zzso fluid dynamics zzso studies of pulmonary air zzso The proposed zzso is based on a cubic zzso hybrid registration framework that incorporates zzso landmark information with intensity zzso A sequence of zzso zzso is composed in a zzso framework to ensure local zzso of the large deformation transformation and a zzso meaningful similarity measure is adopted to compensate for changes in zzso intensity due to zzso zzso are performed using the proposed approach to match six pairs of zzso CT human lung zzso zzso show that the proposed approach has the ability to match the intensity pattern and the anatomical landmarks, and ensure local zzso for large deformation zzso zzso results also show that the proposed hybrid approach yields significantly improved results as compared with approaches using either landmarks or intensity zzso
