In this paper, generalized synchronization of two chaotic systems is zzso The auxiliary system approach, which is suggested by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso E 53, zzso zzso is used to detect and study generalized zzso Based on the zzso method and zzso measure, some less restrictive criteria are obtained to guarantee the zzso stability of the error system between the response system and the auxiliary system, which indicates the zzso systems are synchronized in a general zzso It is shown that the feedback gain can be reduced by means of the zzso measure approach, compared to the norm zzso All theoretical results are illustrated by zzso and zzso zzso
