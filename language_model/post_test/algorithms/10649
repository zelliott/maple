zzso zzso receptors comprise three types of G zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The OR zzso contains over 1,000 genes in some zzso species, representing the largest gene zzso in the zzso zzso 

To facilitate an informed analysis of OR gene zzso we identified the complete set of 143 OR genes in the zzso zzso as well as the OR zzso in two zzso species, zzso (44 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso analyzed here contain fewer genes than in zzso species, the zzso OR genes can be grouped into a larger number of major zzso representing greater overall OR diversity in the zzso 

Based on the zzso of fish and zzso zzso we propose a model for OR gene evolution in which different ancestral OR genes or gene families were selectively lost or expanded in different zzso zzso In addition, our calculations of the ratios of zzso to synonymous zzso zzso among more recently expanding OR zzso in zzso zzso zzso that may be involved in zzso zzso
