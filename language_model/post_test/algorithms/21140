Compared to filtered back projection zzso zzso with resolution recovery zzso and wide beam reconstruction zzso zzso which resolve resolution and suppress noise simultaneously during zzso have been shown to zzso zzso zzso zzso quality, even with low count density zzso zzso We zzso that their characteristics would be advantageous for gated zzso where each frame is only zzso the count density of the summed zzso zzso 

An 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso protocol was zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cycle zzso scans were acquired with 90 degrees zzso zzso detectors equipped with high resolution zzso in 156 zzso In 82 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso defects gated image quality was graded zzso 1 zzso zzso Regional zzso wall motion zzso was zzso 0 zzso zzso in a total of 50 vascular territories with zzso Using zzso software zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for each zzso Additionally, for purposes of comparison, the zzso gated zzso were processed with other commercially available packages, Emory zzso and zzso zzso 

Despite zzso acquisitions, compared to zzso image quality increased marginally with zzso zzso zzso zzso but very significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso score was greater only for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although quantitative parameters correlated well with those determined by zzso (all zzso zzso zzso zzso all volume zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso primarily due to a decrease in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso differences in these parameters were of similar magnitude to differences encountered among the commercially available software zzso 

zzso zzso and particularly zzso improve gated zzso diagnostic quality compared to full-time zzso due to increased resolution and reduced zzso However, these zzso which affect zzso edge zzso result in a systematic offset in zzso zzso and zzso
