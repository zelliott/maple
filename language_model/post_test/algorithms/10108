Copy number zzso zzso are known to cause zzso forms of Parkinson disease zzso most notably in zzso and zzso zzso has a zzso mode of zzso however, recent evidence demonstrates that a single zzso in zzso (but not a single zzso zzso may increase risk for zzso We recently performed a zzso association study for zzso that excluded individuals known to have either a zzso zzso or two zzso zzso Data from the zzso zzso were zzso using only white individuals with high quality intensity data, and zzso calls were made using two zzso zzso and zzso After quality assessment, the final sample included zzso cases and zzso zzso zzso varied between the two zzso calling zzso for many regions, including the zzso locus zzso p zzso zzso for zzso and p zzso zzso for zzso However, there was consistent evidence with both zzso for two novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to be larger, and all instances that were zzso tested were zzso In contrast, the zzso in both novel zzso were smaller and failed to replicate using real-time zzso zzso and gel zzso The zzso variation is more akin to a zzso than a typical zzso and the association is likely caused by artifact due to DNA zzso DNA for all the cases was derived from whole blood, while the DNA for all controls was derived from zzso cell zzso The zzso locus contains many zzso with low minor zzso frequency leading to a loss of zzso that may have been zzso interpreted by the zzso calling zzso as support for a zzso Thus, only the zzso within the zzso locus could be zzso validated and associated with zzso zzso
