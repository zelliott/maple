We study the behavior of different zzso of the zzso reduced density zzso zzso for systems with fractional zzso of the total zzso We define these systems as ensembles of zzso spin zzso It is shown that, similarly to density functional theory, the error in the zzso of zzso molecules is directly related to the zzso from constancy of the atomic total energies as functions of the fractional zzso However, several zzso of the zzso show a size inconsistency which leads to additional zzso We also investigate the difference between a direct evaluation of the energy of an ensemble of zzso systems and a direct zzso of the energy of a zzso zzso
