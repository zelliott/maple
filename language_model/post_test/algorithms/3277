We study the zzso dynamics of series zzso of zzso junctions in the zzso limit, where N is the number of junctions in the zzso The junctions are assumed to be zzso zzso driven by a constant bias zzso and globally coupled through a common zzso Previous simulations of such zzso revealed that their dynamics are remarkably simple, hinting at the presence of some hidden symmetry or other zzso These observations were later explained by the discovery of zzso zzso of motion, the choice of which confines the resulting flow in phase space to a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso can be reduced further by restricting attention to a special family of states recently identified by zzso and zzso In geometric terms, the zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso of dimension one less than that found zzso We derive and analyze the flow on this zzso for two special zzso an array with purely zzso loading and another with zzso zzso Our results recover (and in some instances zzso earlier findings based on zzso zzso
