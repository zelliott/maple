Two zzso can be used to measure portal zzso zzso zzso with contrast zzso single-level liver zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso use data from the portal vein and zzso zzso This study compared zzso values obtained with direct and with indirect zzso in a series of zzso 

Both techniques were applied in 27 patients with zzso zzso men and 13 zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso and 18 control patients zzso men and 11 zzso zzso years zzso zzso A single section through the liver was scanned after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso 320 zzso of zzso per zzso 

Both techniques showed reduced zzso in patients with zzso zzso for direct and zzso for indirect zzso compared with control patients zzso and zzso respectively), but only the direct method agreed with zzso expectations based on animal and human zzso In separating zzso and control patients, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly greater for the direct method zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 

Both direct and indirect methods are feasible and distinguish well between zzso and control patients, but the direct method is more zzso and is preferable if portal zzso data are zzso
