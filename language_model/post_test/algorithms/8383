As clinical trials of zzso zzso zzso zzso are initiated in the zzso and other countries, new treatment planning codes are being developed to calculate detailed dose zzso in zzso zzso The thorough evaluation and comparison of treatment planning codes is a critical step toward the eventual zzso of zzso which, in turn, is an essential element for the rational comparison of clinical results from different zzso In this paper we report development of a reference suite of zzso test problems for zzso zzso and discuss common issues encountered in these calculations to facilitate quantitative evaluations and comparisons of zzso treatment planning zzso Specifically, detailed zzso rate zzso were calculated using the zzso Carlo radiation transport code zzso for four different representations of the modified zzso head zzso an zzso zzso zzso model, and zzso representations of this model with cubic zzso sizes of 16, 8, and 4 zzso zzso and zzso beams of zzso zzso 1, 2, 10, 100, and 1000 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1, 2, 5, and 10 zzso photons were individually simulated to calculate zzso rates to a statistical uncertainty of zzso (1 zzso zzso in the center of the head zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso beam with a broad zzso spectrum, similar to zzso beams currently used or proposed for zzso clinical trials, was zzso for all zzso The zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso rates calculated with the 4 and 8 zzso zzso models were within zzso and zzso respectively, of those calculated for the zzso zzso The 16 zzso zzso model produced unacceptably large discrepancies for all dose zzso The effects from different zzso data sets and tissue compositions were zzso zzso the zzso data from zzso 46 to zzso 63 data produced less than zzso difference in zzso rate zzso The zzso profile data, zzso Carlo code zzso zzso factors, and model construction files are available zzso to aid in zzso new and existing zzso treatment planning zzso
