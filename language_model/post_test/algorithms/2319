A series of image analysis zzso zzso geometry methodology, and a zzso zzso procedure have been developed to zzso zzso the zzso layout, and the true density of zzso zzso spines observed at the light (or zzso microscope zzso First, the image of a zzso zzso of interest (in the plane of zzso is scaled to a standard brightness scale, and the zzso profile is separated from the background using a computerized zzso zzso that analyzes the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the resulting zzso image of the zzso is transformed to a zzso skeleton that zzso the zzso zzso zzso skeletal branch lengths are directly zzso (in zzso thus giving objective measures of visible spine lengths and zzso distances along the zzso zzso These raw data are the basis for zzso an zzso of the distribution of zzso spine zzso and zzso a nearest zzso analysis of the spine layout along the zzso A zzso zzso routine, the tilting zzso is suggested for unbiased zzso of the true zzso density of spines along zzso The routine involves tilting the zzso zzso of interest around its zzso axis for a known angular sector and scoring the number of spines seen in one angular position and unseen in the other zzso Data from a study of zzso zzso in the chick zzso are zzso
