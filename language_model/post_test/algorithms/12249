The optimal method of treatment for acute zzso zzso continues to be zzso 

The reported lower zzso rate for zzso treated patients is an effect of zzso end zzso during the healing process, and patients in whom zzso can be demonstrated using ultrasound will have a similar rate of zzso if treated zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

The authors reviewed all patients with an Achilles zzso zzso who were treated to a standard protocol during a zzso period zzso Patients with a gap of 5 zzso or more in zzso on ultrasound underwent zzso those with a gap of less than 5 zzso received zzso zzso All patients were followed up to a minimum of 12 zzso 

After zzso 125 patients were zzso 67 treated zzso and 58 zzso There were 2 zzso in the zzso group and 1 with zzso There was no significant difference between the groups for any zzso 

Reduction of zzso and surgery risks may be possible using dynamic ultrasound case zzso Further studies are needed to show whether functional results are the same with surgical and zzso treatment when dynamic ultrasound criteria are used for case zzso
