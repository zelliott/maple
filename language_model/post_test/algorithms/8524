zzso of the zzso zzso and current zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso channel were investigated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso in primary cultured zzso from zzso mice shifted the zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso thereby restoring zzso zzso zzso zzso and current zzso The increased zzso current zzso in zzso cells was abolished in zzso from animals of 4 weeks and older whereas the positive shift in zzso zzso was independent of mouse zzso Raising zzso zzso levels using the zzso analogue zzso led to an increase in zzso current zzso in zzso cells to the level in zzso zzso There was no effect on the current zzso in zzso cells or on the zzso zzso in either zzso zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso protein zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso current zzso and zzso zzso but diminished the current zzso in zzso zzso without affecting the zzso zzso in these zzso These data show that the increased zzso influx in zzso lacking the zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso current zzso is determined by the zzso zzso The effect on current zzso depends on the age of the mice and its zzso zzso appears to be controlled by the zzso zzso
