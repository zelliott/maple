In zzso zzso phase II clinical trials to evaluate efficacy of cancer treatments using a response zzso one typically identifies a single reference response rate to be the zzso hypothesis zzso Patients eligible for the trial are assumed to have this response rate on average under the zzso zzso When patients arise from zzso having different response rates, this single response rate reference may not be appropriate for the particular mix of patients actually enrolled on the zzso As a result, the Type I and Type II error rates conditional on the mix of enrolled patients may differ considerably from the unconditional error rates used to design the zzso We describe a method for designing zzso Phase II studies that accounts for patient zzso and effectively zzso conditional Type I and Type II error over the range of patient mixes that are likely to zzso Use of the design requires good estimates of the expected response rate within each population stratum as well as the stratum membership zzso but its properties are similar to and often preferable to the standard zzso design even in situations where the underlying assumptions do not hold zzso
