zzso plasticity zzso has been observed in many brain areas such as sensory zzso where it is hypothesized to structure synaptic connections between zzso Previous studies have demonstrated how zzso can capture zzso information at short zzso using specific input zzso such as zzso zzso spike patterns and zzso spike zzso However, the corresponding zzso in the case of arbitrary input signals is still zzso This paper provides an overarching picture of the zzso inherent to zzso tying together many previous results for commonly used models of zzso zzso For a single zzso with plastic zzso zzso we show how zzso performs a spectral analysis on the zzso zzso between its zzso spike zzso The zzso responses and zzso learning window determine kernel functions that specify how the zzso zzso the input zzso We thus zzso this zzso learning scheme as zzso spectral component zzso zzso In particular, the whole input correlation structure must be considered since all plastic zzso compete with each zzso We find that zzso is enhanced when zzso zzso zzso gradual synaptic zzso For a zzso zzso with a zzso response and zzso zzso alone, we find that zzso resembles principal component analysis zzso However, plain zzso does not isolate correlation sources in general, zzso when they are mixed among the input spike zzso In other words, it does not perform independent component analysis zzso zzso the zzso to a single correlation source can be achieved when zzso is paired with a zzso mechanism that reinforces the competition between synaptic zzso Our results suggest that zzso networks equipped with zzso can process signals zzso in the transient zzso activity at the zzso of tens of milliseconds for usual zzso
