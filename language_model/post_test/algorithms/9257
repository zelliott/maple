The authors present an integrated approach to zzso free energy zzso which permits efficient calculation of the free energy difference on rugged energy zzso The method is designed to obtain efficient zzso sampling for rapid free energy zzso The proposal is motivated by the insight that both the exchange efficiency in the presently designed zzso zzso zzso replica exchange method zzso and the confidence of the free energy determination using the overlap zzso method, depend on the same zzso zzso the zzso of the energy difference zzso between all pairs of neighboring zzso zzso zzso these two techniques can produce a joint solution to the problems of the free energy convergence and zzso sampling in the free energy simulations, in which zzso zzso plays two roles to simultaneously facilitate the zzso sampling and improve the phase space overlap for the free energy zzso Specifically, in contrast with other zzso zzso based free energy simulation methods, the zzso approach can ensure robust zzso zzso Due to these features (a synergistic solution to the free energy convergence and zzso zzso and the improvement of the sampling efficiency with the zzso zzso the present approach, as demonstrated in the model studies of the authors, is highly efficient in obtaining accurate free energy differences, especially for the systems with rough energy zzso
