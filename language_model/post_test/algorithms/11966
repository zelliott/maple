zzso is a program to predict genes in anonymous zzso sequences designed with a zzso zzso In the first step, zzso sites, and start and stop zzso are predicted and scored along the sequence using position weight zzso zzso In the second step, zzso are built from the zzso zzso are scored as the sum of the scores of the defining sites, plus the zzso ratio of a zzso model for coding zzso In the last step, from the set of predicted zzso the gene structure is zzso maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled zzso In this paper we describe the zzso of zzso for sites, and the zzso model of coding DNA in zzso zzso We also compare other models of coding DNA with the zzso zzso Finally, we present and discuss the results obtained when zzso is used to predict genes in the zzso zzso These results show that the accuracy of zzso predictions compares currently with that of other existing tools but that zzso is likely to be more efficient in terms of speed and memory zzso
