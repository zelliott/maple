In this paper, we present a novel zzso measure for object shape zzso The proposed method is based on the idea of generating pairs of points from a set and measuring the probability that a point dividing the corresponding line segments belongs to the same zzso The measure is directly zzso to image functions representing shapes and also to zzso images which approximate image zzso The approach introduced gives rise to a variety of zzso measures which make it possible to obtain more information about the object zzso The proposed measure turns out to be easy to implement using the Fast zzso zzso and we will consider this in zzso Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our measure in different situations and compare it to other similar zzso
