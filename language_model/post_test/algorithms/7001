A zzso test was applied to determine elastic zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Three zzso zzso with nominal zzso of 20, 5 and 1 zzso were used and zzso cycles were zzso Each cycle provided E and contact pressure or Meyer's zzso The plot of contact pressure versus penetration depth was converted into a zzso zzso zzso relationship, which was used to select the optimum maximum zzso force for each zzso The results were compared with those determined by the conventional triangular zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparable E value, irrespective of zzso was zzso zzso and the 1 zzso zzso was able to provide E values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The H values generated with the zzso zzso technique were comparable to those determined by the zzso zzso technique at zzso strains of zzso and zzso for the 1 and 5 zzso zzso
