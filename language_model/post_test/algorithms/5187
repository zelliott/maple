zzso of zzso complexes from the coordinates of their zzso components usually starts by generating many potential predictions from a zzso zzso search followed by a second stage that aims to refine such zzso Here, we present and evaluate a new method to effectively address the complexity and sampling requirements of the initial exhaustive zzso In this approach we combine the projection of the interaction terms into zzso zzso zzso with the efficiency of zzso zzso approximations to accelerate the zzso The binding energy upon complex formation is zzso as a correlation function composed of van der zzso zzso and zzso potential zzso The zzso zzso are identified by a novel, fast and exhaustive zzso zzso search combined with a simple zzso zzso zzso obtained on standard zzso benchmarks demonstrate its general zzso and zzso The accuracy is comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art initial exhaustive zzso zzso tools, but achieving superior zzso Moreover, a parallel version of the method performs the zzso search in just a few minutes, opening new application opportunities in the current zzso zzso
