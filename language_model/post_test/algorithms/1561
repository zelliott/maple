The production of graceful skeletal movements requires coordinated zzso of multiple muscles that produce zzso around multiple zzso The work described zzso is focused on one such movement, stance, that requires coordinated zzso of zzso muscles acting around the hip, knee and ankle zzso The forces evoked in these muscles by external stimulation all have a complex dependence on muscle length and zzso zzso and some of these muscles are zzso In order to recreate zzso maneuvers in the zzso zzso we excited the hind limb zzso using zzso zzso stimulation zzso of the muscular branch of the zzso zzso the zzso nerve and the main branch of the zzso zzso zzso was achieved with either acutely or chronically implanted Utah zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso that activated motor units in the zzso muscles of the hip, knee and ankle zzso zzso that were able to evoke large extension forces and zzso that zzso minimal zzso of the targeted motor zzso Three hind limb zzso strategies were investigated, including sequential zzso of independent motor units to increase force, and zzso or simultaneous zzso of three sets of six or more zzso zzso that excited the hip, knee and ankle zzso All zzso strategies evoked stance, but the zzso zzso strategy also reduced muscle fatigue produced by repeated zzso maneuvers compared with fatigue produced by simultaneous zzso of different motor zzso zzso These results demonstrate the use of zzso zzso as a means to recreate zzso zzso zzso muscle forces in the unilateral hind zzso This muscle zzso paradigm could provide a promising zzso approach for the restoration of zzso transitions in individuals who are paralyzed by spinal zzso injury, stroke or zzso
