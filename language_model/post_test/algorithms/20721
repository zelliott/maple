In this note, we employ the new geometric active zzso models formulated in zzso and zzso for edge detection and zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound medical zzso Our method is based on defining zzso metrics on a given image which in turn leads to a novel snake paradigm in which the feature of interest may be considered to lie at the bottom of a potential zzso Thus, the snake is attracted very quickly and efficiently to the desired zzso
