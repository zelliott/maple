The zzso zzso and statistical techniques usually used to zzso zzso data do not inherently represent the underlying zzso zzso a hybrid approach involving characteristics of both supervised and zzso learning is zzso This approach is based on template matching in which the interaction of the variables of inherent zzso and the ability to express the zzso zzso are zzso zzso normal zzso cells and zzso cancer cells of different zzso were grown in conventional two-dimensional tissue culture and in three dimensions on zzso zzso zzso that were either zzso or restrictive for expression of the zzso zzso The zzso represents the effects of two zzso zzso and the zzso effect of zzso By assigning values to each of the biological variables of inherent zzso and the ability to express the zzso zzso a template was constructed, which zzso the interaction between zzso Gene expression zzso both positively and zzso with the template was observed, but when zzso correlations were carried out, the different models for the template zzso on the same actual zzso A subset of 21 genes was identified, which correlated with two a zzso models or an zzso model above the zzso confidence limits identified in a zzso zzso with zzso permutations of the data zzso The correlation zzso of expression of several genes were zzso zzso Analysis of upstream zzso regulatory elements zzso confirmed that these genes were not a randomly selected set of zzso Several zzso were identified as significantly zzso in the sample of 20 genes for which zzso were identified, and the high correlations of several genes were consistent with zzso zzso The authors suggest that the template method can be used to identify a unique set of genes for further zzso
