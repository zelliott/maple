In recent years, there has been increasing use of zzso imaging in patients with zzso zzso to evaluate for zzso Given the critical role of the zzso input function for generation of accurate zzso data, several studies have evaluated the effect of varying the zzso input function location in patients with acute zzso Our aim was to determine the effect on quantitative zzso data when the zzso input function location is zzso to significant zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

A retrospective study was conducted of patients with zzso zzso admitted from 2005 to zzso zzso criteria were the presence of at least 1 anterior cerebral artery or zzso vessel with a zzso significant zzso and at least 1 of these vessels without zzso We zzso each zzso zzso 4 separate times by using standardized methods, only varying the selection of the zzso input function location in the anterior cerebral artery and zzso zzso For each of the 4 separately processed examinations for each patient, quantitative data for zzso zzso and zzso were calculated by zzso sampling of the vascular zzso zzso analysis was performed by using a linear zzso zzso 

One hundred twelve uniquely processed zzso levels were analyzed in 28 patients zzso age, 52 years; 24 women and 4 zzso recruited from January 2005 to December zzso The average Hunt and Hess scale score was zzso zzso zzso The average time to zzso from initial presentation was zzso zzso zzso zzso For each vascular territory zzso and left anterior cerebral artery, zzso zzso cerebral zzso there were no significant differences in the quantitative zzso zzso and zzso generated by zzso input function locations zzso to significant zzso compared with zzso vessels zzso zzso zzso 

zzso input function placement zzso to significant zzso does not affect the quantitative zzso data in the corresponding vascular territory or any other vascular territory in zzso zzso
