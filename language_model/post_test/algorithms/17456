The zzso zzso generated against the zzso toxin zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso Hoffmann zzso the effect of both the toxin and the zzso We cloned and zzso the genes coding for the zzso zzso of zzso A three-dimensional zzso model of the zzso zzso was generated using a zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso model of the complex zzso was built using the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso structure of zzso and experimental results on a putative zzso region around the N and C zzso The initial complex zzso were submitted to a new refinement procedure of zzso energy zzso combined with zzso molecular zzso The final complex, selected after an extensive zzso uses the loop zzso as the central part of the zzso The generated complex allows the following zzso 1) the zzso capacity of zzso toward the zzso of zzso zzso might rather be caused by the high zzso concentration and toxicity of zzso than by a broad zzso 2) the region involved in the binding of zzso to the zzso channel, should overlap with the employed zzso region, and 3) contact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are candidates for zzso to broaden its zzso zzso zzso
