The zzso time zzso is useful for identifying zzso factor deficits after zzso bypass zzso However, long processing times and the need for fresh frozen plasma zzso to be thawed cause delays in factor zzso We hypothesized that, by treating with zzso blood sampled toward the end of zzso can provide zzso results that help to determine the requirement for zzso after zzso Laboratory delays can be eliminated with zzso zzso We studied 158 adults undergoing zzso cardiac zzso Blood taken before separation from zzso was mixed with zzso and zzso was measured in the laboratory with a zzso zzso zzso between these results and laboratory zzso of blood taken after systemic zzso were compared by using zzso and Altman plots with the threshold of zzso zzso We found that the laboratory zzso zzso during zzso versus after zzso were zzso but the limits of agreement exceeded these zzso Similarly, there was unsatisfactory agreement between the zzso and laboratory zzso results measured before, zzso and after zzso For each zzso measured during zzso the corresponding confidence zzso for the zzso zzso was zzso During zzso a laboratory zzso of zzso or zzso s or zzso or zzso s suggests a zzso or zzso or zzso or zzso probability of not requiring or potentially zzso respectively, zzso after zzso We conclude that the majority of zzso zzso obtained from blood taken before weaning from zzso and treated in zzso with zzso was associated with a high probability of whether or not zzso would be needed after zzso 

zzso dysfunction after zzso bypass may contribute to zzso zzso zzso tests and fresh frozen plasma requires time and delays treatment in patients who need fresh frozen zzso We have devised a technique to provide early zzso of zzso zzso zzso
