This paper presents theoretical and zzso studies of zzso zzso using hard zzso rays, from the viewpoint of imaging and reconstruction methods for cell zzso The proposed system employs a zzso zzso in zzso zzso transmission geometry to efficiently detect the higher spatial frequency components of an zzso zzso distribution, and to effectively suppress interference between the zzso wave field and the wave field zzso by the zzso This system features acquisition of a single projection by a single exposure using a simple geometry and aggressive use of zzso zzso zzso We present the physical description of the imaging method using the zzso zzso zzso derived from the Born zzso First, we demonstrate that the reconstruction leads to the zzso zzso We then describe a reconstruction zzso based on the classical zzso zzso Finally, we show the efficacy of this system by computer zzso Our simulation demonstrates that the imaging system zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter in a phase object 400 zzso in zzso
