Medical management of suspected radiation casualties requires use of zzso zzso because no single zzso measurement is sufficiently zzso This report describes the design and zzso used in a radiation exposure assessment software application that serves as a diagnostic utility for zzso and medical treatment zzso as well as to convey psychological reassurance, for zzso assessment of radiation zzso and for surge response assessment for mass zzso zzso 

The Armed Forces zzso Research Institute's Biological zzso Research Program developed the integrated zzso zzso Assessment zzso computer program using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 with various second party zzso and zzso zzso zzso were adopted by analyzing data from merged databases of human radiation exposure incidents and normal controls zzso zzso The results are summarized in zzso zzso 

BAT zzso are presented and compared to other previously published dose assessment zzso based on biological indicators zzso onset of zzso zzso depletion zzso These new zzso are incorporated into a computer-based program that assists zzso and medical providers in recording relevant diagnostic information and assessing significant radiation zzso It promotes zzso zzso zzso data collection after a radiation exposure incident and provides data templates for entry of diagnostic information using zzso zzso It allows for recording of relevant clinical information and summarizes diagnostic information such as estimated zzso zzso Data can be printed and zzso in accordance with civilian and military zzso
