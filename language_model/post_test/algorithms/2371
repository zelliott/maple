This study assessed the zzso accuracy of previously published zzso zzso analysis equations for zzso zzso mass of young zzso zzso Hispanic women (N zzso zzso The reference method was zzso weighing at residual lung zzso Body density was converted to percent body fat using the zzso zzso Resistance and zzso were measured with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis equations of zzso zzso zzso Segal, Gray, and Van Loan were zzso There were significant correlations between criterion and predicted zzso mass zzso zzso zzso for all zzso The standard error of estimate for each equation was zzso however, the total error for the zzso zzso zzso and the Van Loan zzso zzso equations exceeded the recommended value zzso zzso For all zzso the difference between average criterion and predicted zzso mass was significant zzso zzso zzso However, the mean differences for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Gray zzso zzso equations were zzso In conclusion, the Segal, zzso and Gray equations may have potential for assessing the body composition of healthy, zzso Hispanic zzso
