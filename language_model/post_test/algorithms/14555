This paper explores an application of support zzso zzso for zzso control of an zzso aerial vehicle zzso Unlike neural networks, support zzso zzso zzso generates global solutions, because zzso basically zzso zzso programming zzso zzso With this advantage, the zzso zzso inverse dynamic model and the compensation term for the inversion error are identified zzso which we call zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to compensate for the inversion error and the unexpected uncertainty, an online adaptation zzso for the zzso is zzso Then, the stability of the overall error dynamics is analyzed by the zzso ultimately bounded property in the zzso system zzso In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso zzso zzso simulations are performed on the zzso zzso
