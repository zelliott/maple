zzso ability in the frontal lobe (among other brain zzso relies on the assignment of value to states of the animal and its zzso Then higher valued states can be pursued and lower (or zzso valued states zzso The same principle forms the basis for zzso reinforcement learning zzso which have been fruitfully applied both as models of value zzso in the brain, and as artificial controllers in their own zzso This work shows how state zzso signals zzso from frontal lobe zzso as measured with zzso zzso zzso can be applied as zzso to an adaptable artificial learning agent in order to guide its acquisition of zzso A set of experiments carried out on an alert zzso demonstrate that both zzso and zzso zzso in the frontal lobe show differences in response to both primarily and zzso desirable zzso zzso zzso This difference allows a zzso signal zzso to serve successfully as a zzso for an zzso controller performing a virtual zzso zzso The agent's zzso allows its performance to exceed the limits of the zzso zzso decoding zzso We also show that decoding state zzso is more accurate when using relative zzso of both zzso and zzso rather than either species zzso
