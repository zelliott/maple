zzso Although secondary structure predictions are only zzso correct, the computer programs provide some idea as to zzso zzso zzso The detection of zzso zzso in zzso proteins allowed the identification of membrane zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A combination of computer analyses of protein zzso and the identification of functional zzso in zzso must be substantiated by experimental zzso zzso Computer analyses of membrane proteins may provide a theoretical approach to the selection and development of antibiotics capable of interfering with the zzso and function of viral proteins in cellular zzso
