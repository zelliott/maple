zzso zzso detects the zzso magnetic fields as generated by zzso electric currents arising from synaptic zzso zzso It is zzso has excellent zzso resolution, and it can zzso zzso activity with good zzso For these reasons, many scientists interested in the zzso of brain functions have turned to zzso The technique, however, is not without its zzso Those reluctant to employ it cite its relative zzso among pediatric populations because zzso requires subjects to be fairly still during zzso Due to these zzso challenges, infant zzso studies are not commonly zzso In the present study, zzso was employed to study auditory discrimination in zzso We had two zzso first, to determine whether reliable results could be obtained from infants despite their zzso and second, to improve zzso data analysis zzso To get more reliable results from infants we employed novel hardware zzso zzso tracking zzso and software zzso space separation method, zzso solutions to better deal with noise and zzso With these solutions, the location and orientation of the head can be tracked in real time and we were able to reduce noise and artifacts originating outside the helmet zzso In the present study, these new methods were used to study the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in response to duration changes in harmonic tones in sleeping, healthy, zzso zzso Our findings indicate that with the use of these new analysis zzso zzso will prove to be a very useful and more accessible experimental technique among pediatric zzso
