zzso times zzso and zzso of the bone zzso zzso and zzso bone volume fraction zzso in the zzso were measured for 100 female volunteers using a compact zzso system at zzso T field zzso The speed of sound zzso through the zzso was measured also for the same subjects using a quantitative ultrasound zzso Both relaxation times were found to have positive correlations with age (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and negative correlations with zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Although zzso had a fairly high positive correlation with the zzso (R zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso were correlated with zzso (R zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the age dependence of both zzso and zzso is caused by the zzso properties of the zzso molecules in bone zzso observed using acoustic or elastic zzso
