One challenge in zzso chemistry is the design of zzso zzso building blocks to attain total control of arrangement of matter at a molecular zzso We have achieved reliable prediction and design of the three-dimensional structure of artificial zzso building blocks to generate molecular zzso puzzle units called zzso They can be programmed with control over their zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso into a variety of complex zzso zzso with zzso periodic and zzso patterns and finite zzso This work emphasizes the modular and zzso characteristics of zzso by showing that small zzso structural motifs can code the precise zzso of large molecular zzso It demonstrates that fully zzso materials based on zzso can be zzso and provides insights into zzso processes involving large populations of zzso zzso
