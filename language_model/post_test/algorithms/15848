A major barrier to the understanding, development and zzso of natural product complex zzso zzso has been the lack of zzso during zzso efficacy and safety zzso In addition, it has been our experience that no single zzso system or model is adequate for assessing zzso efficacy and safety of these zzso To address these important issues, our laboratory group has developed a sequential zzso protocol for the zzso evaluation of natural product complex zzso zzso This sequential zzso screening protocol is divided into four zzso 1) zzso characterization of the zzso zzso 2) evaluation of immune zzso zzso 3) assessing in zzso zzso activity and zzso efficacy and 4) zzso safety zzso This sequential protocol provides an effective, zzso and rational approach to the zzso assessment of complex zzso zzso that, in our experience, is zzso of clinical safety and zzso
