The analysis and profiling of short tandem repeat zzso zzso is routinely used in forensic zzso Current methods to investigate zzso zzso including zzso standard zzso analyses and zzso zzso only provide zzso lengths that are used to estimate the number of zzso repeat zzso These methods do not allow for the full resolution of zzso base composition that sequencing approaches could zzso Here we present an zzso profiling method based on the use of the Roche Genome zzso zzso zzso to simultaneously sequence multiple core zzso zzso Using this method in combination with a zzso tool designed specifically to analyze sequence lengths and zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso sequence data are comparable to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found DNA base zzso and repeat sequence variations that would not have been identified using conventional zzso zzso
