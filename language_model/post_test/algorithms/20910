zzso discrimination zzso is an zzso based on zzso zzso analysis, that can be used alone or in various combinations with other zzso in order to diagnose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be set to diagnose VT if zzso or zzso the zzso indicate zzso 

We evaluated the contribution of MD in terms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of rhythm discrimination in slow and fast VT zones zzso zzso zzso and between 150 and 180 zzso zzso zzso results zzso spontaneous episodes in 58 zzso were corrected for multiple episodes within a patient zzso zzso equations zzso Rhythm discrimination in slow VT zones was characterized by zzso and SP below zzso without MD, while the use of MD alone allowed to enhance SP, maintaining zzso at zzso Use of MD in combination with other zzso resulted in a decrease in SP zzso zzso In fast VT zones, MD allows an increase in zzso for VT detection from around zzso up to approximately zzso coupled with an SP of zzso although SP is much higher with MD alone zzso than with any other combination zzso Both in slow and fast VT zones, use of multiple zzso with the setting zzso resulted in an unacceptable decrease in zzso 

MD in a zzso zzso in combination with a rate branch zzso system makes it possible to achieve a very high SP in discriminating detected events both in slow and fast VT zones, while maintaining zzso for VT zzso
