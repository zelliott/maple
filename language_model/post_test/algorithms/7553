The zzso zzso fuzzy model has found many applications in different zzso a major challenge is, however, to build a compact model with zzso model parameters which leads to satisfactory model zzso To produce a compact model, most existing approaches mainly focus on selecting an appropriate number of fuzzy zzso In contrast, this paper considers not only the selection of fuzzy rules but also the structure of each rule premise and zzso leading to the development of a novel compact zzso fuzzy zzso Here, each fuzzy rule is associated with two sets of input zzso in which the first is used for constructing the rule premise and the other is employed in the rule zzso A new hybrid learning method combining the modified harmony search method with a fast zzso zzso is hereby proposed to determine the structure and the parameters for the rule zzso and zzso This is a hard zzso zzso zzso problem, and the proposed hybrid method zzso the problem by employing an embedded zzso leading to a significantly reduced number of model parameters and a small number of fuzzy rules with each being as simple as zzso zzso from three examples are presented to demonstrate the zzso (in terms of the number of model parameters and the number of rules) and the performance of the fuzzy models obtained by the proposed hybrid learning method, in comparison with other techniques from the zzso
