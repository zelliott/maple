In this study, we analyzed blood flow through a model zzso with Reynolds numbers ranging from 300 to 3,600 using both experimental and zzso zzso The jet produced at the throat was zzso leading to an zzso region of slowly zzso zzso For higher Reynolds numbers, this region became more disturbed and its length was zzso The zzso predictions were confirmed by digital particle image zzso and used to describe the fluid dynamics mechanisms relevant to prior zzso of zzso deposition in canine blood flow zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition onto the wall was dependent on the wall zzso stress distribution along the zzso increasing in areas of flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso potential was analyzed under zzso and turbulent flow conditions in terms of the cumulative effect of the varying zzso and zzso zzso and the duration zzso are exposed to them along individual zzso zzso The cumulative product of zzso rate and exposure time along a zzso path reached a value of 500, half the value needed for zzso zzso under constant zzso zzso zzso et zzso Journal of zzso zzso zzso zzso
