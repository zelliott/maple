To introduce a new method for calculating the zzso index zzso 

Assuming that each zzso from parents has undergone a transition before it zzso and zzso to zzso The transition probability is 1 when parent zzso is the same as zzso the transition probability is 0 when parent zzso is different from the zzso Every zzso has a transmission probability with zzso Base on these theories, it is easy to gain the probability that child zzso an zzso from the alleged father or zzso Thus, the X value zzso and Y value zzso of zzso formula can be zzso as unknown man provide an zzso for child with the zzso zzso 

A general formula that calculated the zzso for zzso duos and missing child cases was zzso 

The new method is practical in all kinds of forensic zzso zzso
