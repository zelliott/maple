The zzso dynamics of traveling waves in zzso as it occurs in zzso extract have been zzso both theoretically and zzso We describe this phenomenon with the distributed zzso model that accounts for the reactions of zzso which is a key zzso of the zzso reaction zzso To describe the zzso observed phase waves in an open spatial reactor we introduce a zzso flux of zzso in the zzso The experimental observation that waves can change their direction of propagation during the experiment is considered in the zzso The mechanism for such a change in wave direction is zzso
