In this study, we zzso a wide assortment of zzso previously shown to have diagnostic or zzso value for zzso cell lung cancer zzso with the intent of establishing a zzso serum test capable of identifying patients with lung zzso 

zzso levels of 47 zzso were evaluated against patient zzso consisting of 90 zzso and 43 zzso controls using commercial zzso zzso statistical methods were used on all zzso achieving statistical relevance to define an zzso panel of diagnostic zzso for zzso The resulting zzso were fashioned into a zzso zzso and validated against serum from a second patient zzso 

A total of 14 zzso achieved statistical relevance upon zzso zzso statistical methods then identified a panel of six zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as being the most zzso for diagnosing early stage zzso When tested against a second patient zzso the panel successfully classified 75 of 88 zzso 

Here, we report the development of a serum zzso with high specificity for zzso patients with zzso against zzso of various zzso zzso A high rate of false zzso was observed within the cohort in which patients had zzso lung zzso possibly as a consequence of the inflammatory nature of these zzso
