This zzso controlled clinical study characterized the effects of zzso nitrous oxide zzso and zzso zzso conscious sedation on quantitative zzso zzso readings of 22 healthy dental students as measured by the zzso index zzso The study verified the 2 previously published zzso investigations showing no correlation between zzso dosage up to zzso and zzso zzso Assessment of zzso and zzso scores zzso however, correlated well with increasing doses of zzso from approximately 35 to zzso A near linear zzso relationship was established between zzso and end tidal zzso zzso zzso of zzso Only at the highest level of end tidal zzso recorded, zzso was statistically significant zzso depression zzso zzso evaluated the zzso of the sedative effect of the 2 zzso showing a slight preference for zzso zzso partial zzso zzso and sedation zzso were produced by both agents in administered zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Female subjects exhibited better memory and significantly less zzso than zzso No statistically significant changes occurred in any of the monitored vital zzso zzso readings demonstrated a statistically significant difference from control values only at the zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso does not appear useful for evaluating the level of nitrous oxide sedation in the dental setting but may have some value in assessing depth of sedation at deeper levels of zzso zzso
