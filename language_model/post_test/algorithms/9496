A new method to determine the surface zzso of zzso particles is zzso It is based on the comparison of experimental data on zzso exchange and zzso molecular mean square zzso as obtained by the zzso zzso zzso zzso technique with the corresponding solutions of the diffusion equation via zzso zzso Carlo zzso The method is found to be particularly sensitive in the zzso regime, when the influence of zzso diffusion and surface zzso of the zzso crystal on molecular transport are comparable and the conventional method zzso As an example, the surface zzso of two samples of zzso zzso with different crystal sizes are determined with zzso as a probe zzso at room zzso
