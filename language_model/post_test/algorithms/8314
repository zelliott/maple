zzso modeling is used to study the sequence dependence of zzso and stability within zzso regular duplex zzso The variations of zzso that are found are sufficiently important to be classified as a new type of zzso within the Z zzso It is also demonstrated that certain sequences can adopt more than one of these zzso zzso zzso with experimental studies of chemical zzso within a natural DNA fragment, forced into a left-handed zzso suggests that the results of our modeling may be used to explain the chemical zzso zzso zzso of the Z results with similar studies of the B form allow zzso of transition to be calculated as a function of base zzso
