To simulate and evaluate the administration of zzso agents in the clinical setting, many pharmacology models have been proposed and zzso which play important roles for in zzso testing of zzso control zzso However, to the zzso best knowledge, there is no zzso simulator incorporating zzso feedback control of zzso agent administration freely available and accessible to the zzso zzso many necessary but time consuming procedures, such as selecting models from the available zzso and establishing new simulator zzso will be repeated by different researchers who intend to explore a novel control zzso for zzso zzso To address this issue, an enriched zzso simulator was devised in our laboratory and made freely available to the zzso zzso This simulator was built by using zzso (The zzso zzso zzso The zzso technology embedded in zzso was chosen as the tool to develop a zzso zzso This simulator includes four types of zzso models, and all have been wildly used in zzso zzso zzso For each type of model, 24 virtual patients were created with significant zzso In addition, the platform also provides a model identification module and a control method zzso For the model identification zzso the least square method and particle swarm zzso were zzso In the control method library, a zzso control and a model zzso control were zzso Both the model identification module and the control method library are extensive and readily accessible for users to add zzso zzso This simulator could be a zzso platform for zzso control of zzso which is of great value and has significant development zzso For zzso this simulator is termed as zzso zzso which can be downloaded from zzso zzso
