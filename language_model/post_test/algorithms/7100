A zzso zzso gas zzso with zzso method is zzso zzso of the zzso are designed zzso including the acoustic path arrangement, ultrasound zzso and reception zzso zzso measurement zzso the software and so zzso Four 200 zzso zzso forming two acoustic paths are used to send and receive ultrasound zzso The synchronization of the zzso can eliminate the influence caused by the inherent switch time in simple chord zzso The distribution of the acoustic paths on the mechanical apparatus follows the zzso integration, which could reduce the inherent error by zzso compared with the zzso integration commonly used in the zzso zzso zzso This work also develops timing zzso to determine the flight time of the acoustic zzso The timing mechanism is different from the traditional zzso The timing circuit here adopts high capability chip zzso with the typical resolution of 50 zzso The software of zzso is used to receive data from the circuit and calculate the gas flow zzso Finally, the two paths zzso has been zzso and validated on the test facilities for air flow in zzso Institute of zzso & zzso
