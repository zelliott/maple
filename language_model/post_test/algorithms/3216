zzso of the underwater polarized light field were performed at different stations, atmospheric conditions and water compositions using a newly developed zzso and zzso zzso during a recent cruise in the coastal areas of New York Harbor - Sandy Hook, NJ region zzso zzso are presented for waters with zzso zzso zzso zzso and minerals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and spectral variations of the degree of polarization are found to be consistent with zzso zzso values of the degree of polarization do not exceed zzso and the position of the maximum is close to 100 masculine scattering zzso zzso zzso and degrees of polarization are compared with simulated ones obtained with a zzso Carlo zzso transfer code for the zzso system and show satisfactory zzso
