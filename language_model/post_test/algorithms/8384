zzso planning for zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso beams involves the selection of zzso the relative importance factors to control the relative importance of the target and sensitive structures, zzso an appropriate energy resolution to achieve an acceptable depth zzso zzso an appropriate zzso zzso to zzso the beam zzso and zzso a sufficient number of beams and their zzso In this article we investigate the influence of these variables on the zzso dose distribution of a simulated prostate cancer zzso zzso Good dose zzso for this prostate case was achieved using a constellation of I factors for the target, zzso zzso and normal zzso of 500, 50, 15, and 1, zzso It was found that for an active beam delivery system, the energy resolution should be selected on the basis of the incident zzso energy spread zzso and the appropriate energy resolution varied from 1 zzso at zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso at zzso zzso zzso For a passive beam delivery system the value of the appropriate depth resolution for inverse planning may not be critical as long as the value chosen is at least equal to one-half the zzso of the primary beam Bragg zzso zzso indicate that the dose grid element dimension should be equal to or no less than zzso of the zzso zzso For this prostate case, we found that a maximum of three to four beam ports is required since there was no significant advantage to using a larger number of zzso However for a small number zzso or zzso 4) of beams the selection of beam zzso while having only a minor effect on target coverage, strongly influenced the sensitive structure sparing and normal tissue integral zzso
