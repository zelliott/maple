For pattern recognition, fuzzy set theory has been proven to be highly zzso The aim of the present investigation was to combine the fuzzy set with an zzso zzso to test its suitability for automatic detection of different tooth zzso An experienced operator placed the tip of a zzso zzso zzso on a zzso thereby inducing zzso in the contact area around the zzso zzso Each surface showed a characteristic zzso behavior in the immediate vicinity of the zzso The zzso were then zzso to the zzso tip and recorded by the measurement of variations in current and zzso Because the zzso zzso is driven by zzso it can be used as both an zzso zzso and a sensor zzso The data were processed with Fast zzso transformation and analyzed by means of a fuzzy pattern recognition zzso zzso of the different zzso was carried out by the experienced operator's zzso With a combination of six features zzso zzso was correct for zzso of all zzso The diagnostic reliability of the system was tested by the assessment of 50 teeth for which no learning data had previously been zzso The unknown samples were correctly classified to zzso The excellent results of these experiments suggest promising possibilities for the zzso of new diagnostic and therapeutic instruments in zzso zzso
