To investigate the zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso manual zzso zzso technique for measuring magnetic resonance imaging zzso bone erosion and zzso at the wrist in zzso arthritis zzso 

The zzso zzso scans were obtained in 22 zzso patients zzso zzso Bone erosion and zzso volumes were scored by two readers using outlining and were compared with zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso reliability for zzso and zzso was zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso reliability was high for bone erosion zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparable to zzso scoring zzso zzso zzso zzso but was only moderate for bone zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The methods were highly correlated for erosion scores, r zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2) and moderately correlated for zzso r zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to measure the volume of zzso bone erosion and zzso at the wrist in zzso zzso When compared with zzso scoring, outlining had similar reliability for zzso zzso but reliability was lower for bone zzso possibly reflecting difficulty zzso the borders of affected zzso
