: To contribute to the understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast media with zzso distribution, and zzso zzso providing access to zzso and zzso administration zzso 

: zzso solutions of the zzso equations are presented where the zzso parameters zzso volumes, blood zzso and administration parameters zzso zzso and zzso are fixed and the variable parameters (the exchange rates between plasma and zzso the rate for zzso zzso are adjusted to results from clinical studies of healthy zzso 

: zzso organ plasma zzso and zzso zzso are adequately zzso With the calculated distribution and zzso zzso rates, 3 time periods are zzso 

: The model describes zzso zzso zzso plasma to zzso distribution, and zzso zzso For known administration zzso the relevant zzso parameters can be achieved from the results of clinical zzso If the arguments are zzso the zzso parameters obtained allow the calculation of personalized administration protocols for zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging examinations where the 2 initial time periods are zzso
