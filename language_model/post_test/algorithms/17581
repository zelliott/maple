This paper presents a global test to be used for the analysis of zzso zzso Using this test it can be determined whether the global expression pattern of a group of genes is significantly related to some clinical outcome of zzso Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip zzso known zzso specific areas of the zzso or clusters from a cluster zzso 

The test allows groups of genes of different size to be zzso because the test gives one zzso for the group, not a zzso for each zzso Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene zzso databases for interesting zzso Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are zzso Special attention is given to zzso of the test result, zzso on the associations between samples and showing the impact of individual genes on the test zzso 

An zzso zzso is available from zzso
