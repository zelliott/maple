The utility of simulation environments in the development of an artificial zzso for type 1 diabetes zzso zzso management is well zzso The availability of a simulator that incorporates zzso as a zzso hormone to insulin would allow more efficient design of zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso regulatory system that incorporates zzso action are difficult to identify without using zzso zzso In this article, we present a novel model of zzso dynamics that can be easily identified with standard clinical research zzso 

The minimal model of plasma zzso and insulin zzso was extended to account for the action of zzso on net zzso zzso production by incorporating a new zzso An existing subcutaneous insulin zzso model was used to account for subcutaneous insulin zzso The same model of insulin zzso was employed to model the zzso of subcutaneous zzso zzso Finally, we incorporated an existing gastrointestinal zzso model to account for meal zzso Data from a zzso artificial zzso study using a zzso controller on zzso subjects were employed to identify the composite zzso To test the zzso of the proposed model, a zzso controller was designed using the identified zzso 

Model parameters were identified with good precision, and an excellent fitting of the model with the experimental data was zzso The proposed model allowed the design of a zzso controller and demonstrated its ability to improve zzso control over a zzso zzso 

A novel composite model, which can be easily identified with standard clinical data, is able to account for the effect of zzso insulin and zzso infusion on zzso zzso This model represents another step toward the development of a zzso artificial zzso
