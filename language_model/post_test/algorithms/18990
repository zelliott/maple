The zzso zzso zzso problem aims at reconstructing a zzso tree from DNA sequences while minimizing the number of genetic zzso To solve this zzso problem, zzso methods have been developed, often based on local zzso In this article, we focus on the influence of the neighborhood zzso After analyzing the advantages and drawbacks of the well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso neighborhoods, we introduce the concept of Progressive Neighborhood zzso which consists in constraining progressively the size of the neighborhood as the search zzso We zzso show that applied to the zzso zzso problem, this progressive neighborhood turns out to be more efficient and robust than the classic neighborhoods using a descent zzso Indeed, it allows to find better solutions with a smaller number of zzso or trees zzso
