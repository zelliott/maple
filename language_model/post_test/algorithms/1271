To investigate the enhancement in ultrasound signal zzso in heart, for diagnostic purposes, as a function of size and number of injected zzso zzso by zzso statistical zzso 

The US enhancement in left zzso was measured after injection of 31 suspensions of zzso zzso zzso divided on and injected in six zzso The relationship between the size of zzso between zzso zzso and the US enhancement was explored by zzso product moment correlation analysis, ordinary zzso regression, principal component zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso 

Relative advanced zzso such as zzso and zzso were required to achieve accurate in zzso zzso zzso The most effective zzso sizes contributing to US enhancement in left zzso in dogs were estimated to be in the zzso zzso zzso 

In general, the effective in zzso sizes are dependent on the type of zzso due to the surprisingly large active in zzso sizes found for the tested zzso zzso and zzso are suitable methods for in zzso zzso zzso especially for zzso and noisy zzso
