It is well known that the sequence of zzso acids in proteins code for its zzso zzso It is also known that there exists a relationship between sequence and the zzso structure of zzso The question addressed here is whether the nature of zzso association can be predicted from the zzso similar to the three-dimensional structure prediction from the zzso The class of proteins called zzso zzso is an interesting model system to investigate this problem, because they have very high sequence and zzso structure zzso with diverse forms of zzso zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso as a probe in this paper to zzso gain novel insights about the relationship between sequence and zzso zzso zzso identify the sequence motifs that are characteristic of a given type of zzso zzso and zzso predict the zzso association from the sequence zzso
