zzso species are zzso zzso zzso bacteria that cause zzso in humans and zzso zzso of four zzso zzso have been published, and various zzso gene and zzso data and analysis resources zzso A web gateway to integrate these resources will greatly facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso data in current databases is largely derived from zzso analysis without experimental validation typically found in zzso zzso It is partially due to the lack of a literature mining and zzso system able to efficiently incorporate the large amount of literature data into zzso zzso It is further hypothesized that zzso zzso gene zzso would increase understanding of complicated zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso is developed to integrate existing zzso zzso data and analysis tools with literature mining and zzso The zzso zzso database and zzso Genome zzso allow users to search and analyze genes of 4 currently available zzso zzso and link to more than 20 existing databases and analysis zzso zzso literature publications in zzso are extracted and can be searched by a zzso natural language processing method, a zzso zzso a zzso search, and an automatic literature update zzso To efficiently zzso zzso genes using the large amount of literature publications, a literature mining and zzso system coined zzso is developed to integrate zzso literature mining methods with a zzso manual zzso and management zzso The zzso system is used to quickly find and confirm 107 zzso gene zzso including 75 genes shown to be essential for zzso zzso The 75 genes are further clustered using zzso In addition, 62 zzso genetic interactions are extracted from literature zzso These results make possible more comprehensive investigation of zzso zzso Other zzso features include publication zzso alert service, zzso zzso contact database, and discussion zzso 

zzso is a gateway for zzso researchers to search, analyze, and zzso zzso zzso data originated from public databases and zzso zzso gene zzso and genetic interactions are zzso using zzso leading to better understanding of zzso zzso
