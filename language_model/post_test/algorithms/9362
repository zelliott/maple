zzso class characterizes the overall folding type of a protein or its zzso This paper develops an accurate method for in zzso prediction of structural classes from low zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The proposed zzso method applies linear zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso sequence representation to provide zzso The main advantages of the zzso are the comprehensive representation that includes 58 features describing composition and zzso properties of the sequences and transparency of the prediction zzso The representation also includes predicted secondary structure content, thus for the first time exploring zzso between these two related zzso Based on tests performed with a large set of zzso twilight zone zzso the zzso prediction zzso which equals over zzso is shown to be better than accuracy of over a dozen recently published competing in zzso methods and similar to accuracy of other, zzso zzso that use the proposed zzso
