The zzso (or site specific rate variation, zzso process of biological sequence evolution is a process by which the evolutionary rate of a zzso zzso position can change in zzso In this paper, we introduce zzso zzso zzso zzso chains as a model for representing zzso zzso zzso existing theory to any model of rate zzso We propose a fast zzso for zzso the generator zzso of relevant zzso zzso zzso This zzso makes zzso likelihood calculation zzso even for a large number of rate classes and a large number of states, so that zzso models become zzso to zzso acid or zzso sequence zzso Using this algorithm, we investigate the accuracy of the discrete approximation to the zzso distribution of evolutionary rates, widely used in molecular zzso We show that a relatively large number of classes is required to achieve accurate approximation of the exact likelihood when the number of analyzed sequences exceeds 20, both under the zzso and among site rate variation zzso zzso
