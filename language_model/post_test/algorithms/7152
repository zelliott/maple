This paper presents a compact orthopedic robot designed with modular zzso The layout of the modular zzso is zzso to various conditions such as surgical zzso and targeting zzso A zzso zzso is adopted for the mapping from the zzso image to the robot, while the former zzso based method is satisfactory only when the projection rays are basically perpendicular to the reference coordinate zzso This paper introduces the area zzso as a zzso zzso to improve the registration accuracy for zzso zzso so that the robotic system could be applied to more orthopedic procedures under various zzso orientation zzso The system zzso for zzso neck screw and zzso screw fixation are zzso The accuracy of the robotic system and its efficacy for the two typical applications are validated by zzso
