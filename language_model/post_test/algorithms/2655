A novel higher order singular value decomposition zzso image fusion zzso is zzso The key points are given as zzso 1) Since image fusion depends on local information of source images, the proposed zzso picks out zzso image patches of source images to constitute the fused image by processing the divided zzso rather than the whole zzso 2) the sum of absolute values of the zzso zzso from zzso of zzso is employed for zzso measurement to evaluate the quality of the related image zzso and 3) a novel zzso zzso scheme is applied to construct the fused zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso is an alternative image fusion zzso
