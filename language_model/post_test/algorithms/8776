zzso zzso persons who own a zzso zzso have currently some control via surface zzso zzso However, the control systems are still limited (as they include very few zzso and not always natural (as the subject has to learn to associate movements of the muscles with the movements of the zzso The zzso project tries helping the scientific community to overcome these limits through the creation of zzso data sources to test machine learning zzso In this paper the results gained from first tests made on an zzso subject with the zzso acquisition protocol are zzso In agreement with neurological studies on cortical plasticity and on the anatomy of the zzso the zzso produced stable signals for each movement in the zzso Using a zzso zzso algorithm, we obtain an average zzso rate of zzso on all 53 zzso zzso we simplify the task reducing the number of movements to 13, resulting in no zzso zzso This shows that for fewer movements a very high zzso accuracy is possible without the subject having to learn the movements zzso
