We present a new approach to the design of a decision support system zzso in zzso which converts the available data to relevant zzso Instead of a zzso design zzso zzso we use a zzso design zzso zzso This approach results in a system consisting of three zzso First, the incoming data is validated to ensure reliable further processing for both zzso and zzso Second, the validated data is analyzed to detect patterns that could trigger the zzso zzso Finally, from these patterns a strategic selection is made and offered to the zzso as information relevant for the decision that has to be made in the current zzso zzso show that this approach is zzso but further evaluation is necessary before practical application is zzso
