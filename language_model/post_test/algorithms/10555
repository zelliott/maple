Nowadays, more and more clinical scales consisting in responses given by the patients to some items zzso zzso Outcomes - zzso are validated with models based on zzso Response Theory, and more specifically, with a zzso zzso In the validation sample, presence of missing data is zzso The aim of this paper is to compare zzso methods for handling the missing data zzso based on simple zzso in the context of zzso validation of PRO by a zzso zzso The main indexes used for validation by a zzso model are zzso 

A simulation study was performed allowing to consider several cases, notably the possibility for the missing values to be zzso or not and the rate of missing zzso 

Several zzso methods produce bias on zzso indexes zzso the zzso methods artificially improve the zzso qualities of the zzso In particular, this is the case with the method based on the Personal Mean zzso zzso which is the most commonly used zzso method in zzso 

Several zzso methods should be avoided, in particular PMS zzso From a general point of view, it is important to use an zzso method that considers both the ability of the patient zzso for example by zzso zzso and the difficulty of the item zzso for example by its rate of zzso zzso Another recommendation is to always consider the addition of a random process in the zzso method, because such a process allows reducing the zzso zzso the analysis realized without zzso of the missing data (available case zzso is an interesting alternative to the simple zzso in this zzso
