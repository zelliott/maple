The authors present a method for zzso measuring variations in T wave shape and time intervals for the quantitative assessment of the significance of serial changes of the zzso zzso The results, established on a healthy population, show the zzso of zzso formula, the constancy of maximum of T to the end of the T time zzso and good stability of the spatial T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of corrected zzso zzso is mainly zzso to zzso heart zzso changes in true onset of Q to a maximum of T time zzso The zzso mean zzso zzso between two serial T zzso is well correlated with changes in drug zzso
