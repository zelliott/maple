zzso zzso thrust experienced by wheelchair users with neurological disorders may cause injuries via impact with the wheelchair, lead to the occupant sliding out of the seat, and also damage the zzso The concept of a dynamic seat, which allows movement of a seat with respect to the wheelchair frame, has been suggested as a potential solution to provide greater freedom and zzso zzso of the zzso motion and forces during zzso zzso thrust events is of great importance in developing more comfortable and effective dynamic zzso The objective of this study was to develop a method to identify zzso motions and forces during zzso thrust zzso This information can be used to design the triggering system for a dynamic zzso 

An experimental system was developed to automatically track the motions of the wheelchair user using a video camera and also measure the forces at the zzso An inverse dynamic approach was employed along with a zzso human body model and the experimental data to predict the zzso zzso 

Two kinds of experiments were zzso the first experiment validated the proposed model and the second experiment showed the effects of the zzso thrust speed, the zzso angle, and the zzso zzso The proposed method was tested using a sensitivity analysis, from which a performance index was deduced to help indicate the robust region of the force zzso 

A system to determine zzso motions and forces during zzso zzso zzso was zzso Through experiments and simulations, the effectiveness and reliability of the developed system was zzso
