Hidden zzso models zzso are widely used for biological sequence analysis because of their ability to incorporate biological information in their zzso An automatic means of zzso the structure of zzso would be highly zzso However, this raises two important zzso first, the new zzso should be biologically zzso and second, we need to control the complexity of the zzso so that it has good zzso performance on unseen zzso In this paper, we explore the possibility of using a genetic zzso zzso for zzso the zzso zzso zzso are sufficiently flexible to allow incorporation of other techniques such as zzso training within their evolutionary zzso Furthermore, operators that alter the structure of zzso can be designed to zzso zzso and simple zzso In this paper, a training strategy using zzso is proposed, and it is tested on finding zzso structures for the promoter and coding region of the zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso for hidden zzso models zzso zzso zzso with different numbers of states to zzso To prevent zzso a separate zzso is used for comparing the performance of the zzso to that used for the zzso zzso The zzso was capable of finding an zzso comparable to a zzso zzso designed for the same task, which has been published zzso
