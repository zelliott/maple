The significance of zzso zzso zzso for zzso evolution remains controversial, in part because the mechanisms by which zzso contributed to functional evolution or zzso are still incompletely zzso Fish zzso provide an ideal context in which to examine the consequences of zzso because the zzso lineage experienced an additional zzso soon after divergence from zzso and because five zzso zzso are available for comparative zzso Here we present an integrated approach to characterize these zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and spatial gene expression and on protein sequence zzso A minimum of zzso of zzso zzso have been retained in two copies in each of the five fish zzso and many of these zzso are key zzso genes that function as zzso factors or signaling zzso Almost all duplicate gene pairs we examined have zzso in spatial and/or zzso expression during zzso A quarter of duplicate pairs have zzso in function via the acquisition of novel protein zzso or via changes in the zzso zzso of their zzso zzso We compared the spatial expression and protein domain architecture of zzso zzso to those of their single mouse zzso and found many examples supporting a model of zzso zzso have acquired novel protein zzso more often than have zzso zzso zzso changes at the gene regulatory level were more common than changes at the protein zzso We conclude that the most significant consequence of zzso for zzso evolution has been to enable zzso regulatory control of development via the acquisition of novel zzso expression zzso We find limited evidence that zzso gene loss led to zzso isolation and zzso in this zzso
