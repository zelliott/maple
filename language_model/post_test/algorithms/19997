In this paper an automatic zzso for the left zzso zzso wall zzso and zzso zzso from zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso images is zzso The extent of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso Since zzso can be used to estimate the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has potential clinical utility in the management of acute zzso zzso This paper presents a new scheme based on the zzso level set method zzso with additional shape constraint for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In our approach, shape information of the zzso wall is zzso to introduce a shape feature of the zzso wall into the zzso level set zzso The performance of the method is tested using real zzso images (12 zzso and the results of the automatic system are compared to manual zzso The mean perpendicular distances between the automatic and manual zzso wall boundaries are in the range of zzso zzso analysis on zzso wall area indicates there is no consistent bias as a function of zzso wall area, with a mean bias zzso individual investigator one zzso and zzso zzso individual investigator two zzso and zzso when compared to two zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso demonstrates good correlation when compared to an expert with an average error of zzso for 69 slices of short axis zzso image from 12 zzso
