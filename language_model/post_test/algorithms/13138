The shape of the face can be estimated before the surgery by using zzso computer programs that provide tools to guide skill zzso The aim of this study was to present the dynamic volume zzso method to predict facial soft tissue changes after the modification of the skull associated with zzso zzso 

Soft tissue volume is modeled by a dynamic volume zzso that includes the elastic behavior of the actual zzso The model is a hybrid of zzso model and finite element model, and combines their advantageous zzso It provides fast and realistic soft tissue zzso zzso shape of the patient's face is estimated by zzso the skull and letting the soft tissue model relax over the new boundary conditions formed by the new skull zzso zzso zzso were compared with the conventional zzso zzso where the soft tissue is not modeled zzso Also, zzso zzso were compared with the actual zzso data for 6 zzso surgery zzso 

The mean of the error between the estimated shapes and the actual zzso shapes was zzso zzso when the whole face was zzso 

When the facial soft tissue is modeled by the dynamic volume zzso the zzso shape is estimated better than by the conventional method and previous methods in the zzso
