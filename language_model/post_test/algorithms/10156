zzso room management using early zzso continuous positive airway pressure zzso may delay zzso zzso 

To identify factors associated with early zzso failure and effects of various zzso criteria on rate and time of zzso 

zzso analysis of the first 48 h in infants of zzso weeks zzso age zzso treated with sustained zzso followed by early zzso 

Of 225 infants zzso zzso weeks) 140 zzso could be zzso with zzso in the delivery room, of whom 68 zzso zzso zzso weeks) succeeded on zzso with zzso outcome and 72 infants zzso zzso zzso weeks) failed zzso within 48 h at a median zzso age of zzso zzso zzso History or initial blood gases were poor zzso of subsequent zzso zzso zzso at fraction of inspired oxygen zzso versus zzso versus zzso instead of zzso would have resulted in unnecessary zzso of zzso versus zzso versus zzso of infants with zzso success but decreased the age at zzso of infants with zzso failure to zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

Medical history or initial blood gas values are poor zzso of subsequent zzso zzso A threshold zzso of zzso compared to zzso for zzso would shorten the time to zzso delivery without a relevant increase in zzso zzso An zzso approach with a trial of early zzso and prompt zzso and zzso treatment at low thresholds may be the best approach in very low zzso zzso
