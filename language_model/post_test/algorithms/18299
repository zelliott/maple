Numerous experimental studies of zzso zzso zzso on solid surfaces show that zzso interactions play an important role for the zzso and end zzso The latter can, zzso be intact zzso or supported zzso zzso zzso Despite an accumulated quite large experimental data base, the understanding of the underlying processes is still poor, and mathematical models are zzso We have developed a zzso model of a zzso zzso on a zzso where the charge of the surface and the charge and polar state of the zzso zzso can be zzso With physically reasonable assumptions and input zzso we reproduce many key experimental zzso clarify the details of some experiments, and give predictions and suggestions for future zzso Specifically, we have investigated the influence of different zzso zzso zzso charges of the zzso in the zzso on the outcome of a zzso zzso zzso For different zzso of zzso lipids with positive and negative zzso we investigated whether the zzso zzso or not, zzso it zzso what extent it gets zzso and when it zzso zzso zzso of neutral zzso on different types of zzso charged zzso was also zzso The mean surface charge density of the zzso was zzso including or excluding local fluctuations in the surface charge zzso The simulations are compared to available zzso A consistent picture of the influence of different zzso zzso in the zzso on zzso and the influence of different types of zzso on zzso zzso appear as a result of the simulation zzso
