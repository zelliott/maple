zzso Alpha Shape zzso zzso is a new empirical score function suitable for virtual library screening using zzso zzso protein zzso Here, the score function is used in combination with the geometry search method zzso zzso A description of the protein binding site is generated using zzso property fields like in zzso Alpha Shape zzso Analysis zzso zzso property fields are also used to describe the zzso zzso The overlap between the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fields is zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso functions introduce a smoothing of the property zzso This makes the score function robust against small structural variations, and therefore suitable for use with zzso zzso This also makes it less critical to include protein flexibility in the zzso zzso We use a fast and simplified version of the score function in the geometry search, while a more detailed version is used for the final prediction of the binding free zzso This use of a zzso scoring makes zzso zzso efficient, and well suited for virtual zzso The zzso score function is trained on 218 X-ray structures of zzso zzso complexes with experimental binding zzso The performance of zzso is compared to two other zzso methods, zzso and zzso with respect to both accuracy and zzso zzso According to this study, zzso is more zzso efficient than both zzso and zzso and gives a better prediction of the free energies of zzso zzso is also more robust against structural variations than zzso
