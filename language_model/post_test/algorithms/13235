We propose an zzso zzso of parallel zzso digital zzso zzso which is a technique of zzso zzso zzso In the conventional zzso in zzso the residual zzso zzso wave and the zzso images cannot be removed completely and a part of zzso information is zzso The proposed zzso can remove these residual images by zzso the calculation of zzso zzso and by using zzso transform technique, zzso Then, several types of complex zzso are derived from a recorded zzso according to the directions in which the neighboring zzso used for carrying out the spatial zzso zzso are zzso Several zzso are zzso and wide zzso information of the object wave is obtained by selecting the spectrum among the zzso images in each region of the spatial frequency domain and zzso a zzso image from the zzso
