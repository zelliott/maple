It has been reported that high-resolution zzso imaging zzso may demonstrate brain tumor zzso We determined whether the degree of zzso zzso signal intensity zzso on zzso zzso with maximum relative cerebral blood volume zzso and to compare its diagnostic accuracy for zzso grading with that of dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso MR zzso 

zzso patients with diffuse zzso underwent both zzso zzso and zzso at zzso We correlated the degree and zzso of zzso with zzso within the same tumor zzso The degree of zzso and zzso were compared among 3 groups with different zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso were determined between the degree of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy for zzso zzso 

The degree of zzso showed a significant correlation with the value of zzso in the same tumor segments zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, the areas of densely prominent zzso did not accurately zzso with those of zzso zzso correlation zzso between zzso degree and zzso grade were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso In the zzso curve analysis of zzso correlation by using the degree of zzso the optimal sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value for determining a high-grade tumor were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The degree of zzso shows a significant correlation with the value of zzso in the same tumor zzso and its diagnostic performance for zzso grading is comparable with that of zzso
