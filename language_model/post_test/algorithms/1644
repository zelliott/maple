An earlier study reported that zzso calcium zzso contributes less than zzso of total calcium absorbed by the zzso although the zzso has the highest calcium transport rate compared with other zzso zzso Thus, the zzso significance of the zzso pertaining to body calcium metabolism remains zzso zzso a zzso calcium balance study in zzso rats revealed an increase in zzso calcium loss with marked decreases in fractional calcium zzso and urinary calcium zzso only in the early days zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso mechanism to minimize zzso calcium zzso Further investigation in zzso rats showed that active calcium transport was enhanced in the zzso colon but not in the small zzso whereas passive calcium transport along the whole zzso was zzso Since zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly increased zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells could have been involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, elevated serum zzso hormone levels and zzso were evident in zzso rats despite normal plasma calcium levels, suggesting that zzso compensation alone might be insufficient to maintain zzso Thus, massive bone loss occurred in both cortical and zzso sites, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of zzso zzso calcium zzso with pervasive zzso in zzso rats therefore corroborates that the zzso is extremely crucial for body calcium zzso
