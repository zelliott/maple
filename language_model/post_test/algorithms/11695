zzso optical zzso zzso is emerging as a viable new biomedical imaging zzso Using zzso zzso light, this technique zzso zzso as well as scattering properties of biological zzso First commercial instruments are now available that allow users to obtain zzso and zzso views of various body zzso Currently, the main applications are brain, breast, zzso joint, and zzso zzso Although the spatial resolution is limited when compared with other imaging zzso such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso or X-ray computerized zzso zzso zzso provides access to a variety of zzso parameters that otherwise are not accessible, including zzso imaging of zzso and other zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can be realized in zzso portable zzso that allows for bedside monitoring at relatively low zzso In this paper, we present an overview of current zzso zzso technology, including hardware and zzso zzso and focus on applications in brain and joint zzso In addition, we present recent results of work on optical zzso imaging in small zzso
