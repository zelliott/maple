Many applications in spatial sound recording and processing model the sound scene as a sum of directional and diffuse sound zzso The power ratio between both zzso zzso the zzso ratio zzso represents an important measure for zzso which aim at performing robustly in zzso zzso This contribution discusses the zzso zzso from the spatial zzso between two arbitrary zzso directional zzso First, the spatial zzso is expressed as function of the zzso For most microphone zzso the spatial zzso is a complex function where both the absolute value and phase contain relevant information on the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is derived from the spatial zzso zzso The zzso is discussed for different practical microphone zzso including zzso zzso of arbitrary zzso directional microphones and spaced zzso of identical zzso directional zzso An unbiased zzso zzso requires zzso zzso estimates as well as information on the zzso of the directional sound, which usually has to be zzso Nevertheless, measurement results verify that the proposed zzso is zzso in practice and provides accurate zzso
