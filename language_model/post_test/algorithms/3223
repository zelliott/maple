To determine whether changes at zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging were present in children with intractable zzso and focal cortical zzso zzso in zzso zzso white matter zzso to MR zzso areas of zzso zzso zzso white matter beyond the MR zzso zzso but zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso deep white matter zzso 

The study protocol had institutional research ethics board approval, and written informed consent was zzso Fifteen children with zzso and intractable zzso zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso underwent zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso of interest were placed in zzso the zzso white matter zzso to the MR zzso zzso as well as the zzso side; zzso the zzso white matter beyond the MR zzso zzso but zzso to a zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso side; and zzso deep white matter tracts projecting to or from the MR zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Eleven of 15 children had zzso zzso zzso and four children had zzso zzso There were significant differences in zzso mean zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso white matter zzso to the MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso as well as that beyond the MR zzso zzso but zzso to a zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), compared with the zzso zzso There were also significant differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deep white matter tracts projecting to or from the MR zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso 

With use of zzso zzso clusters to zzso the zzso zone, zzso imaging can help identify zzso in tissue zzso beyond the MR zzso zzso
