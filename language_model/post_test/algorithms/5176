For high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso to be widely zzso in the clinic, robust methods of treatment planning, guidance and delivery need to be zzso These technologies would greatly benefit if patient specific tissue parameters could be provided as zzso so that the treatment planning and monitoring schemes are customized and tailored on a case by case zzso A zzso method of zzso the local in zzso acoustic heating rate using the heat transfer equation zzso and applying novel signal processing techniques is presented in this zzso The heating rate is obtained by zzso measuring the time required to raise the temperature of the therapeutic focus from a baseline temperature to boiling (here assumed to be 100 degrees C for zzso media) and then solving the heat transfer equation zzso to find the heating rate that results in the onset of zzso The onset of boiling is zzso detected by measuring the time instant of onset of acoustic emissions in the audible frequency range due to violent collapse of zzso In zzso experiments performed in a tissue mimicking zzso phantom and excised turkey breast muscle tissue demonstrate that the zzso estimates of heating rate are in good agreement with those obtained independently using established zzso The results show potential for the zzso of these techniques in therapy planning and monitoring for therapeutic dose zzso using real-time acoustic zzso
