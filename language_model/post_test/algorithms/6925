In this article, a new approach is introduced to lowering the zzso noise in weak zzso zzso We use artificial neural network to make the noise be white, and then we adopt an zzso filter of which the reference signal is achieved by zzso from other zzso zzso The outcome is the reduction of both white noise and zzso noise in zzso zzso zzso results have been achieved by using this method in the experiment of late potential zzso
