zzso zzso has been proposed as a possible zzso agent because of its facile reaction with the zzso ultimate zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Previous studies in mouse skin indicated almost complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso suggesting the possible utility of this compound as a zzso zzso However, little is known of the metabolism of zzso or of its possible long-term zzso Mice were fed diets containing up to zzso zzso in zzso for a period of 7 weeks, and possible toxicity was monitored by weight gain and zzso examination of all major zzso No toxicity was observed at any dose of zzso zzso was found to be a good zzso in zzso for two zzso known to metabolize zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso were zzso acid and an apparent zzso zzso zzso In zzso the major urinary zzso was zzso acid, which attained levels as high as 34 zzso in the urine of mice receiving the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso unchanged in the feces and zzso zzso zzso acid, and an unidentified, relatively zzso zzso were also detected in the serum of experimental zzso Although large zzso variation in the serum zzso concentration was found, there was a zzso increase in serum zzso as the dietary level of zzso was zzso These results suggest that neither toxicity nor metabolism will severely limit the utility of zzso as a zzso zzso
