A class of zzso zzso for image coding, which are characterized by zzso synthesis zzso is zzso In this class, the synthesis filter bank zzso is first defined with an arbitrary combination of finite impulse response synthesis filters of perfect reconstruction zzso An analysis FB is then obtained using direct zzso inversion or zzso zzso of Neumann series zzso Moreover, to improve zzso we introduce a zzso transform that follows the analysis zzso This class enables a greater freedom of design than previously presented zzso zzso zzso We illustrate several design examples and present experimental results for image coding, which indicate that the proposed zzso are promising and comparable with conventional zzso zzso including zzso
