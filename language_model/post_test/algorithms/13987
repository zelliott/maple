In this study, we have produced zzso zzso signals of carotid artery and internal jugular zzso simulating respiratory zzso The aim of the study is to observe the effect of signal zzso and its duration on power spectral density zzso frequency zzso obtained by zzso zzso The signals were recorded from ten male zzso Signal interruption was performed by moving the sampling volume in and out of the vessel zzso To estimate the effect of zzso recording time and signal zzso on frequency zzso we have worked on a control data of 30s with continuous zzso and three sets of data with artificially interrupted signals of 30, 60 and 90s zzso zzso power spectral density, area under the power spectral density, and frequency level corresponding to maximum power spectral density were calculated on frequency zzso The frequency level corresponding to maximum power spectral density provides the most statistically stable finding in our preliminary zzso The signal duration of the signal had no significant effect on the statistical stability of the frequency zzso
