Trying to model the zzso process is a complex activity as it is influenced by a number of implicit and explicit zzso example, zzso distribution, zzso zzso zzso watershed topography, and soil zzso However, this kind of forecasting is particularly important as it is used to predict serious zzso estimate erosion and identify problems associated with low zzso zzso learning approaches zzso decision trees and artificial neural zzso are particularly well suited to problems of this nature as they can often interpret underlying factors (such as seasonal zzso which cannot be zzso by other zzso In addition, these approaches can easily be trained on the explicit factors zzso zzso and the zzso factors zzso zzso that affect river zzso zzso learning approaches can also be extended to account for new factors that emerge over a period of zzso This paper evaluates the application of decision trees and two artificial neural network models (the zzso zzso and the zzso basis function zzso to river flow forecasting in two flood prone UK zzso using real zzso zzso Comparisons are made between the performance of these approaches and conventional flood forecasting zzso
