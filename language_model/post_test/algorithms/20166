An zzso zzso method zzso is proposed to simulate the propagation of zzso electrical zzso without explicit mesh constraints using a zzso zzso In our framework the geometry of zzso is first defined by a zzso particle representation that is, a sufficient number of sample zzso without explicit zzso are placed in and inside the surface of zzso zzso zzso and other material properties of zzso are then attached to sample zzso according to their geometrical locations, and over the zzso particle representation spatial variation of these properties is zzso using the shape function of zzso After the zzso equations are converted to their zzso weak form and solved using zzso the propagation of zzso zzso can be simulated over the zzso particle zzso The derivation of this solution technique is presented along a series of zzso experiments and a solution of zzso model using a zzso zzso membrane model in a canine zzso model and a zzso model which is constructed from digitized virtual Chinese zzso
