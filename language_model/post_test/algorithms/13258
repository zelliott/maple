Most existing differential zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches are based on three kinds of scanning zzso described by zzso zzso and zzso Due to the potential of compact imaging systems with magnified spatial resolution, zzso zzso has attracted significant zzso In this paper, we report a reconstruction method based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Due to the differential nature of phase contrast projections, the zzso zzso from differentiation of the projection data prior to zzso unlike zzso zzso commonly used for zzso CT zzso This work comprises a zzso study of the zzso and its experimental zzso using a zzso measured with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso tube zzso Moreover, the zzso simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with several classes of truncated zzso zzso We believe that this feature is of particular interest for future medical zzso zzso CT imaging zzso
