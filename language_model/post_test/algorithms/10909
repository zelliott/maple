Complex regional pain syndrome zzso types I and II are zzso pain disorders that develop as an exaggerated response to a traumatic zzso or nerve damage, that generally affects the zzso or as the consequence of a distant process such as a stroke, spinal zzso or zzso zzso It rarely appears without an apparent zzso zzso of upper limbs after stroke is frequently today called zzso syndrome zzso The onset and severity of zzso appears to be related with the zzso of the stroke, the severity and recovery of motor deficit, zzso and sensory zzso Another important zzso factor is zzso zzso The zzso of the disease is still not zzso In zzso there is an exaggerated inflammatory response and some chemical zzso have been identified and are present in the inflammatory soup around the primary zzso zzso that, through different zzso can induce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is hypothesized that a localized zzso inflammation is at the basis of zzso zzso and zzso that are present in the initial zzso of zzso The repeated discharge of the C zzso causes an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Another important factor is the zzso of the central nervous system, and in particular this appears to affect the primary zzso zzso The central role of the sympathetic nerve is presently in zzso However, it is thought that a zzso of zzso patients exists in whom a zzso factor is the zzso of the sympathetic nervous system, and that it responds positively to sympathetic zzso Diagnosis is clinical and there are no specific tests, nor zzso symptoms to identify this disease with zzso Diagnosis of zzso after stroke appears more complex than in other pathological situations: the zzso upper arm frequently appears painful, zzso with altered heat and tactile sensations and slightly zzso skin within a zzso zzso Some investigations can aid differential diagnosis with other zzso Treatment may be zzso zzso with zzso regional zzso zzso and zzso In any case there is little evidence that supports the efficacy of the interventions normally used to treat or prevent zzso The key to effective treatment undoubtedly lies in a an expert multidisciplinary team that is zzso and motivated and that treats the disorder with zzso zzso
