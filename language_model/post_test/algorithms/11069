zzso zzso inversion methods are capable of eliminating image zzso associated with the widely adopted zzso reconstruction zzso Yet, significant image zzso might also occur due to reflections and scattering of zzso waves from strongly zzso areas in zzso zzso we modify the zzso reconstruction methodology to incorporate zzso weighting in order to minimize these zzso The method is compared with another weighting procedure termed zzso zzso yielding generally better zzso The zzso weighting is subsequently verified zzso attaining quality improvement of the zzso image reconstructions in the presence of acoustic zzso in tissue zzso and small animals zzso
