The Diversity zzso zzso population is a zzso stock derived from the same eight founder strains as the Collaborative Cross zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DO mice display a broad range of zzso Natural levels of zzso provide genetic zzso and, as a result, DO mice are robust and breed zzso zzso mapping analysis in the DO presents new challenges and zzso Specialized zzso are required to reconstruct zzso from zzso zzso array zzso The eight founder zzso can be combined into 36 possible zzso which must be zzso in zzso mapping zzso zzso structure of the DO must be taken into account zzso zzso zzso effects of eight founder zzso provide information that is not available in zzso crosses and can dramatically reduce the number of candidate zzso zzso effects can also distinguish chance zzso of zzso from zzso which provides a basis for establishing causality in expression zzso zzso We recommended sample sizes of zzso mice for zzso mapping studies, larger than for traditional zzso The zzso zzso strains provide a resource for independent validation of DO mapping zzso zzso zzso of the DO can provide a powerful advantage in our ability to zzso conclusions to other genetically diverse zzso zzso diversity can also help to avoid the zzso of identifying an idiosyncratic reaction that occurs only in a limited genetic zzso zzso tools and data resources associated with the zzso the zzso and their founder strains are developing zzso We anticipate a flood of new results to follow as our community begins to adopt and zzso these new genetic resource zzso
