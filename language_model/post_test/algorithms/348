The zzso of equations governing flow in zzso aquifers poses challenges for zzso models, particularly in zzso zzso zzso methods are often zzso do not zzso or require extremely fine zzso and small time zzso Standard modeling procedures such as automated model zzso and zzso Carlo uncertainty analysis typically require thousands of model zzso zzso and efficient model performance is essential to these zzso We propose a new method that offers improvements in stability and efficiency and is relatively tolerant of coarse zzso It applies a strategy similar to that in the zzso code to the solution of Richard's equation with a zzso zzso zzso The method zzso a contrast between horizontal and vertical zzso in zzso containing the water table, does not require zzso cells to convert to inactive cells, and allows recharge to flow through relatively dry cells to the water zzso We establish the accuracy of the method by comparison to an zzso solution for zzso flow to a well in an zzso zzso with delayed zzso Using a suite of test problems, we demonstrate the efficiencies gained in speed and accuracy over zzso simulations, and improved stability when compared to zzso The advantages for applications to transient zzso zzso analysis are clearly demonstrated by our zzso We also demonstrate zzso to mixed zzso zzso zone applications, including zzso and find that the method shows great promise for these types of problem as zzso
