It is well known that zzso zzso are translated at different levels depending on their sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso is of importance in prediction of the gene expression pattern by computer methods and to improve the recognition of zzso within cloned zzso zzso It may also be used in zzso experiments to zzso the expression of foreign genes in transgenic zzso 

The sets of zzso untranslated region zzso significantly different between zzso zzso abundant and scarce zzso were determined for zzso zzso plants and zzso plants, and collected in the zzso zzso Computer tools for the prediction of zzso zzso are zzso 

Programs for zzso zzso prediction are available at zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso (for zzso and zzso zzso (for zzso The zzso database may be zzso at: zzso zzso
