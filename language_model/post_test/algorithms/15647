The ability to identify zzso genes using zzso technology is dependent on zzso high-quality total zzso from the diseased tissue under zzso However, it is not always possible to obtain large amounts of affected tissue from patients and therefore the quality and yield of zzso may be zzso This protocol described a procedure for generating superior zzso zzso by amplifying zzso sequences via successive rounds of in zzso zzso zzso zzso This improved procedure zzso a zzso primer to generate the zzso template, which is able to zzso the size zzso of the original isolated zzso zzso
