A model depicts the relationship between clinical zzso and zzso on a set of genetic zzso After the model is constructed and zzso it may be used to predict clinical zzso such as traits of complex zzso A zzso model is used to predict the zzso or adverse drug reactions of a zzso The construction of a model is a challenging zzso This is because a zzso zzso does not contain enough information to zzso patients in general, given the complex biological mechanisms zzso An exhaustive search for the correct combination of zzso across multiple zzso is, however, zzso zzso We are, thus, motivated to propose a novel zzso for the construction of models using the multiple zzso zzso zzso information in zzso zzso This zzso zzso the techniques of genetic zzso and zzso algebra zzso The proposed zzso is tested on simulated data, as well as real zzso zzso of chronic zzso C patients treated with zzso zzso A model for predicting the treatment efficacy is constructed and zzso The results showed that the proposed zzso is very effective in zzso models zzso multiple zzso
