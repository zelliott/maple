The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac zzso in human zzso zzso are very zzso zzso the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great zzso In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human zzso cells that, while including a high level of zzso detail, is zzso cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of zzso zzso The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major zzso zzso the fast zzso zzso zzso transient outward, rapid and slow delayed zzso and inward zzso zzso The model includes a basic calcium zzso allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium zzso calcium current zzso and the contraction zzso We are able to reproduce human zzso zzso and M cell action zzso and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed zzso zzso Our model reproduces the zzso observed data on action potential duration zzso which is an important characteristic for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available zzso Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human zzso tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 zzso We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of zzso behaviors and provides a basis for studies of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
