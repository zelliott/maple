zzso of sequences that have descended from a common zzso based on an explicit zzso model of zzso insertions and deletions has risen to prominence in the last zzso Making statements about the positions of zzso zzso zzso is central in sequence and zzso analysis and is called zzso This statistical approach is harder zzso and zzso than competing approaches based on choosing an alignment according to some zzso zzso But it has major practical advantages in terms of testing evolutionary hypotheses and zzso zzso Basic dynamic approaches can allow the analysis of up to 4-5 zzso zzso techniques can bring this to about zzso zzso Beyond this, different or zzso approaches must be zzso Besides the zzso challenges, increasing realism in the underlying models is presently being zzso A recent development that has been especially fruitful is combining statistical alignment with the problem of sequence zzso making statements about the function of each zzso zzso So far gene finding, protein secondary structure prediction and regulatory signal detection has been tackled within this zzso Much progress can be reported, but clearly major challenges remain if this approach is to be central in the analyses of large incoming sequence data zzso
