The similarity of the marker zzso frequency and linkage zzso structure between two populations are major factors for the determination of the zzso and efficiency of zzso tagging zzso derived from one population to use for an indirect association study in another zzso To prove the similarity between northern East Asian populations in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 166 drug-related genes shared between zzso Han Chinese and Japanese were analyzed for their correlation zzso zzso frequency, zzso statistics and linkage zzso statistics zzso zzso showed a high correlation between these zzso zzso sets derived by an aggressive tagging zzso from these zzso zzso in Japanese and Chinese were used to test the coverage of East zzso zzso in zzso zzso derived from Japanese and Chinese are comparable in the percentage of coverage of the zzso captured with zzso at r zzso zzso zzso zzso in these drug-related gene zzso Additional zzso sets derived from the combination of zzso and zzso tagging zzso sets were used to test the coverage in zzso The later set improved the percentage of coverage of zzso captured with zzso at r zzso for these zzso High similarity between zzso and northern East Asian zzso frequency and linkage zzso statistics supported that zzso derived from the northern East Asian population should be useful for an indirect association study in zzso The combination of zzso Japanese derived zzso and zzso zzso improved the percentage of zzso coverage in zzso at least in these drug-related gene zzso
