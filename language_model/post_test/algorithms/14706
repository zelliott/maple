A high degree of reliability for critical data transmission is required in body sensor networks zzso However, zzso are usually vulnerable to channel zzso due to body fading effect and zzso zzso which may potentially cause data transmission to be zzso In this paper, an zzso and flexible zzso communication scheme for zzso namely zzso is zzso zzso adopts a channel bandwidth reservation strategy to provide reliable data transmission when channel zzso zzso In order to fulfill the reliability requirements of critical sensors, zzso priority and queue are employed to zzso adjust the channel bandwidth zzso zzso results show that zzso can alleviate the effect of channel zzso while yielding lower packet loss rate and zzso for critical sensors at zzso
