A classical model for zzso opinion change is the threshold zzso Here we study zzso of opinion change driven by threshold model dynamics in the case where multiple initiators trigger the zzso and where all zzso possess the same adoption threshold zzso Specifically, using empirical and stylized models of social networks, we study cascade size as a function of the zzso fraction zzso We find that even for arbitrarily high value of zzso there exists a critical zzso fraction zzso beyond which the cascade becomes zzso Network structure, in particular zzso plays a significant role in this zzso zzso to the case of zzso or zzso initiators studied zzso we observe that community structure within the network zzso opinion spread to a larger extent than a homogeneous random zzso Finally, we study the efficacy of different zzso selection strategies on the size of the cascade and the cascade zzso
