zzso constrained minimum zzso zzso are highly effective for analysis of zzso correlated brain activity, but their performance degrades when correlations become zzso Multiple constrained minimum zzso zzso zzso are insensitive to source correlations but require a zzso information about the source zzso Besides the question whether unbiased estimates of source positions and zzso can be obtained remained zzso In this work, we derive zzso source zzso that can be applied to both induced and evoked brain zzso They may be regarded as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the case of multiple correlated zzso We show that for arbitrary noise zzso these zzso provide simultaneous unbiased estimates of multiple source positions and zzso and remain bounded at singular zzso We also propose an zzso search zzso that makes it possible to find sources approximately without a zzso assumptions about their locations and zzso zzso and analyses of real zzso data demonstrate that presented approach is superior to traditional zzso zzso in situations where correlations between the sources are zzso
