zzso registration is a key instrument for zzso anatomy to study the zzso of zzso and zzso However, in order to be an effective instrument for the clinical practice, registration zzso must be zzso efficient, accurate and most zzso robust to the multiple biases affecting medical zzso In this work we propose a fast and robust registration framework based on the zzso zzso registration zzso The transformation is zzso by stationary zzso fields zzso and the similarity metric zzso a zzso local correlation zzso zzso Moreover, we show how the zzso setting provides a stable and consistent zzso scheme for the zzso of the zzso zzso and the flux of the deformation across the boundaries of a given zzso Thus, it provides a robust evaluation of spatial zzso We tested the zzso in the zzso registration setting, by comparing with state-of-the-art registration zzso on public available zzso and in the zzso zzso registration problem, for the statistically powered zzso of the zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso Experimental results show that zzso is a zzso flexible, efficient and robust zzso for the accurate zzso registration of images, which can find several applications in the field of medical zzso Without any additional zzso it zzso equally well zzso & zzso registration problems, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art zzso
