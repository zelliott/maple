To compare the dose and image quality of a standard dose abdominal and pelvic CT with zzso Back zzso zzso to zzso CT with zzso zzso zzso Reduction zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso examined the images of 21 patients in the portal phase of an abdominal and pelvic CT scan before and after zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The acquisition zzso dose and evaluations of the image quality were compared between standard dose zzso images and zzso images reconstructed with zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso 

The mean acquisition length was similar for both CT zzso There was a significant dose reduction of zzso with zzso CT compared to standard dose CT zzso zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso There were no differences in image quality scores between standard dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso images zzso versus zzso respectively, zzso 

zzso zzso zzso reconstruction enables a significant reduction in dose of zzso to be achieved with abdominal CT scan compared to zzso whilst maintaining equivalent image zzso
