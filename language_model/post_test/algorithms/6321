zzso of the zzso composition of normal zzso tissue is a prerequisite for understanding the zzso changes that accompany zzso changes during lung cancer zzso In this study, 12 zzso zzso mapping experiments are performed on frozen sections of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso images are constructed using principal component analysis and zzso cluster zzso zzso comparison of zzso images with zzso evaluation of stained sections enables the identification of the zzso origin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle, zzso zzso and zzso of the spectral zzso zzso zzso collected from the zzso side of zzso consistently show higher DNA contributions and lower zzso contributions when compared with superficial zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveal a strong signal contribution of zzso predominantly zzso These zzso are almost identical to the zzso obtained from zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso is mainly composed of zzso zzso Different parts of zzso tissue are distinguished by differences in spectral contributions from collagen and zzso zzso is identified by spectral contributions of zzso and zzso As demonstrated here, in zzso analysis of the molecular composition of zzso structures by zzso zzso mapping creates powerful opportunities for increasing our fundamental understanding of tissue organization and zzso Moreover, it provides a firm basis for further in zzso and in zzso investigations of the zzso changes that accompany zzso transformation of zzso
