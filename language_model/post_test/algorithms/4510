Breast zzso can be found in both benign and zzso zzso and the composition of these zzso can indicate the possible disease zzso As current practices such as zzso and zzso examine the zzso of the zzso they cannot reliably distinguish between the two types of zzso which frequently are the only zzso features that indicate the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is an optical technique capable of obtaining zzso information of a sample in zzso We demonstrate for the first time the zzso recovery of zzso zzso of zzso materials buried within a chicken breast tissue slab 16 zzso thick, achieved using transmission zzso zzso The zzso of both calcium zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso are obtained and chemically zzso The experimental geometry and gross zzso of the zzso signal to the depth of the zzso zzso makes the concept potentially well suited for probing human female zzso in conjunction with existing zzso or zzso to provide complementary data in the early diagnosis of breast zzso
