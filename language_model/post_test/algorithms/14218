Best linear unbiased prediction of genetic merits for a marked quantitative trait locus zzso using mixed model methodology includes the inverse of conditional zzso relationship zzso zzso for a marked zzso When accounting for zzso the conditional zzso relationships between two parents of individuals for a marked zzso are necessary to build zzso zzso Up to now, the tabular method and its adaptations have been used to zzso these zzso In the present paper, an indirect method was implemented at the zzso level to zzso these few zzso zzso results showed that the indirect method can perform faster with significantly less storage requirements than adaptation of the tabular zzso The efficiency of the indirect method was mainly due to the use of the zzso of zzso The indirect method can also be applied to construct an approximate zzso for populations with incomplete marker data, providing approximate probabilities of descent for zzso zzso for individuals with incomplete marker zzso
