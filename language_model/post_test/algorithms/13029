Cancer vaccine feasibility would benefit from reducing the number and duration of zzso without diminishing zzso However, the duration of in zzso studies and the huge number of possible variations in vaccination protocols have discouraged their zzso In this study, we employed an established mouse model of preventive vaccination using zzso transgenic mice zzso to validate in zzso protocols that reduce the number of zzso and zzso zzso With biological training, the in zzso model captured the overall in zzso behavior and highlighted certain critical zzso First, although zzso could be reduced in number without sacrificing zzso the intensity of early zzso was a key zzso of long-term tumor prevention needed for zzso utility in the zzso Second, after zzso ended, older mice exhibited more rapid tumor onset and sharper decline in zzso levels than young mice, emphasizing immune aging as a key variable in models of vaccine protocols for elderly zzso zzso studies confirmed predictions of in zzso modeling in which an immune plateau phase, once reached, could be maintained with a reduced number of zzso Furthermore, that rapid zzso in young mice is required for long-term zzso protection, and that the accuracy of mathematical modeling of early immune responses is zzso Finally, that the design and modeling of cancer vaccines and vaccination protocols must take into account the progressive aging of the immune system, by striving to boost immune responses in elderly zzso Our results show that an integrated in zzso zzso approach could improve both mathematical and biological models of cancer zzso
