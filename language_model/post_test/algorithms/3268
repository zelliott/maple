zzso states in networks of coupled zzso occur when some fraction of the zzso zzso with one another, while the remaining zzso are zzso Several groups have studied zzso in networks of identical zzso but here we study these states in zzso models for which the natural zzso of the zzso are chosen from a zzso For a model consisting of two zzso we obtain exact results by reduction to a finite set of differential zzso and for a network of zzso in a ring, we zzso known zzso We find that zzso can destroy zzso destroy all states except zzso or destabilize zzso in zzso zzso depending on the form of the zzso
