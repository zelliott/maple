A method for detecting shocks and impacts in zzso zzso time histories has been developed that is suitable for zzso as a computer zzso The procedure consists of comparing the zzso of a zzso mean value and the zzso calculated for successive time segments of the zzso zzso The indicators were the ratio of the zzso root mean value to the root mean square zzso and the zzso corresponding to a cumulative probability value of zzso zzso zzso the magnitude of the positive and negative excursions exceeded zzso of the time divided by zzso Both indicators have a value of zzso for random zzso with a zzso zzso distribution, and zzso from this value when the motion possesses other zzso For seat motion in the zzso analyzed using frequency weighting zzso and time segments of zzso zzso shocks and impacts could be identified when zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso visual zzso of 160 zzso to zzso recorded in a range of military vehicles operating under different conditions was performed by a jury of two zzso The zzso zzso agreed with computer identification of shocks and impacts in zzso of the zzso
