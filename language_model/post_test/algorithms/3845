The authors describe their perspective on the modeling of cardiac rhythms as a component of cardiac zzso zzso zzso They emphasize that these models are for a specific end purpose and that the aspects of cardiac behavior that are captured by the models are only those relevant for the development of the zzso zzso The approach is to use statistics to describe ranges of cardiac behavior that share some common feature with respect to the purpose of the signal zzso The statistical approach has the advantage that, coupled with a statistical performance zzso it specifies an optimal zzso zzso These optimal zzso are often zzso intractable, however, especially for real-time use in zzso zzso are therefore zzso The mathematical form of the model is then important since, even if two forms generate identical statistics, the approximations that are natural in different forms can be quite zzso Two different mathematical zzso are zzso zzso nets and interacting zzso zzso the different types of approximately optimal zzso zzso that are natural in these two zzso are zzso
