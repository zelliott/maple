Although previous studies investigating the zzso zzso database zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso have proven its high accuracy for bacterial zzso the studies differed in sample preparation, number of zzso quantity of shots and target types zzso In particular, the score zzso values of special importance for reliable species identification zzso The aim of the present study was to identify zzso differences in the mean score values for zzso zzso values recommended by the manufacturer were adapted using the 20th zzso to rule out unknown zzso factors, even though the specificity was high and the lowest zzso values would also yield an accurate zzso zzso correct species diagnosis was obtained in zzso of samples zzso only 220 of all zzso zzso revealed a score of zzso whilst zzso zzso had a score between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso had a score of zzso Ten of 21 species had a calculated 20th zzso of zzso and one species of zzso In conclusion, the use of zzso zzso values improves the relative sensitivity of species identification in zzso
