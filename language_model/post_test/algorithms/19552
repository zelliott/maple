zzso systems for recording and analyzing behavior have many applications for the study of zzso in zzso zzso In particular, zzso approaches allow for precise quantitative definitions of behavioral zzso that have traditionally been zzso described by individual zzso zzso systems also facilitate the analysis of behaviors that occur over long time scales or are difficult to detect by zzso Here we describe the detailed methodology for the use of one recently described automated tracking system for zzso zzso These protocols make it possible to measure a wide range of parameters related to the zzso body posture, and locomotion patterns of individual zzso and zzso zzso
