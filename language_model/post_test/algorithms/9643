zzso behavior is one of the most important firing activities of neural system and plays an important role in signal zzso and zzso In the present paper, a neural network with delay zzso is modeled to investigate the generation mechanism of bursting zzso The zzso zzso is zzso studied and then the zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso is analyzed with the external input zzso zzso dynamics in the neighborhood of the zzso zzso we obtain the zzso sets where the zzso zzso or the fold limit cycle zzso may happen in the system under zzso For a periodic zzso occurring in the neighborhood of the zzso zzso it is seen that the zzso zzso and fold limit cycle zzso may lead to the transition from zzso state to firing zzso Complex bursting phenomena, including zzso zzso zzso cycle zzso zzso bursting and zzso cycle bursting are found in the firing zzso The results show that the zzso properties of different zzso are related to the zzso behaviors derived from the zzso of the zzso Finally, it is seen that the bursting disappears but the periodic zzso appears in the delayed neural network for large values of zzso
