The mapping of sterile genes is an essential issue, which should be solved for the investigation of zzso mechanism in wide zzso of zzso However, the methods formerly developed cannot address the problem of mapping sterile zzso with zzso In this study, we developed a new method to map sterile genes with zzso in wide zzso of plants using a zzso zzso The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters of zzso zzso and effects of sterile zzso and the zzso results of these parameters were obtained using the expectation zzso zzso zzso The application and efficiency of this method were tested and demonstrated by a set of simulated data and real data zzso zzso from the simulation experiments showed that the method works well for simultaneously zzso the positions and effects of sterile zzso as well as the zzso between sterile zzso A real data set of a zzso zzso population from an zzso hybrid between cultivated rice, zzso zzso and its wild African relative, zzso zzso was analyzed using the new zzso Five sterile genes were detected on the zzso of 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, and significant zzso effects were found among the four pairs of sterile zzso
