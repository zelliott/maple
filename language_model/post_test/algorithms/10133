zzso provides MR zzso from multiple adjacent zzso within a body volume represented as a two- or three-dimensional zzso allowing the measurement of the distribution of zzso over this zzso The zzso of these zzso are usually analyzed one by one, without exploiting their spatial zzso In this article, we present an advanced zzso zzso method for zzso data, in which the available spatial information is zzso A zzso zzso zzso is proposed in which prior knowledge is included in the form of proximity constraints on the spectral parameters within a grid and zzso starting zzso A penalty term that promotes a zzso smooth spectral zzso map is added to the fitting zzso This method is zzso in the sense that several sweeps through the grid are performed and each solution may tune some zzso at zzso zzso studies of zzso data showed significantly improved zzso estimates after the inclusion of spatial zzso zzso zzso maps were also demonstrated by applying the method to in zzso zzso zzso Overlapping zzso or zzso of compounds present at low concentration can be better zzso with the proposed method than with zzso zzso The new approach compares favorably against the zzso approach embedded in the well-known zzso software zzso
