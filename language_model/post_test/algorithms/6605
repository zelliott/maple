zzso C is increasingly used to estimate zzso function, but its large zzso zzso limits its practical zzso This study aimed at zzso whether the clinical practice of zzso zzso C determination with serum zzso zzso improved the ability of the zzso and Gault formula to estimate zzso clearance zzso 

It was an zzso zzso study of zzso zzso with mildly impaired zzso zzso Using the zzso et al formula zzso zzso rate zzso zzso - zzso + zzso C zzso zzso linear zzso zzso and artificial neural networks zzso we integrated zzso C in the zzso and Gault formula and analyzed the potential superiority of this procedure by comparing its performance with that of the two zzso taken zzso 

The inclusion of zzso C in the zzso and Gault formula using the data of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso a simple mean between the two zzso or ANN ameliorated the zzso zzso precision allowing an absolute error reduction of approximately 4, 4 and zzso respectively zzso values 12, 12 and zzso 

Although the combination of the zzso et al and zzso and Gault zzso using both linear and zzso mathematical methods allowed a statistically significant reduction in the zzso error generated by zzso and Gault, considering the small impact on the zzso precision and the large zzso variation of both zzso C and zzso this procedure probably has no clinical zzso
