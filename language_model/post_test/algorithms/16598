In the current work, we have proposed a parallel zzso for the recognition of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The automated systems are used in biomedical field to help the doctors and pathologist by producing the result of an inspection in real zzso Generally, the biomedical signal data to be processed are very large in zzso A zzso computer is having its own limitation regarding its zzso So the fastest available computer with latest zzso also may not produce results in real time for the immense zzso Parallel computing can be proved as a useful tool for processing the huge data with higher zzso In the proposed zzso zzso zzso has been applied where multiple processors perform the same operation on different part of the data to produce fast zzso All the processors are interconnected with each other by an zzso zzso The complexity of the zzso was analyzed as zzso where, 'n' is the length of the input data, zzso is the number of zzso used in the zzso and zzso is the amount of overlapped data between two consecutive intermediate processors zzso This zzso is zzso as the level of zzso increase zzso with the increase in number of zzso The zzso has been implemented in zzso Passing zzso zzso It was tested with 60 zzso recorded zzso signal data zzso The recognition rate of zzso on an average was zzso
