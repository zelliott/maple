zzso is the most dangerous skin cancer and early diagnosis is the key factor in its successful zzso zzso dermatologists reach a diagnosis via visual inspection, and reach sensitivity and specificity levels of about zzso Several zzso diagnostic systems were reported in the literature using different zzso zzso In this paper, we will illustrate a novel approach by which a suitable combination of different zzso is used in order to improve the diagnostic performances of single zzso We used three different kinds of zzso namely linear zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decision tree, the zzso of which are 38 geometric and zzso features automatically extracted from digital images of skin zzso Multiple zzso were generated by combining the diagnostic zzso of single zzso with appropriate voting zzso This approach was evaluated on a set of 152 digital skin zzso We compared the performances of multiple zzso zzso and zzso zzso between them and with respect to single ones zzso zzso We further compared the zzso performances with those of eight zzso zzso performances were measured in terms of distance from the ideal zzso Compared with zzso and zzso groups, performances of zzso systems were significantly higher zzso and zzso zzso No statistically significant differences were found between the zzso and zzso groups zzso While the dermatologists group showed a level of performances significantly higher than the zzso systems zzso no differences were found between the multiple zzso groups and the dermatologists groups, indicating comparable zzso This work suggests that a suitable combination of different kinds of zzso can improve the performances of an automatic diagnostic zzso
