Digital zzso and vocal fold curve fitting are blended with detailed symmetry analysis of zzso to provide a comprehensive characterization of the zzso properties of injured vocal zzso 

zzso fold zzso of 12 excised canine zzso was recorded under zzso unilaterally injured, and zzso injured zzso zzso were created at zzso zzso and zzso of the vocal fold zzso and zzso parameters were compared zzso among conditions and were studied with respect to zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso asymmetry was found in the bilateral zzso The unilateral condition showed significant zzso zzso zzso and it showed the lowest zzso phase symmetry among the zzso In condition zzso vertical phase difference did not show significant differences among conditions, whereas zzso were significantly different among conditions at all line scan positions and most vocal fold zzso zzso differences in frequency were found among the conditions at all 4 vocal fold lips, with the bilateral condition exhibiting the greatest zzso 

Digital zzso and curve fitting provide detailed information about the zzso behavior of injured vocal zzso Awareness of zzso properties associated with vocal fold injury may aid in diagnosis, and the quantitative abilities of digital zzso may allow for objective treatment zzso
