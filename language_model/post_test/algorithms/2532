The general availability of reliable and affordable zzso technology has enabled genetic association studies to move beyond small zzso studies to large prospective zzso For prospective studies, genetic information can be integrated into the analysis via zzso with focus on their association with a censored survival zzso We develop zzso zzso methods to estimate associations between common zzso and a censored survival outcome in large cohort zzso Our zzso zzso zzso and weighted zzso zzso both based on the Cox zzso model, but differ in how the zzso zzso are integrated into the zzso Our approaches enable zzso zzso to be performed once as a simple zzso step, and thus avoid zzso based on sophisticated zzso that zzso between zzso zzso and risk zzso We show that zzso weighted zzso and weighted zzso combination provide valid tests for genetic associations and reliable estimates of moderate associations between common zzso and a censored survival outcome, and are straightforward to implement in standard statistical zzso We apply the methods to an analysis of zzso zzso and risk of adverse outcomes in a prospective cohort study of zzso with chronic heart zzso
