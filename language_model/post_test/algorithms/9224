One of the major concerns in detecting changes in higher moments is these changes may be due to zzso or process errors that are not biologically zzso For example, a larger zzso observed in the expression levels may simply due to the larger variation in the data collecting zzso Several zzso which exhibit some extreme expression levels than the rest of the samples, may also increase the zzso or zzso of the expression levels zzso So it is very important to reduce the effect of zzso and process errors by proper experimental designs zzso such as technical replicates and biological zzso before high sensitivity zzso such as zzso can be zzso We have presented and demonstrated the operation of two new criteria, zzso and the zzso for identifying zzso expressed zzso These two criteria were compared with several commonly used criteria, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with simulated data show zzso to be more powerful than the zzso When zzso screening is required, zzso appears to be preferable to zzso When an zzso similar to zzso is zzso zzso should be zzso The popular zzso rank sum is a more conservative approach that should be employed when the lowest zzso is zzso even at the expense of lower zzso ICE is a less desirable criterion because it does not perform well for data generated by the normal zzso zzso gave results similar to those of zzso zzso of these zzso using real biological zzso showed that zzso and zzso flagged several biologically significant genes that were missed by zzso besides selecting most of the genes that are also selected by zzso
