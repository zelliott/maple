Based on all kinds of adjacent zzso acids zzso we map each protein primary sequence into a 400 by zzso zzso zzso In addition, we further derive a zzso zzso mathematical zzso zzso which is extracted from the primary protein sequences via singular values decomposition zzso of the zzso The obtained zzso zzso feature zzso zzso further facilitate our quantitative analysis of protein zzso Using the zzso representation of the primary protein zzso we analyze the similarity for different sequences upon two data zzso 1) zzso sequences from nine species and 2) zzso sequences of 24 zzso We also compared the results in this study with those from other related zzso These two experiments illustrate that our proposed zzso approach does perform well in the field of similarity analysis of zzso
