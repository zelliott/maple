The three fixed effects zzso of a zzso are compared under conditions of random enrollment in a zzso clinical zzso These comparisons are performed by assuming five different enrollment zzso The zzso are compared via simulation using their expected mean squared zzso Unlike previous discussions of these three zzso we take explicit account of the effect of centers that fail to enroll patients to one or both treatment zzso Within each center, we assume enrollment follows a zzso process and consider the two situations in which the mean rate of this process is the same in every center and in which the mean rates are sampled from a gamma zzso The effect of patient dropout is studied as well as the effect of increasing the number of zzso zzso show that for many sound scenarios, the simpler zzso corresponding to the simplest model works better, even for the cases when data are generated by more complex zzso
