Many zzso formed by zzso zzso or rigid filaments exhibit zzso theology in the form of zzso and negative normal stress when samples are zzso in simple zzso zzso Two different classes of theoretical models have been developed to explain this zzso elastic response, which is neither predicted by rubber elasticity theory nor observed in zzso or gels formed by flexible zzso One model considers the response of zzso networks of zzso zzso that have zzso zzso relations arising from their zzso zzso The other considers networks of rigid filaments with linear zzso relations in which zzso arises from zzso deformation and a shift from filament zzso to stretching at increasing zzso zzso gels are a good experimental system to test these theories because the zzso zzso assembles under different conditions to form either zzso fluctuating zzso with persistence length on the order of the network mesh size, or thicker rigid zzso zzso of zzso and optical zzso shows that strain stiffening and negative normal stress appear at smaller strains than those at which filament orientation is evident from zzso Comparisons of zzso to normal stresses and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggest methods to evaluate the zzso of different theories of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the ratio of normal stress to zzso stress is one zzso that zzso zzso and rigid filament models, and comparisons with experiments reveal conditions under which specific theories may be zzso
