The zzso of zzso currents in zzso is known to be modulated by the membrane zzso but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully zzso In particular, the impact of membrane potential on the zzso zzso gating has not been zzso In the present study, the effect of membrane zzso on current responses zzso by zzso zzso applications was studied in cultured zzso zzso The current to zzso relationship zzso for responses to zzso zzso (10 zzso showed an inward zzso zzso zzso at positive zzso was zzso zzso zzso of that at negative zzso On the contrary, zzso for currents evoked by low zzso (1 zzso showed an outward zzso The onset of currents zzso by zzso zzso was significantly accelerated at positive zzso Analysis of currents evoked by prolonged applications of zzso zzso revealed that positive zzso significantly increased the rate and extent of zzso The zzso of current responses to zzso zzso were significantly accelerated at positive zzso indicating an enhancement of the binding zzso However, at low zzso at which the onset rate is expected to approach an zzso set by zzso and zzso rates, no significant modification of current onset by zzso was zzso zzso analysis based on model simulations indicated that the major effect of membrane zzso was to increase the rates of zzso zzso and of opening as well as to slightly reduce the rate of exit from zzso In conclusion, we provide evidence that membrane zzso affects the zzso zzso microscopic zzso
