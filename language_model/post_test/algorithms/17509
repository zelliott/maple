In this paper, the authors propose a new model for active contours zzso in a given image, based on zzso functional zzso and Shah, zzso The model is composed of a system of differential and integral zzso By the experimental results we can keep the advantages of Chan and zzso model zzso and zzso 2001) and avoid the zzso for zzso zzso More importantly, in theory we prove that the system has a unique zzso zzso
