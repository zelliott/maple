In vessels whose diameter is smaller than the length of the range cell or measurement volume, the maximum blood zzso is often calculated from the maximum frequency of the zzso spectrum, using the classical zzso zzso It is shown that the accuracy of this procedure is significantly improved at large zzso angles, if a correction for transit time broadening is zzso This finding is based on the demonstration that the maximum frequency of the zzso spectrum depends only on the maximum zzso passing through the measurement volume, but in a manner which is a function both of the zzso shift frequency as well as the transit time broadening associated with the passage of zzso through the beam zzso
