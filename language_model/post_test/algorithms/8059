With the rapid development of zzso zzso technologies, efficient methods for identifying linked regions using zzso zzso zzso data have become more and more zzso Recently, a deterministic method that works very well on zzso zzso data has been developed zzso et zzso zzso 2008, zzso zzso However, that program can only work on a limited number of family zzso In particular, the results (if zzso will be poor when the zzso data for the whole zzso of one of the parents in a nuclear family is zzso 

We have developed a software package zzso for identifying linked regions using zzso zzso zzso zzso We focus on handling the case where the zzso data for the whole zzso of one of the parents in a nuclear family is zzso We use the minimum zzso model for zzso zzso in zzso Several local zzso zzso are used to zzso the zzso of each individual and determine the linked regions based on the zzso zzso zzso We have developed a more flexible method to combine nuclear families to further refine zzso the length zzso the linked zzso 

Our new package zzso is efficient software for linked region detection using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can handle some important cases where the existing programs do not work zzso In particular, the new package can handle many cases where the zzso data of one of the two parents is missing for the entire zzso The running time of the program is zzso where m is the number of members in the family and zzso is the number of zzso sites in the zzso zzso is specifically suitable for handling big sized zzso This research also demonstrates another practical use of the minimum zzso model for zzso zzso in zzso The software package can be downloaded at zzso
