We describe an zzso to design the primary structures for peptides which must have the strongest binding to a given molecular zzso This problem cannot be solved by a direct zzso zzso because of an enormous number of possible primary and spatial zzso The approach to solve this problem is to describe a state of each zzso by two zzso zzso zzso acid type and zzso 3-D zzso and to minimize binding energy over all these variables zzso For short chains which have no long-range interactions within themselves, this zzso can be done easily and efficiently by dynamic zzso We also discuss the problem of how to estimate specificity of binding and how to deduce a sequence with zzso specificity for a given zzso We show that this sequence can be deduced by the same zzso after some modification of energetic zzso
