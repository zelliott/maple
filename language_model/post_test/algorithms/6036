We present a quick and easy method for the zzso of a zzso of zzso The zzso is based on a three-step zzso procedure which relies only on the constancy of the delivered zzso at each zzso With this method the gain of each sensor is derived relative to a reference zzso The zzso has been applied to a zzso of (32 zzso zzso zzso zzso After the zzso zzso have been applied, by comparing the response of the zzso of chambers to a reference detector over a large field, we determined that the zzso measurement of individual chambers is better than zzso The zzso zzso the cumbersome problem of the relative gain zzso of a zzso of a large number of zzso
