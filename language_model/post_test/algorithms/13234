We report zzso optical zzso zzso zzso that offers 1,000 times higher zzso scan rate than conventional zzso in the 800 zzso spectral zzso This is made possible by employing zzso zzso for chirping a pulse train and transforming it into a passive swept zzso We demonstrate a record high zzso scan rate of zzso zzso To show the utility of our method, we also demonstrate real-time observation of laser zzso zzso Our zzso zzso is expected to be useful for industrial applications where the speed of conventional zzso falls zzso
