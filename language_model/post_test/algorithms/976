This work describes the use of a method, based on the projection onto convex sets zzso algorithm, for reduction of the zzso ghost in zzso imaging zzso In this method, ghosts outside the parent image are set to zero and a model zzso is obtained from the zzso transform zzso of the resulting zzso The zzso and zzso phase corrections for each line of the original zzso are estimated by comparison with the corresponding line in the model zzso To overcome problems of phase zzso the zzso phase corrections for the lines of the original zzso are estimated by registration with the corresponding lines in the model zzso It is shown that applying these corrections will result in a reduction of the zzso and that zzso the process will result in a convergence towards an image in which the ghost is zzso The method is tested on zzso zzso zzso The results show that the method is robust and remarkably effective, reducing the zzso ghost to a level nearly comparable to that achieved with reference zzso
