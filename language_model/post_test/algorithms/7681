Echo zzso imaging zzso sequence used for acquiring functional zzso zzso time series data provides the advantage of high zzso resolution, but also is highly sensitive to the magnetic field zzso resulting in geometric zzso A zzso zzso map measured before or after the zzso scan to correct for such zzso does not account for magnetic field changes due to the head motion during the time series zzso In practice, the field map zzso changes with head motion during the scan and leads to variations in the geometric zzso We model in this work the field zzso with the object and the scanner dependent zzso The zzso term varies with the zzso magnetic zzso and orientation, zzso head position with respect to zzso Thus, the simple transformation of the acquired field may not yield an accurate field zzso We assume that the zzso field remains unchanged and independent of the head zzso Our approach in this study is to zzso estimate the zzso magnetic zzso zzso map from an observed high-resolution zzso field map using an zzso derived from a probability density function of zzso zzso This approach is capable of finding the zzso map regardless of the wrapping zzso A dynamic field map at each head position can be estimated by applying a rigid body transformation to the estimated zzso and the 3-D zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso discrete zzso model for computing zzso field zzso
