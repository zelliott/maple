zzso is an important molecular target in cancer zzso zzso agents able to bind to the protein are currently under study, commonly used in the clinic to treat a variety of zzso and/or exploited as zzso to investigate the zzso structure and zzso Here we report the binding modes for a series of zzso zzso A4 and zzso established from zzso studies carried out on the structure of zzso in complex with zzso The proposed models, in agreement with published zzso data, show that zzso A4 binds to the zzso site of zzso and that zzso assume an orientation similar to that of zzso The models can be used to design a new class of zzso zzso the zzso zzso capable of binding to the zzso site of zzso with higher zzso
