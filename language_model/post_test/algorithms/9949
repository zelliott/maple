Modeling zzso zzso data often involves linear methods such as principal component analysis zzso and partial least squares zzso These methods have the objective of describing the main zzso in the data and maximum zzso between the predictor variables and some response variable zzso If the experiment is designed to investigate zzso biological zzso however, the factors obtained become difficult to interpret in a biological zzso Moreover, when these methods are applied to analyze data, an implicit assumption is made that the measurement errors exhibit an zzso distribution, often limiting the extent of the information zzso A method for the linear decomposition of zzso zzso data by zzso curve resolution zzso which has been used elsewhere for time course zzso applications, is introduced and implemented via a weighted alternating least squares zzso zzso zzso of error information is incorporated in the modeling process, allowing the least squares projections to be performed in a maximum likelihood zzso As a result, noise zzso resulting from zzso peak shifts can be zzso eliminating the need for zzso The utility of the method is demonstrated using two sets of zzso zzso zzso data, zzso zzso in zzso and fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extracted for the zzso data exhibit strong correlations with zzso consistent with zzso fluctuations in zzso The concentration of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a steady increase, which zzso at Day 3 post dose and returns to zzso levels at Day zzso Other zzso including zzso and zzso exhibit the opposite zzso Although the fish zzso data are more complex, the profiles extracted by the zzso display characteristics that depict zzso variation consistent with processes associated with zzso
