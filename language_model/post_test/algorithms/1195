Our purpose in this study is to develop a zzso zzso technique for the zzso of suspicious zzso clusters in digitized zzso In previous work, a zzso diagnosis zzso scheme was developed that used local zzso analysis of overlapping zzso and a fuzzy zzso zzso to segment individual zzso and zzso analysis for reducing the number of false positive zzso The performance of this previous zzso scheme depended on a large number of parameters such as the intervals used to calculate fuzzy membership values and on the combination of membership values used by each decision zzso These parameters were zzso zzso based on the performance of the zzso on the training zzso In order to overcome the limitations of manual training and rule generation, the zzso zzso was modified in order to incorporate automatic zzso zzso For the zzso of individual zzso the new zzso used a neural network with zzso zzso The zzso zzso were created by processing the zzso features with a family of membership functions, the parameters of which were automatically extracted from the distribution of the feature zzso The neural network was trained to zzso feature zzso as either positive or zzso Individual zzso were segmented from positive zzso After zzso another neural network was trained to eliminate false positive zzso A database of 98 images provided training and testing sets to zzso the parameters and evaluate the zzso zzso zzso The performance of the zzso was evaluated with a zzso zzso At a sensitivity rate of zzso there was an average of zzso false positive clusters per zzso The results are very comparable with those taken using our previously published zzso zzso However, the new zzso is more suited to zzso its performance on a larger population, depends on two zzso zzso making its evaluation much easier and can be trained in an automatic way making practical its application on a large zzso
