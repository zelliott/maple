A novel notion of connectivity for zzso images is introduced, defined by means of a zzso connectivity assigned at zzso zzso In this zzso a zzso image is connected if all level sets below a zzso threshold are zzso The proposed notion is referred to as zzso level connectivity and includes, as special cases, other well-known notions of zzso zzso such as fuzzy zzso connectivity and zzso zzso In contrast to those approaches, the present framework does not require all zzso sets to be zzso Moreover, a connected zzso object may contain more than one regional zzso zzso level connectivity is studied in the rigorous framework of connectivity zzso The use of zzso level connectivity in image analysis applications, such as object zzso image zzso zzso zzso and zzso image zzso is discussed and zzso
