The maximum flicker frequency was determined over a zzso range of retinal zzso for a stimulus zzso designed to isolate the linear response from zzso zzso zzso For a particular retinal location, the data zzso to the zzso law and departed significantly from the predictions of the diffusion zzso The slope of the function was an zzso characteristic and was unaffected by stimulus intensity or area, zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the slope varied substantially with retinal zzso increasing by more than a factor of 2 between the zzso and 35 degrees zzso This increase shows that the time constant of the zzso zzso visual response decreases with increasing zzso The difference between zzso and periphery remained at high spatial zzso zzso that it was not attributable to lateral zzso zzso
