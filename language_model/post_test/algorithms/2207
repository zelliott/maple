It is not yet possible to predict an zzso outcome from zzso zzso coronary zzso or zzso coronary zzso zzso The purpose of the zzso project is to redefine complications associated with coronary interventions, to set up a zzso computer model to predict individual outcome and to compare the results to those of conventional statistical zzso zzso data items were zzso in 455 consecutive patients zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years; range zzso years; zzso male, zzso unstable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing coronary interventions at three university zzso zzso complication rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso vessel closure with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Computer zzso derived by applying techniques from artificial intelligence were able zzso to reduce the set of possible relevant risk factors from zzso to about 40, zzso to predict individual risk with an accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso to explain the structural relationship between outcome and risk zzso Patient data from two zzso were used to construct and test the zzso Data from a third zzso were used to evaluate the zzso The most important zzso acute zzso zzso heart failure zzso class zzso zzso unstable zzso complex zzso high low density zzso cholesterol and duration of coronary heart zzso Neither age nor gender impaired the zzso zzso coronary zzso results in acute zzso zzso however, for stable zzso procedural risk increased with zzso There was little risk from primary zzso zzso coronary zzso in acute zzso zzso in patients with zzso heart failure classes zzso however, the risk was high for patients in zzso classes zzso II, either with or without additional zzso zzso intervention techniques were no zzso for zzso but were zzso for zzso zzso
