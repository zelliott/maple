A new method for two-dimensional zzso of medical zzso images is zzso The spatial resolution of the zzso images is much higher compared to the common images of the fundamental and second zzso The zzso also results in a more distinct zzso zzso Unlike the most published zzso zzso for zzso images, the presented technique can be implemented using currently available hardware in real-time imaging, with a rate up to 50 frames per zzso This makes it attractive for application in the current ultrasound zzso The zzso is based on two-dimensional zzso zzso with simplified assumptions about the point spread zzso zzso radio frequency image data are zzso instead of common fundamental harmonic zzso Thus, information of both the first and second zzso is zzso The method was validated on image data recorded from a zzso phantom and on clinical image zzso
