To improve the zzso of zzso tumors in a virtual environment, we developed an zzso for color mapping the thickness of the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of this zzso as a component of virtual CT zzso 

Five subjects with a history of superficial zzso zzso of the zzso underwent zzso CT scanning after zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso images were transformed into three-dimensional models, and the thickness of the zzso wall was demarcated by using a new computer zzso and a fixed color zzso zzso were compared with those obtained by conventional zzso 

Three tumors, one site of benign wall zzso and normal wall thickness were correctly identified by using zzso source images and virtual zzso with color zzso 

Color mapping of zzso wall thickness is feasible and demonstrates both normal and thickened zzso Its value in identification of small or zzso tumors will require further zzso
