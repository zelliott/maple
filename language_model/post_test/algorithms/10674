zzso images in zzso zzso optical zzso zzso are zzso studied by the boundary element method based on rigorous zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso results of zzso and zzso images for samples with different zzso features are zzso zzso of the polarization of the input light and the optical parameters of samples on the resolution of zzso are zzso The artifacts in zzso images are also zzso zzso results indicate that the zzso images for TM input light and zzso images for both TE and TM input light give only the local changes of the sample topography because of the loss of the zzso component of the zzso
