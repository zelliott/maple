The widespread use of zzso experimental zzso designed to measure the entire complement of a cell's genes or gene products has led to vast stores of data that are extremely plentiful in terms of the number of items they can measure in a single sample, yet often sparse in the number of samples per experiment due to their high zzso This often leads to zzso where the number of treatment levels or time points sampled is zzso or where there are very small numbers of technical and/or biological zzso Here we introduce a novel zzso to zzso the uncertainty in the zzso intervals between biological zzso taken across a set of quantitative zzso The zzso provides a zzso distribution of possible gene expression values within zzso zzso based on a plausible biological zzso We show how zzso of this uncertainty can be used to guide researchers in further data collection by identifying which samples would likely add the most information to the system under zzso Although the context for developing the zzso was gene expression zzso taken over a time series, the approach can be readily applied to any set of quantitative systems biology zzso taken following quantitative zzso zzso zzso In principle, the method could also be applied to combinations of treatments, in which case it could greatly simplify the task of exploring the large zzso space of future possible zzso
