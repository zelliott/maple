More than 10 years experience in implementing the zzso Johnston and zzso methods has shown that they overestimate the sizes of zzso zzso and zzso when used in populations other than the zzso This study was designed to assess the zzso of the two most commonly used methods of mixed zzso analysis and to attempt to derive a more accurate and precise formula to predict the sizes of the zzso zzso and zzso in a sample of Indian zzso 

The sample included 200 study models zzso male, 100 zzso zzso zzso and zzso equations were applied to this sample and the mean differences between the actual and estimated tooth zzso were zzso New zzso equations were derived using lower first zzso and zzso as the zzso 

The mean difference between the actual and estimated values of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso methods were clinically and statistically zzso Therefore new zzso equations were derived taking lower first zzso and zzso as the zzso for both zzso On zzso these equations were found to be accurate and precise for this zzso 

It is recommended to use these equations as a method of mixed zzso analysis for the Indian zzso
