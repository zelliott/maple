zzso superficial zzso zzso tumors are most commonly treated with zzso zzso with the patient under zzso We report our experience with office zzso of small, zzso low grade zzso tumors using flexible zzso 

We conducted a prospective single institution analysis of 267 consecutive patients with superficial zzso cancer undergoing routine zzso cancer surveillance between January 1998 and December zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso criteria for office zzso were less than 5 low grade appearing zzso tumors, tumor size less than zzso zzso negative urine zzso and patient zzso All patients completed initial treatment zzso zzso partial zzso and/or zzso zzso and a minimum of 6 months on surveillance without recurrence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for small, low grade, zzso zzso tumors was zzso and well zzso Of the 123 patients zzso experienced 1 or more tumor zzso zzso 1 to zzso in a median followup of zzso zzso Of these zzso 74 zzso underwent office zzso No difference was seen in disease specific survival zzso zzso zzso or disease progression zzso zzso zzso When zzso by risk of recurrence 202 of 267 patients at high risk zzso with low grade zzso recurrence had similar rates of progression to patients at low risk zzso zzso zzso Median time from diagnosis was zzso years, and time from last tumor was zzso zzso 

Office zzso of small, low grade zzso recurrence is safe and zzso in properly selected zzso This change in practice can potentially improve patient quality of life and have a major economic impact on health zzso
