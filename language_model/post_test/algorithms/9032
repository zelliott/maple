zzso zzso zzso have been the standard measure of coronary artery disease zzso during the exercise stress test zzso Our past research has shown other zzso variables to be significant in zzso This study evaluates the benefit of routinely combining these variables in the detection of zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso with suspected zzso referred for zzso had their cases zzso Clinical and zzso variables were associated with zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso used to detect zzso during maximum zzso 

An increase in zzso duration was the most sensitive predictor of zzso with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and a positive zzso power zzso of zzso ST zzso zzso 1 zzso in lead zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and a zzso of zzso ST depression zzso 1 zzso in leads zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and a zzso of zzso When these variables were combined, specificity and zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso evaluation solely by ST zzso fails to identify a significant portion of zzso zzso zzso of zzso ST zzso in zzso and ST depression improved the identification of zzso
