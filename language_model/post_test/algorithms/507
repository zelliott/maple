In the zzso of Mass zzso zzso zzso data, peak zzso feature selection, and learning zzso are critical to zzso zzso To better understand which methods are more accurate when zzso data, some publicly available peak detection zzso for zzso assisted zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso zzso data were recently zzso however, the issue of different feature selection methods and different zzso models as they relate to zzso performance has not been zzso With the application of intelligent zzso much progress has been made in the development of feature selection methods and learning zzso for the analysis of zzso biological zzso The main objective of this paper is to compare the methods of feature selection and different learning zzso when applied to zzso data and to provide a subsequent reference for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso 

We compared a well-known method of feature selection, Support zzso zzso zzso Feature zzso zzso and a recently developed method, zzso based zzso Gene zzso zzso that effectively performs zzso data zzso We also compared several learning zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso normal based zzso zzso zzso recorded as zzso Support zzso zzso and a distance metric learning for Large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso To compare, we conducted a comprehensive experimental study using three types of zzso zzso 

Regarding feature selection, zzso outperformed zzso in zzso As for the learning zzso when zzso models derived from the best training were zzso zzso performed the best with respect to the expected testing zzso However, the distance metric learning zzso outperformed zzso and other zzso on evaluating the best zzso In such cases, the optimum zzso model based on zzso is worth investigating for future zzso
