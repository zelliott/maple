Although current zzso schemes can be very efficient in determining coronary zzso they may fail when the feature to be followed is disconnected (and the scheme is unable to bridge the zzso or branch points exist where the best path to follow is zzso In this paper, we present new zzso zzso zzso for determining vessel zzso and enhancing their zzso zzso A bank of even and odd zzso filter pairs of different zzso are zzso with vascular images in order to create an external snake energy zzso Each filter pair will give maximum response to the segment of vessel having the same orientation as the zzso The resulting responses across filters of different zzso are combined to create an external energy field for snake zzso zzso are represented by zzso zzso and are zzso on filter zzso with dynamic zzso The points of minimal zzso and the zzso zzso are determined from a zzso vessel zzso The system has been statistically validated using fixed zzso and zzso zzso It has also been validated on 20 coronary zzso with two independent operators, and has been tested for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The system has been found to be specially robust in complex images involving vessel zzso and incomplete contrast zzso
