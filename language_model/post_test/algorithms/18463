The Root Zone Water Quality Model zzso is a comprehensive, integrated physical, biological and chemical process model that simulates plant growth and movement of water, nutrients and pesticides in a representative area of an agricultural zzso We tested the ability of zzso to predict surface zzso losses of zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso against results from a zzso zzso zzso simulation zzso Model zzso included zzso soil properties and weather, but default values were used for most other zzso including zzso zzso No attempts were made to zzso the model except for soil zzso zzso zzso and an adjustment of zzso persistence in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the applied zzso zzso and zzso were lost in surface water zzso zzso zzso losses in the zzso zzso occurring 24 h after zzso zzso respectively 91 zzso zzso 86 zzso 6) and 96 zzso zzso of total zzso losses for these zzso zzso adequately predicted zzso water volumes, giving a zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso and loads from the zzso events were generally within a factor of 2, but zzso losses from these events were underestimated, which was probably a zzso effect, and zzso losses were overestimated due to rapid zzso The ratios of predicted to measured zzso zzso in all zzso events varied between zzso and zzso with an average of zzso Large zzso of zzso zzso occurred in zzso events later in the season when both loads and zzso were zzso The zzso root mean square error for zzso zzso concentration predictions varied between 42 and zzso with an average of zzso Pesticide zzso loads were predicted with a similar zzso These results indicate that the zzso mixing model used in zzso is a robust predictor of zzso zzso and zzso
