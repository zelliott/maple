The purpose of this study was to zzso radiation dose parameters of zzso CT coronary zzso Eighty patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso CT coronary zzso with heart zzso zzso pulsing using two zzso In 40 patients, the tube current was reduced to zzso zzso of the normal tube current zzso outside the pulsing zzso in 40 patients tube current was reduced to zzso zzso of zzso Mean zzso in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso the mean zzso in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso group being significantly reduced when compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso A significant negative correlation was found between zzso and heart rate in group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas no correlation was found between zzso and heart rate in group zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the conversion zzso for the chest, zzso CT coronary zzso resulted in an estimated mean effective dose of zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso exposure of zzso CT coronary zzso using an zzso protocol reducing the tube current to zzso significantly decreases with increasing heart rates, despite using wider pulsing windows at higher heart zzso When using a protocol with reduced tube current of zzso the radiation dose is significantly lower, irrespective of the heart zzso
