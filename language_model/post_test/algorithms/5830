zzso Visual zzso Potential zzso is a visual cortical response evoked by repetitive stimuli with a light source zzso at zzso above 4 zzso and could be classified into three zzso low (up to 12 zzso medium zzso and high frequency zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are principally focused on the low and medium range of zzso whereas there are only a few projects in the zzso zzso However, they only evaluate the performance of different methods to extract zzso 

This research proposed a zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to control the navigation of a mobile object on the screen through a scenario and to reach its final zzso This could help impaired people to navigate a robotic zzso There were three different scenarios with different difficulty levels zzso medium and zzso The signal processing method is based on zzso transform and three zzso measurement zzso 

The research obtained zzso ranging in zzso from zzso to zzso with Information Transfer Rate varying from zzso to 45 zzso 

Our proposed method allows all subjects participating in the study to control the mobile object and to reach a final target without prior zzso
