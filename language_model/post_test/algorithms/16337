Small molecules that zzso zzso interactions are of great interest for chemical biology and zzso Here I present a zzso approach to predict zzso sites able to bind both small zzso zzso and zzso in proteins of unknown zzso First, I develop a zzso zzso method that transfers binding sites of known three-dimensional structure onto protein zzso predicting zzso in zzso and protein binding sites with estimated true positive rates of zzso and zzso respectively, at zzso false positive zzso zzso this method to the human zzso predicts zzso proteins with zzso zzso and correctly recovers the targets of known interaction zzso zzso with significantly zzso zzso zzso more zzso zzso than expected were found to be enriched in regulatory and depleted in metabolism zzso Finally, I demonstrate the utility of the method by describing examples of predicted overlap and evidence of their biological and therapeutic zzso The results suggest that combining the structures of known binding sites with established fold detection zzso can predict regions of zzso zzso that are amenable to small zzso zzso zzso software and the results for several complete zzso are available at zzso
