The objective of this research is to design a pattern recognition system based on a zzso zzso State zzso zzso We try to find an optimal zzso with zzso zzso zzso In order to validate this system, the zzso has been applied to a real problem: distinction between normal and abnormal cells in zzso breast fine needle zzso images and zzso zzso fluid zzso The characteristic used in the discrimination between normal and abnormal cells is a texture measurement of the zzso distribution in cellular zzso Furthermore, the effectiveness of this method as a pattern zzso is compared with other existing supervised and zzso methods and evaluated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
