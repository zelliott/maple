An application of the zzso fluid mechanical method to the air flow in a two-dimensional model of an infant incubator was zzso The air flow in a zzso model was simulated and the zzso equations were directly solved using a zzso method incorporating a zzso coordinate system on a zzso The model was based on a real infant zzso slightly simplified for the sake of computing speed, and included a model of a zzso The number of zzso zzso was 101 zzso 61 zzso zzso The calculation was carried out under the condition of zzso starting zzso and the results were examined by the means of color graphics zzso There were several very large scale zzso in the incubator free space, and their global structure did not show strong changes once they were zzso Although the global structure did not change, small scale zzso were shown to be produced around the air inlet and zzso down through the free space of the zzso From these results, we believe that assuming steady and uniform flow in the incubator may not always be relevant when considering heat loss of a baby in an zzso The steady and uniform flow has been previously assumed either implicitly or explicitly by most of the zzso
