The aim of this study was to test a previously described training tool for ultrasound for use as a zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed in 10 patients with zzso fractures diagnosed using zzso zzso zzso One examiner ranked his zzso findings regarding the presence of a fracture on six zzso zzso landmarks on a scale from 1 to zzso These results were correlated with CT findings by displaying fused zzso In all but three patients fractures were correctly identified using zzso In the remaining three patients the examiner was unable to determine whether a fracture was present or zzso Normally, these patients would have been subjected to conventional zzso zzso proved to be a reliable zzso imaging zzso for the investigation of suspected zzso fractures in daily clinical practice, resulting in decreased radiation exposure since conventional zzso are zzso According to this algorithm, patients with zzso confirmed zzso fractures are examined for surgical planning using zzso zzso
