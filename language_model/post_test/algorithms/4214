The aim of this study was to characterize the optimal reconstruction parameters for zzso expectation zzso zzso with zzso zzso scatter zzso and zzso resolution recovery zzso We assessed the optimal parameters for zzso in an zzso torso phantom study, and evaluated the zzso of the reconstruction parameters in the groups of normal volunteers and patients with abnormal zzso 

Images of the zzso torso zzso 9 normal volunteers and 7 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso were acquired with a zzso zzso zzso data comprised a zzso zzso with an acquisition zzso size of zzso zzso A zzso mean square error zzso of the phantom image was calculated to determine both optimal zzso update and a full zzso at half maximum zzso of zzso zzso We validated the zzso count, contrast and noise characteristic for clinical subjects derived from zzso zzso zzso with zzso resolution recovery zzso and filtered back projection zzso were simultaneously performed to compare zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso zzso updates and zzso filter with zzso zzso zzso yielded low zzso value in the phantom zzso When we used zzso with 120 updates and zzso filter with zzso zzso zzso in the normal volunteers, zzso contrast showed significantly higher value than that derived from 120 updates and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the combination of zzso zzso updates and zzso zzso zzso produced lowest % root mean square zzso zzso Regarding the zzso contrast of patients with abnormal zzso zzso with the combination of zzso zzso updates and zzso zzso zzso produced significantly higher value than that derived from zzso zzso updates and zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso for the % zzso noise zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the number of zzso updates and zzso of zzso filter were zzso 120 updates and zzso zzso and zzso zzso updates and zzso zzso on the zzso processing, zzso Further assessment may be required to determine the optimal zzso reconstruction parameters in a larger patient zzso
