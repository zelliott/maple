Adding zzso to zzso solutions for peripheral nerve block zzso and zzso the action, but by incompletely understood zzso In an effort to discriminate the zzso from the zzso effects of zzso the authors measured the zzso content of peripheral nerve over the course of block produced by zzso zzso with and without zzso and correlated it with the degree of zzso 

zzso zzso nerve blocks were performed in 18 groups of rats (10 in each) with zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso Over the full course of nerve block, the authors regularly measured analgesia to toe pinch and then rapidly removed nerves to zzso zzso zzso content at zzso zzso after zzso 

The zzso of zzso clearance from nerve was composed of a zzso transient superimposed on a very slowly zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso content was to increase the amount of zzso in the zzso component by zzso to zzso although the total neural content was not altered by zzso for the first 10 zzso after zzso zzso prolonged blockade by almost fourfold and enhanced the intensity of peak zzso as well as the fraction of rats with complete block, almost throughout the zzso period of behavioral zzso 

Adding zzso to zzso solutions increases the intensity and duration of zzso nerve block in the zzso The early increase in intensity is not matched with an increase in zzso zzso content at these early times, although the prolonged duration of block by zzso appears to zzso to an enlarged zzso content in nerve at later times, as if a very slowly zzso zzso zzso received a larger share of the zzso The increase in early analgesia without increased zzso content may be explained by a zzso action of zzso that zzso enhances zzso zzso but also by a zzso effect that alters the distribution of the same net content of zzso within the zzso
