This study aims to investigate what is the best initial therapy for patients with zzso prosthetic valve zzso 

Data from 47 patients diagnosed with prosthetic valve zzso in two zzso hospitals during an zzso period were zzso 

The involved zzso were in zzso position in 34 cases (2 biological zzso in zzso position in 12, and in double zzso and zzso position in zzso The zzso was not zzso in 12 zzso In the remaining 35 patients, the prosthetic obstruction was treated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or direct surgery zzso zzso zzso There was no mortality in the zzso group, although 6 patients needed surgery before discharge because of an abnormal prosthetic residual zzso zzso zzso 5) or a zzso abnormal disc valve motion zzso zzso zzso Five out of 14 patients of direct surgery died, 2 before the planned operation could be zzso Thus, mortality rate, in an intention to treat analysis, was very zzso to zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso and this, despite the higher index of clinical severity (on a scale from 0 to 4) was superior in this group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in those who underwent zzso p zzso zzso 

In terms of mortality rate, zzso is a better alternative than direct surgery to fight against zzso prosthetic valve zzso Even if the result is zzso it allows the performance of surgery in better clinical conditions and, thus, with minor zzso
