zzso sensing provides critical information, such as force, texture, shape or temperature, in manipulation zzso In particular, tactile sensors traditionally used in zzso are emphasized in contact force determination for grasping control and object zzso Nevertheless, slip detection is also crucial to successfully manipulate an zzso Several approaches have appeared to detect zzso the majority being a combination of complex sensors with complex zzso In this paper, we deal with zzso analyzing how a novel, but simple, algorithm, based on zzso zzso can be used in a simple, but low-cost and zzso force zzso We also analyze the results of using the same principle to detect slipping in other force sensors based on flexible zzso In particular, we show and compare the slip detection with: zzso a flexible finger, designed by the authors, acting as a force zzso zzso the finger zzso sensor of a commercial robotic zzso zzso a commercial zzso force sensor mounted on the wrist of a zzso and zzso a fingertip zzso zzso zzso
