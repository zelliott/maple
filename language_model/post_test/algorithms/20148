Breast ultrasound zzso image zzso is a very difficult task due to poor image quality and zzso zzso In this paper, local features extracted from roughly segmented regions of interest zzso are used to describe breast zzso The roughly segmented zzso is viewed as a zzso And zzso of the zzso are considered as the instances of the zzso zzso learning zzso method is more suitable for zzso breast tumors using zzso zzso However, due to the complexity of zzso images, traditional zzso method is not zzso In this paper, a novel zzso method is proposed for solving such zzso First, a zzso map is used to map the instance space to the concept zzso Then, we use the distribution of the instances of each bag in the concept space to construct the bag feature zzso Finally, a support zzso machine is employed for zzso the zzso The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better zzso the accuracy is zzso and the area under receiver operator characteristic curve is zzso zzso
