In Aberdeen, a zzso zzso zzso scanner has been adapted to trigger off patient zzso signals, allowing for the acquisition of gated blood pool zzso at a number of slice levels through the patient's zzso This paper describes a system for the routine generation and display of surface rendered images derived from this data using a zzso based hardware zzso Surface rendering zzso have been implemented to provide an indication of the distribution of the cardiac blood pool in three dimensions, whilst the additional use of zzso and/or zzso sequences provide a zzso method of representing the extra information provided by gated zzso The zzso provides sufficient computing power to produce rendered views at a rate of about 1 frame per second, thus putting view selection fully under operator zzso The success of the system described is reflected in its routine use in a busy clinical zzso
