Since its introduction in 2001, zzso has grown in popularity as a software package for zzso zzso zzso using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso With this note, we announce the release of version zzso a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in zzso The new version provides convergence zzso and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the zzso The introduction of new proposals and automatic zzso of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many zzso The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming zzso extensions zzso and support of the zzso library, allowing likelihood calculations to be zzso to graphics processing units zzso on compatible zzso zzso factors range from around 2 with zzso code to more than 50 with zzso for zzso zzso zzso across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely zzso New models include relaxed zzso dating, model averaging across zzso substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial zzso tree zzso zzso of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the zzso zzso of species trees zzso zzso Marginal model zzso for zzso factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone zzso The new version provides more output options than zzso including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site zzso zzso branch rates, and zzso zzso A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for zzso in zzso and compatible zzso
