This paper proposes a tree decomposition of protein structures, which can be used to efficiently solve two key zzso of protein structure zzso protein zzso for backbone prediction and protein zzso zzso To develop a unified zzso based approach to these two zzso we model them as a geometric neighborhood graph labeling zzso zzso we can have a zzso zzso time zzso to decompose a geometric neighborhood graph G zzso zzso zzso into components with size zzso The zzso complexity of the zzso based graph labeling zzso is zzso where Delta is the average number of possible labels for each zzso and zzso zzso zzso the tree zzso of zzso zzso zzso is very small and the zzso method can solve these two problems very zzso This paper also compares the zzso efficiency of the zzso approach with the linear programming approach to these two problems and identifies the condition under which the zzso approach is more efficient than the linear programming zzso Experimental result indicates that the zzso approach is more efficient most of the zzso
