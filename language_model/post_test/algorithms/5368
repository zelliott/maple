Several lines of evidence suggest that besides zzso also zzso properties are zzso involved in zzso and protective activities of the major green tea zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso recent data suggest that zzso zzso zzso stress also in zzso zzso et zzso zzso Here we set out to identify factors modulating cellular effects of zzso in zzso Using the zzso zzso model, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso are significantly dependent on the ratio of cell number to working zzso Treatment with identical zzso zzso at altered experimental settings resulted in zzso values differing up to orders of magnitude and could even exert contradictory zzso This effect was based on zzso clearance of zzso zzso from the zzso In order to estimate zzso zzso equally effective under different settings, we have rationally derived and zzso verified a simple zzso relating zzso working volume, cell number and - indirectly - exposure zzso Algorithm application resulted in similar zzso clearance zzso from cell zzso as well as comparable zzso effects at different zzso Our results demonstrate the importance of standardized experimental settings when investigating zzso and/or beneficial effects of zzso zzso
