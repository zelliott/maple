zzso evokes massive zzso release from rat brain zzso by stimulating zzso and zzso from zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso release was shown to be involved in zzso release of zzso from zzso zzso The following agents have been exploited as zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A1 for evoking depletion of synaptic zzso zzso and enlargement of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso transport blocker zzso for determining participation of zzso carrier in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso acid for zzso zzso zzso As shown by the experiments with zzso acid, zzso and zzso A1 considerably increase the content of zzso zzso The treatment of the zzso with these agents modified the response to zzso particularly to its zzso zzso the lack or substantial lowering of the zzso release during the first 2 zzso after the toxin addition and substantial enhancement of release up to the 5th minute were zzso Only the step of enhanced release was sensitive to zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso was shown to be characteristic for different steps of zzso zzso release from the control, zzso zzso lack of any effect of zzso during the first 2 zzso and powerful zzso in 10 zzso after the toxin zzso Taken together these data appear to indicate that the toxin zzso from zzso and zzso origins releases the zzso the first rapid step reflects zzso zzso and the second zzso step is at least in part due to the release zzso by zzso zzso The incomplete zzso with zzso of the zzso step of the release evoked by zzso toxin zzso suggests the participation not only of the zzso zzso
