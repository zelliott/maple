To improve the ability of biologists (both researchers and students) to ask biologically interesting questions of the Gene zzso zzso database and to explore the zzso by seeing large portions of the zzso zzso in context, along with details of individual terms in the zzso 

zzso and zzso are two new tools built as part of an zzso web application system based on zzso 2 Enterprise Edition zzso zzso has a user interface that enables users to ask biologically interesting questions, such as zzso What are the DNA binding proteins involved in DNA repair, but not in DNA zzso and zzso Of the terms containing the word zzso which have associated gene products from zzso but not fruit zzso The results of such queries can be viewed in a collapsed tabular format that zzso the burden of getting through large tables of zzso zzso enables users to explore the large directed zzso graph structure of the zzso in the GO zzso The two tools are zzso so that results from queries in zzso can be zzso in zzso in the zzso in which they appear, and explorations started from zzso can request details of gene product associations to appear in a result table in zzso 

Free access to the zzso query tool and free download of the zzso zzso viewer are provided to all users at zzso In addition, source code for the zzso tool is also available from this site, along with a user manual for both zzso
