We present a new method for zzso an zzso setup that does not depend on input parameters and is less affected by systematic errors like drift of the zzso It is based on an zzso approach that uses zzso probability to zzso the diffusion zzso and the potential felt by a zzso trapped in an optical or magnetic zzso It exploits a much larger amount of the information stored in the recorded zzso trajectory than standard zzso zzso We demonstrate that this method zzso the zzso method and the zzso method in input information required zzso radius and trajectory zzso and in output zzso
