This work aimed to evaluate the image quality and accuracy of zzso and scatter corrections provided with the zzso Focus 120 scanner using the National zzso Manufacturers Association zzso image quality zzso 

zzso correction was obtained from transmission zzso using either a zzso or a zzso point zzso zzso corrected zzso images were reconstructed using zzso zzso zzso and filtered zzso zzso For zzso data obtained with the zzso source, fully corrected zzso images were also reconstructed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso expectation zzso zzso zzso zzso filtered zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maximum a zzso zzso The mean activity, the zzso of variation zzso of the uniform zzso the recovery zzso zzso for hot zzso and the zzso ratio zzso for zzso water and air compartments were zzso 

For zzso zzso zzso the mean activity value differed by less than zzso from the true zzso zzso the zzso with zzso resulted in lower reconstructed activity and higher zzso On the basis of zzso zzso the zzso for air and water zzso compartments were the closest to zero for zzso zzso The zzso measured on zzso images corrected for zzso but not for scatter did not show any significant difference linked to the transmission zzso However, higher zzso were noted for transmission measurement with zzso in coincidence with zzso when zzso data were corrected for zzso and zzso This resulted from a lower mean value in the uniform zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction methods showed little effect on the mean activity value, whereas zzso zzso methods gave zzso higher zzso Higher zzso were found with zzso reconstruction than with zzso and zzso However, the zzso seemed to be optimal with zzso zzso were higher with zzso methods and decreased with the number of zzso 

For studies of small zzso with the Focus zzso zzso transmission seems to be the most suitable method for zzso zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction methods appear to be a good compromise between overall image quality and reconstruction time: zzso provides the largest zzso but zzso provides superior zzso and scatter zzso
