This study zzso the ability of a novel family of machine learning zzso to identify changes in relative protein expression levels, measured using zzso zzso data, which support accurate class zzso The analysis was done using a training set of 36 total cellular zzso comprised of six normal and three cancer biological replicates (the remaining are technical zzso and a validation set of four normal and two cancer zzso zzso samples were separated by zzso zzso and expression was zzso using zzso zzso Analysis zzso The relative expression reversal zzso zzso correctly classified zzso training biological samples zzso as estimated using a modified version of leave one out cross validation and zzso validation zzso The zzso rule involved comparison of expression levels for a single pair of protein spots, zzso zzso and zzso both of which have prior association as potential zzso in zzso The data was also analyzed using zzso similar to those found in the extended data analysis package of zzso zzso We propose that by accounting for sources of zzso and zzso variation, zzso zzso applied to zzso zzso data provide a useful approach for identifying zzso that discriminate among protein samples of zzso
