zzso acid, a byproduct of zzso process, can be an effective catalyst for zzso of zzso into zzso Due to the low zzso resistance, easy to be separated and zzso there is a growing interest in the use of zzso acid as zzso In this study, response surface methodology zzso was used to zzso the zzso process in order to obtain high zzso yield and zzso Three important zzso initial zzso concentration zzso zzso temperature zzso zzso zzso acid concentration zzso zzso were zzso The optimum initial zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction temperature were 40 zzso 10 zzso and 180 zzso zzso Under these conditions, the maximum zzso yield of zzso and selectivity of zzso were zzso
