It is generally accepted that zzso females are born with a finite pool of zzso and that this is the sole source of zzso throughout the zzso life of the zzso This dogma was shaken in 2003 when researchers showed that the zzso stock might be renewable in adult zzso It has been proposed that zzso stem cells might be a source of new zzso These discoveries have puzzled many researchers and remain zzso In our study, we attempted to determine if transplanted bone zzso cells could provide new zzso in zzso mice and in severe combined zzso zzso mice after treatment with zzso zzso We also examined the possibility that grafted bovine embryonic zzso zzso might provide an environment favoring such a zzso We found no evidence that transplanted bone zzso cells provide new zzso zzso in zzso mice, in zzso mice treated with zzso agents, or with bovine embryonic zzso tissue zzso However, transplanted bone zzso cells have improved the fertility of zzso mice previously treated with zzso zzso These data suggest that bone zzso cells cannot provide new zzso but can positively influence zzso physiology to improve the fertility of mice previously treated with zzso zzso
