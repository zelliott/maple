zzso zzso is a critical zzso of the influenza virus and many zzso targeting to this zzso are quite efficient and encouraging as zzso zzso In this paper the binding model of five series of zzso to zzso was examined using molecular simulation zzso The resulted zzso and orientation of the compounds were directly put into zzso zzso The most significant zzso acid zzso at binding sites and the requirement for features of zzso were applied to direct design of new zzso The robust zzso model and its three-dimensional zzso map provided guidelines to building novel compounds with new scaffold and for structural zzso of current zzso
