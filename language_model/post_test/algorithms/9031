This contribution discusses the feasibility of zzso the major features of zzso its zzso zzso and how much of its global or local zzso might be deduced from signals that can be observed zzso The analysis presented is based on zzso zzso ranging from the classic cable theory, with sources derived from reaction diffusion zzso to a realistic zzso model zzso a whole heart model with electric sources represented by the equivalent electric double zzso The analysis focuses on the fact that the local zzso recovery zzso zzso at regions activated by expanding wave fronts is significantly longer than those activated by contracting zzso The consequences of this effect on observed magnitude and wave form of recorded signals are zzso
