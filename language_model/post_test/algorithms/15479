zzso evaluation methods of time history signals are used to zzso how well simulated human body responses match experimental zzso As the use of simulations grows in the field of zzso there is a need to establish standard approaches for zzso There are 2 aims of this zzso The first is to apply 3 objective evaluation methods found in the literature to a set of data from a human body finite element zzso The second is to compare the results of each method, examining how they are correlated to each other and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the zzso 

In this study, the methods proposed by Sprague and zzso zzso and phase error, zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso standard zzso zzso and zzso et zzso zzso and zzso or zzso size, phase, shape, zzso were zzso A 40 zzso frontal zzso test presented by Shaw et zzso was simulated using the Global Human Body Models zzso zzso male full-body finite element model zzso zzso Mean and standard zzso experimental data zzso zzso 5) from Shaw et zzso were used as the zzso zzso data were output from the model at the appropriate anatomical locations for zzso zzso Force data were output at the seat belts, seat pan, knee, and foot zzso 

zzso comparisons from 53 time history data channels were compared to the experimental zzso To compare the different methods, all objective comparison metrics were zzso and linear zzso were zzso The following ratings were found to be statistically significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Analysis zzso size, R zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shape, R zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso corridor factor, R zzso zzso zzso Relative strengths of the correlated ratings were then zzso For example, though correlated to zzso size, zzso carries a sign to indicate whether the simulated response is greater than or less than the benchmark zzso A further analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of each method is zzso 

The results demonstrate that a single metric is insufficient to provide a complete assessment of how well the simulated results match the zzso The zzso method provided the most comprehensive evaluation of the zzso Regardless of the method selected, one primary recommendation of this work is that for any comparison, the results should be reported to provide separate assessments of a zzso match to experimental zzso zzso phase, and zzso Future work planned includes implementing any forthcoming International Organization for zzso standards for objective zzso Supplemental materials are available for this zzso Go to the zzso online edition of Traffic zzso Prevention to view the supplemental zzso
