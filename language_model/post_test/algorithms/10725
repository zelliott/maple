We investigate the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso tool for the zzso rapid evaluation of tumor specimens and zzso of tumor from surrounding normal zzso zzso zzso is induced with a zzso nitrogen laser zzso zzso zzso zzso and the intensity zzso profiles are recorded in the 370 to 500 zzso spectral range with a fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are conducted on excised specimens zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso from 26 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters derived from the zzso zzso of each site are used for tissue zzso A linear zzso analysis zzso is used for tissue zzso Our results reveal that zzso is characterized by unique zzso characteristics that enable discrimination of tumor from normal tissue with high sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso The accuracy of zzso is found to increase zzso cases in the training set and zzso in the zzso set correctly zzso when parameters from both the spectral and the time domain are used for zzso Our findings establish the feasibility of using zzso as a tool for the identification of zzso and enables further development of real-time diagnostic tools for analyzing surgical tissue specimens of zzso or other brain zzso
