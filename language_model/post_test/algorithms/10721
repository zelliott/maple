Fluorescence imaging of zzso has gained significant attention in recent years due to the emergence of appropriate reporter technologies that enable zzso sensing of molecular function in zzso Two major approaches have been used so far for zzso molecular imaging, zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso molecular zzso zzso is an alternative approach that has been employed for imaging zzso in the past and could be similarly beneficial for zzso molecular zzso We investigate data zzso schemes in zzso and zzso mode and zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso offers significant advantages over zzso zzso imaging and over zzso zzso Our zzso based on zzso and on zzso and in zzso mouse zzso display image quality improvement, superior depth sensitivity, and improved imaging accuracy over the zzso methods zzso zzso zzso imaging retains zzso simplicity and could be used to improve on standard zzso zzso imaging and as a simplified alternative to the more integrated and accurate zzso zzso
