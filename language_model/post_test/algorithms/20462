The zzso goal was to develop a computer graphics model to simulate the displacement and zzso changes that are caused by the zzso of fine zzso zzso The authors developed an application program to zzso the zzso of models of an artery and a zzso The center of the displacement was determined by spatial zzso and the shape of the displacement of the zzso model was calculated using a zzso formula with representation of a brain zzso This computer graphics model was applied to the simulation of the displacement and zzso changes that occur when zzso is performed in the zzso zzso An illustrative case is zzso in which the zzso nerve was displaced by a zzso to simulate the surgery performed in a carotid cave aneurysm of the internal carotid zzso The authors have named this zzso tool a zzso zzso This new navigational system for open zzso would be useful in teaching surgical zzso and in zzso operative zzso
