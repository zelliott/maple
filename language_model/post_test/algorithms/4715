Human zzso especially zzso zzso are difficult to animate because of the high number of degrees of freedom of the hand and the need for the hand to conform naturally to the object zzso zzso human motion data provides us with a rich source of examples of natural zzso However, for each new object, we are faced with the problem of selecting the best grasp from the database and adapting it to that zzso This paper presents a zzso approach to grasp zzso We begin with a database of captured human zzso To identify candidate grasps for a new object, we introduce a novel shape matching zzso that matches hand shape to object shape by identifying collections of features having similar relative zzso and surface zzso This step returns many grasp candidates, which are clustered and pruned by choosing the grasp best suited for the intended zzso For pruning zzso zzso we develop an zzso grasp quality measure specific to the human zzso Examples of grasp synthesis are shown for a variety of objects not present in the original zzso This zzso should be useful both as an animator tool for posing the hand and for automatic grasp synthesis in virtual zzso
