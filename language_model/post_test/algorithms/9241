Image reconstruction in optical zzso is a zzso and generally zzso posed inverse zzso Noise in the measured surface data can give rise to substantial artifacts in the recovered volume images of optical zzso Apart from random shot noise caused by the limited number of photons detected at the measurement site, another class of systematic noise is associated with losses specific to individual source and detector zzso A common cause for such losses in data acquisition systems based on fiber-optic light delivery is the imperfect zzso between the fiber tips and the skin of the patient because of air gaps or surface zzso Thus the term zzso errors was coined for this type of data zzso However, source and detector specific errors can also occur in zzso measurement systems not using fiber-optic delivery, for example, zzso to local skin zzso hair and hair zzso or zzso zzso zzso Often it is not possible to zzso zzso effects in a way that allows us to remove them from the data or incorporate them into the light transport zzso We present an alternative method of eliminating zzso errors by regarding the zzso zzso factors for each source and detector as unknowns in the reconstruction process and recovering them simultaneously with the images of zzso and zzso Our method takes into account the possibility that zzso effects have an influence on both the zzso and the phase shift of the zzso zzso from simulated and experimental phantom data are zzso which show that including the zzso zzso in the reconstruction greatly improves the recovery of zzso and scattering zzso
