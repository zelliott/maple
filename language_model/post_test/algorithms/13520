The key to zzso function is the maintenance of an appropriate balance between molecular stability and structural zzso The lid domain which is very important for zzso zzso is the most flexible part in the zzso zzso In this work, rational design was applied to explore the relationship between lid rigidity and zzso activity by introducing a zzso bond in the hinge region of the zzso in the hope of improving the zzso of zzso zzso zzso through stabilization of the lid domain without interfering with its zzso zzso A zzso bridge between zzso and zzso was introduced into the zzso from zzso zzso in the hinge region of the lid according to the prediction of the zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed substantially improved zzso with an zzso increase in the zzso value at zzso and a zzso increase of zzso compared with the parent zzso probably contributed by the stabilization of the geometric structure of the lid zzso The additional zzso bond did not interfere with the zzso rate zzso and the zzso efficiency towards the zzso fatty acid zzso however, the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso towards zzso decreased by zzso probably due to the block of the zzso zzso channel by the zzso zzso Furthermore, in the synthesis of fatty acid zzso zzso the maximum conversion rate by zzso reached zzso which was zzso higher than that by zzso This is the first report on improving the zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso by introduction of a zzso bond in the lid hinge region without compromising the zzso zzso
