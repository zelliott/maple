We develop a systematic zzso for discovering network of regulatory zzso which identifies regulatory zzso and their regulation program by zzso zzso location and expression zzso Unlike previous approaches zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso and Botstein, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 95, zzso zzso zzso Hughes, zzso Campbell, zzso zzso zzso and Church, zzso (1999) zzso zzso 22, zzso zzso zzso Friedlander, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ziv, zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso 31, zzso Segal, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Botstein, zzso zzso zzso and Friedman, zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso that relied primarily on gene expression data, our zzso regards the regulator binding data as prior knowledge that provide direct evidence of physical regulatory zzso We applied the method to a zzso zzso zzso location data zzso zzso zzso zzso Robert, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thompson, zzso Simon, zzso zzso zzso Jennings, zzso Murray, zzso Gordon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gifford, zzso and Young, zzso (2002) Science zzso zzso for 106 zzso zzso factors and 250 gene expression experiments under the conditions from the cell cycle to responses to various stress zzso The results show that our method is able to identify functionally coherent zzso and their proper zzso zzso materials are available at zzso
