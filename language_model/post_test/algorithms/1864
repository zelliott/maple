zzso the mechanisms behind territory formation is a fundamental problem in zzso zzso The broad nature of the underlying zzso avoidance processes are well documented across a wide range of zzso zzso marking in particular is common to a large range of zzso zzso and is known to be fundamental for zzso However, despite its importance, exact zzso of the zzso over which scent cues and messages persist remains zzso Recent work by the present authors has begun to shed light on this problem by zzso animals as random zzso with zzso interaction zzso zzso emerge as dynamic objects that continually change shape and slowly move without settling to a fixed zzso As a consequence, the zzso distribution of such an animal results in a slowly increasing home range, as shown for urban zzso zzso zzso For certain other species, however, home ranges reach a stable zzso The present work shows that stable home ranges arise when, in addition to zzso zzso zzso each animal moves as a central place zzso That is, the zzso movement has a random aspect but is also biased towards a fixed location, such as a den or nest zzso Dynamic territories emerge but the probability distribution of the territory border locations reaches a steady state, causing stable home ranges to emerge from the territorial zzso Approximate zzso expressions for the zzso probability density function are zzso A zzso is given for using these expressions to zzso both the strength of the zzso movement bias towards the central place and the zzso over which scent messages zzso Comparisons are made with previous theoretical work zzso central place zzso with zzso zzso Some insights into the mechanisms behind zzso zzso laws of animal space use are also zzso
