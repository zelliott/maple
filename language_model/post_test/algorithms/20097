zzso clinical decisions concerning diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease rely on correct integration of data on coronary anatomy and zzso zzso The purpose of this article is to introduce a new left zzso zzso model for improved alignment of coronary zzso segments and zzso zzso territories, designed for the zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso study with a primary objective to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso detector zzso zzso zzso to detect coronary artery zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso deficits in patients with suspected coronary artery disease compared with the gold standard of conventional coronary zzso and zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso We describe a zzso segment and zzso territory alignment model, its application in both standard and CT image data sets, and the zzso process of the initial cohort of patients recruited for the zzso zzso zzso committees reviewed the images of the first 101 gold standard and 107 CT data zzso On the basis of the presented model and rules, all cases for zzso were correctly zzso During image review, 6 zzso gold standard and 9 zzso CT data sets needed further realignment not triggered by the zzso 

We present a vascular territory distribution model developed for the zzso zzso study, which accounts for zzso in coronary anatomy and potential zzso zzso territory zzso
