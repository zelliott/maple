Two types of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated for their glow curve response to separate zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were exposed to gamma zzso from a zzso source and zzso zzso using a positive zzso zzso The glow curve peak structure for each individual zzso exposure was zzso to obtain peak zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso glow zzso were obtained by zzso of the zzso obtained single field zzso Feature zzso were composed of two kinds of features: those from zzso and those taken in the zzso of several glow curve zzso The inner product of the feature zzso was used to discriminate among the pure zzso pure zzso and simulated zzso zzso In the pure cases, identification of radiation types is both straightforward and zzso zzso discrimination did not succeed using zzso features, but the zzso features proved to discriminate zzso
