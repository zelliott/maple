In integrated zzso and recognition of character strings, the underlying zzso is trained to be resistant to zzso We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art pattern zzso of this zzso First, we build a baseline zzso string recognition system with simple but effective zzso The zzso scores of the candidate patterns generated by zzso are combined to evaluate the zzso paths and the optimal path is found using the beam search zzso Three neural zzso two zzso density models, and two support zzso zzso are zzso Each zzso has some variations depending on the training zzso maximum likelihood, zzso learning both with and without zzso zzso The string recognition performances are evaluated on the zzso string images of the zzso Special Database 19 and the zzso images of the zzso zzso The results show that zzso training is crucial for neural zzso and support zzso zzso zzso for the zzso density models, the zzso of parameters is zzso The string recognition results compare favorably to the best ones reported in the literature though we totally ignored the geometric zzso The best results were obtained using a support zzso zzso but the neural zzso and zzso density models show better zzso between accuracy and zzso zzso
