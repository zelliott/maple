The in zzso investigation of joint zzso in normal and injured wrist requires the zzso of zzso bones from zzso zzso images, and their registration over zzso The zzso of bone zzso ranging from dense cortical bone to zzso zzso bone, the irregular shape of closely packed zzso bones, small zzso spaces compared to the resolution of CT images, along with the presence of blood vessels, and the inherent blurring of CT imaging render the zzso of zzso bones a challenging zzso We review the performance of statistical zzso zzso models zzso zzso region growing, region competition, and zzso operations for this zzso We then propose a model which combines several of these approaches in a unified zzso Specifically, our approach is to use a curve evolution zzso of region growing from zzso seeds, where growth is modulated by a zzso competition between neighboring zzso The zzso zzso which we interpret as the predicted boundary of collision between two regions, is used to couple the growth of seeds and to mediate long-range competition between zzso The zzso requires zzso representations of each growing region as well as the zzso zzso This method combines the advantages of active zzso models, region growing, and both local and global region competition zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for our application where many of the difficulties presented above are overcome as illustrated by synthetic and real zzso Since this zzso method does not rely on zzso knowledge, it should be zzso to a range of other medical imaging zzso zzso
