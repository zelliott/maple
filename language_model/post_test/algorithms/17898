In this correspondence, the problem of exponential stability for neural networks with time delay is zzso By introducing a novel zzso functional with the idea of delay zzso a new criterion of exponential stability is derived and then formulated in terms of a linear zzso zzso This new criterion proves to be much less conservative than the most recent result, and the conservatism can be notably reduced as the zzso goes zzso An example is provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed zzso
