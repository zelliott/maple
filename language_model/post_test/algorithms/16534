The complex mechanical properties of skin have been the subject of much study in recent zzso Several experimental methods developed to measure the mechanical properties of skin in zzso such as zzso or zzso are unable to measure zzso zzso zzso An experiment zzso the mechanical properties of in zzso human skin using a novel zzso zzso is zzso The zzso applied zzso zzso to the anterior zzso and the zzso upper zzso The zzso of the skin in each area is highly zzso zzso and zzso The response of the upper arm skin is very dependent on the orientation of the zzso A finite element model consisting of an Ogden strain energy function and zzso zzso was developed to simulate the zzso An zzso initial stress field, representing the in zzso skin tension, was used as an additional model zzso The model simulated the experiments accurately with an zzso of zzso for the anterior lower zzso area, zzso for the anterior upper zzso and zzso for the zzso upper zzso The maximum in zzso tension in each area determined by the model was zzso zzso in the anterior lower zzso zzso zzso in anterior upper zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso upper zzso The results also show that a finite element model with a zzso strain energy function cannot simulate the experiments with the same zzso
