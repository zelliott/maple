We present a rate model of the spontaneous activity in the auditory cortex, based on synaptic zzso A zzso zzso system of equations is derived and the analysis reveals two main zzso The first regime zzso to a normal zzso The second regime zzso to zzso zzso A detailed analysis of each regime is presented and we prove in particular that synaptic depression zzso the global cortical zzso The transition between the two regimes is induced by a change in synaptic zzso when the overall connectivity is strong enough, an zzso activity is spontaneously zzso zzso simulations confirm the predictions of the theoretical zzso In particular, our results explain the transition from normal to zzso regime which can be induced in rats auditory cortex, following a specific pairing zzso A change in the cortical maps reorganizes the synaptic connectivity and this transition between regimes is accounted for by our zzso We have used data from recording experiments to fit synaptic weight zzso zzso with the fitted zzso are zzso similar to the real zzso recorded in zzso during the zzso We conclude that changes in the synaptic weight function in our model, which affects zzso zzso organization and reproduces the changes in cortical map connectivity can be understood as the main mechanism to explain the transitions of the zzso from the normal to the zzso regime in the auditory zzso
