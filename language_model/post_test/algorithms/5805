A population that adapts to gradual environmental change will typically experience zzso variation in its population size and the selection zzso On the basis of the mathematical theory of zzso branching zzso we present a framework to describe the fixation process of a single beneficial zzso under these zzso The approach allows for arbitrary zzso of the selection zzso zzso and the population size zzso as may result from an underlying ecological zzso We derive compact zzso approximations for the fixation probability and the distribution of passage times for the beneficial zzso to reach a given intermediate zzso We apply the zzso to several biologically relevant scenarios, such as linear or zzso changes in the selection zzso and zzso population zzso zzso with computer simulations shows that the zzso results are accurate for a large zzso range, as long as selection is not very zzso
