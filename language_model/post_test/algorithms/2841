zzso zzso zzso products contain many zzso such as zzso acid and zzso The zzso content is an important quality indicator for zzso zzso A hybrid variable selection algorithm, which is a combination of zzso transform zzso technology and modified zzso variable eliminate zzso method, was proposed to extract useful information from zzso transform infrared zzso transmission zzso for the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso data were compressed by zzso zzso the irrelevant variables in the compressed zzso zzso were eliminated by zzso In the zzso process, simulated zzso zzso zzso was employed to search the optimal zzso zzso After the zzso process, variables for the zzso model were reduced from zzso to zzso Finally, the retained variables were employed as zzso of partial least squares zzso model to build the zzso zzso For the prediction set, the correlation zzso zzso of zzso and root mean square error of prediction zzso of zzso were zzso The prediction result was better than the zzso model with zzso zzso It was indicated that proposed zzso method could not only make the prediction more accurate, but also make the zzso model more zzso Furthermore, the reconstructed zzso represented the projection of the selected zzso zzso into the original domain, zzso the chemical interpretation of the predicted zzso It is concluded that the zzso transmission zzso technique with the proposed method is promising for the fast detection of zzso zzso
