A control zzso is presented that addresses the stability issues inherent to the operation of monolithic zzso laser zzso It enables a continuous pulse duration tuning without any onset of zzso zzso A demonstration of the zzso performance is presented for two radically different laser zzso zzso and continuous pulse duration tuning between zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso With practical applications in mind, this zzso also zzso control over performance parameters such as output power and wavelength during pulse duration zzso The developed zzso enables the user to harness the operational flexibility from such a laser with zzso zzso
