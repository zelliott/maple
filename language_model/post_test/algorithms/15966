A mathematical model was developed to predict oxygen transport in a hollow fiber zzso liver zzso Model parameters were taken from the zzso zzso zzso a blood zzso hollow fiber zzso with zzso seeded in the zzso zzso Cellular oxygen zzso is based on zzso zzso and zzso oxygen transport in the blood is zzso The effect of modulating three important parameters is investigated, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen consumption of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and hollow fiber oxygen zzso A computer zzso of the model is used to assess whether a given cell mass could be maintained within such a zzso The results suggest that liver cell lines possessing low rates of oxygen consumption could be maintained if zzso of sufficiently high oxygen zzso are zzso For primary zzso which have much higher oxygen demands, zzso transport of oxygen is rate limiting, and the zzso hollow fiber zzso is thus an inappropriate design for use as a zzso liver with primary zzso
