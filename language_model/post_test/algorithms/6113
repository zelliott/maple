The excellent visual quality and zzso rate of zzso image coding have limited applications due to exhaustive inherent zzso zzso This paper presents a new fast and efficient image zzso that applies the speed of the zzso transform to the image quality of the zzso zzso Fast zzso zzso using zzso domain zzso is applied to the zzso zzso of zzso transformed image and a modified set zzso in zzso trees zzso coding, on the remaining zzso Furthermore, image details and zzso progressive transmission characteristics are zzso no blocking effects from zzso techniques are introduced, and the zzso zzso problem common in zzso hybrid zzso is zzso The proposed scheme promotes an average of zzso reduction in zzso time comparing to the pure accelerated zzso coding zzso The simulations also compare the results to the zzso zzso zzso In both cases, the new scheme improves the zzso quality of pictures for zzso zzso
