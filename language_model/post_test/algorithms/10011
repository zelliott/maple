An alternative approach to determining embedding dimension when reconstructing dynamic systems from a noisy time series is zzso The available techniques of determining embedding dimension (the false zzso method, calculation of the correlation zzso and others) are known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso New York, zzso to be inefficient, even at a low noise zzso The proposed approach is based on constructing a global model in the form of an artificial neural zzso The required amount of zzso and the embedding dimension are chosen so that the description length should be zzso The considered approach is shown to be appreciably less sensitive to the level and origin of noise, which makes it also a useful tool for determining embedding dimension when constructing zzso zzso
