To compare the accuracy of the zzso and zzso methods in zzso lens zzso power calculations in normal eyes and eyes after zzso zzso zzso 

International Vision Correction Research Centre, University of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso eye models were constructed using zzso optical software, importing zzso zzso zzso ray zzso and zzso surface zzso data zzso ray zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso to predict zzso position zzso lens position zzso or zzso anterior chamber depth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Olsen 2) were used in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso lens power was calculated in 25 eyes after zzso zzso surgery using normal and zzso modified zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso were well zzso Using zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Olsen 2 to predict zzso position, mean absolute prediction errors zzso of the zzso formula were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso D, and zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso of normal zzso method were zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso D, and zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso of individual zzso method were zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso D, and zzso zzso zzso D, zzso No statistical differences were found between the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso formulas were as accurate as the zzso method in zzso power calculations in normal eyes and eyes after zzso zzso
