zzso the energy zzso of molecular clusters is a challenging zzso Traditionally, search zzso such as simulated zzso genetic zzso or basin hopping are usually used in conjunction with empirical force zzso We have implemented a basin hopping search zzso combined with density functional theory to enable the zzso of molecular clusters without the need for empirical force zzso This approach can be applied to systems where empirical zzso are not available or may not be sufficiently zzso We illustrate the effectiveness of the method with studies on water, zzso and water + methanol clusters as well as zzso water and methanol clusters at the zzso level of zzso A new lowest energy structure for zzso is predicted at the zzso zzso In all of the zzso mixed water and methanol zzso we find that zzso prefers to combine with methanol rather than water in the zzso zzso
