When a zzso optical zzso zzso zzso system is used to extract zzso images from a zzso information carrier, the resulting images may suffer from zzso zzso and zzso patterns derived from interference zzso We describe and analyze these negative influences that degrade the quality of extracted zzso images and propose practical zzso and methods to minimize zzso The emphasis of the discussion will be the removal of the zzso fringes produced by the zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso and experimental results of image enhancement for zzso zzso extraction using zzso zzso are zzso
