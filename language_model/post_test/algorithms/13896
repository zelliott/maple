Modern three-dimensional zzso zzso dose calculation zzso need to be fast and accurate if they are to be practical for treatment zzso zzso to a previously proposed zzso pencil beam zzso method are presented in order to fulfill these zzso Specifically, a fast zzso transform zzso zzso technique is used to speed calculation of the zzso the zzso spectrum is zzso and the effects of finite source size, a zzso zzso source intensity profile and partial transmission through a zzso zzso zzso leaf are zzso The use of zzso techniques in the calculation of small zzso fields involves approximations that are investigated for a 6 zzso beam and shown to introduce errors that vary with energy but do not exceed zzso on the central zzso zzso zzso calculated by zzso zzso are in excellent agreement with those calculated by full field zzso zzso Two key advances over the original zzso of the zzso model are zzso the fast calculation of the zzso zzso development, and the incorporation of realistic beam parameters enables accurate modeling of clinical zzso
