We employ grand zzso ensemble zzso Carlo simulations to investigate the impact of zzso zzso on the phase behavior of an adjacent zzso The zzso consist of a periodic sequence of grooves in the zzso zzso the grooves are infinitely long in the y zzso The shape of the grooves is controlled by a zzso zzso For zzso zzso 0 the zzso are zzso If zzso zzso 1, the grooves are wedge zzso If zzso zzso 1 the grooves become zzso and in the limit zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso potential representing a groove consists of two contributions, zzso that of the homogeneous zzso base corresponding to a zzso solid and that of a finite piece of solid with zzso zzso Whereas the former contribution can be calculated zzso the latter needs to be evaluated zzso For very large values of zzso that is in zzso zzso zzso we observe zzso zzso of that portion of fluid located inside the zzso As zzso decreases zzso zzso gives way to continuous zzso In all cases, a nearly zzso zzso interface eventually forms in the direction normal to the surface of the zzso base and outside the grooves if one increases the chemical potential zzso
