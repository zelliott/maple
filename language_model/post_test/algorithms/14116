Since the initial description of an zzso zzso zzso by Webb et zzso it has been suggested that departure from the zzso zzso zzso could indicate early lung zzso However, its significance has not been determined in zzso We aimed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso and to correlate the zzso values with pulmonary zzso 

The study population consisted of 21 consecutive patients with zzso evaluated with zzso zzso high-resolution CT and 6 patients with normal high-resolution CT zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso values were zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso using a lung analysis software program and were correlated with pulmonary function tests zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso values in patients with forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso zzso or zzso were significantly smaller compared with those in patients with zzso zzso in bilateral lower zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso The zzso values in patients with zzso zzso values zzso or zzso were significantly lower than in those with zzso zzso values zzso zzso lower zzso P zzso zzso left lower zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso values in bilateral lower zzso at zzso were significantly correlated with zzso and zzso vital capacity zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso 

The quantitative measurement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso values of the lung showed that these zzso at zzso in both lower zzso correlate with zzso zzso
