zzso differences due to experimental features of zzso experiments are present in most large zzso data zzso Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of zzso different production lots of zzso or different zzso zzso These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of zzso zzso 

We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within zzso data zzso Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor zzso zzso data zzso The new method of zzso zzso Discrimination zzso is shown to be better than Support zzso Machines and zzso Value zzso for the adjustment of systematic zzso zzso In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in zzso data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different zzso zzso
