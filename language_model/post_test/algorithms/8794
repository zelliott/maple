This letter develops a zzso zzso approach for three-dimensional zzso of an unknown number of sources in shallow water with uncertain environmental zzso The zzso zzso the zzso information criterion using zzso hybrid zzso for environmental zzso zzso sampling for source bearing, and Gibbs sampling for source ranges and zzso zzso expressions are used for unknown complex source strengths and noise zzso which allows these parameters to be sampled zzso An efficient scheme for zzso sources is used during the zzso A synthetic example considers zzso a quiet source in the presence of multiple zzso using a horizontal line zzso
