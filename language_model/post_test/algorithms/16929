zzso association studies have identified multiple genetic zzso zzso to several complex human zzso However, zzso frequency at zzso showing robust associations might differ substantially among different zzso In this paper, we present methods to assess the contribution of genetic zzso to the difference in the zzso of disease between different population groups for different zzso We derive expressions for the contribution of a single genetic zzso multiple genetic zzso and the contribution of the joint effect of a genetic zzso and an environmental factor to the difference in the zzso of zzso The contribution of genetic zzso to the difference in zzso increases with increasing difference in zzso frequency, but declines with increasing difference in zzso between the two zzso The contribution of genetic zzso also increases with increasing relative risk and the contribution of joint effect of genetic and environmental factors increases with increasing relative risk of the zzso zzso The contribution of genetic zzso to the difference in zzso between two populations can be expressed as a function of the population attributable risks of the genetic zzso in the two zzso The contribution of a group of genetic zzso to the disparity in zzso of disease could change considerably by adding one more genetic zzso to the zzso Any estimate of genetic contribution to the disparity in zzso of disease between two populations at this stage seems to be an elusive zzso
