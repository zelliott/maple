The export zzso model has been applied worldwide to the zzso of zzso source zzso zzso zzso the export zzso zzso from each pollution source and different zzso zzso is problematic because of uncertainty in the zzso of nitrogen from different land-use zzso zzso theory uses the prior probability distribution and likelihood data to generate a zzso probability zzso The total nitrogen zzso zzso and stream loss rates K zzso for five land-use patterns were estimated by combining published results with monthly data for zzso River system for zzso After zzso zzso the results had small zzso chain zzso Carlo errors and convergence was zzso Average zzso zzso for the entire watershed were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso field, dry land, residential land, zzso and barren land with zzso of variation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among zzso zzso The average K value was zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso K and the zzso water quality model were used to predict the years 2008 and zzso the results validated the zzso This zzso model can determine zzso using prior knowledge and monitored data, overcoming the problems of the zzso zzso The model zzso explicit consideration of uncertainty in zzso zzso
