In this paper, we propose a method to zzso zzso zzso using the zzso information bottleneck method for zzso zzso Although the method we present here is closely related to a group of methods based on detecting the presence or absence of zzso our method is different because it uses gene lengths as zzso We show that this amended method is zzso For zzso zzso we apply zzso and zzso techniques to input zzso As a result, we are able to propose an approach to determine the stability level of a zzso We demonstrate that the zzso tree produced for a selected small group of zzso looks a lot like a zzso tree of this zzso
