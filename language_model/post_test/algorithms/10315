Directed zzso applies mass zzso analysis to a subset of zzso zzso Here we describe a method for targeting select proteins by chemical modification with a tag that zzso a distinct zzso signature zzso in a zzso mass zzso zzso zzso signature transfer and mass pattern prediction zzso the technique exploits the zzso effects of a zzso chemical tag on a zzso mass zzso which can be detected with high sensitivity and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to detect zzso quantities of a single zzso protein from total zzso cell zzso at zzso ratios as low as zzso To identify a zzso zzso we performed an inclusion zzso shotgun zzso experiment where peptides bearing a zzso mass envelope were targeted for zzso allowing for direct site zzso Using this approach, zzso quantities of several targeted peptides were identified in total zzso cell zzso while traditional zzso methods were unable to identify as many zzso Additionally, the zzso signature imparted by the zzso tag was zzso on a zzso zzso suggesting applications in identifying large zzso fragments, such as those containing multiple or large zzso modifications zzso zzso zzso has the potential to enhance any zzso platform that employs chemical labeling for targeted protein zzso including isotope coded affinity zzso zzso tagging for relative and absolute zzso and chemical tagging strategies for zzso zzso
