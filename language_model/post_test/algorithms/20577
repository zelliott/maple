This study examined the effectiveness of cardiac pacing using the zzso DR zzso response zzso for prevention of zzso symptoms in patients with carotid zzso syndrome zzso or zzso zzso The zzso comprises both diagnostic and treatment zzso The diagnostic element consists of a zzso zzso used to identify heart rate changes compatible with an evolving zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment arm consists of pacing at a zzso rate and for a zzso zzso zzso patients zzso age 53 zzso zzso zzso with zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone zzso zzso 31) were zzso Thirty-nine had zzso zzso while the remaining four reported multiple zzso zzso Prior to zzso 40 zzso 152 zzso episodes zzso from 1 to approximately 1,000 zzso zzso over the preceding 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso follow-up duration was 204 zzso zzso zzso Three patients have been lost to follow-up and in one patient the zzso was zzso Among the remaining 39 individuals, 31 zzso indicated absence or diminished frequency of symptoms, or less severe zzso zzso patients zzso or zzso were zzso with respect to zzso or zzso Sixteen patients had symptom zzso Of these, seven experienced zzso zzso or zzso and 9 zzso had zzso the majority of patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were individuals with a history of zzso zzso zzso although symptoms were observed during zzso zzso they appeared to be of reduced frequency and zzso Thus, our findings suggest that a transient period of high rate pacing triggered by the zzso DR zzso response zzso was beneficial in a large proportion of highly symptomatic patients with zzso or zzso zzso
