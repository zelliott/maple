Diagnosis of the zzso power of zzso zzso with zzso zzso disease zzso is challenging during coronary interventions, especially under variable zzso factors like heart rate zzso The goal of this study is to assess the influence of variable zzso and percent area zzso zzso in the presence of zzso on pressure drop zzso zzso ratio of zzso pressure drop to the zzso dynamic zzso and zzso flow zzso zzso ratio of zzso to the zzso at the throat zzso We zzso that zzso and zzso are independent of zzso zzso and zzso were created using zzso balloons and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of pressure drop zzso and zzso were done in 11 zzso zzso zzso flow reserve zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for the groups zzso zzso 120 and zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso 50 and zzso zzso 50, and additionally for zzso zzso 14 and zzso zzso 14 zzso and analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed independence between zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso while it showed dependence between zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso analysis, for the zzso zzso 120 zzso and zzso zzso 120 zzso groups, the values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different zzso zzso zzso However, for zzso zzso 50 and zzso zzso 50, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso A similar trend was observed between the zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly influenced by changes in HR, while they can significantly distinguish zzso and zzso zzso
