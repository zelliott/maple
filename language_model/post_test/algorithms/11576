In the 1st part of this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in layer V of the rat prefrontal zzso zzso were evoked by electrical stimulation of layer zzso zzso with zzso sharp, zzso showed a zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso when given alone depressed the zzso and in addition antagonized the effect of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso component of the zzso by zzso acid zzso abolished the zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso caused zzso zzso zzso inhibited the effect of zzso but did not alter that of zzso zzso was also under these conditions zzso with zzso In the 2nd part of the study, zzso currents were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso of the responses to zzso zzso alone did not alter the zzso but again antagonized the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso also abolished the zzso zzso The zzso zzso persisted in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso applied to the external medium and the zzso solution, zzso The zzso zzso moderately decreased the zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso on zzso and the interaction with zzso was observed also in layer V zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso receptors appear to exert a new zzso influence on fast zzso zzso acid transmission in the cerebral zzso
