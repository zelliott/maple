The zzso of zzso zzso of starch zzso from six different zzso sources zzso zzso zzso zzso sweet zzso and zzso was studied by the use of an zzso zzso zzso A higher rate of zzso was obtained as a smaller size of starch zzso was zzso The zzso amount of zzso on the zzso surface per unit area did not vary very much with the type of starch zzso zzso while the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for rice, zzso zzso zzso sweet zzso and potato respectively, showing that zzso was largely influenced by the type of starch zzso A comparison of the zzso in relation to the zzso structure of the starch zzso suggested that zzso increases as the zzso structure becomes zzso
