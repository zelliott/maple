The prediction of significant short functional protein sequences has inherent zzso In predicting zzso sites, problems came from the zzso of zzso sites, the difficulties in maintaining many different zzso models of binding sites, and the difficulties of obtaining highly sensitive predictions and of obtaining predictions with a constant sensitivity and zzso The zzso presented in this paper overcomes these zzso The proposed zzso zzso is based on the zzso sequence zzso This enables the prediction of zzso sites with constant specificity and zzso Furthermore, this method leads not only to the prediction of zzso sites in general but also predicts the most probable type of zzso zzso 

The tool zzso implementing the presented method can be evaluated under the zzso zzso
