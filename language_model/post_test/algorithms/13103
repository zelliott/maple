We present here a comparison of different zzso zzso decoupling sequences at the moderate zzso spinning zzso frequency zzso of 30 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso ranges from the low power zzso to the high power regime zzso and includes the rotary resonance conditions zzso where zzso zzso For decoupling at the rotary resonance condition, we recently introduced a modification of zzso namely zzso zzso whose properties will be discussed zzso Finally, based on earlier published and current experimental results we suggest the optimal sequence for zzso zzso decoupling at any zzso zzso and zzso zzso up to 35 zzso
