zzso principal component analysis zzso has been proposed to reduce the dimension of the parameters of probability zzso using zzso information as a distance between two zzso It also provides a framework for dealing with various data types such as zzso and zzso for which the zzso assumption on the data distribution is zzso In this paper, we introduce a zzso variable model for the zzso Assuming the discrete distribution on the zzso variable leads to mixture models with constraint on their zzso This provides a framework for zzso on the lower zzso zzso of exponential family zzso We derive a learning zzso for those mixture models based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although intractable integration is required to implement the zzso for a zzso an approximation technique using zzso method allows us to carry out zzso on an arbitrary zzso Combined with the zzso of the zzso the resulting zzso performs simultaneous zzso reduction and zzso zzso experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate its effectiveness for zzso the structures of data as a zzso technique and its high zzso ability as a density zzso zzso
