We propose a solid-state zzso method that zzso the advantages of high-resolution zzso zzso applied to intact zzso when compared to more conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, zzso simulations and experimental results on intact human brain zzso are zzso zzso it is proven that an zzso zzso zzso zzso through Bond correlation zzso solid-state zzso pulse sequence for two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixing provides a zzso improvement in zzso ratio relative to its zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso For this purpose we have refined the zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence for zzso MRS use and compared it to zzso zzso zzso Both sequences were zzso and implemented using zzso zzso inversion zzso As discussed theoretically and shown in simulations, the improved zzso comes from actively removing residual zzso zzso from the average zzso zzso the solid-state zzso techniques are tailored to perform zzso at low temperatures where sample degradation is zzso This is the first demonstration of such a concept for zzso zzso profiling of disease zzso including cancer, from zzso requiring reduced sample degradation for further zzso zzso
