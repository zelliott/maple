This paper reports on a theoretical examination of the hypothesis that red blood cell network characteristics influence the mechanical properties of the zzso For this purpose a newly developed zzso based blood zzso model, which incorporates network zzso was used to predict the transient zzso of blood zzso zzso results of this model have been reported in zzso 46 zzso zzso The main network characteristic examined in the present work was the zzso branch size and its relationship to the evolving zzso Branch size was used to define a network integrity index that accounted for the strength of the developed zzso For the development and validation of the model, experiments performed with an optical zzso zzso with different zzso in zzso rate, were zzso as well as zzso zzso under similar flow conditions performed in a double wall zzso zzso The experimental data were compared with the response of the model, which incorporated the network integrity zzso The results suggest that network characteristics may influence the zzso of blood at low zzso rates and exhibit good agreement with experimental zzso
