Gene expression has a zzso component because of the zzso nature of the gene and the small number of copies of individual zzso proteins in the zzso We show how the statistics of such systems can be mapped onto quantum zzso zzso The dynamics of a single gene switch resembles the zzso model of a zzso zzso or an electron transfer zzso Networks of switches can be approximately described as quantum spin systems by using an appropriate zzso zzso In this way, the concept of frustration for magnetic systems can be taken over into gene zzso The landscape of stable zzso depends on the degree and style of frustration, much as for neural zzso We show the number of zzso which may represent cell types, is much smaller for appropriately designed zzso frustrated zzso networks than for randomly connected zzso
