Health institutions may choose to screen newly admitted patients for the presence of disease in order to reduce disease prevalence within the zzso zzso is costly, and institutions must judiciously choose which patients they wish to screen based on the dynamics of disease zzso Since potentially infected patients move between different health institutions, the screening and treatment decisions of one institution will affect the optimal decisions of zzso an institution might choose to zzso off the screening and treatment decisions of neighboring zzso We develop a theoretical model of the strategic decision problem facing a health care institution choosing to screen newly admitted zzso The model incorporates an zzso zzso model of disease transmission into a game zzso model of strategic zzso Using this setup, we are able to analyze how optimal screening is influenced by disease zzso such as the efficacy of treatment, the disease recovery rate and the movement of zzso We find that the optimal screening level is lower for diseases that have more effective zzso Our model also allows us to analyze how the optimal screening level varies with the number of decision makers involved in the screening zzso We show that when institutions are more autonomous in selecting whom to screen, they will choose to screen at a lower rate than when screening decisions are more zzso zzso also suggest that zzso screening decisions have a greater impact on disease prevalence when the availability or efficacy of treatment is zzso Our model provides insight into the factors one should consider when choosing whether to set a mandated screening zzso We find that screening mandates set at a zzso level zzso state or zzso will have a greater impact on the control of infectious zzso
