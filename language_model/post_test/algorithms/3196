It had been previously shown that an idealized version of the zzso extension of the zzso zzso spin echo diffusion experiment can be used to determine the apparent radius of zzso with restricted zzso In the present work, the feasibility of the experiment was demonstrated in an zzso imaging experiment, in which the apparent radius of zzso in white matter tissue was zzso Moreover, zzso simulations have been carried out to determine the reliability of the zzso For small diffusion times, the radius is systematically zzso zzso zzso area, finite length zzso zzso and a statistical distribution of zzso within a zzso all have a minor influence on the estimated zzso
