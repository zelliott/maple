zzso has been increasingly used in protein zzso and design strategies in order to predict the structure of zzso zzso Here we test capabilities of zzso zzso part of the newly developed zzso zzso modeling suite, against zzso Benchmark zzso and compare it with zzso zzso the latest version of the previous zzso software zzso The benchmark contains a diverse set of 116 zzso targets including 22 zzso complexes, 33 zzso complexes, and 60 zzso zzso These targets were further classified by expected zzso difficulty into 84 zzso targets, 17 medium targets, and 14 difficult zzso We carried out local zzso zzso for each target, using the zzso structures when available, in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the performances of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso achieved 56 zzso zzso compared to 49 in zzso A breakdown of zzso performance by protein complex type shows that zzso zzso achieved zzso zzso for zzso of zzso targets, zzso of zzso targets, and zzso of zzso zzso In terms of zzso difficulty, zzso zzso achieved zzso for zzso of zzso targets, zzso of medium targets, and zzso of difficult zzso For targets that failed, we carry out additional analyses to identify the cause of failure, which showed that zzso backbone zzso changes account for a majority of zzso We also present a zzso statistical analysis that zzso the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate the additional functionality available in zzso zzso by incorporating zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of a smaller target zzso This study marks the most extensive zzso of the zzso module to date and establishes a baseline for future research in protein interface modeling and structure zzso
