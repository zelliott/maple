Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso offers a zzso powerful, zzso zzso method for the identification of chemical and biological zzso The use of radio frequency zzso zzso has been shown to increase the sensitivity in zzso zzso Recent advances in zzso technology have further demonstrated a substantial increase in mass sensitivity zzso Olson, zzso Peck, zzso Webb, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso samples, Science zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods for producing zzso zzso possess a level of flexibility and zzso that exceeds previous production methods, such as hand winding zzso This paper presents electrical zzso of zzso zzso produced by a unique laser zzso system that can pattern three zzso surfaces and compares calculated and experimental results to those for wire wound zzso zzso We show that existing zzso conditions for zzso zzso design still hold true for zzso zzso produced by zzso Current zzso zzso show somewhat inferior performance to wire wound zzso zzso due to limitations in the existing zzso zzso In principle, however, when the pitch of the zzso zzso is less than zzso zzso coils should show comparable performance to wire wound zzso In the cases of larger pitch, wire cross sections can be significantly larger and zzso lower than zzso zzso
