In zzso zzso surgery, recovering three-dimensional zzso anatomy from incomplete information has been focus of interest due to several factors such as less invasive surgical procedures, reduced radiation doses, and rapid zzso updates of the zzso The aim of this paper is to report results obtained combining statistical shape modeling and zzso zzso techniques for predicting bone shape from clinically and surgically relevant zzso including sparse observations of the bone surface but also zzso and zzso zzso Different state of the art methods such as partial least square regression, principal component regression, zzso correlation analysis, and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso relevant surrogate variables and combinations are investigated on a database of 142 zzso and 154 zzso shapes obtained from CT zzso The results are evaluated using cross validation to zzso the prediction zzso The proposed approach enables to characterize the added value of different zzso in a quantitative and localized zzso zzso indicate that complementary sources of information can be efficiently exploited to improve the accuracy of shape zzso
