This study aims to evaluate the zzso of the treatment of brain zzso with surgical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso country of Vietnam from the perspective of patients and zzso 

The treatment of 111 patients with brain zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso score matching was used to adjust for selection bias zzso zzso 30 zzso mean and zzso of survival time were defined by the zzso zzso the cost analysis focused on the time period of relevant zzso 

The mean survival times of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso months, and the zzso survival rates were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The mean number of hospital bed days was significantly higher for zzso than zzso zzso versus zzso days, P zzso zzso but direct costs of zzso were significantly lower zzso as opposed to zzso million Vietnamese zzso zzso per patient, P zzso zzso However, indirect costs of zzso were 10 times higher zzso versus zzso million zzso per patient, P zzso zzso The cost per life year gained was higher for zzso than zzso zzso and zzso million zzso zzso 

zzso is similarly effective as zzso However, in the broader context of the zzso from the perspective of patients and their families, zzso is more zzso The lower costs directly charged by the hospital for zzso may prevent poorer and older patients from choosing zzso Thus, the overall zzso of each treatment option should be taken into consideration in deciding on the zzso
