The purpose of this paper is to describe a technique for zzso the parameters of a zzso model that zzso ordered categories and zzso zzso The technique builds on the conditional zzso zzso described by zzso zzso zzso and represents an extension of a conditional zzso described by zzso and Engelhard zzso 2002) in which parameters appear as the zzso of a zzso derived from paired zzso The zzso is used successfully to recover parameters from a simulated data zzso No one has previously described such an extension of the zzso zzso to a zzso model that includes both ordered categories and zzso zzso The paired comparisons technique has importance for several reasons: it relies on the zzso of parameters that is true only for the zzso measurement zzso it works in the presence of missing zzso it makes transparent the connectivity needed for zzso zzso and it is very zzso The technique also shares the mathematical framework of a very popular technique in the social sciences called the Analytic zzso zzso zzso zzso
