The authors evaluated the accuracy of three automated zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso effects on sedentary time zzso zzso and indirect effects on zzso physical activity zzso zzso zzso time were zzso 

A zzso from the zzso Australian zzso zzso and zzso Study zzso completed activity logs and wore zzso for a total of zzso zzso A published zzso that allows movement within zzso periods zzso 1) was compared with one that allows less movement zzso 2) or no movement zzso zzso zzso for population estimates were examined using zzso US National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso 

Mean difference per day between the criterion and estimated wear time was negligible for all three zzso zzso zzso but zzso limits of agreement zzso were wide zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso 2 and 3) zzso sedentary time as zzso on zzso zzso and zzso of days and zzso zzso time as sedentary on zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Use of Algorithm 2 zzso with Algorithm 1) affected population estimates of sedentary time zzso by 20 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso between zzso 1 and 2 was good for zzso time zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not for wear time or sedentary zzso 

zzso wear time can be estimated accurately on zzso however, zzso can be substantial for zzso Algorithm choice affects estimates of sedentary zzso zzso very limited movement within zzso periods can improve zzso
