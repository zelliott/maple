Many complex networks are described by directed zzso in such networks, a link represents, for example, the control of one zzso over the other zzso or zzso information zzso Some zzso measures are used to determine the relative importance of zzso specifically in directed zzso We analyze such a zzso measure called the zzso The influence represents the importance of zzso in various dynamics such as zzso evolutionary zzso random walk, and social zzso We zzso calculate the influence in various networks, including directed zzso networks and a directed version of the zzso zzso zzso The global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts rather than local properties of the zzso such as the degree, are shown to be the chief zzso of the influence of zzso in many zzso The developed method is also zzso to the calculation of the zzso We also zzso show that in a coupled zzso system, the threshold for zzso by a zzso is low when the zzso is placed on influential zzso For a type of random network, the zzso derived threshold is approximately equal to the inverse of the zzso We zzso show that this relationship also holds true in a random zzso network and a neural zzso
