zzso zzso and stable evolution are desirable criteria to satisfy in level set zzso In this study, a novel zzso level set method utilizing both global and local image information zzso is zzso The global image information is extracted from mean shift zzso without any prior zzso zzso initial contours are obtained by regulating the zzso zzso The local image information, as extracted by a data fitting energy, is employed to maintain a stable evolution of the zero level set zzso The advantages of the proposed method are as zzso First, the controlling parameters of the evolution can be easily estimated by the zzso zzso Second, the zzso of the model increases because of a reduction in zzso cost and manual zzso Experimental results confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for medical image zzso
