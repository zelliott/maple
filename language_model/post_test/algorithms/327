We develop a high speed spectral domain optical zzso zzso zzso system based on a zzso zzso and zzso discrete zzso transform zzso to realize minimized depth dependent sensitivity zzso After precise spectral zzso of the zzso zzso of the acquired spectral data is adopted for image zzso The zzso is able to measure a wavelength range of about 138 zzso with a spectral resolution of zzso zzso at central wavelength of zzso zzso corresponding to an zzso imaging range of zzso zzso in zzso zzso simulations and sensitivity zzso zzso under two alignment states of the zzso are zzso Both theoretical simulations and experiments are done to study the depth dependent sensitivity of the developed system based on zzso in contrast to those based on conventional discrete zzso transform zzso with and without zzso In zzso imaging on human finger from volunteer is conducted at zzso rate of 29 zzso and reconstruction is done based on different zzso The comparing results confirm that reconstruction method based on zzso indeed improves sensitivity especially at large depth while maintaining the zzso depth zzso
