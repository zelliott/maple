Heat shock protein 70 zzso binds zzso and has several functions that include protein zzso protein trafficking, and involvement with immune zzso However, zzso zzso peptides had not previously been zzso zzso we zzso and identified several hundred zzso bound peptides from zzso using liquid zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso Our work shows that the peptides are capable of binding zzso as previously zzso They are generally zzso zzso acids in length and zzso to specific regions of many zzso Through zzso assisted analysis of peptides zzso from zzso we determined variable zzso acid zzso including a 5 zzso acid core sequence that zzso favorably zzso We also developed a computer zzso that predicts zzso binding within zzso This work helps to define what peptides are bound by zzso in zzso and suggests that zzso zzso zzso selection by aiding a funneling mechanism that is flexible but allows only a limited number of peptides to be zzso
