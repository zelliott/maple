Patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso and normal zzso are classified in an zzso group, albeit this subset is zzso for clinical zzso A recent complementary DNA zzso study identified a zzso signature zzso used to cluster normal zzso zzso them into 2 zzso relevant zzso We sought the first independent validation of the zzso value of this zzso Using zzso zzso to measure gene expression in samples from zzso treated adults with zzso normal zzso we performed cluster analysis based on the previously identified zzso We also developed a zzso zzso rule using the signature to predict outcome for individual zzso zzso analysis confirmed the zzso utility of the zzso patient clusters differed in overall zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso identified groups with differences in overall zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A strong association of the outcome zzso with the zzso adverse zzso internal tandem zzso zzso zzso potentially explained the zzso significance of the zzso However, in the zzso of patients without zzso zzso there was a moderate difference in survival for the zzso zzso Our analysis confirms the zzso of the zzso profiling strategy for outcome prediction in zzso normal zzso
