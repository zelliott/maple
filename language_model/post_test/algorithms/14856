To evaluate in zzso digital chest zzso of an ex zzso system if increased latitude and enhanced image detail contrast zzso improve the accuracy of detecting artificial air space zzso in parts of the lung that are superimposed by the zzso 

19 zzso lungs were inflated inside a chest zzso prepared with zzso zzso zzso liquid to generate zzso air space zzso and examined with direct zzso zzso zzso zzso k zzso 125 zzso 4 zzso 276 zzso images with and without EVP of zzso were presented to 6 zzso 8 regions were read for zzso the reference was defined by zzso Statistics included zzso zzso zzso and calculation of zzso zzso under zzso zzso 

Behind the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the median sensitivity increased from zzso without EVP to zzso at EVP zzso zzso in zzso zzso The specificity decreased from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso value and zzso correlation increased from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Above the zzso the median sensitivity for artificial zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso with EVP zzso in zzso zzso The specificity and zzso value decreased from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, zzso in zzso 

In this ex zzso experiment, EVP improved the diagnostic accuracy for artificial air space zzso in the superimposed parts of the lung zzso under the zzso zzso Above the zzso the accuracy was not affected due to a zzso in zzso
