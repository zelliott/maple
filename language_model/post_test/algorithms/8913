Many studies have evaluated the biological effects of zzso rich plasma reporting the final outcomes on cell and zzso However, few studies have dealt with the zzso of growth factor delivery by plasma rich in growth zzso zzso blood was obtained from three healthy volunteers and processed with zzso technology to prepare zzso plasma rich in growth zzso The zzso zzso scaffolds were then incubated in zzso in a cell culture medium to monitor the release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso during 8 days of zzso A zzso rich plasma was prepared employing the same technology and the zzso of growth factors and zzso were determined after zzso of zzso After each period, the medium was collected, zzso zzso was destroyed and the zzso were stored at zzso until zzso The growth factor delivery is diffusion controlled with a rapid initial release by zzso of the zzso content after zzso of incubation and a steady state release when almost zzso of the growth factor content has been zzso zzso zzso zzso retained almost zzso of the amount of the growth factors after 8 days of zzso The addition of zzso to the formula of zzso rich plasma did not increase the concentration of the growth factors, while it drastically increased the presence of zzso zzso Further studies employing an in zzso inflammatory model would be interesting to study the difference in growth factors and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso rich zzso
