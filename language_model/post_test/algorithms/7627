A new technique called constrained source space imaging is introduced that holds promise for zzso acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso A sparse set of arbitrarily zzso coarse zzso is first localized using zzso selective zzso from which zzso signals are separated using only the spatial sensitivities of zzso receiver zzso without the need for zzso zzso using imaging zzso This method permits very fast acquisitions of targeted zzso without complex or time-consuming image reconstruction zzso Furthermore, because the data acquisition is performed without imaging zzso zzso zzso can be densely sampled and processed for contrast enhancement to improve functional magnetic resonance imaging data zzso Here, the constrained source space imaging technique is validated in zzso form, for a simple functional magnetic resonance imaging motor task using a zzso zzso zzso echo acquisition mode zzso to image four zzso at zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso demonstrate good zzso signal separation and good characterization of zzso responses in primary motor zzso zzso and supplementary motor areas through zzso fitting of the measured zzso With further zzso the constrained source space imaging method has potential utility in a zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments with zzso values under 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso of other sources of MR signal contrast are also zzso
