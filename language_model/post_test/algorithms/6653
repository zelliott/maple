Genome comparisons are behind the powerful new zzso methods being developed to find all human zzso as well as genes from other zzso zzso are now frequently being studied in pairs to provide zzso zzso This zzso zzso approach often reveals zzso genes and may support the deletion of zzso zzso Joining mouse and human as the zzso zzso for the first two zzso are: two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso two sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Even zzso like zzso and zzso zzso which have been known for more than five years, are now being significantly zzso zzso developed for zzso or zzso will now be applied to mouse and human, and soon to additional zzso such as rat and dog, to identify all the zzso zzso zzso Current large disparities between human zzso predictions zzso zzso and zzso methods zzso zzso still need to be zzso This will be the challenge during the next few zzso
