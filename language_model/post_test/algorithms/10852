Experimental processes to collect and process zzso data are increasingly complex, while the zzso methods to assess the quality and significance of these data remain zzso These challenges have led to many biological zzso and zzso zzso We developed a complete empirical zzso model to analyze zzso complex zzso zzso data derived from zzso mass zzso zzso of zzso protein complex pull-down zzso Our model considers not only zzso associations, but also zzso associations missed in previous zzso Using our model and a zzso zzso zzso data set, we estimated that there should be an average of 28 true associations per zzso almost ten times as high as was previously zzso For data sets generated to mimic a real zzso our model achieved on average zzso sensitivity in detecting true associations, as compared with the zzso sensitivity in previous work, while maintaining a comparable false discovery rate of zzso
