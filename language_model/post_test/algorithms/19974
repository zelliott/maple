zzso zzso photography has been used to motivate sun safety in behavioral zzso The relationship between sun damage shown in zzso photographs and melanoma risk has not been systematically zzso 

To examine the relationship between severity of sun damage in zzso photographs and zzso melanoma risk factors in zzso 

zzso standard visible and zzso photographs were recorded for zzso zzso Computer software zzso sun zzso zzso zzso counts, skin color by zzso facial zzso hair and eye color were collected in skin zzso zzso data were collected in telephone interviews of zzso 

Among 12-year-old children, sun damage shown in zzso photographs correlated with zzso melanoma risk zzso Sun damage was greatest for children who were zzso white and those who had red hair, blue eyes, increased facial zzso light skin and greater number of zzso (all P values zzso zzso zzso were similar for standard visible and zzso zzso zzso was the strongest predictor of sun damage in visible and zzso zzso All other zzso melanoma risk factors were also zzso for the zzso zzso 

zzso in software zzso used to score the photographs could produce different zzso 

zzso photographs portray more sun damage in children with higher risk for melanoma based on zzso Therefore sun protection interventions targeting those with greater sun damage on zzso photographs will target those at higher melanoma zzso This study establishes reference ranges dermatologists can use to assess sun damage in their pediatric zzso
