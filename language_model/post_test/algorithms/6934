Many practical biological problems involve an intractable zzso search through a large space of zzso This paper describes preliminary results from a zzso zzso of zzso search that combines anytime and optimal search zzso The zzso applies to problems whose solutions may be described by an zzso zzso It produces an approximate solution quickly, then zzso improves the result over time until a global optimum is zzso A global optimum may be produced before producing its proof of global zzso Local zzso are never zzso We describe preliminary applications to zzso zzso protein backbone zzso small zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding motif zzso The results are encouraging, although still quite zzso
