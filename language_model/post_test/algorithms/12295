A zzso machine is a classic model of neural computation, and a number of methods have been proposed for its zzso Most methods are plagued by either very slow convergence or zzso bias in the resulting zzso Here we consider zzso in the basic case of fully visible zzso zzso We show that the old principle of zzso zzso provides an zzso that is zzso very simple yet statistically zzso
