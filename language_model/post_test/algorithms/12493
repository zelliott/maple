The principle of zzso motion freezing of zzso objects extends directly to interference zzso that use zzso as part of the measurement zzso Analysis shows, however, that the fringe contrast loss for zzso motion in zzso zzso is a zzso phenomenon, which can alter the apparent nominal center wavelength of the zzso zzso As in zzso systems, the key adjustable zzso is the duty cycle, equal to the product of the zzso frequency and the pulse zzso This theoretical study provides detailed zzso of expected errors as a function of the duty cycle, including fringe contrast loss, apparent wavelength shift, and measurement zzso
