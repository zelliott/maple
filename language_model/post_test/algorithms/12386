Previous studies on zzso cancer have shown zzso involvement to be an independent indicator of prognosis and zzso This study aimed at developing an objective method for detection of zzso zzso from molecular profiles of primary zzso zzso zzso 

The study included primary zzso tumor zzso from 60 patients across different stages and 5 control zzso of normal zzso The entire cohort was divided into training and validation sets comprised of zzso positive and zzso negative zzso zzso expression profiling was performed for a panel of 70 genes using standardized competitive zzso and the expression values of the training set samples were run through an zzso machine learning process called genetic programming that employed an zzso cross validation technique to generate zzso rules of limited zzso These were then used in a voting zzso to zzso the validation set samples into those associated with or without zzso zzso 

The generated zzso rules using 70 genes demonstrated zzso accuracy on the validation set when compared to the pathological zzso zzso The rules showed a strong zzso for zzso zzso and zzso resulting in gene expression motifs that zzso suggested a pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso positive zzso Additionally, the motifs showed zzso to be lower relative to zzso and zzso to be relatively high by itself in zzso positive zzso Rules generated using only zzso zzso and zzso were comparably zzso with a single representative rule producing an accuracy of zzso when used by itself on the validation set, suggesting a crucial role for these genes in zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates the use of standardized quantitative gene expression values from primary zzso tumor zzso as zzso in a genetic programming system to generate zzso rules for determining the zzso zzso Our method also suggests the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in unique mathematical combinations in the progression towards zzso zzso Further studies are needed to identify more zzso signatures and confirm the role of these genes in the evolution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
