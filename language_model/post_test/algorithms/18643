Conventional relaxation parameters zzso zzso and zzso obtained at different temperatures and magnetic fields, are reported for the zzso zzso carbon in zzso in a zzso zzso These data are interpreted with the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso relaxation rates related to the zzso zzso zzso interactions for the same carbon are zzso The complete data set consisting the conventional and zzso relaxation parameters is interpreted using a new zzso approach, in which the zzso model for the zzso spectral zzso is combined with the zzso jump model for the zzso spectral zzso with the global correlation time as a common zzso The zzso jump rates thus obtained are in reasonable agreement with the zzso relaxation zzso and have reasonable temperature zzso
