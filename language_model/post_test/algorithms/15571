The zzso method is applied to calculate fields and electron optical phase shifts in specimens having long-range electromagnetic fields, like reverse biased zzso junctions or stripe magnetic zzso It is shown that this approach not only allows to take into account rather easily the effect of the zzso fields protruding in the space around the zzso but also to obtain solutions to interesting models in zzso zzso
