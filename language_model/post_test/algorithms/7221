zzso of the risk of adverse long-term outcomes such as second zzso zzso and zzso often requires zzso zzso of zzso The method for zzso should be easily zzso and valid across different study zzso The widely used zzso Agent zzso zzso score is derived from the drug dose distribution of the study population and thus cannot be used for comparisons across populations as each will have a unique distribution of drug zzso 

We compared the performance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a unit for zzso zzso agent exposure independent of study population, to the zzso Comparisons included associations from three Childhood Cancer zzso Study zzso outcome zzso receiver operator characteristic zzso zzso and goodness of fit based on the zzso Information zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso performed essentially zzso in analyses of risk for pregnancy among the partners of male zzso participants, risk for adverse dental outcomes among all zzso participants and risk for premature menopause among female zzso participants, based on similar associations, lack of statistically significant differences between the areas under the zzso zzso and similar model fit values for the zzso between models including the two measures of zzso 

The zzso is easily zzso zzso its use for patient zzso It is independent of the drug dose distribution of a particular patient population, a characteristic that will allow direct comparisons of outcomes among zzso zzso We recommend the use of the zzso in future research assessing cumulative zzso agent zzso
