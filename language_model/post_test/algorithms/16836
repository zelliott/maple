A valuable alternative to traditional diagnostic tools, such as zzso zzso to monitor general zzso well-being by means of zzso heart rate analysis is zzso zzso a passive and low cost recording of zzso heart zzso In this paper, it is presented a simulator software of zzso zzso signals relative to different zzso states and recording conditions (for example different kinds and levels of zzso Before developing the software, a data collection pilot study was conducted with the purpose of specifically identifying the characteristics of the zzso of the zzso and maternal heart sounds, since the available literature is not rigorous in this zzso The developed software, due to the possibility to simulate different zzso and pathological zzso conditions and recording situations simply zzso some system zzso can be useful as a teaching tool for demonstration to medical students and others and also for testing and assessment of zzso heart rate extraction zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso On this purpose, the simulator software was used to test an zzso developed by the authors for zzso heart rate extraction considering different zzso heart rate parameters and signal to noise ratio zzso Our tests demonstrated that simulated zzso signals are very close to real zzso zzso
