Using zzso density functional theory, we have studied an zzso proposed model for zzso zzso zzso intermediate X, which contains a single zzso bridge, one terminal zzso or zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso and a zzso bridge provided by zzso For the models proposed here, the terminal zzso zzso binds to site zzso which is closer to zzso The zzso centers are assigned as zzso zzso and zzso coupled to give the zzso zzso zzso ground zzso zzso show that the model with a terminal hydroxide in the zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the lowest energy state, and the calculated zzso shift and zzso splitting values for this cluster are also the best among the four clusters studied here when compared with the experimental zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for this state do not show good agreement with the zzso The calculated zzso distances for this and the other three clusters at zzso A are much longer than the zzso A which was predicted by the zzso zzso The zzso bridge provided by zzso tends to be closer to one of the zzso sites in all clusters studied here, and it does not function as a bridge in helping to produce a short zzso zzso Overall, the models tested here are not likely to represent the core structure of zzso intermediate zzso The model with the terminal zzso binding to the zzso center shows the best calculated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the experimental zzso This supports the earlier proposal based on analysis of zzso zzso zzso et zzso that the terminal oxygen group binds to the zzso site in zzso
