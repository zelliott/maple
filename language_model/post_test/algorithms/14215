Traditionally, zzso quantitative zzso relationships zzso for alcohol zzso zzso zzso have been developed by assigning the measured zzso for commercial products to the average structures zzso chain length and zzso chain zzso of these zzso Acute zzso magna toxicity tests for zzso zzso indicate that zzso are more toxic than the individual zzso substances corresponding with their average structures zzso to the zzso relation of toxicity with zzso zzso the zzso value zzso as effects zzso attributed to the average structures that are used to develop the existing zzso is expected to be too zzso A new zzso technique for complex zzso which zzso the mixture toxicity with regard to the zzso distribution zzso the individual zzso zzso rather than the average structure, was zzso This new technique was then applied to develop new zzso zzso zzso for zzso fish, and zzso Despite the higher complexity, the fit and accuracy of the new zzso are at least as good as those for the existing zzso based on the same data zzso As expected from typical zzso zzso of commercial zzso the new zzso generally predicts less toxicity than the zzso based on average zzso
