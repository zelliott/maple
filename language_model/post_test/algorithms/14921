In the past, the development of zzso zzso zzso systems seems to have been determined primarily by the zzso zzso and other properties of the technical zzso This paper, however, focuses on the zzso aspect in an attempt to answer the question to what extent zzso cardiovascular control is restored by the zzso zzso This is a question which should be asked before attempting to design a zzso system and especially before designing zzso systems with infinite zzso Four categories are zzso direct bridging zzso open loop systems, closed systems using zzso or zzso zzso and those using cardiac zzso Further subdivisions are zzso From the zzso as well as from the zzso viewpoint a system should preferably not combine sensors from one and the same of these zzso At present direct bridging is available only for the zzso zzso so that for zzso zzso patients feedback control via cardiac signals zzso zzso comes nearest the goal without, however, zzso bridging the zzso zzso systems should no longer be developed as zzso zzso A well developed activity zzso however, which quickly zzso the most prominent zzso of cardiovascular control is best suited to complement another sensory system achieving zzso zzso New and promising concepts zzso toward direct bridging are the analysis of zzso action zzso and the zzso concept, both of which seek direct correlation with the zzso information not available in zzso zzso
