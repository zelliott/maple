This paper compares the zzso and zzso approaches in the geometrical zzso of a zzso zzso in terms of accuracy and zzso To come up with an unbiased quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the zzso the concept of reliable estimate has been zzso the statistical distribution of the accuracy is assessed over different zzso experiments performed with the same data but with different noise distribution and different test zzso zzso show that in the simulations where the only error on the two-dimensional points was zzso zero mean, and on real data which were corrected for zzso through zzso or linear zzso the accuracy of the two methods was quite zzso zzso showed more accurate than zzso on simulated data with residual distortion errors and on real data which were not corrected for zzso As far as speed is concerned, a fast zzso zzso is associated with zzso while the simultaneous solution of two pairs of zzso equations is associated to zzso The first zzso is much faster, requiring 113 flops per point versus 259 of zzso the fast zzso with zzso parameters does not achieve the same accuracy on the reconstructed three-dimensional zzso Taken all together the results suggest that zzso can be theoretically considered the best approach to three-dimensional zzso provided that zzso are corrected in zzso The statistical evaluation of the accuracy allows a fair zzso of the performances of the zzso to be zzso unbiased by particular zzso of measurement errors and test zzso
