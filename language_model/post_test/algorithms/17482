Growth of zzso zzso during gamma zzso zzso induced persistent infection in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mac 6) cell lines was studied by a quantitative real-time zzso and zzso When zzso cultures were treated with zzso zzso zzso the replication of zzso zzso DNA was unaffected while differentiation into infectious elementary bodies zzso was strongly zzso and in contrast to the zzso cultures, no second cycle of infection was zzso The estimated doubling time of zzso zzso zzso was zzso h in both zzso treated and zzso zzso zzso At 72 h post zzso most infectious zzso were released from zzso cultures, whereas in zzso treated zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso zzso were in zzso zzso A higher dose zzso zzso of zzso was needed to restrict growth of zzso zzso in zzso Mac 6 zzso In zzso zzso Mac 6 cultures, the growth curve of zzso zzso resembled that observed in zzso cells, except that no second cycle of infection could be zzso In zzso treated zzso Mac 6 cultures, the number of infectious zzso zzso zzso recovered decreased gradually after 3 days post zzso while zzso zzso zzso load remained zzso suggesting persistence of zzso zzso also in these zzso
