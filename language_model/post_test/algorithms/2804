We present a zzso zzso solution to the zzso equation using the decomposition zzso This solution is zzso in nature and provides a simpler alternative to zzso approaches such as differential equation evaluation and zzso techniques that are currently used to zzso zzso concentration in the zzso zzso A detailed characterization of the errors in zzso zzso zzso from decomposition, zzso and zzso methods over a wide range of zzso : zzso values was made by comparing them with highly accurate solutions obtained using the Lambert W zzso Our results indicated that solutions obtained from the decomposition method were usually more accurate than those from the corresponding classical zzso zzso Moreover, these solutions required significantly fewer zzso than the zzso zzso Specifically, when the zzso was zzso of the total time zzso the zzso zzso zzso using the decomposition method were characterized by zzso on the order of zzso or zzso The zzso nature of the decomposition solution and its relatively high accuracy make this approach an attractive candidate for computing zzso concentration in the zzso zzso
