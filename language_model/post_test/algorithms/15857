The zzso model of zzso zzso zzso approaches smoking behavior at the level of the individual and zzso zzso and social factors to describe the evolution of behavior change in the zzso zzso is innovative in several ways: zzso the model describes zzso the interactions among these behavioral zzso zzso the model accounts for both the zzso of these factors among different persons and the zzso of basic rules describing these factors in all zzso and zzso the model can be applied to various types of populations and a wide range of intervention zzso zzso combines the zzso psychological and social zzso into a hazard function for zzso to zzso This hazard function is then organized into a three term expression zzso a baseline hazard characteristic to each individual, a decreasing term for the diminishing aspect of the initial hazard and an effect of external zzso The model gives promising results when applied to the Multiple zzso zzso zzso Trial zzso data using the assumptions of a zzso distribution for the baseline zzso a negative exponential for the decrease in the initial hazard and a constant intensity for the external zzso
