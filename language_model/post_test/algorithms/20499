zzso rotation of cardiac fibers may have a large influence on the zzso stabilization, and termination of several life threatening cardiac zzso However, three-dimensional modeling of zzso in cardiac tissue is zzso zzso as a tissue on the order of zzso in size must be used to sustain zzso and several seconds must be zzso zzso accuracy requires time steps on the order of zzso and spatial zzso on the order of zzso zzso the zzso zzso systems are extremely zzso In this article, a zzso efficient model of a three-dimensional block of cardiac tissue with fiber rotation is zzso zzso zzso is achieved by using a discrete cable model which allowed for system order reduction, and also by using a scheme for tracking the zzso wave front which identified regions requiring integration with a small time zzso zzso zzso s of activity of the approximately 2 zzso zzso cells zzso a block measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 26 zzso zzso of model parameters on performance are zzso The effect of fiber rotation on the spread of electrical activity after point source stimulation and a cross shock protocol is clearly zzso
