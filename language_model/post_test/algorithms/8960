Changes of neural zzso at a variety of zzso rhythms are effectively associated with cognitive zzso The present study investigated whether the directional zzso of neural information flow zzso could be used to symbolize the synaptic plasticity impairment in zzso zzso network in a rat model of zzso Male zzso rats were employed while zzso was administered at a dose of 300 zzso for 4 zzso zzso was measured by the Morris water zzso Local field zzso zzso were recorded before long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso partial directed zzso zzso and zzso zzso conditional mutual information zzso were used to measure the zzso zzso in both zzso and low gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso induced the zzso deficits consistent with the reduced zzso in zzso zzso Phase zzso values zzso showed that the synchronization between zzso and zzso in both zzso and LG rhythms was reduced by zzso In both zzso and LG zzso zzso zzso were significantly decreased in zzso treated rats while a similar variation trend was observed in zzso reduction, zzso that the effects of zzso on cognitive impairment were possibly zzso via profound zzso of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso The results suggested that zzso activities at these rhythms were most likely involved in determining the zzso of information flow in the zzso zzso network, which might be associated with the zzso of synaptic transmission to some zzso
