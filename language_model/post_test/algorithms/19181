This paper presents an zzso framework for improving zzso zzso decision zzso zzso The underlying hypothesis of the study is that each example in the knowledge database of a medical decision support system has different importance in the decision making zzso A new decision zzso incorporating an importance weight for each example is proposed to account for these zzso The search for the best set of importance weights is defined as an zzso problem and a genetic zzso is employed to solve zzso The zzso process is tailored to maximize the system's performance according to clinically relevant evaluation zzso The study was performed using a zzso system developed for the zzso of regions of interests zzso in zzso as depicting masses or normal zzso The system was constructed and evaluated using a zzso of zzso extracted from the Digital Database for zzso zzso zzso Experimental results show that, according to receiver operator characteristic zzso analysis, the proposed method significantly improves the overall performance of the zzso system as well as its average specificity for high breast mass detection zzso
