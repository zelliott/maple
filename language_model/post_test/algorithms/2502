To introduce and validate an zzso muscle and fat zzso zzso based on joint analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and water and fat zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso 

We first segmented the subcutaneous fat by use of a zzso zzso model, then applied zzso zzso in the feature domain defined by the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso images to identify the zzso fat and zzso In the final step we zzso zzso and area measures of fat and zzso We applied this zzso on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR images acquired from 28 zzso 

We validated our tissue composition analysis against fat and muscle area zzso obtained from zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the same participants and found very good agreement between the two zzso Furthermore, we compared the proposed approach with a zzso that uses zzso images only and observed that joint analysis of zzso and zzso images is more accurate than the zzso only zzso 

Our zzso zzso produces accurate tissue zzso is less zzso and more zzso than the original zzso zzso and can address zzso zzso zzso and intensity zzso zzso
