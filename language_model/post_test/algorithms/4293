The aim of this study was to develop a feedback system to assist gait rehabilitation of cerebral zzso zzso toe zzso with dynamic zzso 

zzso pressure of the zzso and the heel was collected by zzso zzso embedded in zzso shoes and transmitted to a zzso via zzso Dynamic foot pressure index of each stride was calculated by zzso software running in the zzso to distinguish zzso strides from normal strides in real zzso An auditory signal would be produced to alert the patient each time a zzso stride was zzso 

For zzso toe zzso the one-way analysis of zzso indicated a significant difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in dynamic foot pressure index between the affected side zzso zzso zzso and the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso In addition, the validation test showed that this system can distinguish zzso strides from normal strides of children with zzso with an accuracy of zzso 

This system was able to monitor the zzso strides of children with zzso in real time and had the potential to enhance rehabilitation training efficiency and correct zzso gait in children with zzso with dynamic zzso
