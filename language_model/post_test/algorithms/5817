In order to harness the zzso capacity of zzso cultured zzso networks, it is necessary to understand zzso dynamics and connectivity on a zzso zzso To this end, this paper zzso dynamic zzso patterns emerging from zzso zzso zzso cultures using hidden zzso models zzso to characterize zzso spike trains as a progression of patterns of underlying states of zzso zzso However, zzso aimed at optimal choice of parameters for such models is essential and results are reported in zzso zzso derived from ensemble zzso data revealed highly zzso patterns of state transitions in the order of milliseconds in response to probing zzso
