An image restoration approach based on a zzso maximum zzso method zzso has been applied to a zzso image zzso problem, that of reduction of geometric blurring in zzso zzso The aim of the work is to demonstrate an improvement in image spatial resolution in realistic noisy zzso images with no associated penalty in terms of reduction in the zzso ratio perceived by the zzso Images of the zzso zzso image quality phantom were recorded using the standard zzso settings of zzso zzso focus and also at zzso zzso focus and zzso zzso zzso the latter two arrangements would normally give rise to unacceptable geometric zzso Measured zzso functions were used in conjunction with the zzso image processing to zzso these zzso The results are presented as comparative images of phantom test features and as observer scores for the raw and processed zzso zzso of high resolution features and the total image scores for the test phantom were improved by the application of the zzso zzso It is argued that this successful demonstration of image zzso in noisy zzso images offers the possibility of weakening the link between focal spot size and geometric blurring in zzso thus opening up new approaches to system zzso
