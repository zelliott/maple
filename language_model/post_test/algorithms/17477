This paper describes a method for surgery zzso or more specifically a learning system of how to use a brain zzso zzso use of brain zzso can lead to brain tissue zzso such as tearing of brain tissue and zzso The idea is to provide surgeons with a tool which can teach them the correlation between deformation and applied zzso The system includes a zzso zzso based model of the brain in a zzso Reality setup with zzso zzso The physical model links the shape of the zzso model with the associated zzso The interaction between the zzso and the brain model is handled by a collision response method which aims at smoothing the discrete zzso zzso The experimental results are promising even though the used force feedback device is somewhat constraining the zzso
