In this work, a method is presented for the transformation of zzso recordings to a standard sensor zzso For the case of an 148 channel zzso zzso the zzso was evaluated using simulations as well as phantom head zzso It turned out that the method is very robust and yields accurate results regardless of the position of the field zzso even with large differences between original and standard zzso sensor positions and high zzso The method can be applied as a prerequisite for comparing or averaging recordings of different subjects or zzso
