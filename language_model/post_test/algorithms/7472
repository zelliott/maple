zzso zzso is the process of modeling appearance of disease zzso on digitized zzso images via zzso features zzso texture, zzso Due to the curse of zzso building zzso with large numbers of features requires feature selection (which may require a large training zzso or zzso reduction zzso DR methods map the original zzso features in terms of zzso and zzso which limits the potential for feature transparency or zzso Although methods exist for variable selection and ranking on zzso obtained via linear DR schemes zzso principal components analysis zzso similar methods do not yet exist for zzso DR zzso zzso In this work we present a simple yet elegant method for zzso the mapping between the data in the original feature space and the transformed data in the kernel zzso zzso embedding space; this mapping provides the basis for zzso of variable importance in zzso kernels zzso We show how zzso can be implemented in conjunction with the popular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is evaluated in the contexts of three different problems in digital zzso zzso predicting five year zzso failure following radical zzso zzso predicting zzso zzso recurrence risk scores for zzso breast zzso and zzso distinguishing good and poor outcome zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso of features identified by zzso provide similar or better zzso or zzso performance compared to the original high zzso feature zzso
