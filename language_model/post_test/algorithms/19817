zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the breast that exhibits several distinct zzso but the link between zzso and patient outcome is not zzso We zzso that different mechanisms of growth may still result in similar zzso zzso which may look different in zzso To zzso the connection between growth and zzso zzso we reconstruct the zzso architecture of zzso zzso from zzso patient zzso We produce a fully automated zzso that zzso zzso and reconstructs zzso zzso from zzso images of zzso serial sections from human zzso The alignment zzso is based on zzso cross zzso the zzso zzso uses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques to segment the duct and zzso The reconstruction method combines these images in zzso We show that two distinct zzso zzso are indeed found in samples whose zzso zzso sections are similarly identified as zzso zzso These differences in architecture support the hypothesis that zzso spaces may form due to different mechanisms, either isolated cell death or merging zzso leading to the different zzso We find that out of 15 samples, 6 were found to have zzso zzso 6 were found to have zzso zzso and 3 were zzso We propose that the zzso zzso found, zzso and zzso account for some of the zzso of the disease and may be zzso indicators of different patient zzso
