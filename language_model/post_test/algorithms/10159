zzso zzso the circulating zzso of zzso in blood, is a zzso protein and most of these natural zzso have been identified using zzso focusing zzso gel zzso Here, we show that a rare zzso gene zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso A3 on the protein zzso One healthy individual with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso studied so far exhibited low normal zzso zzso and slightly decreased zzso activity, suggesting that this zzso is associated with zzso zzso In addition, we present the findings of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 26 patients with severe zzso showing one of the following four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the plasma of most compound zzso patients, only one of the two zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso probably due to zzso plasma concentration of the 2nd zzso zzso In almost all cases, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso predicted by computer modeling were in good agreement with the observed zzso band zzso zzso zzso by zzso in combination with molecular genetic analysis of the zzso gene is a useful approach to characterize zzso zzso and zzso zzso
