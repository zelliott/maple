In this study, we present a zzso zzso quantum zzso analysis of the lowest zzso zzso of zzso We have made use of the zzso zzso zzso method in conjunction with both an zzso and a zzso representation of the zzso Energy zzso and the newly developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Meyer, zzso zzso zzso 138 zzso zzso an zzso which performs the transformation of a zzso (up to zzso Potential Energy zzso into product zzso Many sets of zzso zzso zzso expansions, differing in the system coordinate definition zzso and zzso as well as in the number of terms in the expansion, have been zzso zzso for the zzso of the ground states energies have been carried out on these zzso obtaining an excellent overall agreement with accurate previous zzso zzso Carlo zzso calculations, irrespective of the coordinate zzso The 24 lowest excited zzso states of zzso have been zzso by Block zzso and assigned for the first zzso This has been carried out in two different pictures, zzso a zzso reduced zzso one, in which the OH distances have been frozen at the Potential Energy Surface zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The agreement between both descriptions is zzso The following fundamental modes have been zzso OH zzso zzso zzso OH zzso OH zzso and the elusive bridging H zzso In particular, we provide a very accurate description of the latter in perfect agreement with zzso
