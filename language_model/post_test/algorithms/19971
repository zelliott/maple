zzso of the inverse problem is a complex issue when using zzso acoustic zzso zzso techniques to identify the vibrating zzso This paper shows that, for convex homogeneous plates with arbitrary boundary conditions, alternative zzso schemes can be developed based on the zzso of the normal zzso of the plate in a zzso basis, zzso the possibility to approximate it as a weighted sum of few elementary basis zzso In particular, these techniques can handle zzso of the zzso field at the zzso which can be problematic with standard zzso This comes at the cost of a higher zzso complexity to solve the associated zzso problem, though it remains easily zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso framework allows us to take advantage of the concept of zzso zzso under some conditions on the sampling process zzso the design of a random zzso which can be zzso and zzso zzso it is possible to reconstruct the sparse signals with significantly less zzso zzso zzso than classically zzso After introducing the different concepts, this paper presents zzso and experimental results of zzso with two plate zzso and compares the advantages and limitations of these zzso techniques over standard zzso zzso
