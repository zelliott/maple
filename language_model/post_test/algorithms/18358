In this study we have investigated the potential of optical techniques to monitor changes in bone mineral density zzso via changes in scattering zzso For each of five bone samples, diffuse reflection and transmission zzso were measured over the wavelength range zzso zzso using an zzso sphere and zzso zzso These were converted into optical zzso and scattering zzso using a zzso Carlo inversion zzso zzso were made on samples immersed in zzso acid solution for different lengths of time in order to investigate the effect of reduction in zzso on the optical zzso After full zzso the optical scattering zzso fell by a factor zzso From the observed degree of fluctuation of the zzso we estimate that zzso could be measured with an accuracy of zzso if optical scattering can be measured with an accuracy of zzso We also report preliminary zzso of bone scattering using optical zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso is obtained on dry samples with and without zzso zzso These results suggest that minimally invasive techniques for measuring optical zzso such as zzso may have a role in monitoring regional changes in zzso This could be an important advance in our understanding of bone zzso and its relationship to zzso Both the zzso sphere and zzso zzso also suggest that light transport in bone is zzso zzso zzso was used to assess probability of obtaining results in zzso
