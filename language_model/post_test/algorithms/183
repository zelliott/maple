In zzso zzso strain imaging, large zzso zzso strains cause peak hopping artifacts separating the highest correlation zzso peak from the true zzso A correlation zzso filter was previously designed to minimize peak hopping zzso For large zzso however, the correlation zzso filter must follow the strain distribution to remove peak hopping zzso This processing usually means zzso and high zzso zzso To reduce the zzso burden, a narrow band approximation using phase rotation is developed in this paper to facilitate correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso are first phase rotated to increase zzso then zzso zzso phase angles are determined by the local strain and spatial zzso This form of correlation zzso filtering enhances true correlation zzso zzso in large strain applications if zzso due to deformation does not completely destroy the zzso among neighboring correlation zzso The assumed strain used in the filter can also zzso from the true strain and still be zzso Further improvement in displacement zzso can be expected by combining correlation zzso filtering with a new zzso displacement zzso
