zzso concentration may be a useful feature for distinguishing benign from zzso lung zzso in zzso zzso The calcium concentration can be estimated from the measured CT number of the zzso and a CT number vs calcium concentration zzso line that is derived from CT scans of two or more calcium reference zzso To account for CT number zzso in the reconstruction field, such zzso lines may be obtained at multiple locations within lung regions in an zzso zzso The authors performed a study to investigate the effects of patient body size, zzso region, and zzso zzso size on the derived zzso lines at ten lung region positions using both single energy zzso and dual energy zzso CT zzso zzso zzso lung zzso of two zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso were zzso zzso of three different diameters zzso zzso and 16 zzso were scanned in a simulated zzso section representing the middle of the chest with large lung zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also scanned in a section representing the upper chest with smaller lung zzso Fat rings were added to the zzso of the zzso to simulate larger zzso zzso were acquired on a zzso scanner at 80, zzso and 140 zzso and were repeated three times for each zzso The average absolute CT number zzso between the zzso lines were zzso In addition, zzso or zzso were determined when the zzso lines for one condition zzso small zzso were used to estimate the zzso zzso of zzso for a different condition zzso large zzso The authors demonstrated that, in general, DE is a more accurate method for zzso the calcium contents of lung zzso The DE zzso lines within the lung field were less affected by patient body size, zzso zzso size, and zzso position than the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso of zzso were also in general smaller in quantity with DE than with zzso However, because the slopes of the zzso lines for DE were about one-half the slopes for SE, the relative improvement in the concentration estimates for DE as compared to zzso was about one-half the relative improvement in the separation between the zzso zzso zzso in the middle of the chest zzso section with large lungs were nearly completely consistent with the above zzso On the other hand, results in the zzso zzso section with smaller lungs and greater amounts of muscle and bone were zzso A repeat of the entire study in the upper zzso section yielded similar mixed zzso Most of the inconsistencies occurred for the zzso zzso zzso and may be attributed to errors caused by beam zzso volume zzso and insufficient zzso zzso higher resolution reconstructions of the smaller zzso application of high atomic number filters to the high energy zzso beam for improved spectral zzso and other future developments in zzso may alleviate these problems and further substantiate the superior accuracy of zzso in zzso the calcium zzso of lung zzso
