zzso of differentiated zzso cancer may show different zzso patterns for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 58 zzso patients, and spiral zzso zzso zzso of the lung in 25 zzso zzso patients presented with zzso zzso 15 patients with zzso zzso and five patients with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso stage zzso was zzso in 3, zzso in 19, zzso in 11 and zzso in 25 zzso For the detection of zzso zzso PET was found to have a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso a sensitivity of zzso and the two methods combined a sensitivity of zzso When zzso PET was limited to patients with elevated zzso zzso levels and negative zzso zzso the sensitivity of this zzso was zzso Of the 21 patients with zzso zzso zzso seven presented with zzso zzso but no zzso zzso In four of them, a second zzso hot spot appeared in a zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso Five of the seven patients underwent zzso None of the eight patients with pulmonary zzso smaller than 1 zzso exhibited zzso zzso while five of them had zzso zzso All had positive results on spiral zzso In conclusion, zzso PET cannot be zzso for zzso zzso If the zzso level is elevated and zzso zzso is negative, zzso PET can be used to detect zzso zzso zzso and zzso anatomical zzso A spiral CT of the lung is useful to exclude pulmonary zzso before planning a dissection of zzso zzso zzso zzso
