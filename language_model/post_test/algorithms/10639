A theoretical description of one- and zzso zzso echo peak shifts zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso echo spectrum zzso of a coupled zzso system are zzso The effects of population relaxation in the zzso states on both the zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso For values of time T shorter than the population relaxation time, a finite zzso peak shift magnitude and zzso cross zzso in the zzso zzso provide evidence of electronic zzso between the zzso These two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso peaks, both originate from the electronic zzso However, it is shown that the zzso and zzso zzso methods can provide complementary information on the zzso zzso optical responses of coupled zzso zzso
