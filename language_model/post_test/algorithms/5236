An electric drill coupled with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fiber or a zzso thin film was used for rapid sampling of zzso aromatic zzso zzso in zzso zzso Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the sampling rates of zzso fiber and thin film can be predicted zzso Compared with the zzso zzso the zzso thin film active zzso exhibited a higher sampling rate and much better sensitivity due to its higher zzso ratio and its larger extraction phase zzso The amount of the zzso extracted by the thin film was around 100 times higher than those obtained by zzso for both 5 zzso rapid sampling and equilibrium zzso A new thin film active zzso was then developed for rapid on-site water zzso The sampling kit included a portable electric drill, a copper mesh pocket, a piece of thin film, and a zzso Laboratory experiments indicated that the sampling remained in the linear zzso phase with this zzso to 8 zzso for the zzso Field test illustrated that this novel zzso was excellent for rapid on-site water sampling due to its short sampling period, high sampling efficiency and durability The thin film sampling kit zzso on-site zzso sample preparation, storage and zzso This new zzso is more zzso and easier to zzso than previous zzso
