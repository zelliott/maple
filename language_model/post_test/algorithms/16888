The zzso zzso of interacting zzso complexes is zzso and the role is analyzed of certain zzso called zzso shadows, which form suitable building blocks for more general zzso We prove that, for two interacting zzso called interaction structures, there exist for fixed zzso only zzso many zzso zzso This implies that, for fixed zzso there are only zzso many classes of interaction zzso In particular, the simplest case of zzso zero already provides the zzso for certain types of structures that occur in nature and are not covered by other zzso This case of zzso zero interaction structures is already of practical interest, is studied here in detail, and is found to be expressed by a multiple zzso grammar that extends the usual one for zzso secondary zzso We show that, in zzso time and zzso space complexity, this grammar for zzso zero interaction structures provides not only minimum free energy solutions but also the complete partition function and base pairing zzso
