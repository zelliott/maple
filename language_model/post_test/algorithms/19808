The synthesis of complete genes is becoming a more and more popular approach in zzso gene zzso zzso for this are the decreasing prices and the numerous advantages in comparison to classic molecular cloning zzso Two of these advantages are the possibility to adapt the zzso usage to the host zzso and the option to introduce restriction zzso target sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso regarding zzso zzso is a free zzso software program which is able to detect possible restriction sites in both coding and zzso DNA sequences by introducing multiple silent or zzso zzso zzso The zzso of an alternative sequence containing a desired restriction motive from the sequence with the optimal zzso usage is considered during the search of potential restriction sites in coding DNA and zzso sequences as well as protein zzso zzso is available at zzso
