To evaluate zzso zzso zzso after radical zzso in a non selected group of patients and their response to zzso 

We included our patients who were operated on between 1998 and zzso The patients filled in a modification of zzso zzso before the zzso zzso We tried zzso with doses of 100 zzso in 3 different zzso zzso 12 and zzso months after the zzso zzso In the event of a complete response they filled in the zzso zzso 

The mean age of the patients was zzso years old and the mean observation period was zzso zzso Only 111 zzso of the total number of patients operated on wanted treatment and only 90 took zzso in the proposed zzso 27 zzso 18 zzso and 45 zzso patients had a complete response, a partial response or no response to the zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso points less than the zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, the preservation of zzso the presence of a previous partial response and the presence of the previous zzso were significantly related to the complete zzso however, only zzso kept its value in the zzso zzso 

zzso must involve themselves in the early rehabilitation of the zzso function even in those patients where preservation of the zzso was not zzso One must always try to zzso zzso or zzso whenever the patient desires preservation of zzso The response to zzso is better after the first year and in patients who have previous zzso
