The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantitative properties of zzso expectation zzso zzso on kinetic modeling with nitrogen 13 zzso compared with filtered zzso zzso in healthy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies from 20 normal volunteers at rest and during zzso stimulation were zzso Image data were reconstructed with either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso input functions and tissue zzso were compared together with the zzso blood flow and zzso zzso The late area under the zzso input functions during zzso is overestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso the area under the late part of the zzso tissue zzso is underestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso during both rest and zzso These differences in tissue and input functions cause the resting zzso blood flow to be underestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso flow is underestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso causing the zzso flow reserve to be underestimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Large zzso differences in zzso and zzso flow values were observed with a flow zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the lateral zzso zzso 

zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso images with zzso zzso and PET produces high-quality images for visual zzso However, compared with zzso zzso is associated with substantial zzso of zzso on quantitative zzso Our findings indicate that zzso should be used with precaution in clinical PET zzso
