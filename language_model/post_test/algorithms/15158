Identification of potential drug safety problems using statistical screening zzso in routinely collected databases of adverse drug reactions zzso requires decision rules based on thresholds of the chosen zzso Choosing higher or lower thresholds changes both the sensitivity of the screening and the number of false alarms produced, and thus has an impact on the effectiveness of the detection zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on the effectiveness of signal detection activities of choosing different warning thresholds for the zzso reporting ratio zzso and for the count of reports of any zzso zzso 

Signal detection methods were tested within the zzso database of suspected zzso Using an established set of known zzso the number that could be detected and the changes in time gained for earlier investigation of the signal were calculated over a range of signal detection zzso These figures were set against the number of false positive signals produced by the statistical signal detection zzso 

Higher thresholds for the lower confidence bound of the zzso produced fewer false zzso but this benefit was offset by important losses of sensitivity in the detection of zzso By contrast, increases in the threshold for the count of a specific zzso combination produced fewer false zzso with little loss of either sensitivity or time gained for investigation of adverse zzso A threshold of five compared with the current European zzso Agency threshold of three gave a reduction of 25 % in false positive signals in return for a loss of 12 % in true signals detected zzso 

Changes in the standard threshold for the count of zzso combinations can result in a substantial improvement in efficiency of the signal detection zzso zzso this change might be applied only to products with a well-established safety zzso
