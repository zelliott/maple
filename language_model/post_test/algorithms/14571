Principal component analysis zzso and normal mode analysis zzso have emerged as two invaluable tools for studying zzso changes in zzso To compare these approaches for studying protein zzso we have used a zzso of the zzso zzso whose dynamics is well zzso We first show that both zzso on zzso from molecular dynamics zzso simulations and zzso reveal a general zzso behavior in agreement with what has previously been described for zzso We thus compare the zzso of zzso on independent MD runs and subsequently investigate the influence of the length of the MD zzso We show that there is a relatively poor zzso correspondence between zzso obtained from two independent runs and conclude that caution should be taken when analyzing principal components zzso We also observe that increasing the simulation length does not improve the agreement with the experimental structural zzso In fact, relatively short MD simulations are sufficient for this zzso We observe a rapid convergence of the zzso (after zzso 6 zzso Although there is not always a clear zzso correspondence, there is a zzso good agreement between the movements described by the first five modes obtained with the three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is particularly interesting to relate this to the zzso cost of the three zzso The results we obtain on the zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of robust and zzso strategies for the study of protein zzso using either zzso or zzso of zzso from MD zzso
