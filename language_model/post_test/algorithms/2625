We introduce a class of zzso shell structures, the zzso which zzso a structural transformation induced by zzso under pressure zzso The geometry of the zzso comprises a zzso shell patterned with a regular array of circular zzso In order for the pattern transformation to be induced by zzso the possible number and arrangement of these voids are found to be restricted to five specific zzso Below a critical internal pressure, the narrow ligaments between the voids zzso leading to a cooperative zzso cascade of the skeleton of the zzso This ligament zzso leads to closure of the voids and a reduction of the total volume of the shell by up to zzso while remaining zzso thereby opening the possibility of zzso We use a combination of precision zzso experiments, finite element simulations, and zzso analyses to explore the underlying mechanics of these zzso structures, finding excellent qualitative and quantitative zzso Given that this folding mechanism is induced by a mechanical instability, our zzso opens the possibility for zzso zzso over a wide range of length zzso
