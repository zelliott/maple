zzso outcomes zzso have gained importance in clinical and zzso research and aim at assessing quality of life, anxiety or fatigue for zzso zzso Response zzso zzso models are increasingly used to validate and zzso zzso Such models relate observed variables to a zzso variable zzso zzso which is commonly assumed to be normally zzso A zzso sample size determination is important to obtain adequately powered studies to determine clinically important changes in zzso In previous developments, the zzso method has been proposed for the determination of the power of the test of group effect for the comparison of PRO in zzso studies with an zzso model, the zzso zzso The objective of this work was to evaluate the zzso of this method (which assumes a normal distribution for the zzso zzso to violations of zzso zzso The statistical power of the test of group effect was estimated by the empirical rejection rate in data sets simulated using a zzso distributed zzso zzso It was compared to the power obtained with the zzso zzso In both cases, the data were analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso model including a zzso zzso for group zzso For all situations, both methods gave comparable results whatever the zzso from the model zzso Given the results, the zzso method seems to be robust to the zzso of the zzso trait for determining the power of the test of group zzso
