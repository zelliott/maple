The current rise in popularity of zzso research has led to the development of new sensor concepts and recording zzso zzso the zzso using bed mounted pressure sensors opens up new possibilities for home monitoring zzso The signals measured with these sensors contain a mixture of cardiac and respiratory zzso which can be used for detection of zzso of heart failure like zzso or zzso However, the separation of the cardiac and respiratory components has proven to be difficult, since there is significant overlap in the zzso of both zzso In this paper, an zzso for the separation task is zzso which can overcome the problem of overlapping zzso Additionally, a model has been developed for the generation of artificial zzso which are used to analyze the separation zzso Furthermore, the zzso is tested on preliminary data from a clinical zzso
