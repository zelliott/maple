This paper addresses recognition of human actions under view zzso We explore zzso of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across zzso Building upon this key zzso we develop an action zzso that captures the structure of zzso similarities and zzso within an action zzso Despite this zzso zzso zzso not being strictly zzso we provide zzso and experimental validation demonstrating its high stability under view zzso zzso zzso are also shown to be stable under performance variations within a class of actions when individual speed fluctuations are zzso If required, such fluctuations between two different instances of the same action class can be explicitly recovered with dynamic time zzso as will be demonstrated, to achieve zzso action zzso More central to the current work, zzso ordering of local zzso zzso can simply be ignored within a zzso type of zzso zzso action discrimination is still retained in this way to build a zzso action recognition zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary zzso Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor zzso correspondence zzso Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient zzso action zzso The method is validated on three public data zzso It has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions, such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views only for zzso
