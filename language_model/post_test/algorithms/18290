zzso controlled release zzso zzso of zzso a poorly soluble drug, have been formulated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso of zzso variables and process parameters such as zzso ratio, zzso grade of zzso drug particle size, and zzso force on the zzso characters and drug release has been zzso Our results indicated that the release rate of the drug and the mechanism of release from the zzso zzso are mainly controlled by the zzso ratio and zzso grade of the zzso In general, decrease in the drug particle size decreased the drug zzso Lower zzso zzso zzso was found to be more sensitive to the effect of zzso force than the higher zzso The zzso were found to be stable and zzso
