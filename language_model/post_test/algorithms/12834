The problem of determining zzso from zzso has gained considerable prominence in the research community since the beginning of the zzso zzso Here the focus is on determining the sets of zzso values of individual zzso zzso since such information better captures the genetic causes of zzso One of the main zzso tools for zzso is based on the assumption that the evolutionary history for the original zzso zzso perfect zzso This tool can be applied only on individual blocks of zzso in which it is assumed that zzso do not zzso However, exact determination of blocks is usually not zzso It would be desirable to develop a method for zzso which can account for zzso and thus can be applied on zzso sections of zzso A natural candidate for such a method is zzso via zzso networks (which model zzso or their simplified zzso zzso zzso However, even zzso via zzso networks appears hard, as the efficient zzso exist only for very special zzso the zzso network has either a single zzso or only small zzso with two zzso zzso Building on our previous results, we show that, in general, zzso via zzso networks is zzso and it remains zzso when zzso are allowed to have at most k zzso for any zzso
