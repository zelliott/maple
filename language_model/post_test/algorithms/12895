A forward ray tracing zzso model is presented to determine the exact image projection in a general zzso topography zzso zzso the skew ray error in zzso topography is zzso A quantitative analysis comparing zzso zzso and zzso zzso in reconstructing the front surface of the cornea shows that arc step zzso are more sensitive to noise zzso Furthermore, they are less accurate in determining zzso aberrations particularly the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso are more accurate and more precise showing that point to point zzso topography is superior compared to its zzso zzso
