A general approach is developed to search for stable structures of short chain fragments zzso of zzso or bound zzso in a given molecular zzso This molecular field is produced by the remaining part of a zzso or by any other surface with a defined spatial zzso The zzso must be short enough to have no pronounced long-range interactions within zzso The method is illustrated by calculation of the 3-D structures of two zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso zzso are based on a lattice model of zzso space and on strict and fast zzso of zzso statistical mechanics and dynamic programming (which are very similar in zzso This makes a search of zzso structures only several times (and not several orders of zzso longer than that of a zzso
