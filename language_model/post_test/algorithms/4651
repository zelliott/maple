A particular problem in image registration arises for zzso images taken from different imaging devices and/or zzso Starting in 1995, mutual information has shown to be a very successful distance measure for zzso image zzso zzso mutual information is considered to be the state-of-the-art approach to zzso image zzso However, mutual information has also a number of well-known zzso Its main disadvantage is that it is known to be highly zzso and has typically many local zzso 

This observation motivates us to seek a different image similarity measure which is better suited for zzso but as well capable to handle zzso zzso 

In this work, we investigate an alternative distance measure which is based on zzso zzso 

As we show, the alternative approach is zzso much zzso easier to zzso fast and straightforward to zzso faster to zzso and also much more suitable to zzso zzso
