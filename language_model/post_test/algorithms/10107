zzso the body zzso where zzso proteins can be zzso into is important for protein function zzso and disease zzso zzso In this study, we developed a network-based method to predict which kind of body zzso human proteins can be zzso zzso For a newly constructed benchmark zzso that consists of 529 zzso zzso the prediction accuracy for the most possible body fluid location predicted by our method via the zzso test was zzso significantly higher than the success rate by a random guess zzso The likelihood that the predicted body zzso of the first four orders contain all the true body zzso where the proteins can be zzso into is zzso Our method was further demonstrated with two independent zzso one contains 57 proteins that can be zzso into zzso while the other contains 61 proteins that can be zzso into zzso and were possible zzso associated with various zzso For the 57 proteins in first zzso 55 were correctly predicted as zzso zzso For the 61 proteins in the second zzso 58 were predicted to be most possible in zzso These encouraging results indicate that the network-based prediction method is quite zzso It is anticipated that the method will benefit the relevant areas for both basic research and drug zzso
