The primary obstacle to de zzso protein structure prediction is zzso zzso the native state generally has lower free energy than zzso structures but is zzso difficult to zzso zzso predictions with atomic level accuracy have been made for small proteins using the zzso structure prediction method, but for larger and more complex zzso the native state is virtually never zzso and it has been unclear how much of an increase in computing power would be required to successfully predict the structures of such zzso In this paper, we develop an approach to determining how much computer power is required to accurately predict the structure of a zzso based on a zzso of the zzso search problem as a zzso sampling problem in a discrete feature zzso We find that zzso sampling for many proteins is limited by critical zzso features, often the backbone zzso angles of individual zzso which are sampled very rarely in unbiased zzso and, when zzso dramatically increase the sampling of the native zzso These critical features frequently occur in less regular and likely strained regions of proteins that contribute to protein zzso In a number of zzso the linchpin features are in regions found zzso to form late in zzso suggesting a correspondence between folding in zzso and in zzso
