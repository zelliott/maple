We used diffusion zzso imaging zzso to evaluate zzso changes in skeletal muscle cells under external zzso 

In 6 healthy volunteers, we compared zzso of the zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso muscles under zzso We performed imaging using a zzso magnetic resonance zzso scanner and zzso zzso zzso pulse sequences zzso for skeletal zzso We calculated diffusion zzso zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso and fractional zzso zzso values in a series of zzso acquired zzso and compared them between the zzso and zzso lower zzso We also measured a zzso area of skeletal zzso 

We observed clear differences in zzso and zzso between zzso muscles and the zzso muscles we used as zzso The mean control zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean control zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso limbs increased to zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with those values in the zzso zzso zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso limbs decreased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with those in zzso Moreover, the mean value of zzso area of skeletal muscle zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso area in the zzso zzso zzso limbs decreased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with those in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and post hoc zzso tests showed significant zzso 

zzso changed markedly on zzso the lower limb based on the correlation of the zzso area and zzso suggested marked changed in zzso following application of pressure to the lower zzso If zzso of the zzso area is assumed to represent zzso of the cell, change in zzso reflected the change in the size of muscle zzso
