We develop a methodology for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso We begin by modeling the brain images temporally with a standard general linear zzso After that, we transform the resulting estimated standardized zzso zzso maps through a discrete zzso transformation to obtain a sparse representation in the zzso zzso zzso we assign to the zzso zzso a prior that is a mixture of a point mass at zero and a zzso white zzso In this mixture prior for the zzso zzso the mixture probabilities are related to the pattern of brain activity across different zzso To incorporate this information, we assume that the mixture probabilities for zzso zzso at the same location and level are common across zzso Furthermore, we assign for the mixture probabilities a prior that depends on a few zzso We develop an empirical zzso methodology to estimate the zzso and, as these zzso are shared by all subjects, we obtain precise estimated zzso Then we carry out zzso in the zzso space and obtain smoothed images of the zzso zzso by applying the inverse zzso transform to the zzso means of the zzso zzso An application to computer simulated synthetic data has shown that, when compared to zzso analysis, our zzso methodology performs better in terms of mean squared zzso Finally, we illustrate the utility and flexibility of our zzso methodology with an application to an zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso (2005) through a zzso zzso study of working memory related brain zzso
