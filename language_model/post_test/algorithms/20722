In this paper, we present a zzso zzso approach to solve the zzso equation encountered in optical zzso With this zzso the unknown image, the data, as well as the weight zzso are all represented by zzso expansions, thus yielding a zzso representation of the original zzso equation in the zzso zzso This transformed equation is then solved using a zzso zzso by which an increasing portion of zzso zzso of the unknown image are solved in successive zzso One can also quickly identify regions of interest zzso from a coarse level reconstruction and restrict the reconstruction in the following fine resolutions to those zzso At each resolution level a zzso least squares solution is obtained using the zzso zzso descent zzso This approach has been applied to continuous wave data calculated based on the diffusion approximation of several two-dimensional zzso test zzso Compared to a previously reported one grid algorithm, the zzso method requires substantially shorter zzso time under the same reconstruction quality zzso
