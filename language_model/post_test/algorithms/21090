Studies of zzso dynamics in AIDS research are very important in understanding the zzso of zzso infection and also in assessing the effectiveness of zzso zzso There are many AIDS clinical trials on zzso dynamics currently in development worldwide, giving rise to many design issues yet to be zzso For example, most studies are focused on short-term viral dynamics and the existing models may not be zzso to describe long-term zzso zzso In this paper, we use a zzso approach to study the designs of long-term viral dynamics under zzso zzso zzso zzso These models not only can preserve the meaningful interpretation of the short-term zzso zzso but also characterize the long-term zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso We investigate a number of feasible clinical protocol designs similar to those currently used in AIDS clinical zzso In particular, we evaluate whether earlier zzso can result in more useful information about the viral response zzso we also evaluate the effectiveness of two zzso more frequent zzso per subject with fewer subjects versus fewer zzso per subject with more subjects while keeping the total number of zzso zzso The results of our investigation provide quantitative guidance for designing and selecting zzso zzso
