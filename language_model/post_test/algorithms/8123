In this paper, we present a new zzso zzso model that encompasses zzso competitive and zzso model zzso The simultaneous use of many classes of network behaviors allows for the zzso zzso of zzso patterns (through input zzso and the concurrent zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso All of these operations are achieved within a common learning operation, and using a single set of defining zzso It is shown that the model can learn categories by developing zzso representations strictly from zzso to specific zzso Moreover, because the model is zzso it can reconstruct perfect zzso from incomplete and noisy zzso zzso exploration of the zzso properties and performance shows that its ability for adequate zzso stems zzso zzso properly distributing connection zzso and zzso producing a weight space with a low zzso level (or higher zzso In addition, since the model uses a sparse representation zzso the size of zzso neighborhood can be zzso and no longer requires a decrease through time as was the case with classic zzso feature zzso Since the zzso learning and transmission parameters are independent from learning trials, the model can develop stable fixed points in a constrained zzso architecture, while being flexible enough to learn novel zzso
