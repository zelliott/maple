This paper presents a zzso method for zzso registration of magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso There are two zzso in the proposed registration zzso First, a set of zzso geometric features are selected for each point in the brain, in order to facilitate correspondence detection during the registration zzso This is achieved by zzso an energy function that requires each point to have its zzso geometric features consistent over the corresponding points in the training samples, and at the same time distinctive from those of nearby points in the zzso Second, the active points used to drive the brain registration are zzso selected during the registration zzso based on their zzso and consistency zzso That is, the image points with salient and consistent features zzso different zzso are considered for the initial registration of two images, while other less salient and consistent points join the registration procedure zzso By incorporating these two novel strategies into the framework of the zzso registration algorithm, the registration accuracy has been improved according to the results on simulated brain data, and also visible improvement is observed particularly in the cortical regions of real brain zzso
