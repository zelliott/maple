Using a simple zzso model of a zzso zzso and a surface, simulations were performed to study the zzso zzso zzso probability as a zzso zzso zzso to a zzso patch already zzso on the zzso The zzso zzso probability was studied as a function of temperature, zzso size, and zzso interaction zzso From the simulation data, estimates of the apparent zzso energy for zzso zzso zzso were zzso both for different zzso sizes and for different zzso interaction zzso
