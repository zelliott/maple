In a zzso zzso study, a zzso sample of cases is selected from a zzso geographic region over a fixed period of zzso For diseases of adult zzso the control is generally a sibling or cousin who is matched on sex and age without regard to location of zzso Such a design can lead to biased estimates of environmental relative risk if the prevalence of an environmental risk factor varies by the geographic region from which the cases and controls are zzso However, assuming the independence of zzso and environmental exposure, the zzso for the gene and zzso interaction effects are zzso This suggests that we must use caution in interpreting parameters that estimate environmental main effects from a zzso zzso study if controls are selected from outside the zzso zzso
