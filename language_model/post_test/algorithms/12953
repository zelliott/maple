zzso zzso holographic microscope zzso based on an zzso zzso zzso allows us to use light sources of arbitrary degree of zzso and spatial zzso Besides the conventional zzso modes such as quantitative phase contrast imaging and zzso zzso holographic reconstruction it provides high quality zzso imaging, improved lateral resolution and optical zzso by zzso zzso zzso setup parameters and their limits for a technical realization are derived and described in zzso To demonstrate the optical zzso property of the microscope a model sample uncovered and then covered with a zzso was observed using a zzso light zzso
