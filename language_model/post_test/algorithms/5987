In this paper a neural network model for zzso coordination of hand gesture during zzso is zzso The model includes a simplified control strategy for whole hand shaping during grasping tasks, that provides a realistic coordination among zzso This strategy uses the increasing evidence that supports the view of a synergistic control of whole fingers during zzso In this control zzso only two parameters are needed to define the evolution of hand shape during the task zzso The proposal involves the design and development of a Library of Hand zzso consisting of motor zzso for finger zzso of an zzso zzso zzso Through computer simulations, we show how neural dynamics of the model leads to simulated grasping movements with zzso zzso zzso The model can provide clear-cut predictions for experimental evaluation at both the zzso and neural levels as well as a neural control system for a zzso robotic zzso
