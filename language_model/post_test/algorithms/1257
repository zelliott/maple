zzso represents a substantial advance in a long series of methods for calculating zzso site models given only specific binding zzso Compared to our most recently reported technique, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997, 11, zzso the user no longer has to simplify the structures of the molecules in the training set by zzso the atoms into a few zzso The only remaining source of zzso is the user's choice of compounds for the training set, which can be surprisingly few in zzso Then zzso automatically produces typically several different models that explain the observed binding without zzso The models are remarkably simple but have substantial zzso power for any sort of test compound, with an zzso of the uncertainty of the zzso zzso of the method is reported for four standard test zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso zzso steroids binding to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso and peptides binding to zzso zzso
