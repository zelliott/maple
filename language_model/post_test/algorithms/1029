Based on zzso zzso as templates and zzso as zzso zzso we have zzso a new class of structurally related zzso zzso zzso with systematically increasing zzso zzso These compounds were used to scan the distance between the active sites of two neighboring zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso obtained are a function of the distance between the terminal zzso groups and indicate optimal binding of zzso with zzso bonds between the zzso zzso These experimental data are in full agreement with predictions derived from a novel modeling program that allows the zzso of zzso zzso
