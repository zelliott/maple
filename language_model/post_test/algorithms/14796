The use of zzso imaging is becoming more prevalent for detection of interior hidden defects in manufactured and packaged zzso In applications for detection of hidden moisture, zzso zzso can be used to image the material and then perform an inverse calculation to derive an estimate of the zzso of the hidden material, such internal moisture, thereby alerting personnel to damaging levels of the hidden moisture before material degradation zzso One impediment to this type of imaging occurs with nearby objects create strong reflections that create destructive and constructive zzso at the receiver, as the material is conveyed past the imaging antenna zzso In an effort to remove the influence of the zzso such as metal bale ties, research was conducted to develop an zzso for removal of the influence of the local proximity zzso from the zzso zzso This research effort produced a technique, based upon the use of zzso signals, for the removal of zzso reflections created by local proximity zzso This improvement enables accurate zzso zzso of moisture in such products as cotton zzso as well as other physical properties such as density or material zzso The proposed zzso was shown to reduce errors by a zzso ratio and is an enabling technology for imaging applications in the presence of metal bale zzso
