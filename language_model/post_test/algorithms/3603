As the complexity of musculoskeletal models continues to increase, so will the zzso demands of zzso zzso For this reason, parallel zzso zzso are becoming more zzso Most zzso zzso the zzso In this study, an alternate approach is investigated that zzso the analysis function zzso a zzso or dynamic zzso called repeatedly by the zzso to calculate the cost function and zzso To evaluate this approach, a system identification problem involving a zzso ankle joint model was solved using a zzso zzso and three parallel decomposition zzso zzso calculation decomposition, analysis function decomposition, or both methods zzso For a given number of processors, analysis function decomposition exhibited the best performance despite the highest communication and synchronization overhead, while zzso calculation decomposition demonstrated the worst performance due to the fact that the necessary line searches were not performed in zzso These findings suggest that the method of zzso most commonly used for zzso zzso may not be the most efficient, depending on the zzso zzso zzso In many applications, the best zzso strategy may be to focus on zzso the analysis zzso
