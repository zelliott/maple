An accurate experimental and theoretical study of the lowest core zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso The complex zzso structure of the lowest band of the zzso zzso spectrum zzso is due to the large variation of the molecular zzso which is zzso in the ground state and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso were recorded at high resolution and assigned by theoretical simulations of the zzso taking into account the zzso of symmetrical stretching and symmetrical zzso zzso zzso of the zzso An excellent agreement between experimental and theoretical spectral profiles allowed us to accurately characterize the zzso structure of the electronic zzso The similarities, as well as the differences, of the peculiar zzso progression observed for the two zzso are explained by the strong zzso along the umbrella coordinate and by the zzso variation, leading to a different probing of the zzso potential energy surface of the core excited state during the nuclear zzso
