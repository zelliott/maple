In this study, zzso were prepared by modification of zzso with various zzso zzso and were used to remove zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso capacities of zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso which were much higher compared to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were fitted well with the zzso model with rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The maximum zzso capacity of zzso derived from the zzso equation reached as high as zzso zzso while the maximum zzso capacity of zzso was zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was strongly dependent on solution zzso zzso of zzso did not impact on zzso zzso while they clearly suppressed zzso of zzso In addition, this study also showed that zzso rates were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso respectively, after zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in order to interpret the proposed zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were extensively characterized using scanning electron zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso
