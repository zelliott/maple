In zzso the purpose is to identify and zzso all the zzso in a biological zzso Combined gas zzso and mass zzso zzso is one of the most commonly used techniques in zzso together with zzso zzso and it has been shown that more than 300 compounds can be distinguished with zzso after zzso of overlapping zzso To avoid having to zzso all analyzed samples prior to zzso analysis of the data, we have developed a strategy for rapid comparison of zzso zzso data zzso The method includes baseline zzso zzso time window zzso alternating regression, zzso and identification of retention time windows in the zzso that explain the differences between the zzso Use of alternating zzso also gives zzso zzso which retain the information provided by zzso values that vary between the samples in each retention time zzso The method has been applied to plant extracts derived from leaves of different zzso stages and plants subjected to small changes in day zzso The data show that the new method can detect differences between the samples and that it gives results comparable to those obtained when zzso is applied prior to the zzso zzso We suggest that this method can be used for rapid comparison of large sets of zzso data, thereby applying time-consuming zzso only to parts of the zzso that contribute to explain the differences between the zzso
