In the clinical setting, brief general mental status tests tend to detect zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso less well than more specific cognitive zzso Some preliminary information was collected on the diagnostic accuracy of the Traveling zzso Problem zzso compared with the zzso State zzso zzso in recognizing early zzso from normal zzso 

Fifteen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso and zzso controls were submitted in a single blind protocol to a paper-and-pencil zzso version of the zzso containing a random array of 30 points zzso The task consisted of drawing the shortest continuous path, passing through each point once and only once, and returning to the starting zzso zzso lengths for subjects' solutions were zzso and compared with the optimal solution given by a specific evolutionary zzso called zzso 

zzso zzso significantly better between zzso subjects and controls zzso curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso corrected for age and education zzso curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A path length of zzso taken as zzso zzso classified correctly subjects with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso whereas a score corrected for age and education of zzso on the zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

The zzso seems to be particularly sensitive to early zzso and independent of patient's age and educational zzso The high diagnostic ability, zzso and independence of age and education make the zzso promising as a screening test for early zzso
