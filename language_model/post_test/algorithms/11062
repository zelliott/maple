zzso devices with zzso components can be manipulated remotely using forces induced by the zzso zzso To deflect the tip of an zzso zzso large zzso spheres of 2 zzso diameter are required to exert sufficiently high magnetic forces; however, tracking of these devices is difficult due to the large image zzso In this study, a new zzso technique is proposed to improve the stability of zzso and tracking medical devices with zzso zzso MR tracking methods with selective zzso zzso and phase compensation with a zzso zzso can detect zzso spheres up to a diameter of 1 zzso zzso In this work, a zzso technique is used with two zzso zzso to stabilize the off-set zzso With zzso being applied in zzso directions, an zzso of 5 was achieved in the signal zzso Compared to a zzso acquisition the zzso method reduces the position error in a phantom from 8 zzso to zzso zzso In an in zzso study a tracking precision of 4 zzso was measured without steering zzso at an image update rate of 2 images per zzso zzso experiments were successfully performed with a zzso zzso with zzso sphere in an zzso phantom and in the zzso zzso of a zzso
