To assess safety, zzso zzso stability, and change in aberrations after zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 97 eyes in a zzso zzso zzso eyes had a mean zzso manifest zzso equivalent zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a range of zzso to zzso D of zzso and 0 to zzso D of zzso 

After a zzso cut, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The full treatment to achieve zzso of an early zzso provided by the system manufacturer was used in all zzso 

Safety, zzso zzso and stability were evaluated at 1, 3, and 12 months zzso zzso changes of higher order aberrations zzso at 1 year were determined for zzso sizes of zzso and 6 zzso 

At 1 year zzso zzso visual acuity zzso was zzso or better in zzso of the eyes, and zzso or better in zzso The mean zzso manifest zzso at 1 year was zzso zzso it was within zzso D in zzso and within zzso D in zzso No eye lost zzso or zzso lines of best zzso VA zzso at 1 year zzso 40 eyes gained 1 line of zzso and 5 eyes gained 2 zzso The total zzso root mean square zzso increased on average by a factor of zzso with a zzso zzso for the 6 zzso pupil, the increase factor was zzso No change or reduction in the total zzso zzso was observed in zzso of the eyes for a zzso zzso and in zzso for a zzso zzso There was a significant increase of primary zzso aberration zzso zzso by a factor of zzso for zzso pupils and zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso zzso is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of zzso and zzso zzso Although in close to half of the eyes zzso could be reduced, there was still zzso and induction of zzso with the zzso zzso
