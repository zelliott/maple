Although accelerated diagnostic protocols are being increasingly used in emergency departments to diagnose acute cardiac zzso there have been no prospective evaluations of a chest pain diagnostic protocol with serial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mandatory exercise zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso study in which chest pain protocol results were compared with final zzso diagnoses of acute cardiac zzso (including acute zzso zzso and unstable zzso Patients in need of hospital admission but at low probability (by a validated zzso for acute zzso zzso were examined for zzso known coronary artery disease, cardiac zzso severe zzso or inability to perform exercise zzso A 12-hour diagnostic protocol included serial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical assessments followed by zzso for those with negative initial serial zzso zzso diagnoses were established during hospitalization and diagnostic accuracy was zzso 

The study group of 317 patients was zzso male and zzso black, and had a mean age of zzso years; zzso had a final diagnosis of acute cardiac zzso For this diagnosis, the protocol had a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso and negative zzso value, zzso zzso zzso zzso serial zzso and zzso each made a contribution to improved sensitivity and zzso whereas clinical zzso were less zzso as indicated by zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso 

A chest pain diagnostic protocol achieved high sensitivity and improved specificity over the standard emergency department zzso There were no adverse zzso associated with early zzso
