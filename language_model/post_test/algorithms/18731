zzso zzso is a molecular zzso zzso technique that is capable of zzso probing the zzso changes associated with diseased zzso The purpose of this study was to explore zzso zzso zzso zzso for identifying zzso from normal gastric zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso system was zzso for tissue zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso laser zzso A total of 76 gastric tissue samples obtained from 44 patients who underwent zzso investigation or zzso operation were used in this zzso The zzso examinations showed that 55 tissue specimens were normal and 21 were zzso Both the empirical approach and zzso statistical techniques, including principal components analysis zzso and linear zzso analysis zzso together with the zzso zzso method, were employed to develop effective diagnostic zzso for zzso of zzso zzso between normal and zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso can be acquired from gastric tissue within 5 zzso There are specific spectral differences in zzso zzso between normal and zzso zzso particularly in the spectral ranges of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which contained signals related to zzso III and zzso I of zzso zzso twisting of zzso zzso and the zzso stretching mode of zzso zzso The empirical diagnostic zzso based on the ratio of the zzso peak intensity at 875 zzso to the peak intensity at 1450 zzso gave the diagnostic sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso whereas the diagnostic zzso based on zzso yielded the diagnostic sensitivity of zzso and specificity zzso for separating zzso from normal gastric zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso further confirmed that the most effective diagnostic zzso can be derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso statistical technique has potential for rapid diagnosis of zzso in the stomach based on the optical evaluation of spectral features of zzso
