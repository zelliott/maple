To develop and zzso determine the accuracy of a magnetic resonance zzso imaging strategy to differentiate zzso brain masses, with zzso findings or clinical diagnosis as the reference zzso 

The study was zzso zzso and was approved by the institutional review zzso A waiver of informed consent was zzso A strategy was developed on the basis of conventional MR imaging, zzso MR imaging, zzso MR imaging, and zzso MR zzso to zzso zzso masses as zzso primary zzso high-grade primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The strategy was evaluated by using data from 111 patients zzso women, 65 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with imaging results available on a zzso picture zzso and communication system from a zzso search zzso zzso statistics of the strategy elements and three clinical tasks were zzso 

Search results identified 44 patients with high-grade and 14 with zzso primary zzso 24 with zzso 12 with lymphoma, 11 with zzso five with zzso and one with encephalitis who had undergone conventional and advanced MR zzso However, only 40 patients zzso women, 15 zzso mean age, 45 zzso had undergone all studies and had data to allow completion of the entire zzso zzso sensitivity, and specificity of the strategy, respectively, were zzso zzso and zzso for discrimination of zzso from zzso diseases, zzso zzso and zzso for discrimination of high-grade from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for discrimination of high-grade zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

An integrated MR zzso strategy, which is accurate in differentiation of several zzso brain masses, was zzso
