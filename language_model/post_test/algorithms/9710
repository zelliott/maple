Recent studies suggest that the quality of recovery after a stroke can be increased by early and more intensive zzso Portable unobtrusive devices are promising candidates for the realization of zzso systems that complement care in the zzso rehabilitation phase, both in the clinic and at zzso The proposed system allows patients to increase the amount of motor exercise they can perform in zzso providing them with a real-time feedback based on zzso sensors embedded in the zzso tissue across the upper limb and zzso A dynamic time zzso zzso allows for the recognition of correct and incorrect motor zzso After the feedback phase, data are stored in a central location for review and zzso zzso can be installed either at home or at the hospital to support patients, independent of their zzso The performance of the system on healthy subjects was zzso for seven types of motor exercises for upper zzso zzso Finally, we present the preliminary results of a pilot clinical study to test the system's zzso and zzso by zzso patients, and physicians in a clinical zzso
