An approximate expression is derived for the zzso mobility of a zzso charged zzso particle carrying low zzso potential covered with an zzso zzso zzso layer in an zzso zzso This zzso which becomes Henry's mobility formula in the absence of the zzso layer, is a modification of Henry's mobility formula by taking into account the presence of the zzso zzso zzso
