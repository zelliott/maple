Bone is constantly renewed over our lifetime through the process of bone zzso This process is important for bone to allow it to adapt to its mechanical environment and to repair damage from everyday zzso zzso is thought to occur through the zzso response controlling the zzso and zzso zzso This report shows a way to extract quantitative information about the way zzso is controlled using computer zzso Bone zzso and deposition are described as two separate zzso zzso during which a discrete bone packet is removed or deposited from the bone zzso The responses of the zzso and zzso cells to local mechanical stimuli are described by zzso zzso zzso Our strategy was to test different zzso rules and to evaluate the time evolution of the zzso architecture in comparison to what is known from zzso zzso of real zzso In particular, we tested the reaction of virtual bone to standard therapeutic strategies for the prevention of bone zzso zzso physical activity and medications to reduce bone zzso zzso of the bone volume fraction to reductions in bone zzso was observed in the simulations only for a zzso rule including an zzso barrier for the mechanical stimulus above which bone deposition is switched zzso This is in disagreement with the commonly used rules having a so-called lazy zzso
