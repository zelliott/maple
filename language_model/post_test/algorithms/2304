A new zzso zzso analysis system, using a zzso technique, has been developed to determine the migration and rotation of total hip replacement zzso zzso components in three zzso zzso steel marker balls were injected into the zzso during the zzso The patients stood within a zzso frame during the zzso The two zzso were taken zzso allowing zzso shutters to be moved in front of the films to prevent zzso Studies with a model demonstrated that the system was capable of measuring the position of an implant to better than zzso zzso (2 zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that the migration rate of the different parts of the zzso component could be determined with an accuracy of zzso to zzso zzso By considering the accuracy determined in different ways, methods for improving the system have been zzso The migration and rotation rate of 58 zzso cemented zzso components was studied for four zzso zzso was three to five times greater zzso zzso zzso during the first year than zzso The zzso head moved the most during the first year zzso zzso A better understanding of the cause of implant failure could be obtained by studying the early migration of different types of zzso and comparing this with their clinical results and design zzso
