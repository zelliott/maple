In this paper, we propose a new method for collision handling between 3-D zzso zzso and rigid zzso zzso objects valid for zzso interaction scenes and, specifically, for zzso surgery zzso During the simulation step, zzso of the organ detected as collided must be accurately shifted out of the tool to elude a visual zzso The proposed approach zzso the new position of each collided zzso of the organ taking into account both zzso information of the surgical tool and geometric information of the organ surface that surrounds the zzso under zzso Three parameters zzso from a fuzzy feedback system weigh the nature of the tool motion with respect to the zzso Experimental results show that the solution proposed in this paper is able to avoid the zzso among the multiple zzso points efficiently with physically and zzso coherent zzso
