To assess the long-term outcome of infants with mild and moderate fetal zzso and to determine the zzso value of zzso ultrasound imaging in identifying significant zzso 

This prospective study included zzso infants with zzso mild to moderate zzso who were followed for up to 2 zzso zzso zzso ultrasound examinations were performed at day 5 and months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 after zzso zzso zzso was performed in all zzso 

zzso or zzso findings were diagnosed in 130 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed in 83 of zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of two successive zzso zzso ultrasound examinations performed at day 5 and 1 month to predict significant zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 102 of zzso zzso infants with normal zzso zzso ultrasound scans, we later found only three of 102 zzso cases with significant zzso 

We found in a population of infants with mild to moderate fetal zzso a zzso zzso of significant zzso zzso is an excellent screening tool with high sensitivity and negative zzso value that allows avoidance of zzso medical follow-up in patients with two normal zzso ultrasound zzso
