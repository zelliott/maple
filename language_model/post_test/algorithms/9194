In breast zzso there is a compromise between resolution, noise, and acquisition speed for a given zzso zzso The purpose of the present work is to develop a simulation platform to investigate the potential imaging performance for the many possible zzso system zzso The simulation platform was used to investigate the dependence of image blur and signal difference to noise ratio zzso for several different zzso acquisition zzso zzso projections of a zzso thin zzso wire placed in different object planes were modified according to the zzso zzso transfer function zzso with or without zzso zzso In addition, the focal spot blur zzso which depends on the location of the wire, the system zzso the zzso movement speed, and the exposure time, was also incorporated into the zzso Both expectation zzso zzso and filtered back projection zzso based zzso were used for zzso image zzso The zzso zzso was calculated from the reconstructed image of the zzso To evaluate the noise performance, simulated zzso projections of zzso and tumor in uniform breast tissue were modified with the noise power spectrum zzso calculated from a zzso linear system model for the detector for a given zzso zzso The zzso of the reconstructed images was calculated with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso view number, and angular zzso Our results showed that for a zzso distance zzso of 66 zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso 2) caused more degradation to the zzso zzso than the blur caused by the moving focal spot and zzso The in-depth resolution can be improved by increasing the angular zzso
