zzso of zzso abdominal CT images is required by many clinical applications of computer aided diagnosis and therapy zzso The research on automated methods involves different zzso among which the liver is the most zzso In the current clinical practice more images (at different zzso are acquired from the region of interest in case of a zzso abdominal CT zzso The majority of the existing methods, however, use only the zzso image to segment the zzso This paper presents a method that automatically segments the liver by combining more zzso of the zzso CT zzso The method uses zzso facilitated by zzso and zzso functions, which incorporate anatomical and zzso information to eliminate zzso and zzso Another method, which uses only the zzso phase to segment the liver automatically, is also zzso Both methods were evaluated using different zzso which showed that the result of zzso method can be used without or after minor correction in nearly zzso of the cases, and the zzso method can provide result comparable with zzso manual zzso in zzso of the zzso The comparison of the two methods demonstrates that automatic zzso is more reliable when the information of more zzso is zzso
