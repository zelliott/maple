Fabric zzso is now a sophisticated chemical process involving a variety of operations including zzso The chemistry of zzso zzso is described including the use of novel organic compounds to provide effective zzso at the lower temperatures of modern wash zzso The instability of zzso compounds is illustrated using cameo case histories to relate theory and zzso zzso available for determining their zzso are zzso A model is provided for hazard and risk assessment of development projects in general zzso those involving new zzso processes or zzso from ideas phase through exploratory laboratory investigations to pilot plant zzso and eventual manufacture and commercial zzso This paper is a prelude to Part 2, which describes the determination of zzso and kinetic properties of zzso zzso and discusses the implication of the results in terms of precautions for their safe storage and incorporation into zzso zzso during zzso
