zzso zzso zzso is challenging due to limitation of the data acquisition rate caused by the speed of zzso zzso zzso of data from several cardiac cycles is a possible technique to achieve higher zzso The aim of this work is zzso it is, zzso to provide a method for real-time presentation of stitched zzso images acquired over several cardiac cycles and, zzso to demonstrate that the geometrical distortion of the images is decreased when zzso is applied to zzso zzso data of the left zzso zzso We present a volume zzso zzso that zzso data from N consecutive heart cycles into an assembled data zzso The assembly is performed in real time, making immediate volume rendering of the full volume zzso zzso images acquired with this technique are zzso Through simulations with a zzso model of the zzso wall, geometrical distortion and volume zzso errors due to long image capture time was zzso for zzso recordings of the zzso zzso showing the variation throughout the cardiac cycle of the zzso geometrical distortion in the zzso walls are zzso as well as zzso showing the volume estimates compared with the true zzso volume of the zzso We conclude that real-time display of stitched zzso ultrasound data is feasible and that it is an adequate technique for increasing the volume acquisition rate at a given spatial zzso Furthermore, the geometrical distortion decreases substantially for data with higher volume rate and, for a full scan of the zzso zzso over at least four cycles is zzso
