We demonstrate in both simulated and real cases the effect that zzso of a three-dimensional zzso wrapped phase distribution has on the geometry of phase zzso zzso and their branch cut zzso The more intuitive two-dimensional zzso problem of setting branch cuts between zzso pairs is taken as a starting point, and then branch cut surfaces in flat and ambiguous zzso zzso are zzso It is shown that the correct zzso branch cuts and zzso branch cut surfaces should be placed where the zzso of the original phase distribution exceeded zzso zzso zzso This information, however, is lost zzso to zzso and cannot be recovered from the sampled wrapped phase distribution zzso As a consequence, empirical rules such as finding the surface of minimal area or methods based on the wrapped phase zzso will fail to find the correct branch cut zzso We conclude that additional information about the problem under study is therefore needed to produce correct branch cut surfaces that lead to an zzso phase distribution with minimum local zzso An example with real data is provided in which zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging data are successfully zzso when the position of the vessel walls and the physical properties of the flowing blood are taken into zzso
