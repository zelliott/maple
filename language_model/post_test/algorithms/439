Given the knowledge of class probability zzso a zzso zzso and relative risk levels, zzso zzso provides the optimal zzso decision zzso Specifically, focusing on the zzso zzso scenario, under certain symmetry zzso matched filters provide optimal results for the detection zzso zzso that the zzso zzso is in fact a zzso projection of the feature zzso to a zzso zzso in this paper, we develop a smooth zzso projection filter constrained to the estimated span of class conditional zzso as does the zzso zzso The zzso projection filter is designed in a zzso kernel zzso space leading to an zzso solution both for the filter and the optimal zzso The proposed approach is tested on typical detection problems, such as neural spike detection or automatic target detection in synthetic zzso radar zzso zzso zzso are compared with linear and kernel zzso analysis, as well as zzso zzso such as support zzso machine, zzso and zzso
