We present a zzso model that explicitly represents the main features of the underlying zzso incorporating the major hormonal regulatory effects on both zzso and vascular function, and that accurately simulates hormonal regulation of zzso salt and water zzso This is the first model to explicitly couple zzso and zzso zzso and it is much more detailed in structure than existing whole organ models and zzso portions of zzso zzso In contrast to previous zzso models, which have only considered the zzso state, our model is able to regulate water and sodium zzso over a variety of experimental conditions in good agreement with data from experimental studies of the zzso Since the properties of the zzso and zzso are explicitly represented, they can be altered to simulate zzso conditions and pharmacological zzso The model serves as an appropriate starting point for simulations of zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso conditions and for exploring the relationship between the zzso environment and zzso zzso function in zzso and zzso zzso
