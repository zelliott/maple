We present a new method for determining the consensus sequence in DNA zzso zzso The new method, zzso directly incorporates aligned zzso trace information into consensus calculations via our previously described zzso zzso zzso The new method extracts and sums evidence indicated by the representation to determine consensus zzso Using the zzso method results in automatically produced consensus sequences that are more accurate and less ambiguous than those produced with standard zzso zzso Additionally, these improvements are achieved with less coverage than required by the standard zzso zzso and a coverage of only three, error rates are as low as those with a coverage of over ten zzso
