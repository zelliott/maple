zzso the patient dose while maintaining the diagnostic image quality during CT exams is the subject of a growing number of studies, in which simulations of zzso CT with patient data have been used as an effective technique when exploring the potential of various dose reduction zzso zzso in zzso raw zzso data, however, have restricted the use of this technique to a limited number of zzso Here, we present a novel zzso CT simulation technique which provides realistic zzso images without the requirement of raw zzso zzso 

Two key characteristics of CT systems, the noise equivalent zzso zzso and the zzso zzso transfer function zzso were measured for various combinations of object zzso and tube currents by analyzing the noise power spectrum zzso of CT images obtained with a set of zzso Those zzso were used to develop a comprehensive CT noise model covering the reduced zzso zzso zzso object zzso system noise, and zzso zzso which was then employed to generate a simulated noise zzso for the zzso condition with the use of a synthetic zzso generated from a reference CT zzso The simulated noise zzso was filtered with the zzso zzso and zzso to create a noise CT image, which was then added to the reference CT image, finally providing a simulated zzso CT zzso The simulation performance was evaluated in terms of the degree of zzso zzso the noise zzso the zzso filter effect, and the streak noise pattern at zzso zzso sites with the set of phantom zzso 

The simulation results showed good agreement with actual zzso CT images in terms of their visual appearance and in a quantitative evaluation zzso The magnitude and shape of the zzso zzso of the simulated zzso images agreed well with those of real zzso images, showing discrepancies of less than zzso in terms of the noise power at the peak height and zzso in terms of the spatial frequency at the peak zzso The zzso of the noise measured for 12 different combinations the phantom size, tube zzso and reconstruction kernel for the simulated and real zzso images were very similar, with differences of zzso to zzso The p value for a statistical testing of the difference in the noise magnitude ranged from zzso to zzso showing that there was no difference statistically between the noise zzso of the real and simulated zzso images using our zzso The strength and pattern of the streak noise in an zzso phantom was also consistent with zzso 

A novel zzso CT simulation technique was developed which uses only CT images while not requiring raw zzso zzso Our method can provide realistic simulation results under zzso conditions both in terms of the noise magnitude and the zzso zzso This technique has the potential to promote clinical research for patient dose zzso
