zzso zzso are potent zzso or zzso agents that however display some limitations zzso zzso induction of zzso In order to overcome these zzso we recently proposed new zzso in which zzso zzso were zzso coupled to zzso zzso The resulting zzso compounds spontaneously formed zzso zzso and displayed a promising efficacy both in zzso and in zzso Since long-term stability is essential for further clinical development we needed to develop a zzso zzso protocol in order to improve the zzso stability of those zzso zzso zzso zzso has been successfully zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso up to zzso after zzso and zzso have been zzso which is necessary for in zzso zzso zzso zzso by dynamic light scattering showed that zzso had a stabilizing effect on zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso could be stored up to four months at room temperature before zzso without loss of zzso In zzso zzso studies on three zzso cell lines showed that zzso zzso retained their zzso activity after zzso We showed that this zzso protocol could also be applied to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, these results allow for the use of zzso zzso in upcoming zzso trials of the different zzso compounds developed in our zzso
