We report zzso transport calculations in chemically zzso zzso zzso The effect of the joint attachment of zzso and hydrogen groups on the zzso surface is investigated as a function of zzso location and coverage zzso The chemical bonding of a single zzso pair zzso and zzso is shown to considerably alter the zzso capability of ribbon channels, similarly to an zzso type of zzso With transport calculations in zzso ribbons with lengths up to the zzso scale, the elastic mean free paths and zzso regimes are zzso Even in the low zzso density limit, transport properties are found to be severely damaged by the zzso indicating a strong tendency toward an insulating zzso
