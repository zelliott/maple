The zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso calculations were performed for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with a zzso and DNA duplex to zzso their zzso binding and the stability of the DNA duplex, as determined by analysis of their zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed with the zzso force field and at the zzso and zzso levels with several basis zzso The zzso interaction energies zzso were analyzed for interactions of zzso with each base pair, DNA duplex with each zzso acid zzso and each base pair with each zzso In addition, zzso interactions were analyzed including hydrogen bonding and stacking of zzso In the interaction between DNA and zzso there was a significant charge transfer zzso from the DNA to zzso and this CT interaction played an important role as well as the zzso zzso It is necessary to apply a quantum mechanical approach beyond the zzso zzso approach to describe the sequence zzso In the DNA zzso interaction, the zzso interactions dominated the stabilization of the zzso stacking zzso Strong, attractive zzso interactions and weak, repulsive zzso interactions were zzso zzso of the zzso interactions of free and zzso DNA revealed that the zzso interactions were stronger, and the stacking interactions were weaker, in the zzso zzso zzso the DNA duplex stability appears to change due to both the zzso and the CT interactions that take place under conditions of zzso zzso
