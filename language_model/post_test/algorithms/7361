A wide variety of zzso alignment zzso have been published recently to tackle the problem of mapping millions of short reads to a reference zzso focusing on different aspects of the procedure such as time and memory efficiency, sensitivity, and zzso These tools allow for a small number of zzso in the zzso however, their ability to allow for gaps varies zzso with many performing poorly or not allowing them at zzso The zzso strategy is applied in most zzso alignment zzso After aligning a zzso of the reference sequence against the high-quality zzso of a short zzso zzso important problem is to find the best possible alignment between a zzso of the reference sequence succeeding and the remaining zzso of low quality of the zzso The fact that the reads are rather short and that the gap occurrence frequency observed in various studies is rather low suggest that aligning zzso zzso those reads with a single gap is in fact zzso 

In this article, we present zzso a library for extending zzso zzso zzso Apart from the standard CPU version, it includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is based on an zzso computing a modified version of the traditional zzso zzso for sequence zzso zzso experimental results demonstrate that the functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the zzso by a factor of 20 compared to other zzso The analogous zzso and zzso zzso accelerate the zzso by a factor of 6 and 11, respectively, compared to the CPU zzso The library also provides the user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a zzso but zzso number of gaps in the zzso 

We present zzso a library for extending zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is zzso and more efficient than existing zzso for this zzso The importance of our contribution is zzso by the fact that the provided functions may be seamlessly integrated into any zzso alignment zzso The zzso code of zzso is available at zzso
