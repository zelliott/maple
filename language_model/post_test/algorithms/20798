We present the results of an individual zzso model of zzso resistance in zzso Our model examines zzso resistance when two strategies zzso zzso zzso a substance that breaks down zzso zzso zzso who do not zzso or carry the machinery associated with zzso The model allows for populations of up to zzso in which bacteria are affected by their nearest neighbors, and we assume zzso die when there are no producers in their zzso Each of 10,000 slots on our grid (a zzso could be occupied by a producer or a zzso or could zzso be zzso The most surprising and dramatic result we uncovered is that when producers and zzso coexist at zzso zzso are almost always found on the edges of clusters of zzso
