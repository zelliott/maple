zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to create variable coding sequence for certain cell surface receptors is at the origin of immune system zzso This process, known as zzso zzso is implemented via a series of zzso molecular events involving gene choices and random zzso insertions between, and deletions from, zzso We use large sequence zzso of the variable zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso beta chains to zzso the statistical properties of these basic zzso zzso Because any given zzso sequence can be produced in multiple ways, the probability distribution of hidden zzso events cannot be zzso directly from the observed zzso we therefore develop a maximum likelihood zzso method to achieve this zzso To separate the properties of the molecular zzso mechanism from the effects of selection, we focus on zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso We zzso the joint distribution of the various zzso events that occur when a new zzso zzso gene is zzso We find a rich picture of correlation (and absence zzso providing insight into the molecular mechanisms zzso The zzso event statistics are consistent between individuals, suggesting a universal zzso zzso Our zzso model predicts the generation probability of any specific zzso sequence by the primitive zzso process, allowing us to zzso the potential diversity of the zzso repertoire and to understand why some sequences are shared between zzso We argue that the use of formal statistical zzso methods, of the kind presented in this paper, will be essential for quantitative understanding of the generation and evolution of diversity in the zzso immune zzso
