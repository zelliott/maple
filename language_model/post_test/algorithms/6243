zzso zzso zzso techniques are gaining momentum due to the huge database requirements and wide band communication channels needed to maintain high quality zzso zzso Advances in computer software and hardware enable the birth of new techniques in zzso zzso aiming at high zzso zzso In general, most of the introduced zzso zzso techniques depend on their evaluation performance on either inaccurate measures or measures targeting random behavior of zzso In this paper, a new zzso quality measure is zzso A new zzso quality measure is zzso The new approach is based on zzso the segment of interest into frequency bands where a weighted score is given to the band depending on its dynamic range and its diagnostic zzso A performance evaluation of the measure is conducted zzso and zzso Comparative results with existing quality measures show that the new measure is insensitive to error variation, is accurate, and zzso very well with zzso zzso
