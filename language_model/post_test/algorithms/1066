When comparing the performance of a zzso model of an epidemic at two points in a zzso space, a threshold is said to have been crossed when at one point an epidemic develops with positive zzso while at the other there is a tendency for an epidemic to become zzso The approach used to find thresholds in this paper was to zzso a system of ordinary zzso differential equations in a zzso process, accommodating the formation and dissolution of marital partnerships in a zzso population, zzso sexual zzso and diseases such as zzso with zzso A symbolic representation of the zzso zzso of this system was zzso To determine whether this zzso was stable or zzso at a particular zzso point, the zzso was evaluated at a zzso equilibrium and its zzso were zzso The stability or zzso of the zzso was then determined by checking if all real parts of the zzso were zzso By writing software to repeat this process for a selected set of points in the zzso space, it was possible to develop search engines for finding points in the zzso space where thresholds were zzso The results of a set of zzso Carlo simulation experiments were reported which suggest that, by combining the zzso and deterministic zzso within a single zzso it was possible to obtain more zzso interpretations of simulation experiments than if attention were confined solely to either zzso
