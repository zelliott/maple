We carry out a complete zzso characterization of the electric field of an zzso laser pulse after passing through a zzso optical element composed of several zzso zzso concentric zzso zzso expressions for the total zzso field in the time and spectral domain are zzso using the zzso zzso of the zzso These expressions are zzso zzso The zzso zzso and phase structure of the pulse are measured at different planes beyond the zzso optical element using zzso spectral zzso assisted by an optical fiber zzso zzso Our results allow corroborating theoretical predictions on the presence of multiple zzso or complex spectral zzso due to the zzso effects by the zzso ring zzso
