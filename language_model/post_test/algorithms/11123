zzso zzso simulation is used extensively to investigate zzso phenomena in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology to zzso The inverse problem, however, has remained largely zzso How to reconstruct the underlying reactions de zzso from sparse zzso A key challenge is that often only zzso zzso zzso to the population numbers, are zzso zzso We discovered that under specific zzso the set of relative population updates in phase space forms a convex zzso whose zzso are indicative of the dominant underlying zzso We demonstrate the zzso of this simple principle by reconstructing zzso models zzso structure plus zzso from a variety of simulated and experimental systems, where hundreds and even thousands of reactions may be occurring in between zzso In some cases, the zzso models provide zzso zzso This principle can lead to the understanding of a broad range of phenomena, from molecular biology to population zzso
