zzso proteins have been particularly challenging for de zzso structure prediction methods, which tend to pair adjacent zzso into zzso and produce overly local zzso To remedy this problem and facilitate de zzso prediction of zzso protein structures, we have developed a neural network that zzso zzso motifs by local zzso and zzso zzso turns by using the zzso acid sequence as zzso The neural network is trained with a representative subset of the zzso Data Bank and achieves a prediction accuracy of zzso zzso zzso compared to a baseline prediction rate of zzso zzso are predicted with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso turns with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso turn zzso into the zzso de zzso structure prediction method led to higher contact order models and somewhat improved zzso structure predictions for a test set of 11 zzso and 3 zzso The zzso turn zzso from zzso acid sequences is available online for academic use zzso and Kuhn, zzso zzso
