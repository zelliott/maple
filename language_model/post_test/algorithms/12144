zzso analysis of genetic changes within cell zzso that are far from the primary tumor would help determine whether such changes have occurred prior to tumor zzso To determine whether the gene amplification in cells is zzso and/or genetically related to the primary tumor requires quantitative evaluation of a large number of cell zzso from continuous meaningful structures such as zzso tumors, zzso located relatively far from the primary zzso To address this issue, we have designed an integrated image analysis software system for zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso directional zzso zzso were used to zzso the images resulting in a better zzso The accurate shape of the segmented nucleus was recovered using an zzso zzso zzso The study of two cases of zzso zzso in zzso in breast tissue supports the biological observation regarding the existence of a preferential zzso invasion, and therefore a common origin, between the primary tumor and the gene amplification in the zzso lining the zzso structures in the zzso
