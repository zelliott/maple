zzso zzso insulin delivery systems utilizing zzso zzso controllers have demonstrated zzso to late zzso zzso because of delays between insulin delivery and blood zzso zzso zzso An insulin feedback zzso modification to the zzso zzso has been introduced to mitigate this zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso system, four subjects were studied for 24 h on zzso control and 24 h during a separate admission with the zzso modification zzso + zzso Target zzso was 120 zzso meals were served at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso PM and were identical for both zzso No zzso manual zzso were zzso zzso zzso excursions, defined as incremental zzso rise from zzso to peak, and zzso zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso are reported as mean zzso standard zzso 

The zzso + zzso control resulted in higher mean zzso levels compared with zzso alone zzso zzso 54 versus 133 zzso 56 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso excursions zzso zzso 28 versus 114 zzso 47 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 102 versus 255 zzso 129 zzso were similar under both zzso Total insulin delivery averaged 57 zzso 20 U with zzso versus 45 zzso 13 U with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eight zzso events zzso zzso 60 zzso occurred during zzso control versus none during zzso + zzso 

zzso of zzso to the zzso controller markedly reduced the occurrence of zzso without increasing zzso zzso zzso Higher average zzso levels may be attributable to differences in the determination of system gain zzso in this zzso The prevention of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso + zzso zzso may allow for lower target zzso selection and improved overall zzso zzso
