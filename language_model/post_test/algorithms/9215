zzso for zzso zzso and model selection that identify both the structure and the parameters of an ordinary differential equation model from experimental data are zzso The work presented here focuses on the case of an unknown structure and some time course information available for every variable to be zzso and this is exploited to make the zzso as efficient as zzso The zzso are designed to handle problems of realistic size, where reactions can be zzso in the parameters and where data can be sparse and zzso To achieve zzso efficiency, parameters are mostly estimated for one equation at a time, giving a fast and accurate zzso zzso zzso compared with other zzso in the zzso The model selection is done with an efficient zzso search algorithm, where the structure is built zzso Two test systems are used that have previously been used to evaluate identification zzso a zzso zzso and a genetic zzso Both test systems were successfully identified by using a reasonable amount of simulated zzso Besides, measurement noise of realistic levels can be zzso In comparison to other methods that were used for these test systems, the main strengths of the presented zzso are that a fully specified model, and not only a structure, is identified, and that they are considerably faster compared with other identification zzso
