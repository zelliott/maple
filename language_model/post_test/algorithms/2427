The WHO anatomical therapeutic chemical zzso daily dose zzso methodology is a standardized method of comparing zzso zzso The zzso is defined as the average maintenance daily dose of a drug used in a 70 zzso adult, ignoring the considerable differences in body weight of zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to develop a new standardized way of comparing rates of zzso prescribing between European children's zzso 

This pilot study at four European children's hospitals (in the zzso Greece and zzso collected data including zzso zzso use, dosing and indication in children and zzso over a 14 day zzso 

A total of zzso zzso prescriptions were issued with 47 different antibiotics zzso zzso half of all children and a third of all zzso received zzso with wide variation between zzso in the type and dose of zzso zzso We propose a new pragmatic three-step zzso The first step includes a simple comparison of the proportion of hospitalized children on antibiotics by weight bands and the number of zzso that account for zzso of total zzso drug usage zzso The second step is a comparison of the dosing used zzso The third step is to compare overall drug exposure using zzso bed days for standardized weight bands between zzso 

This novel method has the potential to be a useful tool to provide zzso use zzso data and requires validation in a large prospective point prevalence zzso
