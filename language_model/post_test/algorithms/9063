In zzso shape zzso because zzso fringes often contain zzso information zzso with random noise and background intensity information, a new zzso zzso is proposed based on zzso empirical mode decomposition zzso The fringe pattern is first zzso into numbers of intrinsic mode functions by zzso Because the method has partial noise reduction, the background components can be removed to obtain the fundamental components needed to perform zzso transformation to retrieve the phase zzso The zzso can effectively extract the zzso phase of a single direction fringe and an inclined fringe pattern because it is a full zzso analysis method and considers the relationship between adjacent lines of a fringe zzso In addition, as the method does not add noise zzso as does ensemble zzso the data processing time is zzso Computer simulations and experiments prove the feasibility of this zzso
