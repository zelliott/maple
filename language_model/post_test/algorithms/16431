To investigate whether a selective zzso zzso protocol can enrich germ cells and zzso cancer cells from contaminated human zzso cell zzso 

zzso contaminated and control zzso cell suspensions were selectively zzso After each experimental step, the presence of B cells was evaluated by zzso cell sorting zzso and/or zzso chain reaction zzso 

Academic medical zzso 

Five zzso reversal patients willing to donate zzso tissue for research after informed zzso 

In zzso culture, zzso cell sorting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso analysis for zzso and human zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso analysis for a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

With the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class zzso cells could be highly zzso but zzso class zzso zzso cells could still be zzso zzso proved that the cell suspensions contained zzso cells originating from the cell line used to contaminate zzso 

Even though an efficient enrichment of germ cells was zzso the resulting population was not zzso zzso cells were detected in selected cell suspensions of all five patients, demonstrating that the efficacy of this protocol is insufficient for clinical zzso
