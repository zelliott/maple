A recent position statement issued by the UK National zzso Society recommends a zzso approach to the use of peripheral zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso Patients with a zzso zzso greater than zzso or less than zzso are regarded as normal or zzso respectively, while those with a zzso between zzso and zzso are sent for further assessment with spine and hip zzso We have evaluated the zzso zzso zzso by comparing it with the alternative strategies of relying on zzso zzso alone, or performing spine and hip zzso in every zzso The evaluation was carried out using a mathematical model, and the predictions were compared with in zzso data obtained in patients referred for investigation by their general zzso In the model the population distribution of spine, hip, and zzso zzso was described by a zzso zzso zzso Relative risks of fracture were taken from a zzso The three strategies were compared using receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso in which the percentage of future fracture cases identified was plotted against the percentage of the whole population found to have zzso zzso zzso plotted for the discrimination of hip, zzso and zzso fracture risk and the risk of a fracture at any skeletal site were similar for all three strategies, with the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso nearly identical to those for spine and hip zzso For the case of hip zzso zzso zzso or a fracture at any site, zzso zzso was slightly inferior to the zzso algorithm, but the reverse was true for zzso zzso The small difference between the zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso used alone can reproduce clinical decision-making with the zzso zzso zzso provided that a zzso threshold of zzso is used for the diagnosis of zzso instead of the conventional figure of zzso zzso from the in zzso study were in good agreement with the predictions of the model, although some differences were observed that were explained by zzso in the zzso reference zzso We conclude that use of zzso zzso alone with a modified zzso threshold of zzso would save the need for spine and hip zzso scans and identify only slightly fewer fracture cases for zzso
