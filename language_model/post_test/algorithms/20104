zzso and fast zzso of genetic parameters that zzso quantitative traits using mixed linear models with additive and dominance effects is of great importance in both natural and breeding zzso Here, we propose a new fast zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso sampling zzso for the zzso of genetic parameters in the linear mixed model with several random zzso In the learning phase of our algorithm, we use the hybrid Gibbs zzso to learn the zzso structure of the zzso zzso In the second phase of the algorithm, we use this zzso structure to formulate an effective proposal distribution for a zzso algorithm, which uses a likelihood function in which the random effects have been integrated zzso Compared with the hybrid Gibbs zzso the new zzso had better mixing properties and was approximately twice as fast to zzso Our new zzso was able to detect different modes in the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso mode estimates from the zzso zzso method were close to the zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso Moreover, our exponential prior for inverse zzso components was vague and enabled the estimated mode of the zzso zzso to be practically zero, which was in agreement with the support from the likelihood (in the case of no zzso The method performance is illustrated using simulated data sets with replicates and field data in zzso
