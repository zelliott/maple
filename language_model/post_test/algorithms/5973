Recent zzso zzso case reports have suggested zzso of zzso zzso by zzso juice, possibly through zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso responsible for the clearance of the active zzso of zzso To address this question, the effect of zzso juice and other beverages on zzso activity was evaluated in zzso and in zzso 

The effects of 4 beverages on zzso activity were studied in human liver zzso by use of zzso zzso as the index zzso In a clinical study 14 healthy volunteers received 100 zzso zzso on 5 occasions in a crossover fashion, with at least 1 week separating the 5 zzso zzso was preceded in random sequence by the zzso zzso zzso juice zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso juice (8 zzso zzso zzso tea (8 zzso zzso grape juice (8 zzso and zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor serving as a positive control, with 8 zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso was reduced to zzso zzso zzso of control by zzso zzso zzso tea, to zzso zzso zzso of control by grape juice, to zzso zzso zzso of control by zzso juice, to zzso zzso zzso of control by zzso juice zzso and to zzso zzso zzso of control by the index inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all comparisons versus zzso zzso clearance zzso zzso and elimination zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly among trials 1, 2, 3, and zzso However, clearance in the zzso treatment condition zzso 5) was significantly reduced compared with the zzso control (17 zzso 5 zzso versus 31 zzso 8 zzso P zzso and the zzso was prolonged zzso zzso zzso hours versus zzso zzso zzso hours, P zzso zzso of zzso was zzso reduced by zzso zzso zzso 

Although grape juice and tea impaired zzso activity in zzso none of the 3 beverages altered zzso clearance of zzso in humans, making a zzso interaction with zzso highly zzso
