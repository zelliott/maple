An experimental setup for measurement of zzso zzso of the human eye zzso is zzso The method combines laser scanning technique and zzso single zzso zzso The light source is a laser zzso delivering zzso of about 100 zzso duration at a repetition rate of 40 zzso The zzso wavelength is zzso zzso and the zzso wavelength of zzso detection is at 475 zzso The zzso can be determined with a spatial resolution of 80 zzso 80 zzso and 25 zzso time zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The dominating lifetime zzso is shortest in the zzso zzso to 380 zzso and reaches 1500 zzso in the zzso zzso The lifetime zzso varies between 2 zzso and 5 zzso but the spatial distribution is more zzso zzso of zzso oxygen for 6 zzso leads to changes in the zzso lifetime pointing to detection of zzso Diagrams of lifetime zzso versus zzso are well suited for comparison of zzso Such lifetime clusters of a 20 zzso zzso field of a young healthy subject and of a patient suffering from dry age-related zzso zzso overlap only partially with zzso clusters of zzso
