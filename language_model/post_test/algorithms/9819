This study proposes an efficient and improved model of a direct storage zzso memory, improved zzso zzso memory zzso and zzso the use of zzso for efficient zzso of such large-scale neural network structures at a considerable lower cost reduced complexity, and less area required for zzso This memory model directly stores the X and Y associated sets of M bipolar zzso zzso in the form of zzso and zzso memory zzso requires zzso or about zzso of zzso with weight strength ranging between zzso and is zzso very efficient as compared to zzso zzso and other zzso zzso memory zzso models of zzso type that require zzso complex zzso with weight strength ranging between zzso It is shown that it is functionally equivalent to and possesses all attributes of a zzso of zzso type, and yet it is simple and robust in structure, very large scale integration zzso optical and zzso zzso modular and zzso neural network zzso zzso memory model in which the addition or deletion of a pair of zzso does not require changes in the strength of zzso of the entire memory zzso The analysis of retrieval process, zzso ratio, storage capacity and stability of the proposed model as well as of the traditional zzso has been carried zzso zzso on and characteristics of zzso and bipolar zzso for improved storage and retrieval are zzso The simulation results show that it has zzso N times higher storage capacity, superior performance, faster convergence and retrieval time, when compared to traditional sequential and zzso zzso zzso
