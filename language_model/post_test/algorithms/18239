zzso zzso networks cultivated on zzso zzso are a widely used tool for the investigation of network mechanisms, providing structural framework for long-term recordings of network electrical activity, as well as the network reaction to electrical or chemical zzso The typical activity pattern of the culture takes the form of synchronized bursting events zzso in which a large fraction of the recorded zzso simultaneously fire trains of action zzso in short bursts of several hundreds of a zzso We developed a method that identifies clusters of bursts that share a similar zzso motif throughout the culture based on the fact that the culture zzso remains relatively unchanged for an extended time zzso and that zzso fire in a recognizable and precise manner during a burst zzso Our method compares zzso in time delays that occurred between the zzso of zzso of different zzso Three culture zzso were studied and zzso a large network of 2 million cells, a smaller network limited in size of 100,000 cells, and a large network divided into 4 zzso In each of the zzso we identified cultures that showed more than one zzso zzso zzso networks showed more motifs on average than uniform zzso The zzso was able to show high zzso to artificial zzso We also compare the results of our method with another method based on a correlation zzso
