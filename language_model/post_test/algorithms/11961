Because an image can be reconstructed from knowledge of its zzso transform zzso the task of reconstructing an image is tantamount to that of zzso its zzso Based upon the zzso zzso projection zzso zzso from the statistical perspective of unbiased reduction of image zzso we previously proposed an infinite family of zzso methods for obtaining the zzso from the scattered data in zzso zzso zzso In this work, using the zzso zzso we define the zzso zzso transform zzso which can be treated as the data function in zzso zzso using strategies similar to those that analyze the consistency conditions on the exponential zzso transform in two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with uniform zzso we studied the consistency condition on the zzso and we show that there is a hierarchy of zzso methods that actually project the noisy data function onto its consistency space in different zzso In terms of a weighted inner product of the consistency and inconsistency parts of a noisy data function, we further demonstrate that a subset of the family of zzso methods can be interpreted as zzso projections onto the consistency space of the zzso In particular, the statistically zzso zzso method in the family zzso to an zzso projection associated with an ordinary inner product of the consistency and inconsistency parts of a noisy data zzso
