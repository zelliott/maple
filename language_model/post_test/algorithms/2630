zzso activity that persists long after stimulus presentation is a biological correlate of short-term zzso zzso in zzso activity causes persistent states to drift over time, ultimately degrading zzso Models of short-term memory often assume that the input fluctuations to neural populations are independent across cells, a feature that zzso zzso zzso and zzso persistent zzso However, this assumption is at odds with experimental recordings from pairs of cortical zzso showing that both the input currents and output spike trains are zzso It remains unclear how correlated zzso affects the stability of persistent activity and the performance of cognitive tasks that it zzso We consider the zzso zzso zzso dynamics of pairs of mutually zzso populations of zzso zzso In these networks, persistent activity was less variable when correlated zzso was globally distributed across both populations compared with the case when correlations were locally distributed only within each zzso Using a reduced firing rate model with a zzso of persistent states, we show that, when input fluctuations are correlated across both zzso they drive firing rate fluctuations zzso to the persistent state zzso thereby causing minimal zzso zzso Using these zzso we establish that distributing correlated fluctuations globally as opposed to locally improves network's performance on a zzso delayed response discrimination zzso Our work shows that the correlation structure of input fluctuations to a network is an important factor when determining zzso persistent population zzso zzso
