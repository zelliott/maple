The proposed role of the zzso cell entry protein zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis is to facilitate invasion of host zzso The structure of zzso was zzso on the basis of the crystal structure of zzso N of zzso coli by fold prediction and zzso zzso as the model zzso is an zzso protein consisting of two major zzso and zzso zzso connected by a long alpha zzso The model further revealed that the protein contains 12 zzso 9 zzso and 1 zzso The final model of zzso was verified through the program zzso zzso and more than zzso of the zzso were in the zzso zzso A mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso is directed to an zzso within a zzso zzso that has been shown to promote zzso of bacteria in zzso zzso We show here that the zzso could be narrowed down to a core of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributed to zzso zzso does not promote zzso in zzso cells and sequence comparison of zzso and zzso indicates that the zzso mediates zzso The zzso was located at the surface of the zzso model at the zzso beta zzso region in the beta zzso The zzso of this zzso in the model confirms its potential role in promoting zzso of zzso tuberculosis in host zzso
