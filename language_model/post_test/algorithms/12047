We compare, through simulations, the performance of four linear zzso for diffuse optical zzso reconstruction of the three-dimensional distribution of zzso zzso within a highly scattering medium using the diffuse zzso density wave zzso The simulation geometry consisted of a zzso array of sources and detectors at the boundary of a zzso zzso The forward solution zzso is both zzso because we estimate many more zzso zzso zzso than we have zzso and zzso due to the zzso of the inverse zzso We compare two zzso techniques, ART and zzso and two zzso techniques, the truncated zzso and zzso zzso We compare three-dimensional reconstructions with two-dimensional reconstructions which assume all zzso are confined to a known horizontal zzso and we consider two zzso error metrics in addition to mean square reconstruction zzso We include a comparison using simulated data generated using a different zzso method with the same inversion zzso to indicate how our conclusions are affected in a somewhat more realistic zzso Our results show that the zzso techniques are superior to the zzso techniques in zzso of zzso and zzso of their zzso that two-dimensional reconstructions are sensitive to zzso of the object depth, and that an error measure based on a location zzso can be a useful complement to mean squared zzso
