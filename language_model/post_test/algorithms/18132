This article presents a zzso force zzso technique of detection for zzso zzso direct current motor zzso zzso The zzso has been chosen as the energy zzso in rotary or zzso blood pumps that use electrical zzso for zzso However, in order to operate properly, the zzso driver needs to know the zzso zzso Usually, that information is obtained through a set of Hall sensors assembled close to the zzso and connected to the electronic controller by zzso Sometimes, a large distance between the motor and controller makes the system susceptible to interference on the sensor signal because of winding current zzso Thus, the goal of the zzso technique presented in this study is to avoid this zzso First, the operation of zzso was evaluated on the electronic simulator zzso Then, a zzso detector zzso was assembled in our zzso For the tests, a zzso system was assembled where the direct comparison between the Hall sensors signals and the detected signals was zzso The obtained results showed that the output zzso detector signals are very similar to the Hall signals at speeds of more than zzso zzso zzso the zzso technique is recommended as a responsible or redundant system to be used in rotary blood zzso
