This article presents a new high-resolution zzso template of the human, zzso and zzso based on the anatomy of 20 young healthy zzso The zzso is zzso zzso zzso the location of each structure is equal to the expected location of that structure across individuals in zzso space, a result that is zzso with an independent sample of 16 zzso At the same time, the new template preserves the anatomical detail of zzso structures through a zzso zzso generation zzso In comparison to current zzso templates, it allows for an improved zzso zzso for functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the template requires that the zzso and zzso are isolated from the surrounding zzso a process for which an automated zzso has been zzso Compared to zzso to the zzso zzso template, the new method strongly improves the alignment of individual zzso reducing their spatial spread by zzso and improves the overlap of the deep zzso zzso zzso to functional zzso data, the new zzso technique leads to a zzso increase in peak zzso values and in the activated volume in the zzso zzso for movement zzso rest zzso This indicates that the new template significantly improves the overlap of functionally equivalent zzso regions across zzso The template and software are freely available as an zzso which also allows users to relate the new template to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evans, zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso San zzso Academic Press) and zzso (Van Essen, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the human, macaque, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of one individual, the zzso
