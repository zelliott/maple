zzso surface structure was assessed at twice 2 years apart in 26 zzso subjects zzso zzso in 18 subjects with early zzso of zzso type zzso zzso zzso and in 9 subjects who converted from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso state using magnetic resonance zzso zzso We used parallel transport in zzso under the large deformation zzso metric mapping framework to translate zzso deformation of the zzso surface as represented in the MR images between the two time points in a global template coordinate zzso We then performed hypothesis testing on the zzso variation of zzso shape in the global zzso Both subjects with early zzso and zzso showed greater rates of zzso deformation across time than zzso controls within every zzso of the zzso In a random field analysis, inward surface deformation across time occurred in a zzso manner across the zzso surface in subjects with early zzso relative to the zzso zzso Also, compared to the controls, the lateral aspect of the left zzso tail showed inward surface deformation in the zzso Using surface deformation patterns as features in a linear zzso analysis, we were able to respectively distinguish zzso and patients with early zzso from healthy zzso controls at zzso rates of zzso and zzso which were obtained in the same training set using the zzso cross validation zzso
