In nationwide zzso zzso thousands of zzso examinations must be zzso Each consists of two standard views of each breast, and each mammogram must be visually examined by an experienced zzso to assess it for any zzso The ability to detect an anomaly in zzso texture is important to successful outcomes in zzso screening and, in this study, a large number of zzso were digitized with a highly accurate zzso and textural features were derived from the zzso as input data to a zzso zzso neural zzso The paper discusses how zzso was used to produce a zzso organization of the zzso archive in an zzso zzso This process is subject to certain choices of zzso zzso in these zzso experiments using the zzso view, and typically produced zzso for example, 39 mammogram classes, by analysis of features from zzso mammogram zzso The mammogram zzso captured typical subtleties to discriminate zzso and it is submitted that this may be exploited to aid the detection of zzso anomalies, for example, by acting as a zzso stage to simplify the task for a zzso detection zzso or by ordering zzso examinations by mammogram zzso class prior to screening in order to encourage more successful visual examination during zzso The resulting zzso may help train screening zzso and conceivably help to settle legal cases concerning a zzso screening examination because the zzso can reveal the frequency of zzso patterns in a zzso
