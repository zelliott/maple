We present a three-dimensional zzso measurement and imaging based on a zzso zzso In the presented system, projected images of zzso objects are taken by cameras located at random positions on a zzso and then the zzso objects can be reconstructed zzso We introduce an angle correction function to improve the quality of the reconstructed zzso The angle correction function can correct the angle error caused by the position errors in the projected images due to the finite zzso size of the image zzso The zzso results show that the point source was reconstructed successfully by introducing the angle correction zzso We also demonstrate zzso the two objects are located on a rotary stage controlled by a computer, the projected images are taken by a single camera, and by using 33 projected images, the two objects are reconstructed zzso
