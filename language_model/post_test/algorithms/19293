A porous structure comprises pores and pore throats with a complex three-dimensional zzso network structure, and many investigators have described the relationship between average pore size and the amount of bone zzso However, the influence of network structure or pore throats for tissue zzso has rarely been zzso Four types of zzso porous titanium implants with different pore sizes and zzso zzso in diameter and 15 zzso zzso were analyzed using specific zzso for zzso analysis of interconnectivity based on a zzso focus X-ray zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis was performed using the very same implants implanted into the zzso zzso of male rabbits for 6 and 12 zzso This matching study revealed that more poorly differentiated pores tended to have narrow pore zzso especially in their shorter routes to the zzso In addition, for assessment of the entire zzso we proposed new two zzso that represent the degree of bone and tissue zzso into an implant by considering the effect of narrow pore zzso Data obtained suggest that this sort of novel analysis is useful for evaluating bone and tissue zzso into porous zzso
