This paper presents a zzso study of part of the zzso task faced by children, namely the acquisition of zzso zzso It first zzso this task as a formal mathematical zzso It then presents an implemented zzso for solving this problem, illustrating its operation on a small zzso This zzso offers one precise interpretation of the intuitive notions of zzso learning and the principle of contrast applied between words in an zzso It robustly learns a zzso lexicon despite noisy zzso zzso in the presence of zzso uncertainty, with no prior knowledge that is specific to the language being zzso zzso simulations demonstrate the zzso of this zzso and illustrate how zzso based on zzso learning and the principle of contrast might be able to solve zzso problems of the size faced by children, under weak, worst-case assumptions about the type and quantity of data zzso
