Modern zzso zzso zzso systems are supporting increasingly fast rotation speeds, which are a prerequisite for fast dynamic zzso zzso in zzso imaging, and for new zzso such as dedicated breast CT, where zzso scanning is zzso However, not all detector technologies are supporting the high frame rates that are necessary to retain high resolution for objects far away from the zzso Even on systems that would support a sufficiently high frame rate, the necessary bandwidth of the data transfer from the rotating zzso zzso remains zzso The authors evaluated a zzso shifting technique termed zzso zzso zzso as a method of increasing resolution on fast rotating CT systems without the need to increase the frame zzso 

In zzso mode, detector zzso values are shifted along rows during image acquisition to compensate for detector zzso In order to fully exploit zzso focal spot position control zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso applies a counter movement to the zzso focal spot during image acquisition such that it is kept fixed in zzso As a proof of concept, zzso were performed on a zzso zzso counting detector capable of zzso The detector was mounted on a zzso table and a gold wire phantom was zzso with different zzso settings and detector zzso Additionally, simulations of a broad range of zzso and zzso settings on two different zzso a clinical CT scanner and a breast CT zzso and two different detector zzso flat and zzso were performed to assess the gain in resolution and contrast in zzso water zzso containing a small wire at distances from the phantom center varied from zzso to zzso of the phantom zzso As figures of merit, the zzso transfer function zzso at zzso and the maximum contrast were used and compared against the respective values when using zzso zzso which means stopping the rotation when a projection image is zzso 

zzso showed that detector movement and the resulting blurring of the wire projections were compensated to the expected degree when using the appropriate number of zzso shifts per frame zzso zzso Using simulations it was found that when using the optimal zzso factor, over zzso of the resolution achieved in zzso mode was reached for all investigated wire zzso zzso showed better performance on a zzso detector that on the same system with a flat zzso zzso factors that were zzso from the optimum by more than 1 shift led to a performance below that of standard continuous zzso 

The findings of this study encourage the combined usage of zzso and zzso in systems that require fast zzso The integration of zzso in state-of-the-art zzso detectors is zzso
