Breast zzso that are negative for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso negative zzso have been associated with high-grade zzso aggressive clinical behavior, and poor zzso It has been determined that breast zzso that are negative for zzso and zzso but positive for zzso zzso negative zzso share features with zzso breast zzso In this report, the authors zzso the contribution of zzso as well as demographic and tumor characteristics to the survival of women with zzso tumors, zzso tumors, and other breast zzso zzso 

In total, zzso women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between zzso were identified in the California Cancer zzso zzso and tumor characteristics of women with zzso tumors were compared with those from women with zzso tumors and women with zzso A compound zzso hazards zzso analysis zzso (a zzso of the Cox zzso hazards zzso was used to model these zzso 

Women with zzso tumors were younger, African American, Hispanic, and of lower socioeconomic status zzso whereas women with zzso tumors were slightly zzso African American, and zzso zzso Women with zzso and zzso tumors presented with larger, higher grade, and higher stage than women with zzso Survival among women with zzso tumors was poorer compared with that among women with zzso but was nearly the same as that of women with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso analysis indicated that disease stage, tumor grade, zzso and zzso were significant risk factors for zzso zzso zzso and zzso status was associated with an increased risk of zzso There was a small but significant difference in both long-term and short-term survival patients who had zzso tumors compared with patients who had zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso tumors shared many clinical, zzso and tumor features and had survival that was very similar survival to that of patients with zzso tumors, and survival for both groups contrasted greatly with survival for patients with zzso Disease stage, tumor grade, zzso zzso negative zzso and zzso status, rather than negative zzso status, were risk factors for zzso
