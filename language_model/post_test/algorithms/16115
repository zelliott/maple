The computer zzso of soft tissue has applications in the simulation of surgical procedures, product design, and in zzso generally as well as in motion zzso We begin by reviewing computer zzso techniques in a range of zzso zzso are described to predict where surfaces interact zzso aiming as far as possible to use geometric zzso methods available within high level zzso zzso After an initial zzso zzso zzso surfaces were used zzso A model was developed to predict the region of impact of two surfaces in an environment of many surface zzso We report the results of this zzso and the application of refinement zzso to reduce the zzso zzso We then go on to discuss the zzso of this work in the zzso of the deformation zzso of soft zzso
