The authors describe a methodology for helping zzso biologists diagnose discrepancies they encounter between experimental data and the predictions of scientific zzso The authors call these discrepancies zzso zzso They have built a zzso system to help scientists resolve these conflicts in a more zzso evidence-based zzso In zzso biology, zzso conflicts are the result of complex zzso in which data and models are transformed and zzso Increasingly, the data, models, and tools employed in these zzso come from diverse and distributed resources, contributing to a widening gap between the scientist and the original context in which these resources were zzso This contextual rift can contribute to the misuse of scientific data or tools and zzso the problem of diagnosing zzso zzso The zzso hypothesis is that systematic collection of zzso about a zzso process can help bridge the contextual rift and provide information for supporting automated diagnosis of these zzso The methodology involves three major zzso First, the authors decompose the zzso evaluation process into abstract functional zzso Next, they use this process decomposition to zzso the possible causes of the zzso conflict and direct the acquisition of zzso relevant zzso Finally, they use evidence zzso and zzso generated from the zzso collected to identify the most likely causes of the given zzso They describe how these methods are implemented in a zzso system called zzso and show how zzso can be used to help diagnose conflicts between experimental data and zzso built structural models of the zzso zzso zzso
