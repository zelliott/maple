In a homogeneous group of samples, not all genes of high zzso stem from experimental errors in zzso zzso These expression variations can be attributed to many factors including natural biological zzso or zzso zzso The behavior of these genes can tease out important clues about naturally occurring dynamic processes in the zzso or experimental system under zzso We developed a statistical procedure for the selection of genes with high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After the exclusion of low expressed genes and a stabilizing zzso the majority of genes have comparable residual zzso Based on an zzso zzso genes are selected as having a statistically significant difference from the majority of zzso stabilized genes measured by the zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso technique, further noted as zzso zzso groups zzso genes with similar zzso patterns, presumably from their participation in a common dynamic biological zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time, groups of zzso zzso genes and is illustrated with zzso data from patients with juvenile zzso arthritis and healthy zzso
