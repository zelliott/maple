In forensic molecular pathology, quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso provides a rapid and sensitive method to investigate functional changes in the death zzso zzso and reliable relative zzso requires ideal amplification efficiencies of target and reference zzso However, the amplification efficiency, changing during zzso may be overestimated by the traditional standard curve zzso No single gene meets the criteria of an ideal zzso zzso zzso it is necessary to select suitable reference genes for specific zzso The present study evaluated 32 potential reference genes in the human brain of 15 forensic autopsy cases using three different statistical zzso zzso zzso and zzso On zzso data analyses using a completely objective and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 genes met standard efficiency zzso zzso of their stability and suitability as reference genes using zzso suggested zzso and zzso as the most stable ones, and zzso indicated that zzso and zzso had the highest expression zzso while zzso highlighted zzso and zzso as reference genes with the least overall zzso Combining these three zzso suggested the genes zzso zzso and zzso as stable zzso references in zzso analysis of human brain samples, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso being the least stable zzso These findings are inconsistent with those of previous zzso Moreover, the relative stability of target and reference genes remains zzso These observations suggest that suitable reference genes should be selected on the basis of specific requirements, experiment conditions, and the characteristics of target genes in practical zzso
