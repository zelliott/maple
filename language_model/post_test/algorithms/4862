Advanced nuclear magnetic resonance zzso techniques were applied to study the local environments of hydrogen in zzso Through a combined application of the magic echo zzso and the magic zzso echo zzso sequences the zzso and zzso contributions to the zzso second moment zzso were determined zzso The obtained values are compared with the second moments calculated by the van zzso zzso using structural data determined by zzso scattering on zzso This comparison indicates structural differences between zzso and zzso A model is suggested for the orientation of the zzso zzso in zzso for which the calculated second moments are in good agreement with the zzso observed zzso
