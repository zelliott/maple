This study considers the effects of particle size of the powder constituents, and of zzso speed on the zzso of drug distribution on zzso produced in high-speed zzso When a zzso zzso steroid hormone was zzso together with zzso zzso in a zzso 75 zzso zzso at 250 zzso strong zzso of the drug distribution zzso The coarse particle size zzso of the zzso were found to be zzso up to zzso of the mean drug content, whereas the fine size fraction showed a corresponding zzso of zzso Both particle size and zzso speed attributed to this zzso At an zzso speed of 75 zzso a significantly better drug distribution was zzso zzso show that the zzso found are mainly a consequence of the balance between the impact pressure as exerted by the zzso on the one hand and the zzso resistance of the zzso on the other zzso At a speed of 250 zzso the zzso strength of 3 zzso zzso zzso of the initially formed zzso is too weak to resist an impact pressure of 30 zzso zzso zzso For that reason, particle zzso takes place, which results in zzso Because an zzso speed of 75 zzso is equal to an impact pressure of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly less zzso zzso Similar results can be obtained when the particle size of all constituents is reduced, which increases the zzso strength of the zzso
