Current methods for detecting zzso determinism in a time series require long and stationary data records, as most of them assume that the observed dynamics arise only from the zzso deterministic workings of the system, and the zzso portion of the signal (the noise zzso is assumed to be zzso To explicitly account for the zzso portion of the data we recently developed a method based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The method zzso estimates zzso zzso models for both the deterministic and zzso portions of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are calculated for the estimated models in order to examine if zzso determinism is present in the deterministic portion of the fitted zzso To determine if zzso dynamic analysis of zzso fluctuations can be used to assess zzso zzso by predicting the outcome of invasive cardiac zzso study zzso we applied the zzso zzso to zzso measured resting zzso zzso signals obtained from 16 zzso Our analysis revealed that a positive zzso was highly correlated to a patient with a positive outcome of zzso We found that the statistical accuracy of the zzso zzso in predicting the outcome of zzso was zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso may serve as a zzso probe for screening high-risk populations for zzso cardiac zzso
