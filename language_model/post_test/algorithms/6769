A general and detailed noise model for the DNA zzso measurement of gene expression is presented and used to derive a zzso zzso scheme for expression ratios, implemented in a program called zzso which provides not only an estimate of the zzso in gene zzso but also confidence limits for the change and a zzso zzso the significance of the zzso Although the focus is on zzso zzso technologies, the scheme can also be applied to zzso based technologies if parameters for the noise model are zzso The model zzso zzso for all signals in that it provides a seamless transition from very low to very high zzso ratios, an essential feature for current zzso technologies for which the median zzso ratios are always zzso The dual use, as decision statistics in a two-dimensional space, of the zzso and the zzso is shown to be effective in the ubiquitous problem of detecting changing genes against a background of unchanging zzso leading to markedly higher sensitivities, at equal zzso than detection and selection based on the zzso alone, a current practice until zzso
