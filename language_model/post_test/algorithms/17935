Network structure strongly zzso the range of dynamic behaviors available to a complex zzso These system dynamics can be classified based on their response to zzso over time into two distinct zzso ordered or chaotic, separated by a critical phase zzso Numerous studies have shown that the most complex dynamics arise near the critical zzso Here we use an information zzso approach to study zzso relationships within a unified framework and show that these relationships are most diverse in the critical zzso
