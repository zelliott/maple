In zzso the zzso is a crucial element of the imaging chain and controls the zzso zzso of the collected zzso zzso zzso design has been a long studied topic, with many different criteria used to evaluate the zzso One class of criteria is task based, in which the zzso is designed to zzso detection of a signal zzso Here we consider a new, more realistic task, the joint detection and zzso of a zzso Furthermore, we use an ideal zzso that attains a theoretically maximum task zzso zzso zzso zzso The ideal observer operates on the zzso zzso We consider a family of zzso low-energy zzso of varying resolution and efficiency and zzso over this zzso We observe that for a zzso object characterized by noise due to background zzso and a zzso with zzso noise, the optimal zzso tends to be of lower resolution and higher efficiency than equivalent commercial zzso Furthermore, this optimal design is insensitive to the tolerance radius within which the signal must be zzso So for this scenario, the addition of a zzso task does not change the optimal zzso zzso zzso resolution gets worse as signal size grows, and improves as the level of background zzso noise zzso These latter two trends are also observed when the detection task is zzso and background zzso
