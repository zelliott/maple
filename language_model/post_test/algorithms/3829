This preliminary study presents the development and testing of an zzso treadmill device measuring the ground reaction forces zzso and the feasibility of using this force measuring treadmill zzso in clinical gait zzso A commercially available treadmill was modified and fitted out with three-dimensional zzso force zzso Tests of zzso zzso of pressure position zzso cross talk, natural frequency, background noises, and belt speed were undertaken in order to assess the performance of the zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso were recorded while healthy subjects and patients walked on the zzso in order to zzso the net ankle joint moments and the body zzso of mass zzso zzso and zzso The preliminary results of technical tests were satisfactory with an error less than zzso and dynamic tests in healthy subjects corresponded to the zzso The results of patients were clearly zzso demonstrating the ability of the zzso to discriminate pathological zzso from normal zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso obtained from the zzso seem valid and the clinical assessment of net joint moments and zzso zzso and mechanics seem zzso The zzso could be useful device for clinical research and routine gait analysis since it allows gaining some extra room and quickly collecting the zzso during a large number of successive gait cycles and over a wide range of zzso gait zzso However, more work is needed in this area in order to confirm the present results, collect reference data and validate the methodology across zzso
