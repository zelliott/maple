zzso zzso zzso is the principal zzso zzso in human zzso zzso interactions zzso caused by induction of zzso can result in decreased exposure to zzso drugs, with potential loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as a tool to identify zzso zzso The purpose of the current studies was to characterize the effect of known zzso on zzso in zzso cells, and to determine whether these in zzso data could reliably project the magnitude of zzso caused by zzso zzso compounds were chosen for these studies, based on previously published data using primary human zzso zzso compounds had been shown to be positive for zzso and six compounds had been shown to be negative for zzso In zzso cells, all 18 positive controls produced greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso and all 6 negative controls produced less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted to determine the relationship between in zzso induction data and in zzso induction zzso The approach was to relate in zzso induction data zzso and zzso zzso with zzso free plasma zzso to calculate a relative induction zzso This score was then correlated with decreases in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve values for zzso zzso object drugs zzso or zzso from previously published clinical zzso zzso Excellent correlations zzso values zzso were zzso suggesting that zzso cells can be used for identification of zzso as well as prediction of the magnitude of clinical zzso
