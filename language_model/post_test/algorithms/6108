The problem of zzso error control for real-time video transmission over packet zzso networks is commonly addressed via joint zzso coding zzso where source coding and forward error correction zzso are jointly designed to compensate for packet zzso In this paper, we consider hybrid zzso error correction consisting of zzso and zzso The study is carried out in an integrated joint zzso coding zzso zzso where error resilient source coding, channel coding, and error zzso are jointly considered in order to achieve the best video delivery zzso We first show the advantage of the proposed zzso framework as compared to a sequential zzso approach, where error resilient source coding and channel coding are not fully zzso In the zzso zzso we also study the performance of different error control scenarios, such as pure zzso pure zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and application layer zzso are shown to each achieve optimal results depending on the packet loss rates and the round-trip zzso A hybrid of zzso and zzso is shown to outperform each component individually due to its greater zzso
