zzso of zzso zzso zzso interactions on zzso in locomotor rhythm and coordination were examined in in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Spinal locomotor networks were activated by applying zzso zzso zzso zzso to three spinal pools: zzso zzso and zzso Bathing the brain with zero zzso saline altered zzso drive and zzso interaction while zzso feedback was changed by applying zzso to the zzso pool zzso zzso analyses indicated a zzso energy distribution in zzso root zzso activity that shifted between frequency bands on zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to extract zzso long epochs of low frequency burst zzso These were analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso From the zzso in each window, the cycle period and height of the first side lobe peak were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from standard zzso and zzso of variation of all cycle periods and the mean peak zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso interruption significantly decreased the zzso zzso cycle period and zzso but the zzso zzso zzso The zzso delay was also zzso The zzso zzso rhythm with zzso in the zzso pool only was slower but more variable than with zzso over the entire zzso These results indicate that the locomotor rhythm in the presence of zzso interactions is slower but has a higher zzso The higher zzso may reflect a dynamic stability of the zzso Additionally, differences in local neural organization likely contribute to zzso differences in zzso of the motor zzso
