The zzso model of the labyrinth spaces zzso is a useful tool for research on zzso zzso in particular to develop suitable zzso using zzso technology zzso machine zzso It has other potential applications for auditory zzso 

The energy reaching the labyrinth zzso is crucial information for developing zzso to substitute the zzso system because adequate stimulation of the cochlear partition is zzso However, in zzso zzso in human ears are not currently zzso Therefore a model of the normal labyrinth resembling its zzso properties becomes a valuable zzso It could allow comparison of different processing systems, zzso and zzso to develop new zzso and improve their effectiveness and zzso 

This work presents one zzso that zzso the zzso of the stimuli from the zzso zzso through the labyrinthine zzso including its dimensions and physical properties, and some examples of zzso of zzso stimulation by different zzso and zzso zzso As shown in the reported examples, this zzso provided effective measurement of acoustic stimulation across the whole human auditory frequency and intensity zzso zzso and direct stimulation methods are zzso This provided convenient information for the zzso development and allowed comparison between different zzso stimulation patterns and zzso
