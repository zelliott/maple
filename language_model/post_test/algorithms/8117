Many applications of machine learning involve sparse and zzso zzso For example, zzso of diagnostic models using patients' data from clinical studies requires effective integration of zzso clinical and demographic zzso Typically all zzso zzso are properly zzso and mapped onto a single feature zzso used for zzso a zzso This approach, known as standard zzso learning, is used in most application zzso Recently, several new learning zzso have zzso For instance, when training data can be naturally separated into several groups (or zzso we can view model zzso for each group as a separate task, leading to a zzso Learning zzso Similarly, a setting where the training data are zzso but the objective is to estimate a single zzso model (for all zzso leads to the Learning with zzso Data and zzso methodology recently proposed by zzso zzso zzso zzso science zzso of zzso zzso This paper describes a biomedical application of these new data modeling approaches for modeling zzso data using several medical data zzso The characteristics of group variables are zzso Our comparisons demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these new approaches, relative to standard zzso zzso zzso
