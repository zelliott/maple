In order to zzso screen genetic zzso leading to differential expression of the important human zzso gene in the primary zzso organ, zzso zzso expression levels were measured in 73 normal liver tissue samples from Chinese zzso A set of zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso was performed within a 500 zzso region around the zzso gene using the reference panels of 1,000 Genome project and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the strength of associations by zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Through zzso and linkage zzso analysis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may represent independent and strong association zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso start site, has the strongest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a clear zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso The systematic characterization of zzso common quantitative trait zzso associated with zzso zzso expression in normal liver zzso would provide the candidate markers to zzso clinical zzso in Chinese zzso
