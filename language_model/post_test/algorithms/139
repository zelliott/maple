Despite recent advances in CT technology, metal orthopedic implants continue to cause significant artifacts on many CT zzso often obscuring diagnostic zzso We performed this prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental metal artifact reduction zzso image reconstruction program for zzso 

We examined image quality on CT exams performed in patients with hip zzso as well as other types of implanted metal orthopedic zzso The exam raw data were reconstructed using two different methods, the standard filtered zzso zzso program and the zzso zzso Images were evaluated for quality of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso from the metal, zzso 5 zzso apart from the metal, streak artifact, and overall soft tissue zzso The zzso Rank zzso test was used to compare the image scores from the large and small zzso zzso agreement was zzso 

When all patients were grouped together, the zzso images showed mild to moderate improvement over the zzso zzso However, when the cases were divided by implant size, the zzso images consistently received higher image quality scores than the zzso images for large metal implants zzso hip zzso For small metal implants zzso plates, zzso conversely, the zzso images received lower image quality scores than the zzso images due to blurring zzso The difference of image scores for the large and small implants was significant zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was found to be high for all measures of image quality zzso zzso zzso 

The experimental zzso reconstruction zzso significantly improved CT image quality for patients with large metal zzso However, the zzso zzso introduced blurring artifact that reduced image quality with small metal zzso
