zzso is a zzso application, encompassing both new and established zzso for the analysis of gene and marker content zzso arising from zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses flat file output from zzso experiments to determine the probability of the presence or absence of genes or markers within a zzso zzso can construct gene or marker content zzso for a number of zzso and can use the data to estimate an evolutionary tree or zzso zzso from gene content analyses may be validated by comparing them to known gene zzso zzso was initially developed to zzso data derived from comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso and zzso It has recently been adapted to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marker scores derived from zzso zzso marker zzso experiments in zzso New zzso procedures may be added easily to zzso as zzso in order to increase the scope of the zzso
