zzso zzso and zzso zzso are closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso is ecologically widespread and affects primarily zzso patients, while zzso zzso is traditionally found in tropical climates and has been reported to cause disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blue zzso zzso can be used to differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso but there are few reports of its performance in routine clinical zzso Growth of zzso zzso on zzso zzso produces a blue color, indicating the zzso of zzso while zzso zzso fails to cause a color zzso Using reference and clinical zzso we evaluated the ability of zzso zzso and zzso large zzso zzso DNA sequencing zzso zzso to differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso One hundred two zzso zzso were screened for zzso activity, zzso production, and zzso zzso on zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso of 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso positive, and 54 of 54 zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso Several zzso zzso other than the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso positive, indicating that zzso zzso cannot be used alone for identification of zzso zzso zzso correctly identified and differentiated all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the use of zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso and zzso seed zzso or zzso zzso sequencing can be reliably used in the clinical laboratory to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso zzso We describe how zzso zzso and zzso sequencing have been incorporated into the zzso identification zzso in our zzso
