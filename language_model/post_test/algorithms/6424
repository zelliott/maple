There are no published reports identifying an inadequate zzso response to zzso zzso as a predictor of impending respiratory zzso zzso zzso should induce a respiratory zzso in which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide zzso is zzso zzso + 8) zzso zzso This study examined the relation between inadequate zzso compensation and zzso among trauma zzso 

A retrospective chart review was performed for trauma patients admitted between January 1999 and December zzso Age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso chest injury, history of cardiac or pulmonary disease, partial pressure of oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respiratory rate, zzso blood pressure, base deficit, and ability to compensate were analyzed with respect to zzso and need for zzso zzso 

Of 140 patients with zzso zzso 45 ultimately were zzso The mean zzso for the zzso patients was 34 zzso 7 zzso zzso as compared with 41 zzso 11 zzso zzso for the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso Only injury severity and ability to compensate for zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso Patients with inadequate compensation were zzso times more likely to require zzso when control was used for the zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso to mount an adequate zzso response to zzso zzso is associated with an increased likelihood of respiratory failure and a need for zzso zzso zzso of this relation should lead to closer monitoring of patients with this condition, and could help to avert unforeseen crisis zzso This observation needs to be validated in a prospective zzso
