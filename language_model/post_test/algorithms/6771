Various factors influencing the performance of a zzso transform zzso mass zzso zzso have been zzso Using a nitrogen zzso discharge to produce an zzso stream of zzso zzso and zzso it is found for zzso containing only zzso that the zzso ratio zzso closely approaches the value calculated from the zzso background by assuming that the zzso background follows a zzso zzso In contrast, for a more intense beam containing zzso zzso and zzso the zzso is less than its theoretical value because of the appearance of discrete spikes in the mass spectrum caused by zzso in the actual zzso sequence from the ideal zzso These spikes can be reduced, however, by decreasing the zzso zzso Under these zzso conditions, the zzso sequence length is varied to understand how it alters zzso mass resolution, and scan zzso When the length of the zzso sequence is doubled, the zzso increases by the square root of 2 while the time necessary to record a mass spectrum also zzso Mass resolution can be varied between 500 and 1200 at zzso zzso zzso as the sequence zzso zzso speed (10 zzso 25 zzso and acquisition rate (up to 50 zzso are zzso zzso speeds of zzso passes per s can be obtained using a sequence containing zzso elements modulated at 25 zzso The capability to tailor the zzso to increase the scan speed and resolution with a constant 50% duty cycle makes the technique extremely appealing as a mass zzso for measuring rapid changes in the composition of an zzso zzso
