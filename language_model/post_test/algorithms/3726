To evaluate long-term results of custom laser zzso zzso zzso for correction of zzso and zzso using the Custom zzso Transition Zone zzso software and zzso acid masking fluid zzso for final zzso zzso 

We conducted a prospective study of 297 eyes of 167 zzso All eyes had zzso for correction of zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso laser, zzso software, and zzso zzso profile was used in all zzso zzso was used as masking fluid to remove zzso zzso during the final phase of the zzso 

Mean zzso zzso equivalent refraction was zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso to zzso zzso At 1 year after zzso mean zzso equivalent refraction was zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso D to zzso zzso 

zzso with the zzso zzso zzso laser, zzso and Custom zzso Transition Zone zzso software, with zzso zzso was safe and effective at 1 year after zzso
