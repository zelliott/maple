With the recent onset of influenza A zzso pandemic, the need for improved vaccines against virus infections has become an international zzso Strategies for vaccine development have changed over time, from zzso to zzso proteins and further to zzso viral zzso Various zzso and zzso tools have been developed to predict zzso zzso regions in an zzso protein zzso Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, as represented by real time DNA sequencing, provide increased zzso and yield of data on viral pathogens and host zzso This enables us to zzso the zzso sequence for putative vaccine candidates or targets, allowing a more rational approach to the zzso vaccine zzso This review first describes current zzso tools available for the rational design of zzso vaccines and then addresses recent attempts to define zzso peptides at zzso zzso zzso As there are interplay between zzso and T cells, as well as intersection between viruses and zzso the zzso immunity are orchestrated by multiple factors within an interaction zzso zzso single viral zzso alone fails to provide optimal zzso Systems biology offers a zzso perspective of how the various arms of the immune response are integrated to give immune response, as well as how host and virus zzso thereby providing an integrated approach to select the most promising candidates for zzso vaccines zzso We highlight in this article the zzso application of rational zzso vaccine design, which may be a general paradigm for future viral vaccine zzso
