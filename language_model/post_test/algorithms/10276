The objectives of this research were to test the ability of zzso zzso to predict the cause of death in the mortality data with unknown causes, to find association between common causes of death, to identify groups of countries based on their common causes of death, and to extract knowledge gained from data mining of the World Health Organization mortality zzso 

The zzso software version zzso was used for zzso zzso and association analysis of the World Health Organization mortality database which contained zzso zzso Three major steps were zzso Step 1 - zzso of data to convert all records into suitable formats for each type of analysis zzso Step 2 - analyzing data using the zzso decision tree and zzso zzso zzso algorithm, zzso zzso zzso and zzso association analysis zzso Step 3 - interpretation of results and hypothesis testing after zzso zzso 

Using a zzso decision tree zzso to predict cause of death, we obtained 440 leaf zzso that correctly zzso death instances with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated probability of death from each disease that correctly zzso death instances with an accuracy of zzso K means zzso divided the data into four clusters with zzso 59, 65, 144 zzso in each zzso A zzso was used to test discriminate disease differences found in each cluster which had different diseases as zzso causes of zzso zzso association analysis produced association rules of linkage among cancer of the zzso hypertension and cerebrovascular zzso These were found in the top five leading causes of death with zzso confidence zzso 

zzso tools produced the poorest results in predicting cause of zzso Given the zzso of variables in the WHO database, creation of a zzso model to predict specific cause of death was zzso zzso and association tools yielded interesting results that could be used to identify new areas of interest in mortality data zzso This can be used in data mining analysis to help solve some quality problems in mortality zzso
