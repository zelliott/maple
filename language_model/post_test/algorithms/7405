Images embedded in biomedical publications carry rich information that often concisely zzso key hypotheses adopted, methods zzso or results obtained in a published zzso zzso they offer valuable clues for understanding main content in a biomedical zzso Prior studies have pointed out the potential of mining images embedded in biomedical publications for automatically understanding and retrieving such zzso associated source zzso Within the broad area of biomedical image processing, zzso biomedical images is a fundamental step for building many advanced image analysis, zzso and mining zzso Similar to any automatic categorization effort, zzso image features can provide the most crucial aid in the zzso 

We observe that many images embedded in biomedical publications carry versatile zzso zzso Based on the locations of and the spatial relationships between these text elements in an image, we thus propose some novel image features for image categorization purpose, which zzso characterize the spatial positions and zzso of text elements inside a biomedical zzso We further adopt a sparse coding representation zzso based technique to categorize images embedded in biomedical publications by leveraging our newly proposed image zzso 

we randomly selected 990 images of the zzso format for use in our experiments where 310 images were used as training samples and the rest were used as the testing zzso We first segmented 310 sample images following the our proposed zzso This step produced a total of zzso zzso We then manually labeled all these zzso according to the zzso zzso image zzso proposed by zzso Among our zzso results, zzso are zzso images, 126 are gel zzso images, 135 are line charts, 156 are bar charts, 52 are spot charts, 25 are tables, 70 are flow charts, and the remaining 155 images are of the type zzso A serial of experimental results are zzso zzso each image zzso results is zzso and next image zzso performance indexes such as precision, recall, zzso are all zzso Different features which include conventional image features and our proposed novel features indicate different zzso performance, and the results are zzso zzso we conduct an accuracy comparison between support zzso machine zzso method and our proposed sparse representation zzso zzso At last, our proposed approach is compared with three peer zzso method and experimental results verify our impressively improved zzso 

Compared with conventional image features that do not exploit characteristics regarding text positions and zzso inside images embedded in biomedical publications, our proposed image features coupled with the zzso based representation model exhibit superior performance for zzso biomedical images as demonstrated in our comparative benchmark zzso
