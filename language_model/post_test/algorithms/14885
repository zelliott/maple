The study and comparison of zzso zzso is an important problem in molecular biology, because these zzso often reveal important features of the action of various zzso and the functioning of zzso zzso As is known, zzso varies significantly along zzso zzso zzso often concentrate at certain positions in a zzso otherwise termed zzso 

zzso we propose a zzso analysis method based on the use of zzso trees in order to zzso the influence of zzso context on the occurrence of such zzso The zzso program developed has been tested on simulated and real zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso agents zzso zzso the prediction accuracy was zzso zzso 

The zzso program is available upon request from zzso
