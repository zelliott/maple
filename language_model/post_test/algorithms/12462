The accurate prediction of a zzso secondary structure plays an increasingly critical role in predicting its function and zzso structure, as it is zzso by many of the current state-of-the-art methods for remote zzso fold recognition, and zzso zzso structure zzso We developed a new secondary structure prediction zzso called zzso which uses a pair of zzso models constructed from two sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso uses an input coding scheme that combines both zzso and zzso information, zzso a kernel function designed to capture the sequence conservation signals around the local window of each zzso and zzso a zzso model by incorporating both the zzso predictions produced by the zzso model and information about the original zzso zzso on three standard zzso zzso zzso and EVA common subset 4) show that zzso is capable of producing the highest zzso and zzso scores than that achieved by existing widely used schemes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as previously developed zzso zzso On the EVA zzso it achieves a zzso and zzso score of zzso and zzso which are considerably higher than the best reported scores of zzso and zzso zzso
