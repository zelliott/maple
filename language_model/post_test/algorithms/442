We present techniques to improve visual realism in an interactive surgical simulation zzso a zzso simulator that offers a training environment for medical residents as a complement to using a zzso As well as displaying the zzso bone through volume zzso the simulation allows users to experience zzso feedback and appropriate sound cues while controlling a virtual bone drill and zzso zzso The techniques employed to improve realism consist of a fluid simulator and a zzso zzso The former allows for zzso boundaries based on zzso bone data, while the latter gives a wet look to the rendered bone to emulate more closely the appearance of the bone in a surgical zzso The fluid rendering includes bleeding effects, zzso zzso and zzso We incorporate a zzso zzso fluid dynamics simulation into our three-dimensional rendering to effect realistic blood zzso Maintaining real-time performance while drilling away bone in the simulation is critical for engagement with the zzso
