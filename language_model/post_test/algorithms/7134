In biomedical signal processing, Gibbs zzso and severe frequency zzso may occur when using the traditional discrete zzso transform zzso zzso a new zzso zzso based on the zzso complex zzso transform zzso is zzso zzso zzso signals and heart sound signals are zzso based on the zzso The results prove that the zzso is zzso The zzso ratio zzso and the mean square error zzso are used to compare the zzso zzso zzso of the paired samples zzso show that the new method can remove noise more thoroughly and better retain the boundary and texture of the zzso
