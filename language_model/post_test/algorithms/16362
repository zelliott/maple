A novel, sensitive and specific zzso zzso zzso zzso technique based on two useful molecular zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene involved in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso gene involved in cell division, was developed to simultaneously detect the zzso zzso zzso zzso with its zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso samples of zzso migrant carriers infected with geographical zzso zzso zzso The detection and characterization of authentically zzso zzso zzso revealed no false positive identifications in zzso with or without zzso The zzso was zzso more sensitive than the zzso regardless of the zzso DNA isolation method and compared well with the thick blood film and membrane zzso zzso These zzso zzso could also detect zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to a link to zzso sensitivity among those with unknown infection origins that exhibited zzso responsiveness against treatment with zzso plus zzso These zzso methods can augment the results of microscopic detection of the zzso because these methods enhance DNA isolation and zzso amplification zzso
