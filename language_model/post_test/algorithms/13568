How cells form zzso zzso structures using genetically zzso molecular rules remains zzso Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell zzso First, using a zzso zzso model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve zzso All solutions contained one of three minimal zzso positive feedback, mutual zzso or inhibitor with positive zzso These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited zzso circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more zzso With these design principles as a zzso we zzso constructed artificial polarization networks in zzso using a zzso of zzso signaling proteins that zzso direct the synthesis and degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso motifs yielded clear zzso of synthetic zzso that can persist for nearly an zzso Thus, by harnessing zzso signaling zzso we can engineer simple molecular circuits that reliably execute spatial zzso zzso
