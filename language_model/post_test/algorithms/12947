Precision power zzso of zzso zzso radiation are required to establish zzso applications in the zzso spectral zzso However, zzso to the International System of Units zzso has been missing in the zzso region in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso as the national zzso institute of Germany, determines the spectral zzso of detectors for zzso radiation by using two complementary optical zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both approaches have been successfully zzso and a zzso zzso detector with a zzso zzso is used to verify the consistency of the two independent zzso zzso These primary investigations led to the design of a new measurement facility for the determination of zzso radiant power and the zzso zzso of zzso detectors traceable to the zzso
