The purpose of this study is to calculate correction factors for plastic water zzso and plastic water zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso and electron beam zzso using the zzso zzso Carlo code zzso A zzso zzso conversion factor zzso for zzso and zzso was zzso for several commonly used zzso zzso chambers with different wall materials in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso For electron beams, a zzso factor zzso and a zzso zzso correction factor zzso for both zzso were also calculated in combination with zzso and zzso zzso zzso chambers in the range of zzso zzso The zzso values for the zzso chambers were evaluated from the electron zzso correction factor zzso and wall correction factors zzso and zzso for a combination of water or plastic zzso The calculated zzso and zzso values were verified by comparison with the measured zzso A set of zzso values zzso for the zzso chambers was equal to unity within zzso for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso values also agreed within their combined uncertainty with the measured zzso For electron beams, the zzso values zzso for zzso and zzso were from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, in the range of zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso were from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, at a reference depth in the range of zzso zzso The difference in zzso between water and plastic materials for the zzso chambers was zzso at a zzso Finally, zzso values evaluated for plastic materials were equal to unity within zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values also agreed within their combined uncertainty with the measured zzso The absorbed dose to water from zzso chamber zzso in zzso and zzso plastic materials zzso to that in water within zzso Both zzso can thus be used as a substitute for water for zzso and electron zzso
