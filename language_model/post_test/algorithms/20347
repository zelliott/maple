zzso The effects of external zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso currents zzso were studied in smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit portal vein using the zzso patch zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso In normal zzso external solution the zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso and zzso zzso zzso currents zzso was described by a single exponential with a time constant zzso that was prolonged by external zzso which are more permeable than zzso zzso zzso and zzso and accelerated by less zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between the ability of an external zzso to affect the zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso relative to zzso zzso The zzso dependence of zzso and zzso zzso was not affected by external or internal zzso zzso External zzso zzso were not obligatory for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was not altered in zzso external zzso zzso zzso of zzso by mole zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was fitted by a zzso curve, suggesting competition between zzso and zzso zzso for a binding zzso zzso In conclusion, external zzso affect the zzso of zzso by a mechanism compatible with an interaction with a binding site which zzso zzso channel zzso
