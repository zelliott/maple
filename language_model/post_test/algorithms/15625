The dynamics of migration of electronic zzso and the efficiency of their zzso in two-dimensional ensembles of molecules were zzso zzso were characterized using the following zzso the zzso of zzso bands, the values of extinction and rate constant of zzso of electronic zzso critical distances of migration close to those of dye zzso in particular, zzso a and purple zzso A comparative analysis of two-dimensional models of energy migration made it possible to chose a model with an optimum zzso on traps from the largest numbers of zzso zzso It was shown that in ensembles of molecules having different spectral characteristics zzso shifts between the zzso and zzso zzso of the molecules are hear 800 zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso is approximately 90 and zzso for the number of zzso molecules per one trap 210 and zzso zzso
