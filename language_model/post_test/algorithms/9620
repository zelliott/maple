zzso analysis of zzso requires robust methods for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso is especially important in zzso computer aided detection systems, in which findings are matched across images using the zzso zzso zzso the zzso is a key zzso step to avoid false zzso when detecting masses due to the similarity of the texture of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso zzso capable of providing very robust initial estimates of the zzso position and zzso region in digitized zzso is presented zzso Ten zzso digital zzso which are easily zzso attributed to their excellent contrast, are robustly registered to the target digitized zzso zzso The zzso are then zzso and fused into a final zzso position and zzso zzso Compared to other zzso detection methods in the literature, the system proposed here has the advantages that it is more robust and can provide a reliable estimate when the zzso is located outside the zzso Our results show that the change in the correlation between zzso distances in zzso and zzso zzso views is not significant when the detected zzso positions replace the manual zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso is acceptable and can be used as zzso for a more complex zzso to zzso the outline zzso A novel aspect of the method is that it is also capable of detecting and zzso the zzso in zzso zzso
