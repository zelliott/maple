zzso dose calculation zzso well as zzso and electron zzso usually based on zzso zzso taken in a water zzso The exceptions to this are zzso dose calculation zzso for modulated scanning zzso There, it is usual to measure the spot profiles in zzso We use the concept of zzso zzso zzso also for scattering and uniform scanning zzso zzso delivery zzso The dose calculation includes a separate step for the calculation of the zzso zzso distribution per energy zzso The zzso zzso calculation is specific to the technique zzso a lesser zzso of the treatment zzso The actual dose calculation uses the zzso zzso as input and is generic for all zzso machine designs and zzso
