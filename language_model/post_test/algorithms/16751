In this paper, we present a new web browser based on a two-dimensional zzso zzso interface zzso zzso where our major concern is the selection of an intended target in a zzso web zzso A real-world web page may contain tens or even hundreds of targets, including zzso input zzso buttons, zzso In this case, a target filter designed in our system can be used to exclude most of those targets of no zzso Specifically, the user filters the targets of no interest out by zzso zzso with a zzso zzso while keeps those containing the zzso Such filtering largely zzso the target selection task based on our zzso zzso When there are only several targets in a web page zzso an original sparse page or a zzso zzso the user moves the mouse toward the target of interest using zzso zzso zzso The horizontal movement and vertical movement are controlled by motor imagery and zzso potential, zzso If the mouse encounters a target of no interest, the user rejects it and continues to move the zzso Otherwise the user selects the target and activates zzso With the collaboration of the target filtering and a series of mouse movements and target zzso the user can select an intended target in a web zzso Based on our browser system, common navigation functions, including history rolling forward and backward, zzso selection, page zzso text zzso zzso are zzso The system has been tested on seven zzso Experimental results not only validated the efficacy of the proposed method, but also showed that free zzso surfing with a zzso mouse is zzso
