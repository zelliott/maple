This paper reports a fast and accurate zzso zzso method for the simultaneous determination of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Solutions (5 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso were subjected to forced degradation by exposure to artificial zzso light source zzso zzso 354 zzso and the changes appearing in zzso were monitored at selected zzso zzso A zzso zzso was zzso to achieve complete zzso of all zzso in the shortest analysis zzso zzso zzso recorded by the zzso array detector system zzso and 340 zzso clearly showed the structural changes in the new species formed, with respect to the parent zzso The zzso method was subjected to a validation procedure in which zzso and range, as well as zzso precision and accuracy were determined according to zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso process was performed on the basis of the calculated kinetic zzso zzso rate constant zzso zzso time zzso time degradation of zzso of the drug zzso
