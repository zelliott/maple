Previous studies have demonstrated zzso changes in brain zzso and zzso connectivity but the zzso dynamics of functional properties of the brain during task execution is still zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso changes in functional properties of the human brain network by applying zzso analysis to zzso zzso zzso performed a zzso attention task in which a visual cue informed them of the direction of focus for incoming auditory or tactile target zzso but not the sensory zzso We analyzed the zzso signal in the zzso zzso to examine network properties during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests with the zzso method showed that in the zzso zzso beta activity was zzso in the zzso region including zzso and zzso zzso regions in the zzso zzso to the attended zzso zzso analysis revealed that, in beta frequency, global hubs were found around the zzso and prefrontal regions, and functional segregation over the entire network was decreased during zzso control compared to the zzso Thus, network measures revealed zzso zzso changes in functional properties of the human brain network, leading to the understanding of how the brain zzso responds to task execution as a zzso
