The zzso equation is generally used to estimate the kinetic zzso V and zzso when the zzso assumption is zzso Following a brief overview of the derivation of the zzso equation for the zzso zzso reaction, a critical review of the criteria for zzso of the zzso assumption is zzso The application of the zzso assumption makes the implicit assumption that there is an initial transient during which the zzso concentration remains approximately constant, equal to the initial zzso zzso while the zzso complex concentration builds zzso This implicit assumption is known as the zzso stationary zzso This review presents evidence showing that the zzso stationary assumption is distinct from and independent of the zzso zzso zzso to the widely believed notion that the zzso equation can always be applied under the zzso zzso the zzso stationary assumption is truly the necessary condition for zzso of the zzso equation to estimate kinetic zzso zzso the application of the zzso equation only leads to accurate zzso of kinetic parameters when it is used under experimental conditions meeting the zzso stationary zzso The criterion for zzso of the zzso stationary assumption does not require the restrictive condition of choosing a zzso concentration that is much higher than the zzso concentration in initial rate zzso
