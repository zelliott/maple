To study zzso effects of blood from zzso zzso zzso rats with early (less than 7 zzso or chronic zzso than 4 zzso benign hypertension, we assessed zzso resistance and zzso zzso responses in zzso isolated, zzso zzso zzso vascular beds of zzso normal male recipient zzso zzso were zzso (2 zzso with blood from zzso donor rats with limb zzso returned to the donor zzso zzso pressure was zzso Complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in limbs zzso with donor blood from nine early zzso rats, compared with nine appropriate zzso control donor rats, indicated unchanged zzso 50% effective doses, and zzso zzso zzso in limbs zzso with blood from 10 chronic zzso compared with 10 appropriate controls, suggested small zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso in zzso responses were also zzso zzso resting resistance and minimal resistance zzso zzso did not rise, even after 4-5 h of zzso These results provide no evidence in early zzso and little evidence in chronic zzso that zzso factors, including zzso zzso evoke zzso significant zzso effects in zzso in zzso
