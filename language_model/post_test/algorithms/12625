The problem of designing optical systems that contain zzso surfaces is a challenging one, even in the case of designing a single zzso Here we present a method for the coupled design of two zzso reflective surfaces that will have a prescribed zzso On one hand, the method can be described using traditional zzso and zzso which we do, but it is motivated by viewing the problem in the language of zzso from differential geometry and makes use of the exterior differential systems, which we relegate to an zzso zzso applications are given to the design of a mirror pair that increases the field of view of an observer, a similar mirror pair that also zzso the zzso view, and a pair of mirrors that give the observer a traditional panoramic strip view of the zzso
