There are two crucial problems with statistical measures for sequence zzso overlapping structures and background information of words in biological zzso Word zzso in improved composition zzso method took into account these problems and achieved better performance in evolutionary zzso The word zzso is desirable, but not zzso because it assumes that the four bases A, C, zzso and G occur randomly with equal zzso This paper proposed an improved word zzso which uses zzso model to estimate exact zzso distribution according to observed biological sequence and thus has the ability to adjust the background information of the zzso zzso in biological zzso The improved word zzso was tested with three experiments and compared with the existing word zzso The experiment results confirm that the improved word zzso using zzso model to estimate the exact zzso distribution in biological sequences is more zzso
