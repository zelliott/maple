zzso researchers use simulation studies to validate their statistical methods because it is acknowledged that this is the most feasible way to know the ground truth of the zzso The noise model used in these studies typically varies from a simple zzso distribution to an estimate of the noise distribution from real zzso However, although several studies point out the presence of zzso noise in zzso data, this noise source is currently lacking in simulation zzso zzso we explored the impact of adding zzso noise to the simulated zzso For several experimental designs, zzso data were generated under different noise models while the zzso ratio was kept zzso The sensitivity and specificity of a standard statistical zzso mapping zzso analysis were determined by comparing the known zzso with the detected zzso We show that by including zzso noise in the data generation process, the simulation results in terms of sensitivity and specificity drop zzso Additionally, we used the new proposed simulation model to compare a standard zzso analysis against the method proposed by zzso et zzso zzso The results indicate that the analysis of data containing no zzso noise yields a better performance of the zzso zzso However, if zzso noise is included in the data, the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso method are higher compared to the zzso zzso Based on these results, we argue that the results of current simulation studies are likely to be zzso especially when analysis methods are compared using zzso zzso
