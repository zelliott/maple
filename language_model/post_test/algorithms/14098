We sought to investigate the influence of heart rate and zzso resolution on the assessment of zzso zzso function with zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso 

A dynamic cardiac phantom was repeatedly scanned with a zzso CT scanner using a standardized scan protocol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 330 milliseconds rotation zzso at different simulated heart rates, ranging from 40 to 140 beats per zzso Images were reconstructed with an zzso utilizing data from 1 to 4 cardiac cycles zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso and stroke volume as well as cardiac output were zzso zzso of the zzso were compared with the real volumes of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

Using a zzso reconstruction algorithm, the zzso resolution was fixed to 165 zzso With zzso zzso and zzso image zzso mean zzso resolution was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction resulted in a lower zzso when comparing measured and real zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso image zzso the percent zzso between measured and real values for zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction with improved zzso resolution the zzso decreased with increasing heart rate when compared with zzso image zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resolution improves the zzso of zzso volumes in cardiac zzso spiral CT, enabling reliable assessment of zzso volumes even at increased heart zzso
