The purpose of this study was the development and preliminary evaluation of zzso correlation imaging with zzso zzso detection zzso on chest zzso for zzso and zzso improvement of early detection of pulmonary zzso 

Digital chest zzso of 10 zzso of a chest phantom and of seven human subjects were acquired in multiple angular projections with an acquisition time of 11 seconds zzso zzso and total exposure comparable with that of a zzso chest zzso An initial zzso zzso zzso with two zzso filters and zzso thresholds was developed with an independent database of 44 zzso chest zzso with confirmed zzso This zzso zzso zzso was used on each projection image to find likely suspect zzso The zzso zzso were reconstructed in zzso reinforcing signals associated with true zzso while simultaneously decreasing zzso findings produced by overlapping zzso zzso The performance of correlation imaging was tested on two to 15 projection zzso 

zzso performance of correlation imaging was attained when nine projection images were zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso correlation imaging decreased as much as zzso the frequency of zzso findings in phantom cases at a sensitivity level of zzso The corresponding reduction in zzso findings in the cases of human subjects was zzso 

Although limited by a relatively simple zzso zzso and a small number of cases, the findings suggest that correlation imaging performs substantially better than zzso zzso and may greatly enhance identification of subtle solitary pulmonary zzso on chest zzso
