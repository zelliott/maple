Three zzso MR zzso techniques are presented for assessing deep vein zzso zzso at zzso T in patients with metallic zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso fresh blood imaging sequences with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso direction and without zzso zzso zzso were developed for zzso zzso For faster flowing blood, a swap zzso zzso zzso elimination zzso technique was zzso The three techniques were assessed both zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso image analysis in 15 zzso zzso was compared to zzso in the pelvic veins and zzso was compared to zzso in the thigh and calf zzso Both zzso and zzso techniques produced significantly higher zzso zzso and image quality in each comparative study zzso Five patients with metallic implants and confirmed zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and calf zzso examinations and the results were compared to conventional zzso The zzso and zzso images showed all zzso from all five patients without interference from implant zzso zzso The excellent image quality produced by both zzso and zzso throughout peripheral zzso demonstrates their promise for detecting zzso in zzso zzso
