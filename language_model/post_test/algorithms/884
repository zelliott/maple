The usefulness of the quantum chemical zzso calculated at the level of the zzso theory using zzso basis set for zzso study of zzso calcium channel zzso was zzso A data set containing 45 zzso derivatives with known activity was zzso Multiple linear zzso combined with genetic zzso for variable selection and an artificial neural network model combined with principal component analysis for dimension reduction and genetic zzso for factor selection zzso were zzso Some zzso zzso equations with good statistical quality were obtained for different classes of zzso zzso The resulting equations suggest that the electronic properties of the atoms belonging to the backbone of the molecules as well as the zzso of the molecules affect the binding of these molecules with their zzso In the zzso The principal components of the zzso data zzso were used as the input of the neural network and then genetic zzso was applied to select the most relevant set of principal zzso Two ANN models with five selected principal components were zzso These models, which have high statistical qualities, can predict the activity of the molecules with prediction errors lower than zzso
