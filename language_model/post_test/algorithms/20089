The understanding of how general zzso act on individual cells and on global brain function has increased significantly during the last zzso What remains poorly understood is how zzso act at intermediate zzso Several major theories emphasize the importance of zzso groups, sets of strongly connected zzso that fire in a zzso fashion, in all aspects of brain function, particularly as a necessary zzso of zzso The authors have undertaken computer modeling to determine how zzso acid zzso type A zzso zzso zzso agents such as zzso may influence the dynamics of zzso group formation and ongoing zzso 

A computer model of a cortical network with connections modified by synaptic plasticity was zzso At zzso the model spontaneously formed zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso and indirect effects on input drive were then examined to study their effects on this zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and input drive reduction reduced the firing frequency of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The diminution in zzso rates led to dramatic reductions in the firing frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso output from the model at baseline exhibits gamma and zzso zzso The direct and indirect zzso effects reduce the zzso of these underlying rhythms and modestly slow the gamma zzso 

zzso zzso both directly and indirectly zzso the ability of zzso to form groups zzso A lack of group formation is consistent with some theories of zzso loss of memory formation and zzso
