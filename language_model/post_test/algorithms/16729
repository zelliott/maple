zzso zzso fields in zzso MR imaging cause severe image artifacts, when conventional zzso zzso zzso are zzso Particularly in MR sequences that zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso complete signal loss may occur in certain zzso When using a surface zzso for zzso the zzso zzso these problems become even more challenging, as the spatial zzso field zzso is zzso As an alternative to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences can be applied, which have the benefit that these sequences are insensitive to zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the potential of using zzso zzso at 7 T with surface zzso zzso in human zzso The zzso zzso zzso were tuned to deal with the constraints in zzso strength and zzso power deposition, but remained in the zzso zzso As a consequence, the dynamic range in zzso is compromised, and signal zzso is obtained over the echo zzso zzso Bloch simulations over the echo train and phantom zzso were obtained to assess these zzso Still, using proper zzso zzso we demonstrate improved image quality of the zzso zzso versus conventional zzso in the brain, the neck zzso zzso and in the pelvis zzso at 7 zzso
