In zzso zzso zzso and zzso presented a system of partial differential equations for modeling spatial segregation of interacting zzso Apart from competitive zzso zzso and population pressure zzso terms, a zzso term modeling the populations attraction to more favorable environmental regions was zzso In this article, we study zzso a modification of their zzso term to take account for the notion of spatial adaptation of zzso After describing the model, in which a time zzso drift term is considered, we propose a zzso zzso in terms of a zzso time zzso finite element zzso Finally, we zzso the results of some biologically inspired zzso experiments showing qualitative differences between the original model of zzso and the model proposed in this zzso
