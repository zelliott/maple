zzso functional integration between cerebral zzso and dysfunctional brain network organization may zzso the zzso deficits seen in psychiatric zzso zzso zzso measures from network science to brain imaging data allows the zzso of complex brain network zzso While this approach has recently been used to further zzso the nature of brain dysfunction in zzso the value of applying this approach in zzso models of psychiatric disease has not been zzso For the first time, we apply both established and recently derived zzso from network science zzso zzso to functional brain imaging data from rats treated zzso with the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso in the global properties of functional brain networks akin to those reported in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso treatment zzso compromised functional integration between distributed neural systems, including between the prefrontal zzso and zzso that have established roles in zzso through, in part, the promotion of zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso treatment promotes the functional disintegration of discrete cerebral zzso and also alters the connectivity of neurotransmitter systems strongly implicated in zzso zzso we propose that sustained zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of dysfunctional brain network organization in zzso
