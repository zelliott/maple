The accuracy by which biological cells sense chemical concentration is ultimately limited by the random arrival of particles at the receptors by zzso This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the zzso limit zzso zzso 20, 193 zzso Here we derive a lower limit by applying maximum likelihood to the time series of zzso zzso The increased accuracy stems from solely considering the unoccupied time zzso the occupied time intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle zzso and only decrease the accuracy of the concentration zzso zzso which minimize the bound time intervals achieve the highest possible zzso We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing strategy by absorbing or degrading bound zzso
