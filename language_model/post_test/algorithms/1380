This paper describes a novel technique for registering a dynamic sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, using principal component analysis zzso Conventional methods for registering images, such as count difference and correlation zzso zzso fail to take into account the dynamic nature of the data, resulting in large systematic errors when registering zzso zzso However, by using principal component analysis to extract the zzso structure of the image zzso zzso can be zzso by examining the distribution of zzso The registration procedures were tested using a computer-generated dynamic phantom derived from a high-resolution magnetic resonance image of a realistic brain zzso Each method was also applied to clinical zzso images of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to investigate the influence of zzso on kinetic zzso parameters and the binding zzso The zzso technique gave highly significant zzso improvements in image zzso leading to alignment errors in zzso and y of about zzso of the alternative methods, with reductions in zzso over zzso It could also be applied to align image sequences which the other methods failed completely to register, particularly zzso zzso The zzso method produced data of much greater quality for subsequent kinetic zzso with an improvement of nearly 50% in the zzso of the fit to the zzso model, and provided superior quality registration of particularly difficult dynamic zzso
