This study describes the zzso zzso and preliminary clinical evaluation of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the zzso Each zzso was zzso in terms of drug release, zzso zzso zzso zzso a texture zzso in texture profile analysis zzso zzso zzso a texture zzso in zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso disc zzso as a detachment force using the texture zzso in zzso zzso The release zzso for the zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso indicating that drug release was zzso zzso zzso the zzso of each zzso component significantly increased the time required for 10 and zzso release of the original mass of zzso due to both increased zzso and, zzso the unique swelling properties of the zzso zzso zzso of each zzso component also increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso The effects on product zzso zzso and zzso may be due to increased product zzso and, zzso increased resistance to zzso Similarly, the effects of these zzso on zzso highlight their zzso nature and, importantly, the effects of zzso state zzso zzso on these zzso Thus, in zzso where the zzso of PC was zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso Interestingly, statistical interactions were primarily observed between the effects of zzso and PC on drug release, mechanical and zzso zzso These were explained by the effects of zzso on the physical state of PC, namely swollen or zzso In the preliminary clinical zzso a zzso was selected that offered an appropriate balance of the above physical properties and contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso PC, in addition to zzso zzso (as the zzso The clinical efficacy of this zzso zzso was compared to an identical zzso zzso zzso in nine zzso pockets zzso zzso zzso One week following administration of the test zzso there was a significant improvement in zzso health as identified by reduced numbers of zzso microbial zzso zzso it can be concluded that, when used in combination with mechanical plaque zzso the zzso zzso systems described in this study would augment such therapy by enhancing the removal of zzso thus improving zzso zzso
