A physical model was derived for the synthesis of the zzso zzso with an industrial immobilized zzso G zzso called zzso In reactions zzso by zzso less product and more zzso are formed in comparison with a zzso zzso zzso The model incorporates reaction with a zzso zzso distribution, zzso coupled zzso and zzso zzso behavior of zzso and is used to obtain insight in the complex interplay between these individual processes leading to the zzso zzso The model was successfully validated with synthesis experiments for conditions ranging from heavily diffusion limited to hardly diffusion zzso including zzso zzso from 50 to 600 zzso temperatures between 273 and zzso K, and pH values between 6 and zzso During the conversion of the zzso into zzso severe pH zzso inside the zzso zzso which were previously measured by others, were zzso Physical insight in such zzso process dynamics may give important clues for future zzso zzso The modular construction of the model may also facilitate its use for other zzso with other zzso
