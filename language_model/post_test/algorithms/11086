To evaluate the clinical application of a robust semiautomatic image zzso method to determine the brain target volumes in radiation therapy treatment zzso 

A local robust zzso zzso was used on zzso brain images to study the clinical target volume zzso of several zzso First, 3 zzso delineated zzso of 10 patients zzso and the process time for each patient was zzso The averages of the zzso contours were evaluated and considered as reference zzso Then, to determine the zzso through the semiautomatic method, a fourth zzso who was blind to all manual contours selected zzso points around the zzso and defined the initial zzso The time to obtain the final zzso was calculated again for each zzso Manual and semiautomatic zzso were compared using 3 different metric criteria: zzso zzso zzso distance, and mean absolute zzso A comparison also was performed between volumes obtained from semiautomatic and manual zzso 

Manual zzso processing time of tumors for each patient was dependent on its size and complexity and had a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso minutes, whereas it was zzso zzso zzso minutes for the semiautomatic zzso Means of zzso zzso zzso distance, and mean absolute distance between manual contours were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and they were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between manual and semiautomatic zzso zzso Moreover, the mean volume ratio zzso calculated for all samples was zzso 

Given the zzso of this method, the results showed reasonable accuracy and similarity to the results of manual zzso by the zzso This study shows that the localized zzso zzso can have great ability in determining the zzso and can be appropriate alternatives for manual approaches in brain zzso
