For a zzso assessment of the aquatic toxicity of chemical zzso two competing concepts are zzso concentration addition and independent zzso Concentration addition is generally regarded as a reasonable expectation for the joint toxicity of similarly acting zzso In the opposite case of zzso acting zzso the choice of the most appropriate concept is a controversial zzso In tests with freshwater algae we therefore studied the extreme situation of multiple exposure to chemicals with strictly different specific mechanisms of zzso Concentration response analyses were performed for 16 different zzso and for zzso containing all 16 substances in two different concentration zzso zzso mixture toxicity was compared with predictions, calculated from the concentration response functions of individual zzso by alternatively applying both zzso The assumption of independent action yielded accurate predictions, irrespective of the mixture ratio or the effect level under zzso Moreover, results even demonstrate that zzso acting chemicals can show significant joint effects, predictable by independent action, when combined in zzso below individual zzso values, statistically estimated to elicit insignificant individual effects of only zzso The alternative hypothesis of concentration addition resulted in zzso of mixture zzso but differences between observed and predicted effect zzso did not exceed a factor of zzso This finding zzso with previous studies, which indicated near zzso action of zzso of zzso acting zzso Nevertheless, with the scientific objective to predict zzso mixture toxicity with the highest possible zzso concentration addition obviously is no universal zzso Independent action proves to be superior where components are well known to interact specifically with different molecular target sites, and provided that reliable statistical estimates of low toxic effects of individual mixture constituents can be zzso With a regulatory perspective, however, zzso of both conditions may be regarded as an extraordinary situation, and hence concentration addition may be zzso as a pragmatic and zzso default zzso
