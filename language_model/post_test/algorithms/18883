A recently developed method for zzso zzso zzso was used to study the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso which has a zzso form in the ground state, in terms of the zzso and heat capacity changes zzso in different time zzso The zzso change zzso of the first intermediate that forms within 1 zzso after zzso was 38 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The heat capacity change zzso upon formation of this intermediate was positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This positive zzso suggests that the zzso surface area of zzso exposed to the bulk zzso zzso After this initial transition, a zzso reaction with another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso takes zzso Upon this reaction, the energy was stabilized to 26 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso formation was accompanied by a larger but negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This negative zzso might indicate buried zzso zzso at the interface of the zzso and/or the existence of trapped water at the zzso We suggest that zzso interactions are the main driving force for the formation of the zzso upon zzso of zzso
