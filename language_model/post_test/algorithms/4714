This paper proposes a novel zzso zzso map, zzso that fully zzso the zzso hardware built in most zzso Unlike the zzso the proposed zzso zzso samples the unit sphere zzso zzso and all samples span the same solid angle zzso zzso Its mapping zzso contains only a small zzso By feeding the zzso hardware with the zzso zzso map, the zzso can exploit all built-in zzso operators tailored for the zzso and achieve a very high frame zzso In addition, we develop an zzso filtering that compensates zzso artifacts due to texture zzso This filtering technique extends the existing hardware zzso filtering and can be applied not only to the proposed zzso but also to other texture mapping zzso
