Despite at least 40 years of promising empirical performance, very few clinical natural language processing zzso or information extraction systems currently contribute to medical science or zzso The authors address this gap by reducing the need for custom software and rules development with a zzso user zzso highly zzso approach to zzso zzso 

A zzso by zzso approach combines features derived from zzso zzso pipelines with zzso machine learning zzso to automatically and zzso evaluate top-performing zzso The Fourth zzso Shared Task zzso concept extraction task provided the data sets and metrics used to evaluate zzso 

Top zzso scores for each of the tasks were medical problems zzso treatments zzso and tests zzso Recall lagged precision in all zzso Precision was near or above zzso in all zzso zzso With no zzso for the tasks and less than zzso of zzso time to zzso and launch each experiment, the average zzso was zzso one point behind the mean zzso of the 22 entrants in the zzso Strong precision scores indicate the potential of applying the approach for more specific clinical information extraction zzso There was not one best zzso supporting an zzso approach to model zzso 

zzso levels of performance can be achieved using fully automated and zzso approaches to zzso information zzso The described zzso and related documentation is available for zzso
