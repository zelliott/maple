A novel method for protein structure comparison using zzso profile alignment is zzso The zzso profile is a zzso scoring zzso derived from three-dimensional structures and is basically used to estimate zzso zzso for prediction of protein zzso Our idea is to compare two zzso profiles using a dynamic programming zzso to obtain optimal alignment and a similarity score between zzso When the zzso profile of zzso was compared with each of the profiles in the library, which contained 325 profiles of representative structures, all the profiles of other zzso were detected with relatively high scores, and proteins in the same structural class followed the zzso Exhaustive comparison of zzso profiles in the library was also performed to depict protein zzso in the structure zzso Using zzso zzso a zzso projection of points in the protein structure space revealed an overall grouping in terms of structural classes, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results differ in implication from those obtained by the conventional zzso comparison zzso zzso are discussed with respect to the structural divergence of proteins in the course of molecular zzso
