zzso temperature simulation is an important component in environmental modeling since it is involved in several aspects of zzso transport and zzso This paper deals with the performance of the soil temperature simulation zzso of the well-known environmental model zzso Model results are compared and evaluated based on the basis of its ability to predict in zzso measured soil temperature profiles in an experimental plot during a zzso monitoring zzso The evaluation of the performance is based on linear zzso statistics and typical model statistical errors such as the root mean square error zzso and the zzso objective function zzso zzso show that the model required minimal zzso to match the observed response of the zzso zzso of the determination zzso zzso were found to be in all cases around the value of zzso indicating a very good agreement between measured and simulated zzso zzso of the zzso were found to be in the range of zzso to zzso degrees C, zzso to zzso degrees C, zzso to zzso degrees C, and zzso to zzso degrees C, for the examined 2, 5, 10 and 20 zzso soil zzso zzso zzso analyses were also performed to investigate the influence of various factors involved in the energy balance equation at the ground surface on the soil temperature zzso The results showed that the model was able to represent important processes affecting the soil temperature regime such as the combined effect of the heat transfer by zzso between the ground surface and the atmosphere and the zzso heat flux due to soil water zzso
