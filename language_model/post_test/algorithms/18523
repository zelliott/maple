Several studies have shown that zzso usage within genes varies, as it seems dependent on both zzso context and zzso position within the zzso Given that zzso in addition often are avoided in zzso this study aimed at finding out if zzso variations in zzso usage may be a way to control the amount and location of zzso A zzso Carlo zzso was written which zzso the zzso in genes while keeping the zzso acid sequence of the translation product zzso On the zzso zzso zzso were counted and their zzso positions zzso zzso coli zzso uses type II zzso systems and displays pronounced zzso usage zzso Using this as a reference zzso it was clearly shown that the number of zzso in genes is generally lower than the amount of zzso in zzso zzso thus, the succession of zzso seems to be a way to decrease the number of zzso The zzso position of zzso in zzso zzso however, was largely equal to the position in the native zzso so zzso usage phenomena are unlikely to be a way to control the zzso position of zzso The analysis was repeated on two zzso and gave similar same results, even though the virus zzso are much zzso Studies on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which seemingly have no type II zzso systems, showed that in these species there is only weak evidence for zzso usage acting to control the number of zzso
