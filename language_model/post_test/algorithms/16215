This paper studies the problem of stabilization for zzso zzso control systems with an optimal guaranteed zzso Unlike previous works, the resulting zzso system with variable uncertain sampling cannot simply be regarded as an ordinary zzso system with a zzso delay in the zzso By defining a novel zzso zzso functional and using a convex combination technique, the characteristic of zzso systems is zzso A new zzso stabilization criterion is established in terms of linear zzso zzso such that the zzso sampling zzso and the minimal guaranteed cost control performance can be zzso It is shown that the newly proposed approach can lead to less conservative and less complex results than the existing zzso Application examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed zzso
