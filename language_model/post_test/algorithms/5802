What determines the genetic contribution that an individual makes to future zzso With zzso zzso each individual leaves a zzso of descendants, determined by the zzso relationships in the zzso The pedigree of an individual zzso the lines of descent of each of its zzso An zzso zzso value is the expected number of copies of each of its genes that is passed on to distant generations conditional on its zzso For the simplest model of zzso reproduction zzso to the zzso zzso an zzso zzso value is determined within zzso generations, independent of population zzso zzso zzso and subdivision do not greatly slow this zzso Our central result is that the probability that a gene will survive is zzso to the zzso value of the individual that carries it and that, conditional on survival, after a few tens of generations, the distribution of the number of surviving copies is the same for all individuals, whatever their zzso zzso These results can be generalized to the joint distribution of surviving blocks of the ancestral zzso zzso on zzso zzso in the genetic background may greatly increase the zzso in zzso value, but the above results nevertheless still zzso The almost linear relationship between survival probability and zzso value also holds for zzso favored zzso Thus, the influence of the complex pedigree of descendants on an zzso genetic contribution to the population can be summarized through a single zzso its zzso zzso
