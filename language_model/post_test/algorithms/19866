A list of 147 zzso and zzso compounds was compiled from the literature for investigating the relationship between molecular structure and zzso zzso Each compound in the data set was represented by 374 zzso and 970 zzso zzso A genetic zzso zzso for pattern recognition analysis was used to identify a subset of molecular zzso that could differentiate zzso from zzso in a plot of the two largest principal components zzso of the zzso A PC map of the 110 compounds in the training set using 45 molecular zzso identified by the pattern recognition zzso revealed an zzso data zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to occupy a small, but zzso region of the PC zzso space, with the zzso randomly distributed in the PC zzso A zzso zzso neural network trained by back propagation was used to develop a zzso that correctly classified all the compounds in the training set as zzso or zzso The neural network was successfully validated using an external prediction of 37 zzso
