zzso optical systems are considered to have a fundamental resolution limit due to wave nature of zzso This article presents a novel method for observing zzso features in a conventional optical microscope using linear zzso The operation principle is based on a random and time varying flow of zzso moving in proximity to the inspected zzso Those particles zzso the zzso waves and couple them into harmonic zzso The zzso features are zzso and later on digitally zzso by proper image processing of a sequence of zzso The achievable final resolution limit zzso to the size of the zzso Experimental proof of principle validation of the technique is zzso
