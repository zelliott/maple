zzso is an important task in zzso For several years now, support zzso machines zzso have proven to be powerful for infrared spectral data zzso However such methods require zzso of parameters in order to control the risk of zzso and the complexity of the zzso Furthermore, it is established that the prediction ability of zzso models can be improved using zzso in order to remove unwanted zzso in the zzso In this paper we propose a new methodology based on genetic zzso zzso for the simultaneous zzso of zzso parameters and zzso zzso The method has been tested for the discrimination of the geographical origin of Italian olive oil zzso and zzso on the basis of near infrared zzso or mid infrared zzso zzso Different zzso models zzso zzso with mean zzso data, zzso have been tested and statistically compared using zzso statistical zzso For the two zzso zzso with zzso zzso give models with higher accuracy than the one obtained with zzso on zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso most of this accuracy improvement zzso compared with zzso for zzso occurred using only a single zzso zzso For the zzso zzso three zzso zzso steps are required to obtain zzso model with significant accuracy improvement zzso compared to the one obtained with zzso zzso Furthermore, this study demonstrates that even zzso models have to be developed on the basis of zzso spectral data in order to obtain higher zzso zzso
