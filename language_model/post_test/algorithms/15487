In this study, individual differences in brain zzso during positive and negative affective zzso processing in women with different zzso scores are zzso 

Twenty-six women scoring high and low on zzso participated on this zzso A support zzso machine zzso zzso was applied on the zzso single trials zzso by high zzso pictures with negative and positive zzso zzso Based on the accuracy values obtained from subject identification tasks, the most distinguishing zzso channels among participants were zzso pointing which scalp regions show more distinct zzso 

zzso differences were zzso in the zzso zzso between positive and negative zzso zzso yielding higher accuracy in subject identification using negative zzso Regarding the topographical analysis, significantly higher accuracy values were reached in zzso areas and in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Mainly, individual differences in zzso can be located in zzso zzso These differences are likely to be due to the different zzso and coping strategies to unpleasant stimuli in individuals with high zzso In addition, the right zzso shows a greater individual zzso 

An zzso zzso asserts the individual specificity and its topographical differences in zzso activity for women with high zzso compared to low zzso
