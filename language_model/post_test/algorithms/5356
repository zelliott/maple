In this study, we investigated the neural basis of virtual time to contact zzso and the hypothesis that zzso provides zzso information for future zzso zzso A novel approach to differentiate stable zzso and zzso stages within a single zzso trial while a subject was performing a challenging single leg stance with eyes closed was zzso Specifically, we zzso zzso transform and stage zzso zzso using zzso time series data set as an zzso The zzso time series was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals to examine its underlying neural zzso To identify the focal sources of neural zzso of zzso a zzso approach was designed combining the independent component analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso There were two major findings: zzso a significant increase of zzso minimal values (along with enhanced zzso of zzso was observed during the zzso stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and zzso and zzso this zzso dynamics was associated with pronounced zzso of zzso predominantly within zzso alpha and gamma frequency zzso The sources of this zzso zzso were identified at the zzso zzso zzso and the junction of zzso and zzso zzso as well as at the zzso zzso The findings support the hypothesis that the systematic increase of minimal values of zzso zzso with zzso of zzso signals at the zzso and zzso areas serve collectively to predict the future instability in zzso
