zzso membrane protein zzso requires the coordination of several events: accurate targeting of the nascent chain to the zzso recognition, orientation and integration of zzso zzso zzso and proper formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso unanticipated zzso and zzso interactions probably mediate each stage of zzso for single zzso zzso and zzso anchored membrane zzso The importance of these regulated interactions is illustrated by analysis of zzso prediction zzso zzso zzso or zzso TM zzso occur because the primary sequence and overall zzso of a single TM domain are not the only zzso of membrane zzso
