We have used a computer program to scan the entire sequence of viral zzso for zzso signal zzso The method is based on that of von zzso zzso The program zzso a score for each zzso in a zzso The score indicates the resemblance of each zzso to that at the zzso site of a typical zzso zzso signal zzso The program correctly predicts the known zzso signal sequence zzso sites of several cellular and viral zzso The analysis demonstrates that the zzso of enveloped zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso several internal zzso zzso The predicted zzso site in these internal sequences are often known zzso sites for processing of the zzso and are amongst the highest scoring zzso with this zzso These results indicate a role for the cellular zzso signal zzso in the processing of several viral zzso Not all zzso zzso are sites of zzso suggesting a difference between zzso and internal signal zzso This may reflect the secondary structure of the zzso Signal sequences were also found at the zzso of the fusion proteins of the zzso and the zzso This suggests a mechanism of viral fusion analogous to that by which proteins are zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso
