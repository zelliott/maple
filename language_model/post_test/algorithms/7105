zzso frequency shift and electrical zzso variation are common phenomena in the application of high power zzso zzso zzso in focused ultrasound surgery and in zzso They result in low power efficiency and unstable zzso zzso To solve this problem, a driving and measurement system has been developed to track the resonance of high power zzso and to zzso their zzso zzso This has the ability to monitor the operating and performance parameters of the zzso zzso in real zzso The zzso of the system, with its control zzso implemented in zzso (National zzso zzso zzso ensures flexibility to suit different zzso and load zzso In addition, with different programs, it can be zzso as a high power zzso zzso or an instantaneous electrical power measurement system for zzso in the zzso zzso The effectiveness of this system has been demonstrated in detailed zzso With it, high zzso performance at high power can be achieved and monitored in real zzso
