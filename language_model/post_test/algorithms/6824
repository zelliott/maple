Automatic mode switching zzso of dual chamber zzso require fundamental changes in the operation of zzso timing cycles to zzso detection of zzso zzso The timing cycles related to mode switching are basically independent of the zzso zzso zzso periods (when the sensing amplifier is temporarily zzso should be zzso to a relatively small fraction of the pacing cycle to enhance zzso sensing and prevent zzso zzso This review explains the function of the timing cycles pertaining to mode switching and proposes simpler zzso to facilitate the understanding of zzso function and zzso interpretation of complex zzso
