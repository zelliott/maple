The zzso knockout mouse is thought to be a good animal model for human zzso Recent studies have reported on the association of zzso gene zzso with cardiovascular disease in zzso We observed the zzso of single zzso zzso that is, zzso in the promoter region, zzso in zzso 4, and a functional zzso zzso of zzso gene in Koreans, and we investigated their relationships with the presence of coronary artery disease zzso in patients who had undergone coronary zzso A total of zzso subjects who underwent coronary zzso because of chest pain were zzso and their blood pressure, body mass index, zzso blood zzso level, and zzso profiles were zzso zzso were performed on samples of their blood with real-time zzso chain zzso Two single zzso zzso zzso and zzso complied with zzso zzso For the zzso zzso 1 zzso subject for the adverse zzso was detected among the entire population zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso When the subjects were classified into 4 groups according to the number of zzso vessels, there were no differences among the mean values of the cardiovascular risk factors, except for age and the zzso blood zzso levels, which showed a significant difference between that of the normal and the diseased vessel zzso There were no differences in the prevalence of zzso according to the zzso of the zzso zzso however, for the zzso zzso those subjects with the T zzso showed a lower prevalence of zzso than those with the zzso zzso When the subjects were divided into 2 groups according to age, in the group younger than 60 years, T zzso carriers of the zzso zzso showed a lower prevalence of zzso than did the zzso In the group older than 60 years, A zzso carriers of the zzso zzso showed a lower prevalence of zzso than did the zzso On the zzso analysis, the zzso zzso showed an increased risk for zzso with an odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso effects of age were observed in the association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in zzso The zzso zzso seems to be rarely found in the Korean zzso These results zzso the possibility of the zzso gene being a candidate gene of zzso in humans, and further research on this topic needs to be zzso
