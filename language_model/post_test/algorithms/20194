In this paper, we propose a joint zzso system for the purpose of protecting medical zzso This system is based on an approach which combines a zzso zzso algorithm, the zzso index zzso with an encryption zzso a stream zzso zzso zzso the zzso or a block zzso zzso zzso the AES in zzso block zzso zzso mode of zzso Our objective is to give access to the outcomes of the image integrity and of its origin even though the image is stored zzso If zzso and encryption are conducted jointly at the protection stage, zzso extraction and decryption can be applied zzso The security analysis of our scheme and experimental results achieved on zzso depth ultrasound images as well as on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images demonstrate the capability of our system to zzso make available security attributes in both spatial and encrypted zzso while minimizing image zzso Furthermore, by making use of the AES block zzso in zzso mode, the proposed system is zzso with or transparent to the zzso zzso
