Acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso multiple sclerosis zzso share overlapping clinical, zzso and laboratory features at zzso Because zzso may contribute to the zzso of both diseases, we sought to identify zzso zzso that are capable of distinguishing zzso 

We used custom zzso zzso to profile zzso zzso in zzso derived from individuals with pediatric zzso zzso zzso zzso pediatric multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso secondary zzso we zzso both zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso Analysis of zzso software to confirm the differences in zzso zzso profiles between zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso Analysis of zzso software to generate and validate prediction zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was characterized by zzso zzso targeting zzso derived from zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso was characterized by zzso zzso targeting zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso and zzso zzso We generated and validated prediction zzso that distinguish zzso serum zzso zzso specificity zzso from zzso serum zzso zzso specificity zzso on the basis of combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to a small number of zzso zzso 

Combined profiles of serum zzso and zzso zzso identified zzso zzso that may be useful for distinguishing zzso from zzso Further studies are required to establish clinical zzso Further biological zzso are required to delineate the zzso potential of these zzso
