Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene zzso These methods are based on widely different zzso zzso Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the zzso whereas others test each gene set on its zzso Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling zzso This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set zzso 

We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of zzso zzso derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily zzso as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually zzso Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between zzso the zzso derived from such methods can be wildly zzso as a simulation experiment zzso We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set zzso
