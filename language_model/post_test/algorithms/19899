The considered problem of 3-D reconstruction consists in zzso and passively recovering both topography and texture of a scene surface observed by optical zzso with a limited zzso imaging system (typically a conventional optical zzso Throughout a sequence of registered zzso images, the concepts of zzso and zzso involve recovering both topography zzso zzso and texture image of the surface by researching zzso information, zzso Toward that aim, traditional approaches generally follow a zzso zzso way and thereby fail to deal with noisy and disturbed acquisitions, quite frequent in transmitted light observations and of interest in this zzso Such examples are the acquisitions of human ex zzso zzso zzso from the medical issue addressed in this paper, which are mainly damaged by cellular fragments in the sample immersion medium and by emphasized contrast zzso To achieve with such noisy and disturbed acquisitions, a new focus analysis is introduced that originally adopts a 3-D strategy throughout the image zzso This method exploits simultaneously all available zzso cues that effectively strengthens the zzso More precisely, it locally performs zzso statistical analyses over zzso spatial windows so as to find zzso zzso zzso Comparisons to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real acquisitions from the zzso medical issue demonstrate the efficiency and the zzso of the proposed zzso
