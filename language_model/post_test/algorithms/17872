The precision of zzso zzso zzso during a fixation is an important factor in determining the zzso of a zzso zzso tracking system for real-time zzso The objective of this paper is to define and measure zzso fixation precision, propose methods for increasing the fixation precision, and examine the improvements when the methods are applied to two zzso zzso zzso To achieve these zzso techniques for high-speed image processing that allow zzso sampling rates of over 400 zzso are zzso With these high-speed zzso sampling rates, the fixation precision can be improved by filtering while maintaining an acceptable real-time zzso The high-speed sampling and digital filtering techniques developed were applied to two zzso zzso techniques, zzso the high-speed zzso reflection zzso zzso zzso method and a 3-D zzso method allowing free head zzso zzso on the subjects has shown that when operating at 407 frames per second zzso with zzso the fixation precision for the HS zzso zzso zzso method was improved by a factor of zzso to zzso degrees zzso screen zzso compared to the unfiltered operation at 30 zzso For the 3-D zzso zzso method, the fixation precision was improved by a factor of 11 to zzso degrees zzso screen zzso compared to the unfiltered operation at 30 zzso
