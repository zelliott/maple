Imaging of zzso zzso by atomic force zzso allows a determination of the exact statistical zzso for the numbers of zzso per array and the locations of zzso on the zzso This precision makes such data an excellent reference for testing models of zzso occupation on zzso DNA zzso The approach presented here uses a simple statistical zzso model to calculate theoretical population and zzso zzso and compares them to experimental zzso previously determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The model considers the possible locations of zzso on the template, and takes as principal parameters an average free energy of interaction between zzso zzso and DNA, and an average wrapping length of DNA around the zzso Analysis of zzso statistics shows that it is possible to consider interactions between zzso and positioning effects as zzso on a random positioning zzso zzso Analysis of the population statistics is used to determine zzso association zzso and to test for differences in the free energies of zzso formation with different types of zzso zzso namely zzso or zzso and different DNA templates, namely zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show that the two template zzso bind zzso with similar affinities but zzso zzso zzso the association of zzso with both zzso Analysis of zzso statistics is used to determine the strength of specific zzso positioning tendencies by the DNA templates, and the strength of the interactions between neighboring zzso The results show only weak positioning tendencies and that zzso zzso interact much more strongly with one another than zzso zzso in fact zzso appears to induce a small zzso occupation effect between neighboring zzso
