zzso zzso Imaging zzso provides us with valuable information about the white matter fibers and their arrangement in the zzso However, clinical zzso acquisitions are often low resolution, causing partial volume zzso In this paper, we propose a new high resolution zzso zzso zzso This method makes use of the spatial correlation between neighboring zzso Unlike some zzso zzso the proposed method does not require multiple acquisitions, thus it is better suited for clinical zzso The method relies on a maximum likelihood strategy for zzso zzso to zzso account for the noise and an zzso zzso prior to promote zzso in homogeneous areas while respecting the zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to produce high resolution zzso images from a single low resolution zzso We demonstrate the efficiency of the method on synthetic zzso data and real clinical zzso The results show statistically significant improvements in fiber zzso
