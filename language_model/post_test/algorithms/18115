The zzso of several small organic molecules on zzso zzso and zzso as well as on zzso zzso surfaces was investigated by zzso molecular dynamics in zzso solution and a new approach to the calculation of zzso energies is proposed, taking into account the potential energy fluctuation of larger zzso zzso and zzso insert into twin oxygen vacancies in the surface and form polarized zzso zzso zzso In one case spontaneous zzso of two zzso molecules to a zzso zzso with a structure similar to zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso charged zzso were not zzso on any titanium dioxide surface, but the zzso zzso attained stable zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso ethanol, zzso and zzso zzso with their functional zzso Very stable zzso provide a zzso bond and have zzso energies of zzso zzso The zzso compete with water molecules for similar zzso sites in point defects as well as on perfect zzso
