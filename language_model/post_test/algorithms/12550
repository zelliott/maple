A rat model composed of the sacrifice of the anterior and zzso cortical zzso veins by zzso techniques was used for the assessment of brain zzso Twenty male, zzso zzso rats were used in this animal zzso Small zzso were made over the anterior (the intersection of the line drawn from the zzso border of the zzso rim and the line drawn along the zzso to the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso point of the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso After performing a final inspection and describing the zzso vessels, they were sacrificed using bipolar zzso technique and zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso approach, zzso zzso technique and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shift, brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and necrosis were zzso findings observed in this experimental zzso The zzso zzso study demonstrated disrupted areas of the zzso barrier in the operated zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an zzso brain swelling in the operated zzso compared with zzso zzso Our results suggest that the sacrifice of the anterior and zzso zzso veins may be used as an experimental rat model in the evaluation of brain damage and swelling caused by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
