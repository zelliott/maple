The advance in zzso zzso technologies including zzso has demonstrated the potential of generating a tremendous amount of gene expression data for the entire zzso Deciphering zzso networks that convey information on zzso correlations and zzso connections of genes is a crucial analysis task in the zzso zzso Most of the existing analysis methods for zzso gene expression profiles consist of several steps that often require human involvement based on experiential knowledge that is generally difficult to acquire and zzso Moreover, large-scale zzso typically incur zzso expensive zzso overhead and thus result in a long zzso research zzso 

We propose a parallel zzso random zzso theory approach to analyze the cross correlations of gene expression data in an entirely automatic and objective manner to eliminate the ambiguities and zzso inherent to human zzso We apply the proposed approach to the publicly available human liver cancer data and zzso cycle data, and generate zzso networks that illustrate interacting functional zzso The experimental results conform accurately to those published in previous zzso 

The correlations calculated from experimental zzso typically contain both zzso and zzso zzso In the proposed approach, we remove the zzso component by testing the statistics of the zzso of the correlation zzso against a zzso zzso truly random correlation zzso obtained from mutually zzso expression data zzso Our investigation into the components of zzso zzso after zzso zzso rotation reveals distinct functional zzso The zzso of high performance computing resources including zzso package, supercomputer and Linux PC cluster in our zzso and experiments significantly reduces the amount of zzso time that is otherwise needed on a single zzso More importantly, the large distributed shared memory and parallel computing power allow us to process zzso zzso of enormous zzso
