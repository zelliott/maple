zzso independent recognition of zzso objects and their zzso in the presence of clutter and zzso is a challenging zzso We present a novel zzso zzso zzso which performs this task automatically and zzso A zzso model of an object is automatically constructed zzso from its multiple zzso range images zzso These views are converted into zzso table representations (which we refer to as zzso zzso are automatically established between these views by simultaneously matching the zzso of a view with those of the remaining views using a hash zzso voting zzso This results in a graph of relative transformations used to register the views before they are integrated into a seamless zzso zzso These models and their zzso representations constitute the model zzso During online recognition, a zzso from the scene is simultaneously matched with those in the library by casting zzso zzso measures are calculated for the model zzso which receive the most zzso The model with the highest similarity is transformed to the scene and, if it zzso accurately with an object in the scene, that object is declared as recognized and is zzso This process is repeated until the scene is completely zzso zzso were performed on real and synthetic data comprised of 55 models and 610 scenes and an overall recognition rate of 95 percent was zzso zzso with the spin images revealed that our zzso is superior in terms of recognition rate and zzso
