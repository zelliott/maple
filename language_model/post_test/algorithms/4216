zzso is an zzso highly dynamic and zzso zzso zzso which regulates numerous cellular processes such as gene zzso translation, immune zzso protein degradation, zzso interaction, zzso and signal zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso does not display a strict zzso acid consensus zzso although zzso or zzso zzso flanked by zzso and zzso are preferred sites of zzso Based on this information, zzso prediction tools of zzso sites have been zzso Here, we zzso assessed the performance of two available zzso prediction programs zzso zzso server and zzso by comparing their predictions for recently discovered zzso validated zzso zzso Both prediction programs efficiently identified zzso sites situated in an environment resembling the consensus sequence zzso However, both prediction programs revealed numerous false negative zzso predictions when the site of modification was located in an zzso acid sequence differing from the known consensus zzso By searching for a common sequence zzso we found that zzso of zzso proteins preferably occurs at zzso and zzso zzso flanked downstream by zzso and zzso and upstream by one to two zzso followed by a stretch of zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso of proteins located in the zzso or in the zzso zzso occurs at different sites and does not follow a distinct consensus zzso Thus, our study indicates the limitations of the presently available zzso prediction methods for zzso sites and suggests that experimental validation is zzso zzso update and further development of available databases will be the key to improve the performance of zzso site zzso
