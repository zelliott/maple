From an ecological and economical point of view, it is important to design zzso procedures for monitoring heavy metals in the environment and industrial processes in a way to minimize the use of hazardous zzso and reduce the analysis zzso In this paper, a well-known zzso zzso method for the determination of many metal zzso was improved by using zzso selectivity of the strongly overlapped zzso of copper and cadmium zzso in zzso for their simultaneous determination from a single extraction at pH zzso The individual zzso zzso having zzso zzso difference of only 20 zzso were zzso and the metal zzso were zzso by using an improved procedure for zzso the resolving function in a recently proposed signals ratio zzso The procedure consists of using many different resolving functions and plotting the difference of the mean of absolute and zzso mean values of zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso obtained with each of the resolving functions, thus obtaining 2 straight lines having zzso that give a unique and reliable value of the unknown concentration of the individual zzso in mixture giving strongly overlapped zzso In this way, the main drawback of the signals ratio resolution method, that is, the visual zzso of optimal resolving function, is zzso The proposed zzso zzso zzso was tested by using both simulated and experimental zzso zzso was determined in the mixture with ca zzso excess of cadmium, and cadmium was determined in ca zzso excess of copper at zzso concentration zzso
