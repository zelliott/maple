zzso zzso diamond turning as well as advances in computer controlled small lap polishing enables the fabrication of zzso zzso or more specifically, optical surfaces for imaging applications that are not zzso zzso Various forms of zzso for describing zzso optical surfaces exist in optical design and to support zzso A popular method is to add zzso zzso onto a zzso zzso In this paper, recently introduced zzso zzso are investigated in a comparative manner with the widely known zzso zzso In order to achieve zzso zzso when zzso zzso are required to describe zzso surfaces, recurrence relations are a key zzso zzso in this paper establish the zzso of both zzso sets in accurately describing zzso surfaces under stringent zzso zzso the accuracy of these two zzso surface descriptions is a critical step in the future application of these tools in both advanced optical system design and optical zzso
