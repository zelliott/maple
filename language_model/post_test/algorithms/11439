zzso has become a rapidly emerging field and monitoring of protein zzso is needed to ensure quality and consistency during production processes of zzso such as therapeutic zzso or zzso zzso via zzso zzso with zzso detection zzso represents a powerful technique featuring high resolution, high sensitivity as well as zzso zzso However, sample data retrieved from this method exhibit challenges for downstream zzso analysis due to zzso migration time shifts as well as stretching and zzso of zzso Here, we present zzso a freely available and zzso software package to automatically correct for zzso in zzso based zzso zzso We demonstrate its ability to outperform conventional zzso such as dynamic time zzso and correlation zzso zzso in terms of processing time and alignment accuracy for high-resolution zzso Built upon a set of rapid zzso the tool includes an intuitive zzso user interface and allows full control over all zzso Additionally, it zzso the alignment process and enables the user to zzso zzso zzso Software and documentation are available at zzso
