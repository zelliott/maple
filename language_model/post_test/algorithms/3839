We have used the zzso zzso for oxygen parameters to develop a zzso zzso program which zzso the concentration of oxygen released from zzso blood when the zzso is reduced to a stated zzso This program can be used to generate the in zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso allows calculation of the concentration of oxygen released from zzso blood when the blood becomes zzso at a zzso of zzso zzso This entity is an estimate of the zzso amount of oxygen available for release from zzso zzso We have termed it zzso Available zzso We believe that zzso Available zzso is a simpler concept to describe oxygen carriage and release properties of blood than zzso Mixed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and possesses a number of other theoretical and practical zzso The zzso is zzso when zzso blood is highly saturated with zzso To overcome this problem, we have modified the zzso to allow generation of the curve and zzso of zzso Available zzso and other parameters from a zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso
