In this paper, we present a new approach for chaos reproduction using variable structure zzso neural networks zzso A neural network zzso is zzso with a variable structure that will change according to its output performance as compared to the given orbits of an unknown chaotic zzso A zzso between identification errors and zzso complexity is zzso
