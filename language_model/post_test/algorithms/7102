zzso evaluation permits the state of rocks to be determined quickly and cheaply, satisfying the demands faced by today's producers of ornamental stone, such as environmental sustainability, durability and safety of zzso The basic objective of the present work is to zzso and develop the usefulness of ultrasound testing in zzso the zzso properties of zzso Various parameters related to Fast zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been extracted from some of the studies conducted zzso which have not previously been considered in work on this topic, unlike the zzso pulse zzso The experimental study was carried out on cubic specimens of 30 zzso edges using zzso and zzso wave zzso and equipment which extended the normally used natural resonance frequency range up to 500 zzso Additionally, a validation study of the laboratory data has been conducted and some zzso improvements have been zzso The main contribution of the work is the analysis of linear statistical correlations between the aforementioned new ultrasound parameters and zzso properties of the zzso that had not previously been zzso zzso resistance to salt zzso and breaking load for zzso Being properties that directly affect the durability and safety of use of zzso these correlations consolidate zzso as a zzso method well suited to this type of zzso
