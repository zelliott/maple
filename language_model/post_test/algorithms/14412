To test the accuracy of a mathematical model zzso that zzso zzso made on conventional lateral head films to corresponding dimensions observed in a cone beam zzso zzso zzso scan in human zzso 

Thirteen subjects had lateral zzso taken with a conventional zzso machine as well as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower anterior face height zzso from both examinations were zzso Two other groups of zzso were derived zzso from the dimensions directly zzso on the lateral zzso the zzso correction group and the zzso correction zzso The data were analyzed zzso using repeated measures analysis of zzso zzso 

All zzso from the lateral zzso were significantly different from the corresponding zzso derived from the zzso Simply taking into account the image zzso did not correct the zzso zzso linear measurement obtained from a conventional zzso into a zzso zzso linear measurement made on a zzso zzso unless the structures from which the distance will be measured are located on the zzso zzso When the zzso was used to correct the zzso zzso however, there were no statistically significant differences between the zzso group and the zzso zzso 

Using the mathematical formula presented zzso zzso zzso zzso from landmarks both on and off the zzso plane can be corrected into a zzso zzso measurement with zzso By applying this zzso to other existing zzso zzso growth studies, control groups and standards for zzso images could be derived without exposing zzso subjects to zzso
