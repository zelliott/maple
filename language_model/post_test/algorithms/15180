The practical utility of diffusion zzso imaging, especially for zzso high-resolution spin zzso experiments of ex zzso zzso has been hampered by long acquisition zzso To accelerate the zzso a compressed sensing framework that uses a zzso zzso to reconstruct diffusion zzso fields from zzso zzso data was presented and zzso zzso in brain zzso white matter fiber orientation, fractional zzso and mean zzso mapping were compared with alternative methods achievable using the same scan time via reduced image resolution, fewer diffusion zzso directions, standard compressed zzso or zzso sampling zzso The efficiency of the proposed approach was also compared with fully sampled cases across a range of the number of diffusion zzso zzso In general, the proposed approach was found to reduce the image blurring and noise and to provide more accurate fiber orientation, fractional zzso and mean zzso zzso compared with the alternative zzso Moreover, depending on the degree of zzso used and the diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso the measurement accuracy of the proposed scheme was equivalent to fully sampled diffusion zzso imaging zzso that consist of zzso more zzso directions and require zzso longer scan zzso The findings show zzso compressed sensing to be promising for improving the resolution, zzso or scan time of diffusion zzso zzso
