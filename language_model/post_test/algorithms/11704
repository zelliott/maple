We address the challenge of distinguishing zzso zzso zzso time series from those generated by synthetic zzso via a newly developed zzso zzso zzso Traditional measures of time series complexity only zzso the degree of zzso on a single time zzso However, many zzso zzso such as heart rate, zzso in a very complex manner and present correlations over multiple time zzso We have proposed a new method to calculate zzso zzso from complex zzso In order to distinguish between zzso and synthetic time series, we first applied the method to a learning set of zzso time series derived from healthy zzso We zzso established selected criteria characterizing the zzso dependence on scale factor for these zzso We then applied this zzso to the zzso 2002 test zzso Using only the zzso zzso method, we correctly classified 48 of 50 zzso time zzso In combination with zzso spectral analysis, we correctly classified all time zzso
