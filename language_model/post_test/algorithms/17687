A zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso to sample an zzso zzso zzso such as the one of the error terms zzso in a multiple trait animal model with missing records under zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso is based on a zzso form of the zzso zzso density that avoids sampling the missing error zzso zzso prior zzso are assumed for the zzso effects and breeding values, whereas the zzso zzso are assumed to follow zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso prior for the environmental zzso zzso is a product density of all patterns of missing zzso The resulting zzso scheme eliminates the correlation between the sampled missing zzso and the sampled zzso which in turn has the effect of decreasing the total amount of samples needed to reach zzso The use of the zzso zzso in a multiple trait data set with an extreme pattern of missing records produced a dramatic reduction in the size of the zzso among samples for all lags from 1 to 50, and this increased the effective sample size from zzso to 7 times and reduced the number of samples needed to attain zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso
