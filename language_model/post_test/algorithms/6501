Digital image processing in the medical field has become very popular in recent years zzso to the significant advantages it offers over conventional techniques of visual or analogue image zzso One of the most significant aspects in medical image processing has been that of image zzso which deals with the task of registering two images taken under different zzso Image registration is considered an important issue in the field of zzso as pictures of a zzso taken in different periods need to be compared and zzso zzso A hybrid image registration scheme was developed and evaluated for zzso zzso The method splits the zzso zzso problem into two, with a combination of deterministic and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and rotation parameters are estimated using a zzso of image zzso image zzso algorithm, whereas the two translation parameters are estimated with a zzso similarity criterion and a zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of the method has been validated for the registration and comparison of zzso melanoma zzso zzso of rotation and zzso parameters was performed using the zzso transformation technique, which proved to be very accurate, even when high rotation and zzso values were zzso zzso for the rotation zzso zzso were less than zzso zzso for the zzso factor, differences were on average less than zzso with a maximum difference estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using zzso similarity measures namely the zzso sign change, the deterministic sign change zzso and the window value range, the performance of which has been assessed and, in all cases, was found to be highly zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso has been proposed and, in combination with the zzso similarity zzso was evaluated and proved to successfully estimate translation zzso Thus the proposed hybrid registration technique can successfully estimate problem parameters in a zzso zzso
