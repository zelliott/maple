This paper proposes a technique to improve the quality of high-resolution zzso by weighting the coherent average of beats by a function of the energy of the zzso zzso noise, prior to subsequent detection of zzso late zzso The results obtained with 20 patients indicate the method requires fewer beats than conventional zzso average to achieve the same noise zzso
