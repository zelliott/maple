Different strategies for the control of chaotic zzso networks and physical systems are zzso The variables of the dynamics span zzso with very high zzso Novel control techniques are introduced that handle these zzso zzso Depending on the system, several orbits with different zzso zzso may be stabilized out of the chaotic zzso The role of chaos control in information processing is pointed zzso
