The signals recorded by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso are dependent on the zzso properties of biological zzso so it is possible to obtain quantitative structural information zzso from such zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso methods have the ability to probe the behavior of water diffusion over different time scales and the potential to detect variations in zzso zzso To assist in the interpretation of zzso data, zzso expressions have been derived for zzso signals with zzso methods for restricted diffusion in some typical structures, including parallel planes, zzso and zzso using the theory of zzso diffusion zzso These zzso predictions have been confirmed with computer zzso These expressions suggest how zzso signals from biological zzso should be analyzed to characterize tissue zzso including how to estimate cell nuclear zzso This approach provides a model to interpret diffusion data obtained from zzso zzso that can be used for applications such as monitoring tumor response to treatment in zzso
