Phase extension from lower to higher resolution by using an upgraded zzso variables zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in protein molecules with close to 1,000 zzso atoms is zzso Three points of this procedure are of particular zzso zzso The use of a set of auxiliary variables providing a satisfactory fit for many kinds of zzso the new zzso works efficiently despite the extreme zzso of very limited initial phase information into a much larger set of auxiliary zzso zzso The extension of this auxiliary variables set beyond the resolution of the observed data, which enhances the phase extension in a so-called zzso zzso zzso The use of the zzso symmetry as a new figure of merit and as a reliable test for the correctness of the zzso process allows an efficient zzso
