Observation of zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso zzso studies suggest the existence of a zzso zzso shape characteristic of zzso zzso 

Our study systematically assessed the global shape of proteins in a zzso database of zzso zzso complexes by measuring the distance of the surface zzso to the zzso center of zzso The results show that on average the binding site zzso are closer to the center of mass than the zzso surface zzso Thus, the study directly detects an important and simple zzso characteristic of protein zzso The results provide an insight into one of the fundamental properties of protein structure and zzso
