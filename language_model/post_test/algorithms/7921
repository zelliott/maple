The sequences of zzso and recovery of the heart have zzso and clinical zzso We report on progress made over the last years in the method that images these zzso based on an equivalent double layer on the zzso surface serving as the equivalent source of cardiac activity, with local zzso zzso zzso acting as their zzso The zzso wave forms were described zzso by timing zzso found by minimizing the difference between observed body surface zzso and those based on the source zzso The zzso zzso procedure involved is zzso and consequently requires the zzso of initial estimates of its zzso Those of the timing of zzso were based on the fastest route algorithm, taking into account properties of zzso propagation inside the zzso Those of recovery were based on zzso zzso Body surface zzso and individual geometry were recorded on: a healthy subject, a zzso patient and a zzso patient during an zzso provocation zzso In all three cases, the zzso estimated timing agreed entirely with available zzso zzso The improvements to the inverse procedure made are attributed to our use of initial estimates based on the general zzso of zzso The quality of the results and the required zzso time permit the application of this inverse procedure in a clinical zzso
