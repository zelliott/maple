Previously, we showed a source of error in blood flow zzso introduced by zzso flow using a zzso zzso response zzso zzso method measuring blood flow through the image plane of an zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso There is a zzso relationship between flow zzso and the zzso second moment of the zzso spectrum when flow is zzso to the image plane of a zzso zzso zzso However, this relationship changes in the presence of zzso flow, as zzso zzso shift and spread with varying zzso and zzso zzso These two effects increase the zzso spectral second moment, resulting in flow zzso However, by zzso the received signal with variable time delay from pulse to pulse zzso tilting the zzso zzso the zzso spectrum shifts back to direct current zzso and the zzso zzso method can be zzso We present a method to correct this zzso and accurately estimate blood flow through the image plane in real zzso Initially, the tilt delay needed to shift the zzso spectrum back to DC at each point within the flow field is zzso Knowing this tilt zzso a zzso zzso signal is obtained for the zzso component normal to the image plane, and its spectrum is estimated using a zzso That spectrum then is used to estimate the flow speed using a mapping function closely related to the zzso relationship between the zzso spectrum and flow speed observed for zzso zzso To accurately estimate flow angles, we modified the zzso algorithm, applying zzso filter zzso in a zzso arrangement and studying the zzso spectral energy as a function of zzso The zzso spectral estimate is constructed with the zzso output of eight narrow, zzso filters from a zzso Independent simulations show that, for blood slowing at angles between zzso degrees and zzso degrees at a speed of 300 zzso flow zzso would be overestimated by as much as zzso and zzso respectively, using the direct zzso zzso However, this error can be corrected using the modified method presented here, reducing the maximum zzso error by a factor of zzso and zzso for those angles, zzso Although the remaining error is not zzso the volume flow rate, calculated by zzso the flow zzso over the entire vessel zzso differs by only zzso or less from the true value over the angular range considered zzso This represents an improvement of a factor of 40 over zzso estimates at maximum flow zzso zzso the modified real-time method can zzso measure flow in most zzso applications in which the zzso image plane is not precisely zzso to the flow zzso
