Recently, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with local reconstruction zzso zzso methods have been introduced to reconstruct magnitude images from a series of highly zzso data while preserving high spatial and zzso resolution and high zzso ratio zzso in applications with zzso zzso However, these conventional zzso zzso are limited to the generation of magnitude images and, therefore, have limitations in their potential zzso In this work, the zzso zzso zzso has been modified to extend the use of zzso in the zzso family to applications that require processing of complex data, such as MR chemical shift imaging zzso or zzso zzso The proposed method processes the magnitude information the same way as in original zzso zzso zzso In addition, it improves the phase images by zzso the phase map of a zzso composite zzso The feasibility and efficiency of this zzso has been demonstrated on zzso of cortical bone, Achilles tendon, and a healthy volunteer on a clinical zzso zzso
