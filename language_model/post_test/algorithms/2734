To investigate highly temporally resolved zzso zzso with zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso of the hand as supplementary tool for dynamic assessment of zzso and vascular zzso in zzso zzso 

A zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution zzso time of acquisition 4 zzso of the predominantly affected hand of 17 patients with suspected zzso disease was acquired after contrast administration zzso zzso Imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As standard of reference, contrast enhanced non zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso These zzso sequences and the dynamic zzso zzso were separately assessed by two readers in consensus, recording the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signs of zzso and zzso zzso confidence was rated zzso zzso zzso zzso significance was tested using the zzso 

An zzso lower number of zzso zzso zzso zzso 89; zzso and only zzso cases with zzso were identified by the zzso For detected zzso diagnostic confidence was comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso post contrast: zzso In patients with high clinical activity dynamic zzso showed very early zzso zzso Only dynamic zzso detected 3 cases of zzso zzso confirmed with zzso 

zzso zzso fast detection of zzso Although dynamic zzso of the hand is inferior to zzso contrast enhanced sequences in assessing the number of zzso and zzso zzso its high zzso resolution allows for fast visual grading of disease activity and assessment of zzso without additional contrast material zzso
