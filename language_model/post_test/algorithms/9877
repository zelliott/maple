Cancer zzso contain many zzso gene zzso few that drive disease and many more that are zzso zzso We developed an zzso (the concept signature or zzso zzso that zzso biologically important zzso from zzso data by assessing their association with zzso zzso characteristic of cancer zzso including molecular zzso pathways and functional zzso Copy number data supported candidate zzso and suggested a zzso principle for zzso copy number aberrations in fusion zzso By analyzing lung cancer zzso sequencing and zzso data, we identified a novel zzso fusion in the zzso cell zzso Lung tissue zzso revealed 2 of 76 lung cancer patients with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso decreased proliferation and invasion of zzso zzso Together, these results present a systematic analysis of gene zzso in cancer and describe key characteristics that assist in new fusion zzso
