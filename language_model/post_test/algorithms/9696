The zzso Project was established in 1997 to develop tools to facilitate international collaboration in the zzso sciences and the sharing of biological models and experimental zzso The zzso language was developed to represent and exchange mathematical models of biological zzso zzso models can be very complicated, making it difficult to interpret the underlying physical and biological concepts and relationships zzso in the mathematical zzso 

To address this issue a set of zzso was developed to explicitly zzso the zzso concepts represented in the zzso zzso This article presents a framework that combines a visual language, together with zzso zzso to support the zzso of the underlying physical and biological concepts described by the mathematical model and also their relationships with the zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso assists in the interpretation of model concepts and zzso model communication and exchange between different zzso
