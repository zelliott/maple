Human daily activity recognition using mobile personal sensing technology plays a central role in the field of pervasive zzso One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements and the variety of styles when people perform a certain zzso To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing and sparse representation theory using zzso zzso zzso Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the training zzso The class membership of the activity signal is determined by solving a zzso zzso zzso We zzso validate the effectiveness of our sparse zzso approach by recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by 14 zzso Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of zzso which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor, zzso zzso and support zzso machine by as much as zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking for zzso zzso to achieve the best activity recognition performance is less important within our zzso
