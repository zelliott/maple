zzso evidence from multiple zzso is useful in zzso disease candidate genes for subsequent zzso We ranked all known human genes zzso under linkage zzso in the Irish Study of zzso zzso Families using three different evidence zzso 1) a zzso of zzso gene expression results using the Stanley Brain collection, 2) a schizophrenia zzso interaction network, and 3) a systematic literature zzso Each gene was assigned a zzso zzso and ranked after evaluating the evidence within each zzso For comparison to this ranking process, a large-scale candidate gene hypothesis was also tested by including genes with Gene zzso terms related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 167 genes from a custom zzso zzso array were used to evaluate the top ranked zzso hypothesis selected zzso zzso genes were both highly ranked and involved in zzso zzso 1) while 42 and 52 genes were exclusive to zzso zzso 2) or highly ranked zzso zzso zzso The most significant associations were observed in genes zzso zzso and zzso but no individual zzso were significant after correction for multiple zzso zzso of the approaches showed an excess of significant tests using the zzso zzso zzso Random selection of similar sized genes from two independent zzso association studies zzso of schizophrenia showed the excess was unlikely by zzso In a further zzso of three zzso zzso four candidate zzso reached nominal zzso Although gene ranking using integrated sources of prior information did not enrich for significant results in the current experiment, gene selection using an a zzso hypothesis zzso was superior to random zzso As such, further development of gene ranking strategies using more carefully selected sources of information is zzso
