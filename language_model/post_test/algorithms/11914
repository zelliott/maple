We present a zzso imaging method that describes the cell column in zzso zzso The zzso is an ideal template with which to examine cortical organization because it is a basic unit of function, complete in itself, which interacts with adjacent and distance columns to form more complex levels of zzso The subtle details of zzso anatomy should reflect zzso changes that have occurred in evolution as well as those that might be caused by zzso in the zzso In this semiautomatic method, images of zzso tissue are digitized or scanned into a computer imaging zzso The software detects the presence of cell columns and describes details of their zzso and of the surrounding zzso zzso are detected automatically on the basis of zzso and zzso areas using a zzso zzso A line is fit to the cell centers by least squares zzso The line becomes the center of the column from which the precise location of every cell can be zzso On this basis several zzso describe the distribution of cells from the center line and in relation to the available surrounding zzso Other zzso use cluster analyses to determine the spatial orientation of every zzso
