The difficulties associated with fabrication and zzso have limited the development of zzso ultrasound zzso zzso with a large number zzso zzso In previous work, we described a 5 zzso center frequency zzso zzso zzso that used two perpendicular zzso zzso for 3-D zzso zzso This design substantially reduces the channel count as well as fabrication complexity, which makes 3-D imaging more zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso are more commonly used in clinical applications or imaging targets near zzso such as the breast, carotid and musculoskeletal zzso In this paper, we present a zzso zzso zzso zzso array for 3-D zzso zzso A modified acoustic stack model was designed and zzso zzso elements were zzso to eliminate lateral zzso This zzso process made the zzso into a 2-2 composite material, which could help improve zzso sensitivity and zzso Full zzso 3-D data sets were acquired by zzso the zzso with a zzso zzso system zzso zzso 3-D zzso was then performed to obtain volumes of a zzso phantom and a zzso zzso The generalized zzso factor zzso was applied to improve the contrast of zzso zzso The measured zzso zzso fractional bandwidth of the zzso was zzso with a center frequency of zzso zzso The measured lateral zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, compared with a simulated zzso of zzso zzso
