The description of a lifting strategy is typically provided in qualitative zzso A quantitative zzso zzso or index zzso the starting postures but not the primary moving zzso This technical note proposes an index that zzso characterizes different dynamic zzso strategies employed during zzso plane zzso Dynamic lifting strategies are modeled in the zzso domain as different schemes of zzso zzso changes between the torso and leg zzso The index consists of two zzso assigned to two leg zzso zzso their contributions relative to the zzso Given a measured lifting movement, its index parameters values, ranging from zzso to 10, are estimated through an zzso search process with the objective of minimizing the fitting zzso The use of this index is illustrated by applying it to 24 lifting movements performed by six subjects assuming either a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso indicate that a lifting strategy, in terms of whether the leg or the back is generally the prime zzso can be differentiated and zzso using this simple zzso zzso In addition, zzso intermediate strategies are also zzso as the involvement of each segment in a lifting movement is zzso The index is however limited in that it does not accommodate arm motion contributions to a lift nor possible zzso strategic changes during a zzso Potential future applications include zzso movement prediction and simulation for computerized zzso or zzso zzso
