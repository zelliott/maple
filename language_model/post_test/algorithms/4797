We report on the zzso mechanical properties of a statistically zzso zzso zzso network zzso by zzso containing numerous small unfolding zzso such as the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso We show that the inclusion of such proteins has a dramatic effect on the large strain behavior of the zzso Beyond a strain zzso which depends on network density, the unfolding of protein zzso leads to bulk zzso zzso Past this critical strain, the network spontaneously organizes itself so that an appreciable fraction of the zzso zzso are at the threshold of domain zzso We discuss via a simple zzso model the cause of this network organization and suggest that it may be the source of zzso relaxation observed in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso We present data which fully justify our model for a simplified network zzso
