zzso zzso proteins is an important task for designing stable protein engineering in interested zzso In this work, we develop a simple but efficient method to zzso zzso proteins from zzso ones using the zzso acid and zzso zzso Since most of the zzso acid and zzso compositions are zzso we propose a new forward floating selection technique to select only a useful subset of these compositions as features for support zzso zzso zzso We test the proposed method on a benchmark data set of zzso zzso and 793 zzso zzso The results show that our method using 28 zzso acid and zzso compositions achieves an accuracy rate of zzso evaluated by the zzso zzso test, which is higher not only than the existing methods but also than using all zzso acid and zzso zzso
