zzso zzso make it challenging to identify proteins in complex zzso by zzso zzso half of the zzso collected are zzso zzso even when high-resolution tandem mass zzso is zzso zzso zzso are generated from the zzso of different zzso zzso and it is often difficult to distinguish zzso precursors of these peptides from each zzso 

In this paper, we propose a peak intensity zzso zzso peak determination zzso zzso to distinguish different zzso precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso clusters are detected by the edge features of the zzso peak intensity zzso For multiple overlapping clusters grouped as one zzso zzso zzso can be detected by an advanced zzso of the similarity between the estimated and the experimental zzso distribution based on the zzso peak intensity zzso 

zzso mass zzso zzso acquired from zzso of 30 synthetic peptides and zzso of 18 proteins were used to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of zzso The results indicate that zzso can recognize zzso precursors from the zzso zzso containing zzso and overlapping zzso zzso Compared to several published zzso zzso identifies approximately zzso more zzso and has fewer false zzso 

The results on standard zzso and actual samples demonstrated that zzso could notably improve the successful identification rates of the zzso by identifying more zzso zzso and of the identified zzso approximately zzso are zzso zzso This novel zzso will help to interpret zzso produced by shotgun strategy in zzso
