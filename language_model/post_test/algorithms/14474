zzso fingerprint identification is of critical importance to law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects: zzso fingerprints are zzso impressions left by fingers on surfaces of zzso While tremendous progress has been made in plain and rolled fingerprint matching, zzso fingerprint matching continues to be a difficult zzso Poor quality of zzso impressions, small finger area, and large zzso distortion are the main difficulties in zzso fingerprint matching compared to plain or rolled fingerprint zzso We propose a system for matching zzso fingerprints found at crime scenes to rolled fingerprints enrolled in law enforcement zzso In addition to zzso we also use extended features, including zzso zzso quality map, zzso flow map, zzso wavelength map, and zzso We tested our system by matching 258 zzso in the zzso zzso database against a background database of zzso rolled fingerprints obtained by combining the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso baseline zzso identification rate of zzso percent was improved to 74 percent when extended features were zzso In order to evaluate the relative importance of each extended feature, these features were zzso used in the order of their cost in marking by zzso zzso The experimental results indicate that zzso zzso quality map, and zzso flow map are the most effective features in improving the matching zzso
