zzso approximation is an important zzso problem in signal and image processing zzso A zzso system of integrate and fire zzso zzso is proposed as a solution, using the zzso Competitive Algorithm zzso to solve an zzso zzso sparse approximation zzso A zzso system architecture is zzso including IF zzso with a zzso firing function, and zzso zzso to provide linear zzso A network of 18 zzso with 12 zzso is implemented on the zzso zzso a Field zzso zzso zzso zzso with directly zzso floating gate zzso Said system uses over zzso floating gates, the largest system programmed on a zzso to zzso The circuit successfully reproduced the zzso of a digital zzso program, zzso to within zzso zzso and an objective cost only zzso higher on zzso The active circuit consumed zzso of current at zzso and zzso on solutions in zzso with measurement of the zzso spike rate taking an additional zzso zzso the zzso trends to a zzso zzso system, the zzso zzso compares favorably with state-of-the-art digital solutions, and analog solutions using a zzso zzso
