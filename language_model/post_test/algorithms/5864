Heart rate zzso zzso is a major zzso technique for evaluating the zzso nervous system zzso Use of zzso approach to analyze zzso allows investigating the zzso behavior from the power zzso as a function of time, in both zzso and non zzso Power zzso are examined mainly in the zzso and the zzso zzso Traditionally, constant boundaries are chosen to determine the frequency bands of zzso However, these ranges are individual, and can be strongly affected by zzso conditions zzso position, breathing zzso In order to determine the dynamic boundaries of the frequency bands more accurately, especially during zzso challenges, we developed an zzso for the detection of individual zzso spectral boundaries zzso The zzso was tested on recordings from a series of standard zzso maneuvers with rest periods between them, and the response to stand was compared to the known zzso zzso A major advantage of the zzso is the ability to reliably define the zzso range, which provides the potential to investigate the zzso importance of this zzso
