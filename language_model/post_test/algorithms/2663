Many biomedical applications require detection of zzso structures in images and would benefit from automatic or semiautomatic zzso to allow zzso zzso Here, we propose a zzso approach to identify zzso structures based on oriented phase zzso zzso the phase zzso zzso zzso We show that the proposed method is largely insensitive to intensity variations along the curve and provides successful detection within noisy zzso The performance of the zzso is evaluated by comparing it with state-of-the-art zzso approaches on both synthetic and real biological zzso
