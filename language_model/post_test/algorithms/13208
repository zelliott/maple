zzso sequencing is a mainstay for the identification of gene zzso used in molecular diagnostic zzso However, in zzso zzso disorders, failure of zzso amplification can occur for a variety of reasons, leading zzso zzso to appear zzso We sought to investigate the frequency at which apparently zzso zzso detected by zzso sequencing in our laboratory appeared zzso due to other molecular zzso 

A review of zzso cases from 40 different genetic tests that were submitted to the Medical zzso zzso at zzso College of Medicine for zzso sequence analysis was zzso The molecular status of apparently zzso cases was further investigated by testing parents using various zzso 

A total of zzso cases of apparent zzso were identified, ranging from 0 to 37% of the total per zzso One-third of the apparently zzso cases were followed up by parental zzso zzso carrier status was confirmed in zzso of the zzso Of the cases in which parental carrier status could not be confirmed, deletions encompassing point zzso zzso dropout due to zzso zzso at primer sites, and zzso zzso were zzso 

For individuals with zzso zzso disorders and apparently zzso zzso confirmation by parental testing can rule out other causes of apparent zzso including zzso zzso copy number variations, and zzso zzso
