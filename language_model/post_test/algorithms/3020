A model is presented for the zzso synthesis of semiconductor zzso capturing the reactions underlying nucleation and growth zzso The model combines an zzso mechanism for precursor conversion to zzso discrete rate equations for formation of zzso zzso and continuous zzso equation for growth of zzso zzso The model allows us to track the zzso evolution of the entire cluster size distribution and zzso several experimental zzso including mean size and size zzso The model predicts five distinct zzso generation of zzso small cluster formation, size distribution focusing due to precursor zzso zzso steady state region, and size distribution zzso with the latter three explicitly zzso available experimental data at larger cluster zzso Furthermore, we identify two zzso zzso combinations and discuss how these can be used to guide experiments to yield a more rational approach to synthesis zzso zzso to the common hypothesis that diffusion is essential for size distribution zzso the model shows that focusing can be achieved under pure reaction zzso In addition, the model yields new insights into the synthesis of small zzso with narrow size zzso either by zzso of temperature over the duration of zzso synthesis or by introduction of small quantities of zzso that enhance the rate of precursor conversion to zzso We show that for a given set of reaction zzso there is an optimum in the duration of high temperature and additive concentration minimizing zzso
