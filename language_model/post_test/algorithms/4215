During the last two decades a large number of zzso methods have been developed for predicting zzso protein zzso Current zzso rely on zzso signals in the protein zzso such as the distribution of positively charged zzso in zzso zzso and the existence of zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso are zzso modifications zzso that occur in a zzso manner and therefore the presence of a zzso or zzso site in a zzso protein provides zzso zzso We examine the combination of zzso and zzso site prediction with zzso protein zzso zzso We report the development of a Hidden zzso Model based method, capable of predicting the zzso of zzso proteins and the existence of zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso sites along the protein zzso Our method zzso a novel feature in zzso protein zzso zzso which results in improved performance for zzso prediction and reliable prediction of zzso and zzso zzso The method is freely available at zzso
