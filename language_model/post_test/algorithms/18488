zzso image noise is shown to be an important step in the automatic detection of zzso in digital zzso This study extends a well established zzso noise zzso scheme developed by zzso et zzso for application to zzso digital mammogram zzso zzso A simple noise model is determined based on the assumption that quantum noise is dominant in direct digital X-ray zzso zzso of the noise as a function of the gray level is improved by calculating the noise statistics using a truncated distribution zzso Experimental support for the quantum noise assumption is presented for a set of step wedge phantom zzso Performance of the noise zzso technique is also tested as a zzso stage to a zzso detection zzso It is shown that the square root model based approach which zzso allows leads to a robust zzso of the high frequency image zzso This provides better zzso detection performance when compared to the zzso noise zzso method developed by zzso zzso better results are obtained than when noise zzso is zzso A database of 124 direct digital mammogram images containing 28 zzso clusters was used for evaluation of the zzso
