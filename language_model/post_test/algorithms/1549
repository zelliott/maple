zzso interface zzso devices make errors in zzso zzso these errors online from zzso activity can improve zzso performance by zzso the decoding zzso and by correcting the errors zzso Here, we study the zzso zzso of two different types of errors which can both be employed in zzso zzso the execution error, due to inaccurate decoding of the subjects' movement zzso zzso the outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of the zzso We demonstrate that, in zzso zzso recordings from the surface of the human brain, strong zzso neural responses zzso for both types of errors can be zzso zzso were present in the low and high frequency components of the zzso signals, with both signal components carrying partially independent zzso Moreover, the observed zzso can be used to discriminate between error types, with high accuracy zzso obtained already from single zzso zzso We found zzso in multiple cortical areas, including motor and zzso zzso As the motor zzso is the primary target area for recording control signals for a zzso an zzso motor zzso utilizing these error signals may not require additional zzso implants in other brain zzso
