We demonstrate warm target zzso zzso momentum zzso for the fragmentation dynamics of the warm hydrogen molecules at room zzso The zzso movement effect of the warm zzso is removed by using a correction zzso in the momentum zzso Based on the reconstructed three-dimensional momentum zzso as well as the kinetic energy release zzso different zzso states of the zzso ground state are clearly visible and the zzso separation for charge resonance enhanced zzso of the second electron is zzso The results show adequate accordance with the former experiments using other zzso
