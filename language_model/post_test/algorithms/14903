A substantial body of evidence indicates that both humans and wildlife suffer adverse health effects from exposure to environmental chemicals that are capable of interacting with the zzso zzso The recent cloning of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso suggests that the selective effects of zzso compounds may arise in part by the control of different zzso of zzso promoters by the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to identify the structural zzso for zzso binding and to discriminate zzso and zzso in terms of their zzso zzso Comparative zzso Field Analysis zzso was employed to construct a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso model on a data set of 31 zzso compounds for which competitive binding affinities have been measured against both zzso and zzso zzso alignment of the molecules in zzso was achieved by maximizing overlap of their zzso and zzso fields using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The final zzso models, generated by zzso the calculated zzso zzso and zzso fields with the zzso observed binding affinities using partial zzso zzso regression, exhibited excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as high internal zzso ability zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso values of zzso for a test set of compounds outside of the training set were consistent with experimental zzso These zzso models can serve as guides for the rational design of zzso zzso that possess preferential binding affinities for either zzso or zzso These models can also prove useful in risk assessment programs to identify real or suspected zzso
