We present a method of locating edges in zzso images which operates in frequency space on the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of a block containing a straight edge, the method yields an equation for the edge in a fraction of the operations needed to zzso and transform the zzso to zzso zzso As a sample application of this method, we present a technique for alleviating ringing artifacts in zzso zzso
