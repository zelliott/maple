In this paper, we propose an approach for zzso discrete zzso field zzso based on the Green function and zzso zzso The method is inspired by discrete Hodge zzso such that a discrete zzso field can be broken down into three simpler zzso zzso zzso zzso and harmonic zzso We show that the Green zzso zzso zzso can be used to approximate the zzso and the zzso components to achieve our goal of the zzso field zzso The final zzso zzso that represent the boundaries of the influence region of zzso are obtained from the optimal zzso field zzso These zzso are composed of zzso smooth contours or zzso Our method is zzso to both linear and zzso discrete zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso obtained using our approach essentially agree with human zzso zzso
