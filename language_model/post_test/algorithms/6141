Conventional zzso cell zzso zzso accounts for most of the deaths due to kidney zzso zzso stage, grade, and patient performance status are used currently to predict survival after zzso Our goal was to identify gene expression features, using comprehensive gene expression zzso that correlate with zzso 

Gene expression profiles were determined in 177 primary zzso using DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso into five gene expression zzso zzso zzso was correlated with survival in long-term follow-up and was independent of grade, stage, and performance zzso The tumors were then divided evenly into training and test sets that were balanced for grade, stage, performance status, and length of zzso A zzso learning zzso zzso principal components zzso was applied to identify transcripts whose expression was associated with survival in the training set, and the performance of this gene zzso survival predictor was assessed using the test zzso With this method, we identified 259 genes that accurately predicted zzso survival among patients in the independent validation group zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, the gene expression predictor was a strong predictor of survival independent of tumor stage, grade, and performance status zzso zzso zzso 

zzso displays molecular zzso and can be separated into gene expression zzso that correlate with survival after zzso We have identified a set of 259 genes that predict survival after surgery independent of clinical zzso zzso
