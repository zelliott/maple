To present a new method of zzso lens zzso power calculation that takes into account the zzso variation in lens zzso 

Department of zzso zzso zzso 

Information on exact zzso design is derived from the manufacturers' cutting zzso These data were built into an zzso calculation formula based on exact ray tracing and zzso zzso All zzso are zzso 

The method is zzso correct as all zzso surfaces are characterized with respect to both position and zzso zzso In simulation models, the zzso and the zzso formulas performed similarly, while the zzso formula predicted higher zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

It is possible to incorporate the exact zzso design into an zzso power calculation zzso zzso the zzso formula should increase the accuracy of zzso power zzso however, this has yet to be proved from empirical zzso The formula provides an advantage in analysis of zzso zzso for zzso purposes because all zzso distances and powers may be measured or zzso
