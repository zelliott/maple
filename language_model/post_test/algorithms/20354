zzso zzso based on a constant Q transform have been calculated for 28 short zzso zzso zzso sounds and 52 short saxophone zzso These were used as features in a pattern analysis to determine for each of these sounds zzso the test set whether it belongs to the zzso or to the zzso zzso The training set consisted of longer sounds of 1 zzso or more for each of the zzso A zzso zzso was used to calculate clusters for the training data, and zzso probability density functions were formed from the mean and zzso of each of the zzso Each member of the test set was then analyzed to determine the probability that it belonged to each of the two zzso and a zzso decision rule was invoked to assign it to one of the zzso zzso have been extremely good and are compared to a human perception experiment identifying a subset of these same zzso
