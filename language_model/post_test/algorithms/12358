Biotechnology production of zzso is an excellent alternative to the industrial chemical process for the production of this zzso In this work the behavior of zzso zzso zzso was studied when crucial process variables were zzso The zzso (between 18 and zzso and the initial cell mass (between 4 and 10 zzso were considered as control zzso A response surface methodology was applied to the experimental design to study the resulting effect when the control variables were zzso A zzso model was developed and used to determine an optimal value that was further validated zzso The optimal values determined for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, leading to maximum values for productivity zzso zzso and zzso yield zzso zzso
