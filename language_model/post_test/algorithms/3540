Evidence suggests that the rate at which intravenous zzso are infused may influence their zzso site zzso The authors used five different rates of zzso administration to test the hypothesis that different sedation zzso occur at the same effect site zzso zzso independent of the infusion zzso The authors zzso evaluated the automated responsiveness monitor zzso against other sedation measures and the zzso effect site zzso 

With Human Studies Committee approval, 18 healthy volunteers received five consecutive zzso zzso zzso During each infusion, the effect site concentration was increased by a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso Index and zzso were recorded at frequent zzso The times of syringe drop and loss and recovery of responsiveness were zzso zzso and zzso modeling was performed using zzso 

When the correct rate of zzso site zzso was determined for each individual zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso time to peak effect zzso zzso zzso the effect site zzso associated with each clinical measure were not affected by the rate of increase of effect site zzso zzso zzso correlated with all clinical measures of drug zzso zzso invariably stopped responding to zzso at lower effect site zzso zzso than those associated with loss of zzso 

: zzso zzso combined with real-time zzso measures of drug effect, may provide a means to zzso zzso modeling during zzso drug zzso zzso seems useful as an automated measure of sedation and may provide the basis for automated monitoring and zzso of sedation for a zzso delivery zzso
