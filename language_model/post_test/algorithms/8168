In this study, we explored different statistical approaches to identify the best zzso to predict zzso utility scores from the zzso 25 in patients with age-related zzso zzso zzso 

zzso least squares zzso zzso and censored least absolute zzso zzso approaches were compared using zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at screening from a phase zzso clinical trial in patients with zzso Three models were specified in this zzso full (includes all 12 dimensions of the zzso zzso short (includes only the general health dimension and the composite zzso and reduced model zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso accuracy of the models, the mean absolute prediction error zzso mean error, and root means squared error were calculated using zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso and zzso validation using an independent zzso zzso zzso zzso The model that provided the lowest prediction errors was chosen as the best zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso validation consistently demonstrated that, compared to other approaches, zzso zzso produced the lowest zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso for the full model, while zzso performed best for the short and reduced models zzso values were zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso assumptions of both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso however, can accommodate these particular zzso 

The zzso model is recommended for producing the zzso utility scores when only the zzso 25 data are zzso
