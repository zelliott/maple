The purpose of this paper is to present a method for the selection of inverse planning parameters and to establish a set of inverse planning parameters zzso zzso for the inverse planning included in a commercial permanent prostate implant treatment planning zzso The manual planning of more than 750 patients since 1996 led to the establishment of general treatment planning zzso A class solution is tuned to fulfill the treatment planning rules and generate equivalent zzso For ten patients, the inverse planning is compared with manual planning performed by our experienced zzso The prostate volumes ranged from 17 to 51 zzso and are implanted with low activity zzso zzso zzso zzso are calculated for zzso The inverse planning needed about 15 s for each zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso In comparison, the physicist needed about 20 zzso to perform each manual zzso A class solution is found that consistently produces zzso zzso equivalent or better than the manual zzso Moreover, even with strict seed placement rules, the inverse planning can produce adequate prostate dose coverage and organ at risk zzso The inverse planning avoids implant with seeds outside of the prostate and too close to the zzso It also avoids needles with only one seed and needles with three consecutive zzso This reduces the risk of complication due to seed zzso and zzso The inverse planning also uses a smaller number of needles, reducing the cause of zzso The quality of the treatment plans is independent of the zzso size and zzso A class solution is established that consistently and rapidly produces equivalent zzso zzso as manual planning while respecting severe seed placement zzso The class solution can be used as a starting point for every patient, dramatically reducing the time needed to plan individual patient zzso The class solution works with inverse zzso zzso inverse zzso and zzso real-time zzso This technology is not intended to replace the physicist but to accelerate the planning process, making zzso treatment planning more zzso
