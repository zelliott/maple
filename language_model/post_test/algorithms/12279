zzso techniques for assessing zzso quality in order to predict male fertility are still zzso The principal objective of this experiment was to evaluate routine laboratory evaluation and in zzso zzso zzso techniques as zzso of relative zzso fertility using a zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso were evaluated during a zzso zzso period, beginning at zzso zzso of zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso diluted to zzso billion zzso in 50 zzso zzso and used to breed zzso zzso over the same zzso On nine occasions, a specific zzso of the zzso first zzso fraction was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso differed zzso consistently for pregnancy rate (from 73 to zzso zzso rate zzso and total born zzso zzso zzso evaluation and zzso parameters that presented significant differences between zzso but no differences in time and no zzso by time interaction, were used to correlate in zzso zzso A multiple zzso model based on routine zzso evaluation parameters accounted for up to 27 and zzso of the variation of fertility index and total zzso born, respectively, whereas male zzso formation rate was the zzso variable that accounted for 17 and zzso of the variation in zzso rate and fertility index, zzso zzso we zzso that the use of low zzso numbers for zzso determination of pregnancy rate at Day 30, zzso of extended zzso after 7 and zzso and specific zzso parameters may be useful for identifying relatively zzso zzso that are not currently excluded from use in existing commercial zzso zzso
