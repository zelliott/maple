zzso zzso of PET imaging data is required for a useful interpretation of the measured radioactive zzso zzso The partial volume effect zzso describes signal dilution and mixing due to spatial resolution and sampling limitations, which introduces bias in quantitative zzso In the present study we investigated the magnitude of zzso for volumes of interest zzso in the rat brain and the effect of zzso zzso In simulated zzso studies we examined the influence of zzso on time activity zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and binding potential zzso The performance of partial volume correction zzso was studied using the zzso geometric transfer zzso zzso method including the question of whether a zzso zzso point spread function zzso is necessary for zzso of a rat brain close to the zzso of the field of zzso Furthermore, we determined the effect of zzso from activity outside the zzso The results confirmed that zzso is significant in rat brain PET and showed that zzso range is an important factor that needs to be included in the zzso There was considerable bias in time activity zzso for the simulated zzso studies and significant zzso of binding potential even for very small zzso zzso Good activity recovery was achieved with the zzso zzso using a zzso zzso simulated zzso when no activity was present outside the zzso zzso using a simple zzso fit point spread function was not sufficiently zzso zzso from regions outside the brain had a significant impact on measured activity zzso and reduced the accuracy of zzso with the zzso method using rat brain regions alone, except for the smallest zzso size but at the cost of increased zzso zzso partial volume correction methods which inherently compensate for zzso from outside the brain might be a more suitable zzso
