A zzso imaging technique to investigate zzso joint zzso of elbows undergoing zzso zzso is zzso This technique, which employed landmark registration and a previously developed zzso distance algorithm, was validated zzso zzso obtained with this imaging technique were validated in a single zzso by comparing the resulting joint zzso maps to results obtained with experimental casting in a zzso zzso Additionally, the accuracy of the registration technique was assessed in four specimens using zzso and target registration error to evaluate the zzso and angular zzso zzso data from an intact zzso elbow was shown to demonstrate the utility of this zzso The overall accuracy of the registration was better than zzso and the zzso maps showed excellent correspondence with the zzso zzso the use of a zzso imaging technique to examine the zzso of zzso undergoing zzso zzso
