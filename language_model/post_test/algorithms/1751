zzso modeling of random searches is designed to be robust to the sampling rate while the spatial model is required to be of zzso type, which is often zzso zzso Such zzso difficulty may be zzso by employing a model with independent zzso We demonstrate that its disadvantages in statistical properties are blurred under lower zzso We propose a quantitative criterion for choice of the sampling rate at which a spatial model with independent components resembles a zzso zzso Our findings have the potential to assist the observer to employ simpler models in the zzso framework to avoid expensive zzso required for statistical zzso
