The problem of defining a decision rule which takes into account performance constraints and zzso rejection is zzso in a general zzso In the proposed zzso the problem is defined using three kinds of zzso The first is the cost to be zzso which defines the objective function, the second are the decision options, determined by the admissible assignment classes or zzso of classes, and the third are the performance zzso The optimal decision rule within the statistical decision theory framework is obtained by solving the stated zzso zzso Two examples are provided to illustrate the zzso and the decision rule is zzso
