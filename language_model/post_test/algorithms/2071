We propose an zzso that zzso a digitized color image so as to simulate for normal observers the appearance of the image for people who have zzso forms of color zzso The zzso color zzso are deduced from zzso and the residual hues in the transformed image are derived from the reports of unilateral zzso described in the zzso We represent color stimuli as zzso in a three-dimensional zzso space, and the simulation zzso is expressed in terms of transformations of this zzso The zzso replaces each stimulus by its projection onto a reduced stimulus zzso This surface is defined by a neutral axis and by the zzso locations of those zzso stimuli that are perceived as the same hue by normal zzso and a given type of zzso These zzso stimuli were a yellow of zzso zzso and a blue of 475 zzso for the zzso and zzso simulations, and a red of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The operation of the zzso is demonstrated with a mosaic of square color zzso A zzso and a zzso accepted the match between the original and the appropriate image, confirming that the reduction is zzso zzso Although we can never be certain of zzso zzso the simulation provides a means of zzso and illustrating the residual color information available to zzso in any digitized zzso
