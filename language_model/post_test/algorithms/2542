The pulmonary artery zzso wall, which has much higher zzso zzso and zzso void space and approximately zzso the normal zzso pressure of systemic arteries zzso zzso carotid zzso is rarely zzso except under pulmonary zzso This study zzso a detailed, zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport model for the PA to investigate differences in zzso transport processes between the zzso zzso and the relatively resistant zzso The PA and zzso models are similar in wall structure, but very different in zzso values, many of which have been measured (and therefore zzso since the original zzso model of Huang et zzso zzso Both PA and zzso model simulations fit experimental data on zzso LDL concentration profiles and on the growth of isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso spots with circulation time very zzso They reveal that zzso entering the zzso attains a much higher zzso than media concentration but distributes better between these regions in the PA than zzso and that zzso in both regions contributes to observed zzso zzso Solutions show why both the overall zzso water flow and spot growth rates are similar in these vessels despite very different material transport zzso Since early zzso zzso occurs in the zzso zzso and since zzso zzso reaction zzso depend on zzso zzso the lower zzso zzso zzso in the PA zzso zzso likely lead to slower zzso of bound zzso in the zzso These findings may be relevant to understanding the different zzso of these zzso
