While the acquisition of projection data in a zzso zzso zzso scanner is generally zzso out once, the projection data is often removed from the system, making further reconstruction with a different reconstruction filter zzso The reconstruction kernel is one of the most important zzso To have access to all the zzso either prior reconstructions with multiple kernels must be performed or the projection data must be zzso Each of these requirements would increase the burden on data zzso This study aimed to design an effective method to achieve similar image quality using an image filtering technique in the image space, instead of a reconstruction filter in the projection space for CT zzso The authors evaluated the clinical feasibility of the proposed method in lung cancer zzso 

The proposed technique is essentially the same as common image zzso which performs processing in the zzso domain with a filter zzso However, the filter function was determined based on the quantitative analysis of the point spread functions zzso measured in the zzso The zzso transfer functions zzso were derived from the zzso and the ratio of the zzso was used as the filter zzso zzso using an image reconstructed with a zzso an image reconstructed with a different kernel was obtained by zzso which used the ratio of the zzso obtained for the two zzso The performance of the method was evaluated by using routine clinical images obtained from CT screening for lung cancer in five zzso 

zzso images for all combinations of three types of reconstruction kernels zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed good agreement with original reconstructed images regarded as the gold zzso On the filtered images, abnormal shadows suspected as being lung zzso were identical to those on the reconstructed zzso The standard zzso zzso for the difference between filtered images and reconstructed images ranged from zzso to zzso zzso units for all kernel combinations; these zzso were much smaller than the noise zzso in the reconstructed zzso 

The proposed method has good performance and is clinically feasible in lung cancer zzso This method can be applied to images reconstructed on any scanner by measuring the zzso in each zzso
