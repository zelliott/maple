We introduce a new system, called zzso for predicting zzso which predicts individual zzso using two related zzso In this system, we build a hidden zzso model to identify zzso In the hidden zzso model, we propose joint probability models of zzso in zzso zzso sites, zzso zzso and zzso regions by exploiting the zzso between related zzso In order to reduce the false positive rate of the hidden zzso model, we develop a screening process which is able to identify zzso zzso We then build a zzso by combining the statistics from the hidden zzso model and the screening zzso We implement zzso on zzso sequence zzso The source codes are available at zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso and zzso zzso is substantially more powerful in identifying zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso zzso zzso were zzso as well as slightly more powerful in identifying zzso zzso zzso more zzso zzso were zzso at a similar or lower false positive rate, with less computing time and with less memory zzso zzso zzso is also capable of finding new potential zzso
