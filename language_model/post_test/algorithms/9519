In the field of cardiac MR image zzso active zzso models, or snakes have been extensively used, zzso to their promising results and to the numerous extensions proposed to improve their zzso This paper explores a methodology for evaluating cardiac MR image zzso zzso which zzso the distance between computer-generated and the zzso zzso zzso This metric was applied to various external force extensions of the traditional zzso since no systematic comparison has been zzso 

zzso zzso from six patients were zzso Imaging was performed on a zzso T MR scanner with zzso balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso performances were established for traditional zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso zzso The use of a zzso with zzso zzso filtering was also compared to zzso zzso 

zzso between manual and zzso zzso was satisfactory for ejection fraction for every zzso zzso However zzso and zzso volumes were systematically zzso 

The developed regional error metric provided a more rigorous evaluation of the zzso schemes in comparison to the classical derived parameters based on left zzso volume zzso usually used in functional cardiac MR zzso These derived parameters can zzso mask local zzso zzso
