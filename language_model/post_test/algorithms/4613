Multiple description coding can be implemented as zzso and zzso to all standards for image and video communications, with obvious zzso This can be achieved by generating two zzso from the original zzso a zzso amount of extra zzso between the descriptions has to be inserted to help the zzso of the possibly lost description from the received zzso This zzso can be in the form of spatial zzso In this paper, we propose and develop a mathematical framework for two descriptions zzso and zzso methods, which exploit the correlation characteristics of the visual data in order to better implement the multiple description coding zzso zzso results show a noticeable performance improvement of both the proposed methods with respect to zzso art zzso in terms of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
