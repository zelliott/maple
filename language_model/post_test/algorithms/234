With the emergence of zzso alongside large-scale zzso association studies zzso we will soon be in the enviable situation of obtaining precise estimates of population zzso zzso for zzso which make up the panels in standard zzso zzso such as those produced from zzso and zzso For disease association studies it is well known that for rare diseases with known population minor zzso zzso zzso a zzso design is most zzso That is, for a fixed budget the optimal procedure is to zzso only cases zzso In such tests zzso look for a divergence from zzso distribution in cases from that of the known population zzso in order to test the zzso hypothesis of no association between the disease status and the zzso zzso However, what has not been previously characterized is the utility of controls zzso zzso when zzso In this study we consider zzso and zzso statistical methods for testing for zzso zzso association when population zzso are known and when both cases and controls are zzso We demonstrate that for rare diseases the most powerful zzso design is, somewhat zzso to actively discard the controls even though they contain information on the zzso In contrast we develop a zzso test which uses all available information zzso and zzso and appears to exhibit zzso greater power than all zzso methods we zzso
