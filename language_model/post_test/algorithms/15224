A new zzso to trace zzso transitions in proteins is zzso The method uses discrete molecular dynamics as engine to sample protein zzso zzso A multiple zzso zzso potential energy function is used in combination with several enhancing sampling strategies, such as zzso Maxwell Demon molecular dynamics and essential zzso The method, which shows an unprecedented zzso efficiency, is able to trace a wide range of known experimental zzso zzso to simpler methods our strategy does not introduce zzso in the chemical structure of the protein and is able to reproduce well complex zzso zzso zzso The method, called zzso can easily introduce additional restraints to the transition zzso of zzso known zzso known maintained zzso zzso and is freely distributed to the community through the Spanish National zzso Institute zzso
