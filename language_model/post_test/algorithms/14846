We present a zzso acoustic inverse scattering zzso designed specifically for zzso breast zzso At zzso zzso the image domain is roughly tens to hundreds of zzso zzso where zzso is the smallest wavelength in the transmit signal zzso The expected range of contrasts for the breast imaging problem for density, zzso and zzso loss is zzso zzso of the zzso Because of the low contrast, Born zzso provide the basic structure of the inverse scattering zzso However, we use a zzso zzso least squares cost function in place of the basic least squares cost function to estimate the contrast zzso This cost function provides physically meaningful zzso based on a zzso knowledge of the zzso Also, due to the size of the imaging domain and because the objects to be zzso are low contrast and zzso we use the Neumann series solution as the forward zzso The largest domain zzso in simulation was 50 zzso zzso 50 zzso in zzso
