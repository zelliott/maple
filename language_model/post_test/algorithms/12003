The experiments reported in this study constitute a preliminary investigation into the possible zzso effect of the Jamaican zzso zzso zzso zzso were conducted in a random and blind fashion on two zzso species of zzso zzso Both the pulp and the peel were examined for zzso zzso zzso extracts were prepared from these components of the fruit and injected into zzso zzso Various cardiovascular parameters were measured including heart rate, mean zzso pressure zzso and several zzso zzso We report that all extracts tested produced a fall in blood pressure with little change in zzso zzso zzso B produced the least change in heart rate with a fall in zzso of approximately 23 zzso Changes in heart rate with all extracts appeared to be minimal as an zzso value could only be determined for extract A, and zzso values could not be evaluated for extracts C and zzso The zzso by which these extracts produce their zzso effects could not be determined in these preliminary zzso However, it appears not to involve direct effects on cardiac zzso This conclusion is based on the finding that it took a minimum of 10 to 15 seconds for the zzso action to manifest post zzso Future experiments will be aimed at zzso the zzso involved in decreasing zzso
