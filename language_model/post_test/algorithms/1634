The regulatory mechanisms underlying zzso zzso are complex, especially as it is partly controlled by other hormones and the combined action of multiple zzso Regulatory relations between hormones are not directly zzso but may be deduced from time series zzso of plasma hormone zzso Variation in plasma hormone levels are the zzso of zzso and clearance from the zzso A strategy is proposed to extract zzso zzso thresholds and zzso zzso from concentration data, using particular association zzso Time delayed associations between hormone zzso and/or extracted zzso pulse profiles reveal the information on regulatory zzso The above mentioned regulatory mechanisms are illustrated with simulated zzso Additionally, data from a lean cohort of healthy control subjects is used to illustrate zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in real zzso The simulation and the real data both consist of 145 zzso samples per individual, matching a 24-hr time span with 10 minute zzso The results of the simulation and the real data are in zzso
