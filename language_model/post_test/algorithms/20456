To determine whether zzso zzso oxide zzso therapy can zzso the progression of lung disease in acute zzso respiratory failure, we performed a zzso randomized, zzso controlled study of the effects of prolonged zzso therapy on zzso We hypothesized that zzso therapy would improve zzso in an acute manner, slow the rate of decline in gas exchange, and decrease the number of patients who meet zzso zzso failure zzso 

A total of 108 children zzso age zzso zzso with severe acute zzso respiratory failure from 7 centers were zzso After consent was zzso patients were zzso to treatment with zzso (10 zzso or mechanical ventilation alone for at least 72 zzso Patients with an zzso index zzso for 3 hours or zzso for 6 hours were considered treatment failures and exited the zzso 

Patient age, primary diagnosis, pediatric risk of mortality score, mode of zzso and median zzso index (35 zzso 22 vs 30 zzso 15; zzso vs zzso mean zzso zzso were not different between groups at study zzso Comparisons of zzso indexes during the first 12 hours demonstrated an acute improvement in zzso in the zzso group at 4 hours zzso vs zzso mean values; P zzso and at 12 hours zzso vs zzso P zzso At 12 hours zzso of the control group met failure criteria in contrast with zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso During prolonged therapy the failure rate was reduced in the zzso group in patients whose entry zzso index was zzso zzso zzso and in zzso patients zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso causes an acute improvement in zzso in children with severe zzso Two zzso zzso and an entry oxygen index zzso appear to have a more sustained improvement in zzso and we speculate that these zzso may benefit from prolonged zzso
