Enhancement characteristics after administration of a contrast agent are regarded as a major criterion for differential diagnosis in magnetic resonance zzso zzso However, no consensus exists about the best measurement method to assess contrast enhancement zzso This systematic investigation was performed to compare visual zzso with manual region of interest zzso and zzso diagnosis zzso analysis for time curve zzso in zzso 

A total of zzso patients undergoing surgery after zzso zzso zzso were analyzed zzso Dynamic data were measured using visual zzso including zzso as well as zzso methods, and classified depending on initial signal increase and delayed zzso 

zzso revealed 469 zzso zzso zzso 190 zzso Kappa agreement between the methods ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found without statistical significant zzso 

According to our results, curve type zzso are useful as a diagnostic criterion in breast zzso irrespective of the method zzso
