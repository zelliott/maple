We present a zzso zzso method for zzso of zzso potential zzso zzso ratios and zzso using singular value decomposition zzso and compare with the zzso zzso Model zzso When the zzso are generated by a single or multiple zzso with equal zzso ratios, the zzso method is superior to zzso in terms of reliable zzso of zzso and is comparable with zzso for reliable and unbiased zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso model zzso leads to unbiased zzso ratios and biased zzso when the zzso data sets are zzso generated and fit with a single zzso or zzso generated by N zzso with equal zzso ratios and fit with M zzso or zzso N zzso because the effect of model zzso zzso for a zzso zzso proof that zzso estimates zzso ratios more reliably than zzso for these cases is zzso
