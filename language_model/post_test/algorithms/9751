Animal models of lung disease are gaining importance in understanding the underlying mechanisms of diseases such as zzso and lung zzso zzso allows in zzso imaging of these models, thus permitting the study of the progression of the disease or the effect of therapeutic drugs in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso images can be helpful to understand the physiology of diseased zzso especially when combined with zzso of respiratory system input zzso In this work, we present a fast and robust zzso airway zzso and reconstruction zzso The zzso is based on a zzso fast marching zzso that, as it grows, divides the tree into zzso We devised a number of specific rules to guarantee that the front zzso only inside the airways and to avoid leaking into the zzso The zzso was tested on normal mice, a mouse model of chronic inflammation and a mouse model of zzso A comparison with manual zzso of two independent observers shows that the specificity and sensitivity values of our method are comparable to the zzso zzso and radius zzso of the zzso zzso reveal significant differences between healthy and diseased zzso Combining zzso of the automatically segmented airways with the parameters of the constant phase model provides extra information on how disease affects lung zzso
