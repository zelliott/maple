To compare the zzso results of an interactive planning procedure and a procedure based on dynamic dose calculation for permanent prostate zzso 

Between zzso and zzso 510 patients underwent zzso implants for zzso prostate zzso Before zzso zzso patients were treated using an interactive technique that included needle zzso After that period, 323 patients were treated with a more refined dynamic technique that included constant updating of the deposited seed zzso The comparison is based on zzso dose - volume parameters such as the zzso and zzso for the target, zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso Furthermore, the target volume ratios zzso identical with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso identical with zzso were calculated as additional quality zzso 

The dose outside the target volume was significantly reduced, the zzso decreased from zzso zzso for the interactive technique to zzso zzso for the dynamic zzso zzso the mean zzso reduced from zzso to zzso In addition, the mean zzso increased from zzso for the interactive procedure to zzso for the dynamic zzso More importantly, the percentage of patients with a zzso zzso zzso reduced from zzso to zzso A slight decline was observed with regard to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The dynamic implant procedure resulted in improved zzso Almost ideal dose coverage was zzso while minimizing the dose outside the zzso
