The zzso zzso yields a single zzso which, albeit zzso can be strongly affected by the choice of the scoring zzso and the gap zzso Additionally, the scores obtained are dependent upon the lengths of the aligned zzso requiring a zzso zzso To overcome some of these shortcomings, we developed a zzso zzso for local sequence alignment zzso that takes into account the uncertainty associated with all unknown variables by incorporating in its forward sums a series of scoring zzso gap parameters and all possible zzso The zzso can return both the joint and the marginal optimal zzso samples of alignments drawn from the zzso distribution and the zzso probabilities of gap penalties and scoring zzso Furthermore, it automatically adjusts for variations in sequence zzso zzso was compared with zzso to date the best performing dynamic programming zzso in the detection of structural zzso Using the zzso databases zzso and zzso zzso detected zzso and zzso of remote zzso whereas zzso detected zzso and 38% at an error rate of zzso errors per query over the databases, zzso
