A zzso model of the cardiac sodium channel is zzso The model is similar to the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel model developed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the following zzso 1) an additional open state is zzso 2) zzso transitions are made zzso and 3) channel rate zzso are exponential functions of zzso zzso and zzso and have explicit temperature zzso Model parameters are determined using a simulated zzso zzso to minimize the error between model responses and various experimental data zzso The model reproduces a wide range of experimental data including zzso zzso gating zzso tail zzso zzso zzso recovery from zzso and open time zzso over a temperature range of 10 degrees C to 25 degrees zzso The model also predicts measures of single channel activity such as first zzso probability of a zzso zzso and probability of zzso
