The 2010 zzso Development Conference addressed four questions related to the impact of previous fractures on 10-year fracture risk as calculated by zzso To address these questions, zzso was searched on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Titles of retrieved articles were reviewed for an indication that risk for future fracture was zzso zzso of these articles were reviewed for an indication that one or more of the questions listed above was zzso For those that did, the articles were reviewed in greater detail to extract the findings and to find additional past work and citing works that also bore on the zzso The official positions and the supporting literature review are presented zzso zzso zzso fracture probability in persons with a history of multiple fractures zzso A, zzso zzso may underestimate fracture probability in individuals with prevalent severe zzso fractures zzso A, zzso While there is evidence that hip, zzso and zzso fractures appear to zzso greater risk of subsequent fracture than fractures at other sites, zzso of this incremental risk in zzso is not possible zzso B, zzso zzso may underestimate fracture probability in individuals with a parental history of zzso fragility fracture zzso B, zzso zzso of the methodology include performance by a single reviewer, preliminary review of the literature being confined to titles, and secondary review being limited to zzso zzso of the evidence base include publication bias, overrepresentation of persons of European descent in the published studies, and technical differences in the methods used to identify prevalent and incident zzso Emerging topics for future research include fracture epidemiology in zzso populations and men, the impact of fractures in family members other than parents, and the genetic contribution to fracture zzso
