In this paper, an effective zzso approach for zzso kidney zzso of abdominal CT images with zzso structure consideration is zzso This automatic zzso system is expected to assist physicians in both clinical diagnosis and educational zzso The proposed method is a coarse to fine zzso approach divided into two zzso First, the candidate kidney region is extracted according to the statistical geometric location of kidney within the zzso This approach is zzso to images of different sizes by using the relative distance of the kidney region to the zzso The second stage identifies the kidney by a series of image processing zzso The main elements of the proposed system are: 1) the location of the spine is used as the landmark for coordinate zzso 2) zzso candidate kidney region extraction with progressive positioning on the consecutive CT zzso 3) novel directional model for a more reliable kidney region seed point zzso and 4) zzso region growing controlled by the properties of image zzso In addition, in order to provide different views for the physicians, we have implemented a zzso tool that will automatically show the zzso zzso through the method of zzso neighborhood edge zzso We considered zzso of kidney regions from CT scans that contain zzso in clinical zzso The results of a series of tests on zzso images from 30 patients indicate an average correlation zzso of up to zzso between automatic and manual zzso
