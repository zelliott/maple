zzso magnetic resonance imaging provides access to fiber pathways and structural integrity in zzso zzso such as white matter in the zzso In order to enable better access to the sensitivity of the diffusion zzso to the underlying zzso it is important to develop artificial model systems that exhibit a well-known structure, on the one hand, but benefit from a reduced complexity on the other zzso In this work, we developed a novel zzso diffusion phantom made of zzso fibers tightly wound on an acrylic zzso The phantom exhibits three regions with different geometrical zzso of zzso a region with fibers crossing at right angles, a region with parallel fibers and homogeneous density, and, finally, a region with parallel fibers but with a zzso of fiber density along the axis of zzso This gives rise to a gradual change of the degree of zzso within the same zzso In this way, the need to construct several zzso with different fiber zzso is avoided, and one can access different fractional zzso in the same experiment under the same physical zzso The properties of the developed phantom are demonstrated by means of diffusion zzso imaging and diffusion zzso zzso The zzso were performed using a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso pulse sequence programmed zzso The influence of the fiber density packing on the diffusion parameters was zzso We also demonstrate how the novel phantom can be used for the validation of high angular resolution diffusion imaging data zzso
