zzso zzso zzso can increase the difficulty of zzso zzso A number of additional methods have been defined in case of failed zzso attempt by standard zzso We aimed to investigate the more commonly preferred and practical additional methods among zzso 

A total of zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso performed during a study period of 14 months were zzso entered into a zzso Of these, 222 (18 zzso had zzso zzso women, 99 men, mean age 69 zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso women, 460 men, mean age 57 zzso Additional zzso methods used in patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso time, total procedure time, use of zzso zzso and therapeutic success of zzso were compared between the groups as zzso 

zzso zzso was performed by standard technique in 210 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved by placement of a zzso into the pancreatic duct in 6 zzso zzso and use of two devices in one channel in 2 zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the total procedure time and therapeutic success of zzso between the zzso zzso time was significantly longer in patients with zzso zzso zzso was performed less in patients with zzso 

zzso of zzso does not decrease the therapeutic success of zzso Placement of a zzso in the pancreatic duct or use of zzso are practical, successful, safe, and preferred methods which can be used in patients with failed zzso by standard zzso
