Many current methods for multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso require zzso seed points as zzso but do not necessarily allow the expert to work in an intuitive or efficient zzso zzso most methods also assume that the points are placed zzso This paper examines how seed points can be processed with intuitive zzso which provide improved zzso accuracy while zzso quick and natural point zzso Using a large set of zzso from an zzso clinical trial, two zzso are asked to seed the zzso while unaware that the points would be fed into a zzso based on zzso windows, that automatically zzso each marked zzso To evaluate the impact of the new zzso an interactive zzso method is used to provide ground truth and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso rank correlation are used as the primary measures of zzso A zzso analysis is performed to determine the effect on scans with zzso zzso and high zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso the zzso dramatically improve the DC zzso zzso and correlation zzso for the scans with low zzso zzso and also improve the DC zzso zzso and correlation zzso for the scans with medium zzso zzso while having zzso effect for the scans with high zzso zzso which are already segmented accurately by zzso zzso the zzso the DC is close to zzso and the correlation is above zzso for all three load zzso
