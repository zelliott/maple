A zzso method that allows zzso measurement of sugar transport rates and parameters in single living cells is zzso zzso sugar zzso were estimated in real time from changes in cell volume that occur secondary to zzso of zzso across the plasma zzso In turn, the cell volume changes were estimated from variations of zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso Using zzso cells, the zzso allowed zzso measurement of the zzso and exit of zzso and zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso at an zzso concentration of zzso of zzso at an zzso concentration of 200 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso exit were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The apparent affinity of zzso zzso at a very high zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso inhibited in the presence of 50 zzso zzso whereas zzso exit was zzso zzso zzso by 100 zzso zzso This technique may help to characterize sugar transport in freshly isolated cells, zzso and zzso cell zzso It may also allow available cell zzso technology to be used to study the regulation of sugar zzso intrinsic zzso In principle, similar approaches might also be applied in functional studies of other zzso for which zzso zzso are zzso
