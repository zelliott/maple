A zzso zzso zzso zzso technique is introduced for zzso mobile membrane proteins for orientation determination using zzso zzso For proteins undergoing zzso zzso rotation in the zzso zzso the intrinsic equality between the zzso zzso zzso measured in zzso samples and the zzso zzso measured in zzso oriented samples has been shown zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso can be measured with zzso detection using zzso and zzso zzso correlation experiments, so that zzso site resolution can be achieved and multiple zzso constraints can be extracted from each zzso We demonstrate this technique on the zzso zzso zzso of the influenza A virus, where the zzso zzso zzso of various zzso fit to a zzso wave for a zzso tilt angle of 37 degrees , in excellent agreement with data obtained from zzso zzso zzso
