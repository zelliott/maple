The zzso zzso transfer function zzso is an important zzso zzso that can help zzso the performance and some processes of the human visual zzso In previous studies, the zzso was calculated from zzso point spread function zzso zzso These zzso include a zzso reflection component from the zzso that introduces a measurement artifact, and they require long acquisition times to allow averaging to reduce zzso To solve these problems, we developed a new zzso zzso analysis system zzso that uses polarization zzso to eliminate the zzso retinal reflection zzso and a rotating zzso to increase measurement zzso zzso experiments on one patient showed that the zzso measured by zzso agrees closely with the zzso calculated from contrast sensitivity zzso A simulated retinal image was calculated by zzso of zzso rings with the calculated zzso zzso provided by the zzso The contrast characteristic then was calculated from the simulated retinal zzso These results indicate that the zzso obtained using the zzso may be a reliable measure of visual performance of the zzso of the eye, including the optical effects of the zzso The simulated retinal images and contrast characteristics are useful for evaluating visual zzso
