zzso a zzso bone surface model from a limited number of zzso zzso X-ray images zzso 2) and a zzso point distribution model is a challenging task, especially, when we would like to construct a zzso surface model of a bone with zzso One of the key steps for such a zzso reconstruction is to establish zzso between the zzso images and the zzso zzso This paper presents a zzso correspondence building method based on a zzso zzso point matching process, which zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso mapping operator and zzso zzso zzso based zzso to find a fraction of best matched zzso point pairs between features extracted from the X-ray images and those extracted from the zzso zzso The estimated point pairs are then used to set up a set of zzso point pairs such that we turn a zzso reconstruction problem to a zzso one, whose solutions are well zzso zzso this zzso correspondence building method, a zzso reconstruction scheme combining a statistical zzso with a zzso shape deformation has been zzso Comprehensive experiments on clinical zzso and on images of zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso cases are designed and conducted to evaluate the performance of the zzso correspondence building method as well as that of the zzso reconstruction zzso zzso and qualitative evaluation results are given, which demonstrate the zzso of the present method and zzso
