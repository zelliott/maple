We investigate some aspects of the zzso dynamics in an zzso protein zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Our main objective is to zzso the important role of the zzso symmetry in the formation, stability, and zzso properties of zzso zzso in an alpha zzso We show, zzso and zzso that the corresponding system of zzso equations admits several types of stationary zzso solutions and that zzso which preserve zzso symmetry are zzso zzso once formed, they zzso rapidly when they zzso On the other hand, the zzso which spontaneously breaks the local zzso and zzso zzso possesses the lowest energy and is a robust localized zzso We also demonstrate that this zzso is the result of a zzso of the zzso states from the two lowest zzso bands and has an inner structure which can be described as a modulated zzso zzso distribution of zzso on individual zzso The complex and composite structure of the zzso zzso itself distinctly when the zzso is moving and some zzso zzso take zzso Such a zzso structure and the zzso zzso have previously been observed zzso zzso zzso Scott, zzso zzso A 26, zzso zzso Here we argue that the zzso studied by Scott are hybrid zzso and that the zzso arise due to the zzso symmetry of the system and result from the motion of the zzso along the alpha zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso is shown to be zzso to the zzso zzso
