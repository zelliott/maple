The onset and offset of sensory stimuli evoke transient changes in the electroencephalogram zzso that can be detected by linear and/or zzso zzso However, there is presently no systematic procedure to zzso the zzso correlate of the presence of a stimulus (as opposed to its onset evoked zzso We describe a method for detecting a zzso change in brain electrical activity that persists while the stimulus is present zzso zzso The method, which is based on zzso embedding of the zzso time series followed by quantitative analysis of the recurrence plot of the embedded zzso was used to demonstrate the occurrence of a presence effect in separate groups of human subjects exposed to sound, a magnetic field, and zzso Any form of zzso zzso activity induced in the zzso can be zzso particularly activity that is zzso related to the zzso zzso mathematical features of the method were reproduced in a model zzso system containing known zzso zzso
