We introduce a maximum zzso analysis technique for zzso and characterizing rhythmic expression profiles from DNA zzso zzso zzso These patterns are clues to discovering genes implicated in zzso zzso and other periodic biological zzso The algorithm, implemented in a program called zzso zzso zzso Analysis of Gene zzso treats the task of zzso an expression zzso zzso and phase as a simultaneous zzso zzso zzso Specifically, a frequency domain spectrum is reconstructed from a zzso of gene expression data, subject to two zzso zzso the likelihood of the spectrum and zzso the Shannon zzso of the reconstructed zzso Unlike zzso spectral analysis, maximum zzso spectral reconstruction is well suited to signals of the type generated in DNA zzso zzso Our zzso is zzso running in linear time in the number of expression zzso Moreover, an zzso of our zzso runs an order of magnitude faster than previous zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso is superior to other methods at identifying and characterizing periodic expression profiles on both synthetic and actual DNA zzso zzso zzso
