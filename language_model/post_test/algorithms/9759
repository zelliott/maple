zzso pelvic injuries are often associated with zzso life-threatening zzso and immediate medical treatment is therefore zzso However, patient prognosis depends heavily on the type, location and severity of the bone zzso and the complexity of the pelvic structure presents diagnostic zzso zzso fracture detection from initial patient X-ray images can assist physicians in rapid diagnosis and treatment, and a first and crucial step of such a method is to segment key bone structures within the zzso these structures can then be analyzed for specific fracture zzso Active Shape Model has been applied for this task in other bone structures but requires manual zzso by the zzso This paper describes a zzso for automatic zzso and zzso of key pelvic structures - the zzso crests, pelvic ring, left and right zzso and zzso - using a zzso approach that combines directed zzso transform and Active Shape zzso 

Performance of the automated zzso is compared with results obtained via manual zzso An error measures is calculated based on the shapes detected with each method and the gold standard zzso zzso results on these error measures show that the automated zzso performs at least as well as the manual zzso Visual inspection by two zzso and one trauma surgeon also indicates generally accurate zzso 

The zzso zzso described in this paper automatically detects and segments key structures from pelvic zzso Unlike various other zzso zzso methods, it does not require manual zzso or zzso Moreover, it handles the inconsistencies between zzso images in a clinical environment and performs successfully in the presence of zzso This method and the zzso results provide a valuable base for future work in fracture zzso
