In recent years, one of the most important findings in systems zzso has been the identification of large scale distributed brain zzso These networks support healthy brain function and are zzso in a number of neurological disorders zzso zzso Their study is therefore an important and evolving focus for zzso zzso The majority of network studies are conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso which relies on changes in blood zzso induced by neural zzso However recently, a small number of studies have begun to zzso the electrical origin of zzso networks by searching for correlations between neural zzso signals from zzso separate brain areas in zzso zzso zzso Here we advance this research zzso We introduce two zzso extensions to previous independent component analysis zzso approaches to zzso network zzso 1) we show how to derive zzso networks that combine independent components zzso within individual frequency zzso 2) We show how to measure the zzso evolution of each network with zzso zzso zzso We apply our approach to zzso of zzso data recorded in 28 experimental sessions during 3 separate cognitive tasks showing that a number of networks could be identified and were robust across time, task, subject and recording zzso Further, we show that neural zzso in those networks are modulated by memory load, and task zzso This study zzso recent findings on zzso brain networks and zzso the way for future clinical studies in patients in which abnormal connectivity is thought to zzso core zzso
