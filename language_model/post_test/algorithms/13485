The sound generated by blood flow in zzso arteries is investigated for a model that consists of a channel with a zzso zzso The blood zzso zzso zzso are zzso directly using a hybrid approach wherein the zzso flow field is solved by an immersed boundary, zzso flow zzso and the sound generation is modeled by a zzso approach that employs the zzso zzso zzso zzso The transmission and propagation of the sound through the surrounding biological zzso is also modeled with a zzso linear structural wave zzso The flow field inside the artery and the zzso sound signal at the zzso surface are examined to delineate the precise source of the zzso zzso and the correlation between the zzso and the zzso wall pressure zzso It is found that the zzso are related primarily to the zzso of the integrated pressure force on the zzso segment of zzso zzso The current study provides a clear perspective on the generation of zzso from zzso arteries and enables an assessment of the conjectures of previous researchers regarding the source of zzso zzso
