Recently, the zzso of alcoholic liver disease zzso has been increasing in Japan; this associated with an increase in alcoholic zzso zzso Multiple organ failures are frequently observed in patients with severe alcoholic zzso zzso most of whom have a poor prognosis similar to zzso zzso as well numbers of severe zzso patients appear to be zzso Although prognosis of zzso zzso in Japan has been recently improved by intensive treatments such as plasma exchange zzso that of severe zzso has not zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether there was any factor that could determine the prognosis of severe zzso 

We carried out zzso survey by asking hospitals certified by the Japanese Society of zzso and hospitals related to ours hospital for the current status of patients seen with severe alcoholic zzso since zzso We investigated correlations between various factors including blood laboratory data, presence of other organ failure, and zzso 

zzso of patients with severe zzso was high zzso The ratio of female patients with severe zzso zzso was higher than that for other zzso zzso zzso Mean age was older zzso 44 zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso 11 years zzso white blood cell zzso counts were higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso red blood cell counts were lower zzso zzso 95; 265 zzso 72 zzso zzso and zzso time zzso was prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients who had died than in patients who had zzso However, as all differences diminished after carrying out zzso we analyzed data in patients without zzso The results were similar to those in all zzso zzso of infection, gastrointestinal zzso bleeding and zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in patients who had zzso Although intensive treatments such as zzso zzso and zzso therapy did not change the prognosis of severe zzso zzso improved the prognosis of patients without either zzso bleeding or zzso zzso counts were also slightly higher in patients who had died after carrying out zzso Two cases had been cured by zzso zzso zzso zzso can compensate for and reduce the risk due to prolonged zzso in patients with severe zzso These results suggest that the patients with markedly elevated zzso counts, prolonged zzso or anemia should, if possible, be treated at an earlier stage with an intensive treatment such as zzso zzso or zzso therapy before infection, zzso bleeding or zzso zzso Further, zzso might be useful for severe zzso patients with higher zzso zzso
