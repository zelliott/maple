zzso zzso zzso zzso may be used to image brain function, but an important consideration is the effect of the highly zzso skull and other zzso layers on the flow of injected zzso We describe a new reconstruction algorithm, based on a forward solution which models the head as four concentric, zzso shells, with zzso of the brain, zzso fluid, skull and zzso The model predicted that the mean current travelling in the brain in the zzso plane for current injection from polar zzso was zzso times less than if the head was zzso as a homogeneous zzso this suggests that an zzso based on this should be more accurate than one based on a homogeneous sphere zzso In images reconstructed from zzso data or data from a realistic zzso tank containing a real skull, a zzso rod was localized to within zzso or zzso of the tank diameter of its true position, zzso zzso to zzso the tank images were less accurate than those obtained with a reconstruction zzso based on a homogeneous zzso It is not yet clear if the theoretical advantages of this zzso will yield practical advantages for head zzso zzso it may be necessary to proceed to more complex zzso based on zzso models which incorporate realistic head zzso If so, this zzso forward model and zzso may be used to validate zzso zzso
