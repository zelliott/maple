zzso pair approximations zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s and have yielded excellent results for small zzso Recently, interest in zzso and zzso methods has been zzso It has been shown that these methods lead to competitive zzso zzso and structural zzso They greatly surpass second order zzso and popular density functional theory based approaches in accuracy and are intermediate in quality between zzso and zzso in extended benchmark zzso In this work an efficient production level zzso of the closed shell zzso and zzso methods is reported that can be applied to medium sized molecules in the range of zzso atoms and up to about 2000 basis zzso The internal space is spanned by localized internal zzso The external space is greatly compressed through the method of pair natural zzso zzso that was also introduced by the pioneers of the zzso zzso Our zzso also makes extended use of density fitting (or resolution of the zzso techniques in order to speed up the zzso integral zzso The method is called local pair natural zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and zzso zzso zzso three zzso parameters are introduced that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number of zzso per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis functions per zzso With the conservatively chosen default values of these zzso the method recovers about zzso of the zzso correlation zzso This translates to absolute zzso from the zzso result of only a few zzso zzso zzso zzso test calculations demonstrate that zzso zzso has essentially the same accuracy as parent zzso zzso methods for zzso zzso weak zzso and potential energy surfaces but is up to 500 times zzso The method performs best in conjunction with large and flexible basis zzso These results open the way for large-scale chemical zzso
