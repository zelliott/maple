This paper presents a reverse engineering approach for zzso zzso in zzso neural networks zzso We consider the deterministic evolution of a zzso network with zzso zzso where synaptic transmission has delays, modeled as a neural network of the generalized integrate and fire zzso Our approach aims at zzso the fact that the zzso zzso in zzso results in a zzso zzso hard problem when delays are to be zzso Here, this assumption has been reformulated as a linear programming zzso problem in order to perform the solution in a zzso zzso Besides, the LP problem zzso makes the fact that the reverse engineering of a neural network can be performed from the observation of the spike times zzso Furthermore, we point out how the LP adjustment mechanism is local to each zzso and has the same structure as a zzso zzso Finally, we present a zzso of this approach to the design of zzso zzso transformations as a practical method to zzso a zzso network, zzso find a set of parameters allowing us to exactly reproduce the network zzso given an zzso zzso zzso and illustrations are zzso
