zzso gel zzso zzso is an indispensable tool in zzso for the analysis of protein expression in complex biological systems such as cells and zzso However, the automatic extraction of information from gel images is still a challenging zzso In this paper we propose a strategy that represents a zzso procedure of support to the discrimination of different clinical conditions associated with the zzso The analyzed gel images were acquired within the framework of a study of peripheral zzso zzso zzso maps generated from zzso fluid (16 zzso and 8 control subjects) were zzso zzso features were defined to describe each image and treated with a method of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso allowed us to see the gel of the data set as items in a three-dimensional space, segregating according to the clinical zzso Moreover, information with zzso value was obtained for a single outsider gel of a patient who was included in a clinical zzso at the first diagnosis but whose disease progressed with clinical features belonging to a different clinical zzso The method developed may represent an effective tool of zzso that can be used repeatedly to capture the essential impression from separation zzso
