In zzso bacteria, zzso protein channels, such as zzso of zzso coli, constitute the entry point of various classes of zzso While zzso research and development is zzso bacterial resistance to antibiotics is rising and there is an emergency call for a new way to develop potent zzso agents and to bring them to the market faster and at reduced zzso An emerging strategy is to follow a bottom-up approach based on microscopically founded zzso based zzso however such strategy needs zzso zzso Here we propose to use molecular dynamics zzso simulations combined with the zzso algorithm, to study zzso zzso through zzso at a molecular zzso This recently designed zzso overcomes the time scale problem of classical MD by accelerating some reaction zzso It is expected that the initial assumption of the reaction coordinates is a key zzso for the efficiency and accuracy of the zzso Previous studies using different zzso schemes for a similar process only used one reaction zzso which is the zzso Here we go further and see how it is possible to include more zzso reaction zzso accounting explicitly for: zzso the zzso flexibility and zzso interactions with the zzso As model systems, we select two compounds covering the main classes of zzso zzso and zzso We decipher the molecular mechanism of zzso of each zzso and highlight the important parameters that should be taken into account for improving further zzso This will benefit the screening and design for antibiotics with better zzso zzso
