One of the most challenging tasks in the zzso era is to reconstruct the zzso regulatory zzso The goal is to zzso for each gene that responds to a certain biological event, which zzso factors affect its zzso and how a set of zzso factors coordinate to accomplish zzso and spatial specific zzso 

Here we propose a supervised machine learning approach to address these zzso We focus our study on the gene zzso regulation of the cell cycle in the budding zzso thanks to the large amount of data available and relatively zzso biology, although the main ideas of our method can be applied to other data as zzso Our method starts with building an ensemble of decision trees for each zzso data to capture the association between the expression levels of zzso genes and the binding of zzso factors to gene promoter regions, as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the method is more accurate and reliable than the zzso decision tree zzso and several other ensemble learning zzso From the decision tree zzso we extract logical rules that explain how a set of zzso factors act in concert to regulate the expression of their zzso We further zzso a profile for each rule to show its regulation strengths at different time zzso We also propose a zzso zzso method to integrate the rule profiles learned from several time series expression data sets that measure the same biological zzso We then combine these rule profiles to build a zzso regulatory network for the zzso cell zzso Compared to the results in the literature, our method correctly identifies all major known zzso cell cycle zzso factors, and assigns them into appropriate cell cycle zzso Our method also identifies many interesting zzso relationships among these zzso factors, most of which are well known, while many of the rest can also be supported by other zzso 

The high accuracy of our method indicates that our method is valid and zzso As more gene expression and zzso factor binding data become available, we believe that our method is useful for reconstructing large-scale zzso regulatory networks in other species as zzso
