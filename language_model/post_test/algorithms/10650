Public access zzso zzso are now available for more efficient and rapid treatment of zzso sudden cardiac zzso zzso are used normally by untrained people on the streets and in sports centers, airports, and other public zzso zzso automated detection of zzso zzso or its zzso is of high zzso A special case exists at railway stations, where electric zzso frequency interference is zzso Many countries, especially in Europe, use zzso zzso zzso power, which introduces high level zzso interference that may compromise zzso zzso 

Moving signal averaging is often used for zzso zzso interference suppression if its effect on the zzso spectrum has little importance (no zzso analysis is zzso This approach may be also applied to the railway situation, if the interference frequency is continuously detected so as to zzso the zzso conversion zzso for introducing variable zzso zzso A better solution consists of rated zzso software frequency zzso internal irregular zzso according to the interference frequency, and a moving average over a constant sample number, followed by regular back zzso 

The proposed method leads to a total railway interference zzso together with suppression of inherent noise, while the peak zzso of some sharp complexes are zzso This reduction has negligible effect on accurate zzso zzso 

The method is developed in the zzso environment and represents a useful tool for real time railway interference zzso
