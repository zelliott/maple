For the clinical performance of new dental zzso materials to be accurately zzso the three-dimensional anatomical changes of the functional surfaces of the restoration must be zzso over zzso To this end, a highly accurate 3-D optical scanner has been developed that zzso the principles of zzso and a zzso automated 3-D zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and the precision of the new system with and without referenced zzso Additionally, the ability of the system to determine wear of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso of restored teeth were zzso The tooth surfaces were scanned with a resolution of 250,000 surface points within a measuring time of 20 to 40 zzso The results show that the precision and accuracy of 3-D data acquisition depend on the surface zzso Up to an angle of 60 degrees, the precision is better than 3 zzso and the accuracy is better than 6 zzso If exact repositioning of the object before and after zzso loading is possible, zzso with in zzso studies, differences on the surface can be determined with a precision of zzso zzso In zzso zzso which are a necessity in clinical studies, the 3-D data acquisition in combination with the automatic matching program can detect wear with an accuracy of 10 zzso The application of this measuring device for the detection of wear of a composite filling functioning in the mouth has been zzso Since this measuring technique is zzso and zzso of high accuracy can be attained in a short period of time, this system offers the possibility for complex analyses of three-dimensional wear to be conducted on a large number of samples in clinical zzso
