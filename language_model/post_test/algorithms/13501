Family samples, which can be enriched for rare zzso zzso by focusing on families with multiple extreme individuals and which facilitate detection of de zzso zzso events, provide an attractive resource for next-generation sequencing zzso Here, we describe, zzso and evaluate a zzso framework for analysis of next generation sequence data in family zzso Our framework is able to identify zzso sites accurately and to assign individual zzso and can handle de zzso zzso events, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of zzso calling and de zzso zzso zzso Through simulations we show explicit modeling of family relationships is especially useful for analyses of zzso zzso and that zzso accuracy increases with the number of individuals zzso per zzso Compared with the standard approach of ignoring zzso our methods identify and accurately zzso more zzso and have high specificity for detecting de zzso zzso zzso The improvement in accuracy using our methods over the standard approach is particularly pronounced for zzso zzso zzso the zzso calling framework dramatically reduces zzso inconsistencies and is beneficial for zzso zzso We hope our framework and software will facilitate continuing efforts to identify genetic factors underlying human zzso
