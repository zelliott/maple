The aims of this study were to define zzso zzso for identifying zzso and to zzso evaluate the performance of zzso in assessing zzso 

zzso were automatically segmented from 148 abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso 77 normal zzso and 71 cases of zzso zzso by visual inspection and/or linear liver height by zzso zzso liver volumes were compared to manual zzso using volume overlap and zzso Liver volumes were zzso to body surface area, from which zzso zzso were defined zzso zzso by analyzing the distribution of liver sizes in the healthy zzso H scores were validated against consensus zzso The performance of zzso in diagnosing zzso was zzso zzso 

The automated zzso of zzso was zzso with volume overlap and error of zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences zzso zzso zzso between manual and automated zzso for either the normal or the zzso zzso The average volumes of normal and enlarged zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso found that body surface area zzso zzso zzso and gender zzso zzso zzso but not age, significantly affected normal liver zzso No significant effects were observed for zzso and three-way interactions among the three variables zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were used to define mild and massive zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the H score as the reference standard, the sensitivity of zzso in detecting all, mild, and massive zzso was zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso disagreed on zzso of the diagnosed cases zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso characteristic curve of the zzso criterion for zzso detection was zzso 

zzso for the identification and grading of zzso from automatic zzso liver assessment zzso to body surface area zzso zzso are zzso H scores match well with clinical interpretations for zzso and may improve zzso detection compared with height zzso or visual inspection, commonly used in current clinical zzso
