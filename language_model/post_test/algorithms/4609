Character skeleton plays a significant role in character zzso The strokes of a character may consist of two regions, zzso singular and regular zzso The zzso and junctions of the strokes belong to singular region, while the straight and smooth parts of the strokes are zzso to regular zzso zzso a zzso method requires two different processes to treat the skeletons in zzso two different zzso All traditional zzso zzso are based on the symmetry analysis zzso The major problems of these methods are as zzso 1) The zzso of the primary skeleton in the regular region is zzso so that its zzso is sophisticated and zzso 2) The extracted skeleton cannot be exactly located on the central line of the zzso 3) The captured skeleton in the singular region may be distorted by artifacts and zzso To overcome these problems, a novel scheme of zzso the skeleton of character based on zzso transform is presented in this zzso This scheme consists of two main steps, zzso a) extraction of primary skeleton in the regular region and b) amendment processing of the primary skeletons and connection of them in the singular zzso A direct technique is used in the first step, where a new zzso symmetry analysis is developed for finding the central line of the stroke zzso A novel method called smooth zzso is designed in the second step, where a smooth operation is applied to the primary zzso and, thereafter, the zzso compensation technique is proposed to link the primary zzso so that the skeleton in the singular region can be zzso zzso are conducted and positive results are zzso which show that the proposed zzso scheme is zzso to not only zzso image but also zzso image, and the skeleton is robust against noise and zzso zzso
