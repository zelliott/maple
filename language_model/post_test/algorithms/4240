zzso disagreement exists over appropriate PET zzso techniques for zzso cell lung zzso Currently, no zzso zzso explicitly considers tumor motion in determining tumor zzso We developed an automatic PET zzso model as a function of target volume, motion extent, and zzso ratio (the zzso zzso The purpose of this work was to apply the zzso model and six other zzso zzso to a sample of lung zzso PET and zzso CT were performed in the same imaging session for 23 patients (24 zzso for radiation therapy zzso Internal target volumes zzso were zzso on maximum intensity projection zzso of zzso zzso zzso were delineated on PET using the following zzso zzso zzso and zzso of maximum activity zzso standardized zzso value zzso of zzso zzso zzso of mean activity concentration plus background, a linear function of mean zzso and the zzso zzso zzso threshold values from each method were compared to measured optimal threshold values, and resulting volume zzso were compared to zzso zzso zzso between predicted and measured threshold values ranged from slopes of zzso for the simplest zzso techniques to zzso for the zzso zzso zzso values ranged from zzso for the simplest zzso techniques to zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique that included volume, motion, and zzso ratio, produced accurate zzso in patients when compared with zzso zzso
