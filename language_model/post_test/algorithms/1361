Many areas in the field of health physics require evaluation of the change of zzso quantity in a medium with zzso A general solution to zzso zzso models is presented in this paper for application to systems consisting of one physical medium that contains any number of zzso zzso chain zzso The general zzso solution to the problem is first described zzso and then extended to four zzso 1) evaluation of the quantity of zzso as a function of time, 2) evaluation of the time integral of the quantity during a time period, 3) evaluation of the amount in a medium as a function of time following deposition at a constant rate, and 4) evaluation of the time integral of the amount in a medium after deposition at a constant rate for a zzso The solution can be applied to any system involving constant physical transfers from the medium and radioactive chain zzso with branching in the zzso The general solution is presented for quantities expressed in units of atoms and zzso Unlike many earlier mathematical solutions, this solution includes chain zzso with branching explicitly in the zzso
