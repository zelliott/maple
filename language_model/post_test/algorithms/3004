An zzso was created to predict zzso stage in patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The sample consisted of 133 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo zzso To develop a tool to predict zzso disease before surgery, principal component analysis zzso was zzso Patients were zzso into a training set zzso zzso zzso and a validation set zzso zzso zzso and 7 parameters were zzso levels of zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso presence of zzso presence of zzso in zzso and initial tumor size zzso zzso zzso was applied to the training set to determine the weight of each zzso A zzso score was generated for each patient in the set, and a zzso defining zzso disease was zzso The accuracy of the zzso was zzso by the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve zzso The model was then applied to the validation set without zzso the zzso and the positive and negative zzso values of the validation set were zzso 

On zzso zzso 71 patients zzso were found to have zzso tumors and 62 patients zzso had zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in the training group zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the validation group zzso zzso zzso The positive and negative zzso values in the validation group were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The newly zzso internally zzso zzso was zzso accurate in predicting zzso zzso disease before zzso Further external validation in a large cohort was recommended as still zzso
