To investigate the influence of zzso and spatial spot sequences on the zzso surface temperature increase during zzso laser surgery with a zzso zzso zzso 

Institute for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Switzerland, and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso laser system working at a repetition rate of zzso zzso was used to zzso bovine zzso with various zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso profiles was modified by 4 spot zzso line, zzso random, and an zzso scan zzso The increase in zzso surface temperature was measured using an infrared zzso 

The maximum and mean zzso surface temperature increases depended primarily on the spatial and zzso distribution of the spots during zzso and the amount of zzso zzso The highest temperature increases were with the line and zzso scan zzso zzso lower temperature increases were found with the zzso and random scan zzso 

zzso zzso laser systems require spot sequences with zzso zzso and spatial spot distribution to minimize the increase in zzso surface zzso An zzso surface temperature increase will always occur depending on the amount of zzso zzso the type of zzso profile, the radiant exposure, and the repetition rate of the laser zzso
