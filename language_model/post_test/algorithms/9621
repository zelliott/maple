zzso distortion is one of the major artifacts in zzso imaging zzso and many solutions have been proposed for the problem, including the zzso method and the point spread function zzso zzso In this paper, a framework unifying both methods is zzso Under this zzso a zzso zzso method is proposed in which the zzso of the source object is modeled along with a single field map measured by zzso reference zzso zzso images of a phantom and a healthy human subject were acquired, and the results of distortion correction by the zzso method, linear zzso method, and the zzso zzso method were zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso method could correct for geometric distortion and signal intensity distortion zzso avoiding the zzso artifact shown in the zzso zzso In conclusion, the proposed framework gave us an overall picture of how different correction methods zzso The zzso zzso method, which required fewer reference scans and less zzso load, was more clinically feasible than other zzso
