The zzso zzso and zzso gamma rhythms are two prominent examples of zzso zzso zzso The zzso has often been hypothesized to influence zzso networks by its zzso rhythm, and, recently, evidence for such a direct influence has been zzso We examined a possible mechanism for this influence by means of a zzso model study using zzso model zzso We found, in agreement with previous studies, that networks of zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso their spike activity at a gamma frequency and are able to impose this rhythm on a network of zzso cells to which they are zzso When our model was supplied with zzso zzso input zzso the zzso rhythm biased the spike zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, both the zzso and frequency of local field potential gamma zzso were influenced by the phase of the zzso zzso We show that the zzso cells, not zzso cells, are essential for this latter phenomenon, thus highlighting their crucial role in the interplay between zzso and zzso
