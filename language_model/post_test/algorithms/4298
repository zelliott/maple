The zzso used for prostate cancer risk assessment in Western countries are not directly zzso to Chinese zzso consequently, we have developed a new model to evaluate the risk of them developing this zzso 

A total of zzso patients who had undergone zzso ultrasound zzso 12 + zzso prostate biopsy were zzso evaluated in the first stage of the zzso Age, zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso ratio zzso digital zzso examination zzso findings, the presence of a zzso mass revealed using zzso zzso detection of zzso prostate volume zzso and zzso density were considered as zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis involving a backward elimination selection procedure was used to select independent zzso We compared positive rates regarding zzso and zzso biopsy schemes at different risk zzso In the second stage of the study, zzso cases were evaluated using our zzso In higher risk patients, we employed a 6 + 1 core zzso Positive rates in the first and second stages of the study were zzso 

Age, the baseline median natural zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso rate of abnormal zzso findings and rate of zzso masses detected using zzso were the factors that were finally submitted into our zzso A significantly greater area under the zzso characteristic curve was obtained for the zzso than for zzso level alone zzso zzso zzso A cancer probability zzso value of zzso suggested no significant difference between the zzso and zzso biopsy schemes at higher risk zzso In the second stage of the study we verified that in patients with a cancer probability zzso value zzso a 6 + zzso biopsy could be used without a reduction in the positive detection rate, and significantly reducing the number of biopsy zzso zzso 

A zzso based on data from Chinese males was developed to predict the positive detection rate, ratio of positive zzso and zzso score at each risk zzso According to this zzso a reasonable biopsy strategy could be constituted to reduce the number of biopsy zzso required in subjects at high zzso
