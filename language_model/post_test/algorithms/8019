zzso zzso zzso represents a central regulatory mechanism in cell zzso Here, we present an extensive survey of zzso zzso sites in a zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso line by applying zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with high sensitivity zzso liquid zzso tandem mass zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso sites zzso by zzso unique zzso from 285 proteins were confidently identified in zzso following the analysis of both the zzso condition and acute stimulation with zzso growth factor zzso The estimated false discovery rate was zzso as determined by searching against a scrambled zzso zzso of these data with existing literature showed significant agreement for previously reported zzso However, we observed 281 sites that were not previously reported for zzso cultures and 29 of which have not been reported for any human cell or tissue zzso The analysis showed that a majority of highly zzso proteins were relatively zzso Large differences in zzso zzso for sites within the same protein were also observed, raising the possibility of more important functional roles for such highly zzso zzso zzso By mapping to major signaling networks, such as the zzso zzso and insulin growth zzso zzso signaling zzso many known proteins involved in these pathways were revealed to be zzso zzso which provides interesting targets for future zzso and targeted quantitative studies involving zzso zzso in zzso or other human zzso
