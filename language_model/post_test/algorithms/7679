zzso zzso structures such as airways or vessels in medical images is important for diagnosis and surgical zzso Many state-of-the-art approaches address this problem by starting from the root and progressing towards thinnest zzso structures usually guided by image filtering zzso These approaches need to be tailored for each application and can fail in noisy or zzso zzso In this work, we address these challenges by a zzso model which consists of a low-level likelihood measure and a high-level measure zzso zzso zzso The zzso starts by computing a robust measure of zzso presence using a zzso zzso at multiple image zzso The measure is then used in an efficient zzso shortest path zzso to generate candidate zzso branches and corresponding zzso zzso Finally, the branches are verified by a zzso indicator function that zzso false candidate zzso The experiments on detecting airways in zzso X-ray volumes show that the technique is robust to noise and correctly finds airways even in the presence of imaging zzso
