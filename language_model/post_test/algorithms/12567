A zzso system typically consists of both a feature zzso zzso and a zzso These two components can be trained either independently or zzso The former option has an zzso advantage since the zzso need only be trained once for use with any zzso whereas the latter has an advantage since it can be used to minimize zzso error zzso Certain criteria, such as Minimum zzso zzso are better suited for simultaneous training, whereas other criteria, such as Mutual zzso are amenable for training the feature zzso either independently or zzso zzso an zzso criterion is introduced and is evaluated for training the zzso independently of the zzso The proposed method uses zzso zzso of zzso zzso to train the zzso by maximizing an approximation of the mutual information between the class labels and the output of the feature zzso The evaluations show that the proposed method, even though it uses independent training, performs at least as well as three feature extraction methods that train the zzso and zzso zzso
