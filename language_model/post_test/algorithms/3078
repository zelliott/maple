zzso levels of zzso cholesterol zzso in the plasma are a well-established risk factor for the development of coronary heart zzso Plasma zzso levels are in part determined by the rate at which LDL particles are removed from the zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of LDL by zzso liver cells occurs mainly via zzso zzso a process which zzso the binding of these particles to specific receptors in zzso areas of the cell surface, the subsequent zzso of the zzso complex, and ultimately the degradation and release of the zzso zzso constituent zzso We formulate a mathematical model to study the binding and zzso zzso of LDL and zzso particles by zzso in zzso The system of ordinary differential zzso which includes a zzso pit production term representing feedback regulation of surface receptors in response to zzso cholesterol levels, is zzso using zzso simulations and zzso zzso Our zzso results show good agreement with in zzso experimental data describing LDL zzso by cultured zzso following delivery of a single zzso of zzso Our model is adapted in order to reflect the in zzso situation, in which zzso are continuously delivered to the zzso In this case, our model suggests that the competition between the LDL and zzso particles for binding to the pits on the cell surface affects the zzso cholesterol zzso In particular, we predict that when there is continuous delivery of low levels of zzso to the cell surface, more zzso than LDL occupies the pit, since zzso are better competitors for zzso zzso zzso have a cholesterol content comparable to LDL zzso however, due to the larger size of zzso one zzso zzso particle blocks binding of several zzso and there is a zzso drop in the zzso cholesterol zzso When there is continuous delivery of zzso at high levels to the zzso zzso particles still zzso LDL particles for zzso zzso and consequently more zzso than LDL particles occupy the zzso Although the maximum zzso cholesterol level is similar for high and low levels of zzso delivery, the maximum is reached more rapidly when the zzso delivery rates are zzso The implications of these results for the design of in zzso experiments is zzso
