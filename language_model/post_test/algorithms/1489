A system is described for the zzso of zzso flow in arteries in real time by the simultaneous processing of the audio output of a commercial ultrasound scanner carrying the zzso zzso and the video output carrying zzso images of the lateral view of the zzso These images are processed to provide estimates of instantaneous internal vessel zzso Combination with the relevant estimates of spatial mean zzso provides estimates of instantaneous zzso zzso The major limitations of the system are the low rate of production of the zzso images (17 zzso the limited computing power and the need to tilt the zzso to produce an zzso low zzso zzso This tilting diminishes the quality of the imaging echoes from the zzso walls, making diameter measurement zzso In principle, this approach to flow measurement represents an improvement on the conventional duplex technique where a single estimate of diameter is zzso In practice, its value is limited by current zzso zzso
