zzso neutral theory claims that ecological patterns such as species abundance zzso can be explained by a zzso model based on simple zzso One of these zzso the point zzso zzso states that every individual has the same probability to zzso zzso et zzso have argued that other assumptions on the zzso process could be more zzso for example, that every species has the same probability to zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso They introduced a number of neutral community models with a different zzso process, and zzso formulas for their stationary species abundance zzso Here we study a zzso neutral community model, encompassing these modified models, and derive its stationary distribution, thus proving the zzso zzso
