Spot matching is considered as one of key elements in protein identification based on zzso while it is a difficult zzso We propose a novel simple and accurate method for matching spots in zzso zzso The method, inspired from the principle of attraction, is based on the simultaneous exploitation of multiple information such as spot distance, spot intensity, and spot pattern zzso The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and real zzso images of the zzso coli zzso and was also compared with the traditional zzso zzso zzso and zzso registration zzso The results show that the proposed method allows matching accurately and automatically spots in zzso images, and presents significantly improved performance compared to traditional registration zzso
