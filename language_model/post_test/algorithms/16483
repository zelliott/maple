The aim of this study was to examine whether it is possible to perform resuscitation according to the present European zzso Council zzso guidelines with a modified zzso in the case of special, zzso military, zzso On international missions of the German Armed Forces a rescue team only consists of an emergency physician and a zzso As the German Armed Forces require the same means of medical aid for all soldiers on every type of mission worldwide the zzso must meet the zzso zzso 

In the study 20 medical teams specialized in resuscitation were zzso Of these teams 10 were from the German Armed Forces (the physician is a certified emergency zzso and 10 were civilian (the emergency physicians had up to 28 years zzso Each team was monitored as they performed resuscitation on a simulator for a period of zzso The patient's airway was secured by a zzso tube zzso and zzso chest zzso were performed by the emergency zzso During resuscitation both team members held their zzso In addition to comparing all results to the zzso guidelines both groups were analyzed separately and compared to each zzso 

The median time needed for securing the airway was zzso without any differences between the 2 zzso In zzso of the cases the time needed for successfully securing the airway on the first attempt was less than the allowed zzso In 5 cases zzso the teams did not manage to successfully install the zzso during the first attempt (4 failed attempts were performed by civilian teams and 1 by the military emergency zzso however, all 5 teams were successful at the second zzso In the cases where the placement of the zzso was not successful at the first attempt the time required for the final and successful placement was nevertheless less than zzso During the zzso resuscitation procedure the hands-off fraction was on average zzso No differences between the two groups were noted concerning the hands-off time zzso for the civilian teams and zzso for the teams of the German Armed zzso The frequency of chest zzso was above the required zzso (for the civilian teams zzso and for the teams of the German Armed Forces zzso 

During military missions of the German Armed Forces there are no other options to perform resuscitation than by performing this procedure with only two zzso Using the zzso in a modified way securing of the airway with an zzso the performance of zzso chest zzso and an effective resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support according to the zzso guidelines of 2005 are feasible even with 2 zzso Using the zzso instead of zzso zzso to secure the airway particularly contributed to zzso the hands-off zzso
