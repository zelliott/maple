A method is presented for the automated determination of the right zzso ejection fraction zzso by digital image processing of zzso obtained by intravenous infusion of zzso zzso zzso dissolved in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso sum pictures were zzso by the addition of approximately zzso frames selected from the zzso curve of a zzso manually drawn, right zzso region of zzso After processing these two images with an zzso Wiener zzso the right zzso zzso was determined by a recently developed zzso using zzso and functional zzso The zzso was calculated for a series of 51 patients from the counts in the detected right zzso regions in the zzso and zzso sum zzso In 16 patients without evidence of zzso disease, the mean zzso was 50 zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in 18 patients with zzso pulmonary disease zzso zzso zzso and in 17 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso between two zzso of the zzso was r zzso zzso Through digital image processing, the determination of the zzso by zzso with zzso zzso showed high reliability and zzso
