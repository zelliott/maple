This paper addresses the features of zzso zzso zzso butterflies suitable for zzso segment detection and zzso The full segment parameters such as the position, zzso zzso zzso zzso and uniformity are related to the features of the zzso zzso zzso analysis and experimental data are presented in order to demonstrate and build the relationship between the zzso of segments and the features of zzso zzso An effective method is subsequently proposed to employ these relationships in order to discover the parameters of zzso Power line inspection is considered as an application of the proposed zzso The application demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for power line inspection, especially for corner detection when they cross zzso
