To date, zzso zzso filtering problems have not been solved by conventional methods for zzso dynamic systems with persistent bounded zzso This study introduces a fuzzy filtering design to deal with the zzso zzso filtering zzso First, the zzso and zzso fuzzy model is employed to approximate the zzso dynamic zzso Next, based on the fuzzy model, a fuzzy filter is developed to minimize the upper bound of zzso of the zzso error under some linear zzso inequality zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso filtering problem is transformed into a zzso filtering problem, zzso to minimize the upper bound of the zzso of the zzso error subject to some zzso zzso In this situation, the zzso zzso filtering problem can be easily solved by an zzso zzso zzso The proposed methods, which efficiently zzso the peak of zzso error due to persistent bounded zzso extend the zzso filtering problems from linear dynamic systems to zzso dynamic zzso
