We have developed an zzso zzso force field zzso for protein zzso structure zzso zzso is based on physical interactions and was zzso using experimental structures of a family of proteins believed to span a wide variety of possible zzso It contains zzso although zzso terms for hydrogen zzso Its zzso surface area zzso model was first fit to transfer energies of small zzso The parameters of the zzso model were then further zzso to stabilize the native structure of a single zzso the autonomously folding zzso zzso against competing low-energy zzso Here we validate the force field for five zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso For each zzso zzso with 2-3 A backbone root zzso zzso and correct experimental zzso distance constraints emerge as those with the lowest zzso
