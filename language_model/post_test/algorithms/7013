The aim was to demonstrate the possibility of using personal computer zzso (or generally zzso for real-time (or zzso zzso biomedical signal processing by adding a simple zzso conversion card and the mathematical zzso zzso We have realized an assembly written fast zzso transform zzso routine derived from a zzso algorithm, which is zzso zzso an zzso modified by another zzso running zzso according to the number of zzso zzso The program is implemented as a zzso to be called upon by high-level language in different zzso This approach reduces the zzso time, which is particularly useful when many zzso zzso on different data zzso are zzso zzso here are two different applications of the routine as applied to the spectral analysis of zzso ultrasound zzso and surface zzso
