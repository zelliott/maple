zzso zzso signals used to construct conventional ultrasound zzso images contain zzso information that can be examined through the zzso power zzso The zzso power spectrum is found by taking the magnitude squared of the zzso transform of a gated time segment corresponding to a region in the scattering zzso When a time segment is zzso the edges of the gated regions change the frequency content of the zzso power spectrum due to zzso of the zzso zzso windows, like the zzso window, and longer gate lengths reduce the relative contribution of the zzso zzso A new zzso correction factor was developed that partially accounted for the edge zzso The zzso correction factor gave more accurate estimates of zzso properties at small gate lengths compared to conventional zzso zzso The zzso correction factor gave estimates of zzso properties within zzso of actual values at very small gate lengths (less than 5 spatial pulse zzso in both simulations and from zzso on zzso zzso While the zzso correction factor gave higher accuracy of estimates at smaller gate zzso the precision of estimates was not improved at small gate lengths over conventional zzso zzso
