zzso consist of numerous zzso zzso and zzso cells in different stages of zzso Many of these zzso will undergo an zzso process during the lifetime of the zzso By using proper tissue preparation methods, the events within the whole zzso can be observed by using zzso zzso zzso 

Whole zzso were stained with zzso Red zzso fixed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dehydrated with methanol zzso and cleared with zzso alcohol and zzso zzso zzso Using this tissue preparation technique, the zzso becomes relatively transparent, allowing its zzso to be observed with zzso zzso A spectral imaging system zzso located on a conventional microscope was used to interpret the zzso dye zzso and fixation products in the zzso with different zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso was detected as clusters of intensely stained zzso cells located in close proximity to the zzso The fixation with zzso and zzso preserved zzso details, increased tissue fluorescence, thus increased the signal to noise of the background zzso 

zzso zzso can be zzso after they are properly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso intensely stained single cells or clusters of zzso cells in the zzso and the zzso zzso differences between zzso as an indicator of zzso and zzso fixation was used to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso revealed spectral zzso for zzso at zzso zzso and for zzso at zzso zzso The proper use of the zzso from these zzso molecules is the foundation for high quality zzso images of zzso By zzso imaging the two zzso with a zzso zzso laser and a zzso zzso laser, there was a reduction in fluorescent cross talk and an increase in image zzso
