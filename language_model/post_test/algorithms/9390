zzso protein orientation has traditionally been determined by zzso using mechanically or zzso aligned zzso Here we show a new zzso approach that zzso the need for preparing zzso aligned zzso When the protein zzso fast zzso rotation around the zzso normal, the 0 degrees zzso of the zzso averaged powder spectrum is identical to the frequency of the aligned protein whose alignment axis is along the magnetic zzso Thus, one can use zzso zzso to determine the orientation of the protein relative to the zzso zzso We demonstrate this approach on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of influenza A virus, which is known to assemble into a zzso zzso zzso zzso The fast zzso zzso diffusion of the zzso zzso bundle around the membrane normal is characterized via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical shift zzso and zzso zzso relaxation zzso We then show that zzso chemical shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso measured on these powder samples can be analyzed to yield precise tilt angles and rotation angles of the zzso The data show that the tilt angle of the zzso zzso depends on the membrane thickness to reduce the zzso zzso Moreover, the orientation of a longer zzso zzso containing both the zzso domain and zzso zzso is similar to the orientation of the zzso domain alone, suggesting that the zzso domain regulates the orientation of this protein and that structural information obtained from zzso may be zzso to the longer zzso This zzso approach for orientation determination is generally zzso and can be extended to larger membrane zzso
