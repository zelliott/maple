zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso is important for successful surgical correction and zzso evaluation of funnel chest zzso However, conventional zzso that define the severity of zzso have several limitations; manually calculated and cannot supply information about zzso We developed four zzso that can represent both the depression and the asymmetry of the zzso and can automatically be extracted by computerized image processing zzso Three zzso including zzso index zzso zzso index zzso and zzso index zzso were suggested to represent the depression of the zzso and one index, rotation index zzso to represent the asymmetry of the zzso To verify the feasibility of new zzso several synthetic images and real CT images were used to analyze the performance of new zzso and the statistical relationship with conventional Haller zzso The experimental results showed possible application of suggested zzso to the diagnosis of funnel chest zzso Suggested zzso showed clear trends of change with the severity of zzso deformation in regards to both the depression and the zzso zzso of statistical analysis showed high correlation between new zzso and zzso showing possibility of replacing zzso
