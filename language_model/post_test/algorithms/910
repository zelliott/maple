The precision of an interpretation of gas exchange records in progressive exercise is limited by the typical zzso variation in the zzso Recently, two procedures have been proposed for minimizing the zzso in the estimates of zzso gas exchange time series zzso One approach zzso an estimate of pulmonary blood flow zzso for smoothing zzso The other approach zzso an estimate of effective lung volume zzso for smoothing zzso In this paper, we formulate the smoothing problem as a general linear model and demonstrate the concurrent estimates of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, we investigate the interaction between zzso and zzso Specifically, when a high value of lung volume is used (such as the zzso resting functional residual zzso in the zzso gas exchange algorithm, the estimate of Q is biased low and the result is a less effective smoothing of the zzso In addition, we demonstrate how the Q estimate can be improved by utilizing more appropriate estimates of zzso carbon dioxide zzso
