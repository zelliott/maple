Studies of zzso shared through the zzso zzso zzso Foundation zzso have shown that regional organ procurement zzso zzso can predict negative zzso in highly zzso patients when the zzso match is of a high zzso In an attempt to offer more zzso zzso to highly zzso patients, zzso organized the High Grade Match zzso zzso 

This United Network for zzso Sharing zzso allocation zzso requires mandatory sharing of all zzso by participating centers after zzso mandatory sharing requirements have been zzso The zzso levels of sharing are: zzso 0 zzso mismatch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transplants at the same participating zzso or zzso zzso as the control zzso 

During the first 18 months of this program, the 23 participating centers shared 124 zzso of the zzso that were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or less) accounted for zzso in the zzso group, but only zzso of the controls zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso or zzso zzso represented zzso of the zzso group, but only zzso of the zzso group zzso With zzso zzso there was a shift in recipient zzso Patients with blood group O, female patients, older patients, and zzso patients all accounted for significantly larger percentages of the zzso group compared with the zzso control zzso The racial composition of the recipients of high-grade matches was, however, no different than that of the control recipients at the same zzso 

The zzso Program resulted in longer zzso times, but graft survival was not zzso The zzso zzso graft survival rate zzso for zzso zzso was not different from the control zzso graft survival zzso By sharing zzso based on improved zzso matches with consideration for high zzso the zzso Program offered more transplant opportunities to women, blood group O recipients, zzso and older zzso
