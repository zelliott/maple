zzso zzso a zzso chemical used to impart a zzso taste in many flavoring zzso has been associated with zzso zzso in several industrial zzso For workplace evaluations in zzso National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health zzso investigators used zzso zzso zzso a sampling and zzso method for airborne zzso utilizing carbon molecular sieve zzso zzso The method was subsequently suspected to progressively underestimate zzso zzso with increasing sampling site zzso Since zzso of worker exposure may lead to zzso of respiratory health risk in quantitative zzso zzso correction of the zzso zzso previously reported with zzso zzso is zzso We studied the effects of humidity and sample storage duration on recovery of zzso from experimental air samples taken from a zzso generated controlled test atmosphere that allowed control of zzso zzso temperature, relative zzso sampling zzso and sampling flow zzso zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso and results were compared with theoretical test atmosphere zzso zzso After fitting zzso models to the experimental data, we found that absolute zzso zzso zzso and days of sample storage prior to extraction affected zzso recovery as did sampling flow rate to a much smaller zzso We derived a mathematical correction procedure to more accurately estimate historical workplace zzso concentration based on zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso and sample site temperature and relative humidity (to calculate absolute zzso as well as days of sample storage prior to extraction in the zzso With this correction zzso quantitative risk assessment for zzso can proceed using corrected exposure levels for air samples previously collected and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso for airborne zzso
