zzso development for prediction of patient response to therapy is one of the goals of molecular profiling of human zzso Due to the large number of zzso relatively limited number of samples, and high zzso of data, identification of zzso zzso is a challenge for data zzso Furthermore, many genes may be responsible for drug response differences, but often only a few are sufficient for accurate zzso Here we present an analysis approach, the zzso Random Forest zzso method, for the identification of highly zzso zzso The aim is to select from zzso expression data a small number of zzso zzso that could be developed into a simple and robust diagnostic zzso Our method combines the Random Forest zzso and gene expression zzso to rank and select a small number of zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso approach by analyzing four different data zzso The first set contains transcript profiles of whole blood from zzso arthritis patients, collected before zzso treatment, and their subsequent response to the zzso In this set, zzso identified 8 transcripts predicting response to therapy with zzso zzso We also applied the zzso to the analysis of three previously published expression data zzso For all sets, we have compared the zzso and zzso support zzso machines zzso approaches to feature selection and zzso In all cases the zzso selects much smaller number of features, five to eight zzso while achieving similar or better performance on both training and independent testing sets of zzso For both methods performance estimates using zzso is similar to performance on independent zzso The method has been implemented in R and is available from the authors upon zzso zzso
