To establish whether clinically significant zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be excluded in adult patients undergoing zzso zzso without using zzso flow zzso 

zzso Health Science Centre, a zzso referral zzso with full cardiovascular services affiliated with the University of Toronto, Toronto, zzso 

zzso zzso models were developed from a retrospective review of zzso zzso consecutive zzso from 1991 through zzso The dependent variable was more than mild zzso or zzso zzso zzso Independent variables included age, sex and various functional and structural measures obtained during routine two-dimensional zzso The negative zzso values and sensitivity of the models were zzso 

The number of patients correctly classified by these models, as well as the proportion for whom the zzso flow imaging did not add to the baseline zzso was zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain confidence intervals for these zzso 

Ten models were developed, with negative zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso of such decision aids into the software of zzso machinery would help zzso to rule out significant zzso or zzso zzso zzso In practices where zzso flow imaging is routinely zzso zzso fewer procedures could be zzso 

Models based on simple demographic and two-dimensional zzso variables can reliably exclude significant zzso zzso and could potentially reduce the volumes and costs of zzso flow zzso Given the widespread diffusion of zzso zzso imaging, the models may also be helpful to avoid zzso of flow imaging results, by defining zzso in whom the prior probability of significant zzso or zzso zzso is extremely zzso
