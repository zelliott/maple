The focus of this work is on modeling blood flow in zzso systemic arteries assuming zzso zzso zzso zzso flow, and zzso of zzso zzso The aim was to develop a reduced model that would capture certain physical phenomena that have been neglected in the derivation of the standard zzso zzso one-dimensional models, while at the same time keeping the zzso simulations fast and simple, utilizing one-dimensional zzso The viscous zzso equations were used to describe the flow and the zzso zzso membrane equations to model the mechanical properties of zzso zzso Using zzso and homogenization theory, a novel closed, zzso zzso model was zzso In contrast with the standard one-dimensional model, the new model zzso zzso the viscous dissipation of the fluid, zzso the zzso nature of the blood flow - vessel wall interaction, zzso the zzso loop in the zzso zzso walls zzso and zzso two-dimensional flow effects to the zzso zzso A zzso solver based on the zzso zzso zzso was developed and the zzso simulations were compared with the ultrasound imaging and zzso flow loop zzso Less than zzso of difference in the zzso and less than zzso of difference in the maximum diameter was zzso showing excellent agreement between the model and the zzso
