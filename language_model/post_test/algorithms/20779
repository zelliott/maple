This paper compares two methods for zzso room acoustic parameters from reverberated speech and zzso An approach which uses statistical machine learning, previously developed for speech, is extended to work with zzso For speech, zzso time zzso are within a zzso difference zzso of the true zzso For music, virtually all early zzso time zzso are within a difference zzso of the true zzso The zzso accuracy is not good enough in other cases due to differences between the simulated data set used to develop the empirical model and real zzso The second method carries out a maximum likelihood zzso on zzso zzso at the end of notes or speech zzso This paper extends the method to estimate parameters relating to the balance of early and late energies in the impulse zzso For zzso time and speech, the method provides zzso which are within the zzso difference zzso of the true zzso For other parameters such as clarity, the zzso are not sufficiently accurate due to the natural zzso of the zzso zzso Speech is a better test signal than music because of the greater periods of silence in the zzso although music is needed for low frequency zzso
