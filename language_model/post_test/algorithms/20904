There is an increasing recognition that zzso spatial and zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso dynamics and zzso In particular, the patterns of contact within and between zzso zzso zzso at different spatial and zzso scales may reveal important mechanisms governing zzso zzso Using 7 years of data on the interaction between the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso and fire pink zzso zzso we show how the application of zzso explicit and implicit network models can be used to make accurate predictions of infection dynamics in zzso structured zzso zzso consideration of both spatial and zzso organization reveals the role of each in spreading risk for both the host and the zzso This work suggests that the application of zzso explicit network models can yield important insights into how zzso structure can promote the persistence of species in natural zzso
