Biological organisms possess an unparalleled ability to control the structure and properties of zzso zzso They are able, for example, to guide the formation of smoothly curving single zzso or tough, lightweight, zzso skeletal zzso In many zzso an organic zzso interacts with the mineral as it forms, controls its zzso and zzso and is zzso during zzso The remarkable functional properties of the resulting zzso as outstanding fracture toughness and wear zzso be attributed to buried zzso zzso at multiple zzso zzso zzso and controlling such zzso at the zzso length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid zzso However, zzso the structural and chemical complexity of buried zzso zzso presents a challenge to state-of-the-art imaging zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso reveals three-dimensional chemical maps of organic zzso with a diameter of zzso in the surrounding zzso zzso zzso mineral in the tooth of a marine zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso most zzso zzso with either sodium or zzso Furthermore, zzso of these zzso in the zzso indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously zzso Our results demonstrate that in the zzso zzso individual organic zzso have different chemical compositions, and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to detect this zzso zzso by virtue of its high three-dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic zzso We anticipate that the quantitative analysis and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of zzso (such as bone, zzso and zzso but also of synthetic zzso zzso
