The zzso association test zzso an extension of zzso test, zzso on linkage zzso to assess the association of genetic markers and traits in nuclear zzso It does not permit a formal inclusion of zzso although an offset under the zzso zzso option allows for an overall zzso zzso The zzso software provides additional features and permits the inclusion of zzso in the zzso test zzso but does not account for the parental zzso information when the traits are adjusted for the zzso We propose the weighted zzso zzso zzso method to generate trait values adjusted for both parental zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expected to be more powerful, because the zzso is minimized considering both of these factors simultaneously using a weighted zzso zzso Two simulated zzso trio data sets, both with a zzso and the second with a gene by zzso interaction, were simulated to compare zzso power with zzso and zzso for a quantitative zzso zzso is most powerful when levels of significance are greater and zzso have a larger influence, indicating zzso may be especially effective when multiple comparisons are an important consideration, such as with whole zzso association zzso zzso will also improve the cost of an association study when environmental zzso are zzso A zzso program zzso for generating zzso zzso that can be input to the current versions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso software is zzso
