Complex diseases, by definition, involve multiple factors, including zzso interactions and zzso zzso Researchers commonly rely on simulated data to evaluate their approaches for detecting zzso interactions in disease gene zzso A publicly available simulation program to generate samples involving complex genetic and environmental interactions is of great interest to the zzso We have developed a software package named zzso which has been widely used since its zzso In this article, we present an upgraded version zzso which not only zzso its capacity to generate realistic zzso data but also provides great functionality and flexibility to simulate various interaction zzso In addition to a zzso version, a zzso web server zzso has been set up to help users to build complex interaction zzso Furthermore, by utilizing three zzso models as an example, we have shown how realistic model parameters can be chosen in generating simulated zzso
