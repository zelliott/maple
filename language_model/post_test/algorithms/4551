In this article, the influence of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso containing 60 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso mostly used in zzso were sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were prepared by using stationary method with a long period of storage in the refrigerator following the steam zzso zzso and plate zzso zzso readings were modeled by using the zzso power law, which was validated by zzso zzso in the range of zzso In comparison to the zzso without zzso the significant decrease in zzso was observed in the presence of zzso zzso in zzso of 10 zzso and 30 zzso On the other hand, the addition of sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in increasing of zzso of zzso The differences were zzso when the zzso zzso zzso the apparent zzso zzso was zzso in contrast to using the area under zzso zzso data when the significant effect of sodium zzso could be zzso zzso in conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso data could be zzso In the investigation of gentle plastic zzso zzso the allocation of the lower limit of the integration to yield value is emphasized, which prevents the integration of a negative portion of flow curve and, consequently, the lower values of zzso to be zzso
