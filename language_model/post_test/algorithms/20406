We present a novel method for the blind reconstruction of the cardiac sympathetic nerve activity zzso in the zzso zzso band zzso zzso using only heart rate and zzso blood zzso The originality of the method consists in the application of blind source separation techniques to obtain an observer of zzso We show how this observer can be deduced from a linear model of the cardiovascular system by introduction of the fundamental assumptions about the independence of the cardiac sympathetic an zzso zzso In cardiovascular applications, the reliability of the observer has been assessed by zzso of the fundamental assumption for the given zzso A primer qualitative validation has been performed using the muscle sympathetic nerve activity as an indirect indicator of zzso Very satisfying and promising results have been zzso Moreover, we have performed quantitative zzso of the observer in various experimental conditions known to elicit selectively cardiac sympathetic or zzso zzso The experimental conditions include a zzso degrees tilt test, indirect sympathetic zzso by medication, and sympathetic stimulation by zzso zzso We show that the observer allows to highlight changing levels of the cardiac sympathetic activity in the zzso band in all these experimental zzso
