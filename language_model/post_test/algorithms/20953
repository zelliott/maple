This study compares a zzso of zzso models reported in the literature with two novel zzso models for identifying human input respiratory zzso The analysis is carried out on typical patient data obtained with the forced zzso technique zzso on three sets of representative diagnosed zzso healthy, asthma and zzso The performance of the models is characterized by the error between the true respiratory zzso of the patient and the estimated zzso by the zzso zzso The optimal solutions of the zzso zzso are zzso The resulting zzso values are discussed with respect to both model structure and zzso zzso
