zzso simulation by using force field parameters has been widely applied in the fields of zzso and protein research for various zzso We recently proposed a new zzso protein force field, called the zzso force field, which zzso single zzso acid zzso zzso as the fundamental zzso In this article, whole sets of the zzso force field parameters in zzso in zzso and in water have been developed by zzso zzso calculation for all 20 zzso zzso acids and applied to zzso Carlo molecular simulation for two short zzso The zzso separation approximation method was employed to obtain the zzso parameters for the zzso acids with a long side zzso zzso Carlo simulation for zzso zzso by using the zzso force field revealed that the zzso in zzso is mainly controlled by strong zzso interactions between the zzso acid zzso while the zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso are zzso in zzso In zzso the zzso would be determined by the combination of the three zzso On the other hand, the zzso simulation for zzso zzso reasonably reproduced a zzso zzso structure in water although the zzso and zzso zzso were different from the native zzso It was suggested that the zzso force field is a useful tool for analyzing zzso of zzso in terms of intrinsic zzso zzso of the single zzso acid zzso
