The analysis of pelvic CT scans is a crucial step for detecting and assessing the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso the processing of pelvic CT scans could impact decision zzso decrease the time for decision making, and reduce health care zzso This paper discusses a method to automate the zzso of bone from pelvic CT zzso zzso zzso of bone is very important for developing an automated zzso support system for zzso zzso zzso diagnosis and zzso 

The automated method for pelvic CT bone zzso is a zzso approach that combines filtering and zzso zzso for image enhancement, zzso analysis and automated seeded region zzso zzso results of zzso are used to identify the region where bone is present and to target zzso zzso towards the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso filter is applied to accentuate the desired features in the zzso zzso seeded region growing is performed to refine the initial bone zzso zzso 

The proposed method automatically processes pelvic CT images and produces accurate zzso Bone connectivity is achieved and the contours and sizes of bones are true to the actual zzso and size displayed in the original zzso zzso are promising and show great potential for fracture detection and assessing zzso presence and zzso 

zzso experimental results of the automated method show accurate bone zzso The novelty of the method lies in the unique zzso combination of image enhancement and zzso methods that aims at maximizing the advantages of the combined zzso The proposed method has the following zzso it produces accurate bone zzso with maintaining bone zzso and size true to the original image and is suitable for automated bone zzso from pelvic CT zzso
