We investigate two approaches to increase the efficiency of zzso prediction from zzso zzso which is a key step for zzso selection zzso in plant and animal zzso The first approach is feature selection based on zzso zzso which provide a zzso framework for identifying zzso zzso Fitting zzso models using only the zzso markers results in simpler models, which may allow cost savings from reduced zzso We show that this is accompanied by no loss, and possibly a small gain, in zzso power for four zzso models: partial least squares zzso zzso regression, zzso and elastic zzso The second approach is the choice of kinship zzso for zzso best linear unbiased prediction zzso We compare zzso based on different combinations of zzso and zzso of marker zzso and a newly proposed kinship measure that adjusts for linkage zzso zzso We illustrate the use of both approaches and examine their performances using three real-world data sets with continuous zzso traits from plant and animal zzso We find that elastic net with feature selection and zzso using zzso zzso performed similarly well, and were the best-performing methods in our zzso
