This paper concerns with predicting the regulatory targets of a zzso factor zzso We propose and study a joint model that combines the use of zzso zzso gene expression and DNA sequence data zzso a zzso mixture model is used to realize zzso learning, which however can be extended to zzso learning zzso We applied the methods to an E coli zzso to identify the target genes of zzso which, along with applications to simulated data, demonstrated potential gains of jointly modeling multiple types of data over using only one type of zzso
