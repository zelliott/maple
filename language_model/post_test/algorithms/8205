Ensemble zzso have been shown efficient in multiple zzso In this article, the authors explore the effectiveness of ensemble zzso in a zzso zzso diagnosis system for detection of masses in zzso They evaluate two general ways of constructing zzso by zzso of the available development zzso Random division and random zzso Furthermore, they discuss the problem of selecting the ensemble size and propose two zzso incremental techniques that automatically select the size for the problem at zzso All the techniques are evaluated with respect to a previously proposed zzso zzso system zzso The experimental results show that the examined ensemble techniques provide a statistically significant improvement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in performance as compared to the original zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Some of the techniques allow for a notable reduction in the total number of examples stored in the case base (to zzso of the original zzso which, in turn, results in lower storage requirements and a shorter response time of the zzso Among the methods examined in this article, the two proposed zzso techniques are by far the most effective for this zzso Furthermore, the authors provide some discussion and guidance for choosing the ensemble zzso
