A zzso model of cardiac tissue was used to study the zzso of zzso current zzso from zzso potential zzso 

The simulated zzso of zzso current was compared with the simulated zzso current zzso and both simulated values were compared with zzso derived zzso obtained during zzso rhythm and zzso zzso in zzso We found that although zzso zzso slightly overestimate the duration of the zzso zzso they provide a reasonable approximation of zzso during normal zzso and during zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There is a very clear linear correlation between the time spent at or below zzso of the peak inward zzso current zzso its corresponding estimate zzso the peak inward zzso and zzso and the peak zzso zzso providing some evidence that zzso may be a suitable in zzso measure of peak zzso zzso
