zzso receptors zzso participate in many disease pathways and represent the largest family of therapeutic zzso Thus, great investments are made to discover drugs modulating zzso zzso Among functional zzso for screening zzso the zzso imaging zzso is based on zzso of zzso zzso to an activated zzso and has become widely used in zzso zzso However, assessing zzso alone has zzso relying on a single zzso step of zzso zzso during zzso zzso providing no information on the zzso zzso zzso fate, and using only a single fluorescent color zzso fluorescent zzso Taking full advantage of zzso imaging to screen approximately 2000 compounds, the authors zzso the zzso zzso with an zzso zzso of zzso zzso This approach identified and classified 377 compounds interfering with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, a subset of compounds was analyzed for their performance across imaging, zzso calcium release zzso imaging plate reader zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso zzso proximity zzso This indicated that the imaging zzso have even better zzso power for direct zzso of zzso binding than the zzso zzso In conclusion, compounds inducing unique responses can suggest novel mechanisms of action and be used as tools to study zzso zzso and zzso
