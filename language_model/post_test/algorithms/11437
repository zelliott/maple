zzso cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the male zzso Fortunately, the prognosis is excellent if detected at an early zzso zzso the detection and zzso of prostate cancer is crucial for diagnosis, as well as treatment via targeted focal zzso New imaging techniques can potentially be invaluable tools for improving prostate cancer detection and zzso 

In this study, we introduce a new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging, where the tissue being zzso is characterized by the joint correlation of diffusion signal zzso across multiple zzso pulse strengths and zzso By taking into account signal zzso at different water diffusion motion sensitivities, correlated diffusion imaging can provide improved zzso between zzso tissue and healthy tissue when compared to existing diffusion imaging zzso 

zzso evaluation using receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis, tissue class zzso analysis, and visual assessment by an expert zzso were performed to study correlated diffusion imaging for the task of prostate cancer zzso These results are compared with that obtained using zzso imaging and standard diffusion imaging (via the apparent diffusion zzso zzso Experimental results suggest that correlated diffusion imaging provide improved zzso between healthy and zzso tissue and may have potential as a diagnostic tool for cancer detection and zzso in the prostate zzso 

A new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging zzso was developed for the purpose of aiding zzso in cancer detection and zzso in the prostate zzso zzso results show zzso shows considerable promise as a diagnostic aid for zzso in the detection and zzso of prostate zzso
