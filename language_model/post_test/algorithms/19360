Although the advent of antibiotics and improved dental care decreased the zzso and zzso deep neck infections zzso are not uncommon and present a challenging problem due to the complex anatomy and potentially lethal complications that may zzso 

This study reviews our experience with zzso and tries to identify the zzso factors of life-threatening zzso 

A retrospective review was conducted of patients who were diagnosed as having zzso in the Department of zzso and in the Department of zzso Diseases at zzso Regional Hospital from 1995 to zzso zzso between life-threatening complications and other factors were determined by zzso test, zzso exact test and zzso zzso test as zzso 

One hundred zzso charts were recorded; 95 zzso were men, and 72 zzso were women, with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso There were 39 patients zzso who had associated systemic diseases, with zzso zzso of those having diabetes zzso The lateral zzso and zzso spaces were the most commonly involved zzso Upper airway infections and zzso infections were the two most common causes of zzso zzso and zzso of the known causes, zzso The zzso remained unknown in 45 patients zzso zzso staphylococcus zzso and zzso zzso were the most common organisms, identified through zzso Of the zzso group zzso zzso 42 patients zzso underwent surgical drainage under general zzso Thirty-one patients zzso developed life-threatening zzso airway obstruction zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso jugular vein zzso zzso zzso zzso and pneumonia zzso zzso zzso Compared with other patients, the unique features of patients with life-threatening complications were as zzso older age zzso zzso zzso a higher white blood cell count zzso zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso zzso associated systemic disease zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior visceral space involvement zzso zzso zzso and zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso 

zzso continue to occur and these are associated with significant morbidity and mortality even in this era of zzso Furthermore, the widespread and inappropriate use of antibiotics may change the clinical presentation and course of these infections, making them more elusive and less predictable also in complicated zzso The clinical assessment of patients who are older, with zzso formation, underlying systemic diseases, diabetes zzso visceral anterior space or zzso involvement requires careful consideration of potential zzso
