Cell biologists strive to characterize molecular interactions directly in the zzso zzso The intrinsic resolution of optical zzso however, allows zzso of only coarse zzso zzso By zzso information from molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grants access to processes on a molecular scale, such as zzso zzso zzso reactions and zzso and has become a valuable tool for studies in living zzso Here we review basic principles of zzso and focus on seminal applications, including examples of zzso signaling and zzso We consider zzso in the context of zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso imaging techniques and discuss application strategies and recent technical zzso
