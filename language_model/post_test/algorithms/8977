Biological networks have two zzso The first mode is zzso a network is a passage on which something zzso The second mode is zzso a network is a pattern constructed by gluing functions of entities zzso the zzso In this paper, first we discuss that these two modes can be associated with the category zzso duality zzso and derive a natural network structure (a path zzso for each mode by appealing to the category zzso zzso The path notion corresponding to the zzso mode is just the usual directed zzso The path notion for the dynamic mode is called lateral path which is the alternating path considered on the set of zzso Their general zzso in a network are transport and zzso zzso Second, we introduce a zzso zzso of arcs for each mode and see how the two modes are embedded in various real biological network zzso We find that there is a zzso relationship between the two zzso if the value of one is large then the value of the other is zzso This can be seen as a kind of division of labor in a network into transport on the network and zzso of the zzso Finally, we propose an zzso model of networks based on a quality function involving zzso of the two modes in order to see how networks with the above zzso relationship can emerge through zzso We show that the zzso relationship can be observed in the evolved networks only when the dynamic mode is dominant in the quality function by zzso zzso We also show that the evolved networks have features zzso similar to real biological networks by standard complex network zzso
