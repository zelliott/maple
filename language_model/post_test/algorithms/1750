It has been alleged in several papers that the so-called delayed zzso random walks zzso provide a model for the one-dimensional telegraph equation at microscopic zzso This conclusion, being widespread now, is strange, since the telegraph equation describes phenomena with finite propagation speed, while the zzso of the motion of particles in the zzso is zzso In this paper we investigate the accuracy of the approximations to the zzso provided by the telegraph zzso We show that the diffusion zzso being the correct limit of the zzso gives better approximations in zzso norm to the zzso than the telegraph zzso We zzso therefore, that first, the zzso do not provide any correct microscopic interpretation of the one-dimensional telegraph zzso and second, the kinetic zzso model of the telegraph equation is different from the model based on the zzso
