The zzso coronary heart disease zzso functions overestimate the risk of zzso in countries with a low zzso zzso these functions should be zzso for the purpose of primary zzso zzso zzso function charts of overall zzso risk for the Spanish population are zzso Patients and zzso The zzso functions were zzso by substituting the prevalence of zzso risk factors and zzso found in zzso with the same values for zzso The zzso function that included zzso zzso zzso cholesterol was zzso The 10-year probability of developing a zzso event was estimated for several combinations of risk factors and HDL levels ranging from 35 to 59 zzso zzso charts were prepared that show the exact probability of zzso corresponding to each combination of risk factors, shown in separate cells on the zzso 

The event rate and prevalence of zzso risk factors differed considerably between zzso and zzso HDL zzso 35 zzso increased risk by approximately 50% and HDL zzso 60 zzso reduced it by zzso The proportion of cells in which the 10-year probability of developing a zzso event was zzso zzso was zzso times higher and that of cells with a probability zzso zzso was 13 times lower in the chart zzso for Spain than in the original zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso function may help to more accurately estimate the overall risk of zzso in the Spanish population for primary prevention zzso The zzso function should be zzso and the development of functions for the Spanish population should be zzso
