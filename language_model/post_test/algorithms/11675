zzso is the first study to demonstrate an influence of dietary sodium on zzso copper zzso in zzso We examined possible interactions between dietary sodium and the response of freshwater rainbow trout zzso zzso to zzso copper in light of recent evidence of interactions between sodium and copper metabolism in the zzso Trout were maintained for 6 days on one of four diets of increasing sodium concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso sodium by mass, zzso At the end of 7 days, fish were exposed for 6 h to zzso copper spiked with zzso to determine if the dietary sodium affected responses to a subsequent short-term zzso copper zzso The zzso allowed us to distinguish between zzso occurring in fish zzso before the experiment and zzso zzso zzso arising from the experimental zzso zzso sodium zzso of zzso or zzso reduced newly accumulated copper zzso in zzso (from zzso zzso zzso in control to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in fish fed zzso or zzso zzso zzso respectively), liver (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), kidney (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), plasma (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and gut (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso diets also increased plasma and gut sodium zzso by zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso respectively, relative to fish maintained on zzso zzso Whole body zzso rates of both sodium and copper were significantly reduced, and highly correlated zzso with one another, in fish fed zzso diets relative to zzso Moreover, sodium zzso was zzso and 38% higher in fish fed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Fish fed zzso diets also drank more water, but the contribution of drinking to zzso copper zzso was zzso From these results, we speculate that, at least in part, zzso sodium and copper share a common zzso zzso route, probably through an zzso sodium zzso According to this hypothesis, as the channel is zzso with increasing internal sodium zzso both sodium and copper zzso from the water are zzso
