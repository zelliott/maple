While conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has long been used to study multiple sclerosis zzso more sensitive and specific approaches to studying both zzso zzso and normal appearing white matter zzso are needed to gain a better understanding of the zzso of the zzso Two zzso techniques thought to offer insight regarding zzso and zzso integrity are zzso relaxation and diffusion zzso imaging zzso In this study, metrics obtained from zzso relaxation zzso zzso water content zzso and zzso zzso and zzso experiments (in particular the fractional zzso mean zzso zzso parallel zzso zzso and perpendicular zzso zzso were compared for 19 zzso patients within both zzso and zzso zzso with the goal of better understanding how each of the measures are affected by zzso In particular, it was successfully determined that the detection of a zzso signal within an zzso zzso is indicative of a different underlying pathology than is present in zzso without zzso zzso All of the diffusion metrics were significantly different in zzso with a zzso signal than in those zzso While no significant correlations were found between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso and only weak correlations were found in zzso without zzso signal zzso zzso strong correlations were observed in zzso exhibiting zzso signal zzso zzso
