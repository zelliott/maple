Worldwide effort on sampling and characterization of molecular variation within a large number of human and animal pathogens has lead to the emergence of zzso sequence typing zzso databases as an important tool for studying the epidemiology and evolution of zzso Many of these databases are currently harboring several thousands of zzso DNA sequence types zzso enriched with zzso over traits such as zzso zzso resistance, host zzso etc of the zzso zzso of the databases have thus the possibility of dividing the pathogen populations into zzso representing different evolutionary zzso geographically associated groups, or other zzso which are defined in terms of molecular similarities and zzso residing within a zzso When combined with the existing zzso such zzso may provide invaluable information for assessing the position of a new set of zzso in relation to the whole pathogen zzso 

To enable users of zzso schemes to query the databases with sets of new bacterial zzso and to automatically analyze their relation to existing curated zzso we introduce here a zzso zzso method for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our method can use an zzso database as a training set and assign simultaneously any set of query sequences into the earlier discovered zzso while also allowing some or all of these sequences to form previously undiscovered genetically distinct zzso This tool provides zzso zzso of the zzso uncertainty and is highly efficient zzso thus enabling rapid analyses of large databases and sets of query zzso The latter feature is a necessary prerequisite for an automated access through the zzso web zzso We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by zzso both real and zzso data from zzso zzso The introduced method for zzso zzso of sets of query zzso is freely available for Windows, Mac zzso X and Linux operative systems in zzso zzso software which is downloadable at zzso The query functionality is also directly available for the zzso zzso database at zzso and shortly will be available for other species databases hosted at this web zzso 

We have introduced a zzso tool for automated zzso zzso of new pathogen samples that can be integrated into the web interface of the zzso zzso In particular, when combined with the existing zzso the zzso labeling may provide invaluable information for assessing the position of a new set of query strains in relation to the particular pathogen population represented by the curated zzso information will be useful both for clinical and basic research zzso
