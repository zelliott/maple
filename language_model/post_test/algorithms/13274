In kidney paired donation zzso flexibility in the allocation of incompatible pairs is required if a critical mass of pairs to efficiently find matches cannot be zzso 

In the Australian zzso program, virtual zzso is used for the allocation of suitable donors to registered zzso zzso is based on acceptable zzso and donors are excluded from matching to recipients with zzso zzso zzso greater than 2000 mean zzso intensity zzso Match and transplant rates in the first year of the program were reviewed with respect to recipient and donor zzso including blood group distribution, level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Four quarterly match runs were performed, which included 53 pairs and 2 zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the listed zzso In the second run, the zzso threshold was increased to greater than 8000 zzso because no matches were found with standard zzso zzso zzso matching was introduced from run zzso zzso were identified in 37 zzso patients, of whom zzso had a negative zzso with their matched zzso zzso positive results were found only in recipients with zzso greater than 2000 zzso in the second zzso In 4 cases zzso reasons and in 4 cases other reasons resulted in breakdown of chains and 17 patients not progressing to zzso Eventually, 20 zzso patients received a zzso zzso and zzso of these had a calculated zzso zzso greater than zzso 

zzso using virtual zzso is a valid and effective solution for patients with zzso incompatible donors even in the context of highly zzso zzso
