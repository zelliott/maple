zzso in zzso due to zzso of zzso data can be caused by motion of the subject or characteristics of the zzso A general solution for zzso zzso that reduces zzso without zzso modeling is zzso Separate image data sets are acquired in which the phase and frequency directions are zzso In these two data sets, the image signal is zzso whereas the ghost signals are zzso By taking a correlation of these two data sets, an image with greatly reduced zzso is zzso The reduction is shown to depend both on the correct signal intensity of the image, as well as the ghost intensity in the ghosted zzso The reduction approaches zzso in regions of low image zzso and is more moderate in regions of higher image zzso The process was applied to conventional zzso zzso and zzso echo imaging of volunteers and a zzso zzso of a reader study of the volunteer images reflected a significant overall reduction of zzso artifacts in all volunteer zzso
