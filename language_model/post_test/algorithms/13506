In this study, we investigate a zzso approach to video zzso based on zzso Random Field and statistical conditional sampling in order to further improve zzso rate while maintaining high-quality zzso In the proposed approach, representative zzso within a video shot are identified and stored at full zzso The remaining frames within the video shot are stored and compressed at a reduced zzso At the zzso stage, a zzso dictionary is constructed from the zzso and used to restore the reduced resolution frames to the original resolution via statistical conditional zzso The sampling approach is based on the conditional probability of the zzso modeling by use of the constructed zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso approach via statistical conditional sampling has potential for improving zzso rates when compared to zzso the video at full resolution, while achieving higher video quality when compared to zzso the video at reduced zzso
