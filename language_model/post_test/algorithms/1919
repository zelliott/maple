Pulmonary zzso patients harboring zzso zzso can benefit from zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Reliable molecular analyses and precise pathological reporting of the zzso zzso status are factors essential for patient treatment and zzso More than zzso of all zzso zzso analyses are performed on zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso However, zzso may not be sufficient for zzso analysis due to low tumor content and zzso with zzso zzso To define the minimal concentration of tumor cells required for reliable zzso zzso zzso by zzso sequencing and to develop an zzso for routine zzso on biopsy material, we determined total numbers of tumor and zzso cells, calculated the tumor cell concentration and serially diluted DNA from zzso zzso by adding DNA of zzso cells from the same zzso A counted tumor cell concentration of zzso which refers to a zzso estimated concentration of zzso is necessary for reliable detection of all zzso Based on these data, we developed an zzso for evidence-based zzso zzso analysis by zzso sequencing in biopsy zzso which was subsequently applied to 461 diagnostic zzso zzso diagnostic testing results in zzso reliable zzso zzso analyses of biopsy zzso while in zzso of cases zzso had to be zzso
