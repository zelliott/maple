Walking is a constrained movement which may best be observed during the double stance phase when both feet contact the zzso When analyzing a measured movement with an inverse dynamics model, a violation of these constraints will always occur due to measuring errors and zzso of the segments model from reality, leading to inconsistent zzso zzso is obtained by implementing the constraints into the zzso This makes it possible to combine the inverse dynamics model with zzso techniques in order to predict walking patterns or to reconstruct zzso zzso when only a part of the three-dimensional joint zzso is zzso In this paper the outlines of the extended inverse dynamics method are zzso the constraints which define walking are defined and the zzso procedure is zzso The model is applied to analyze a normal walking pattern of which only the hip, knee and ankle zzso are zzso This input movement is reconstructed to a zzso and zzso consistent three-dimensional movement, and the joint forces (including the ground reaction zzso and joint moments of force, needed to bring about this movement are zzso
