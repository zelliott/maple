We developed an automatic quantitative zzso for the measurement of regional zzso wall motion and wall zzso from three-dimensional gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso measures the motion of the three-dimensional zzso surface using a modification of the zzso method, as well as wall zzso using both geometry zzso zzso and partial volume zzso 

The zzso was tested using a zzso zzso heart zzso and the quantitative results were compared with visual zzso assessment of zzso motion and zzso in 79 clinical patients with a wide range of ejection zzso zzso to zzso 

Phantom zzso of simulated motion and zzso were accurate regardless of the camera used zzso or triple zzso the angular span of reconstructed data zzso degrees or 360 zzso the amount of motion (3 or 6 zzso or the amount of zzso zzso 50% or zzso zzso zzso of zzso motion and zzso in the patients were correlated with visual scores zzso zzso zzso exact agreement zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso exact agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inverse linear relations exist between the global zzso visual motion score and the average quantitative motion, and between the global zzso visual zzso score and the average quantitative zzso Automatic quantitative ejection fraction zzso correlated extremely well with average quantitative motion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our zzso is accurate and may be the first automatic technique for the quantitative three-dimensional assessment of regional zzso function in zzso
