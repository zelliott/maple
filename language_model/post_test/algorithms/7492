Millions of people worldwide suffer from fragility fractures, which cause significant zzso financial costs and even zzso The gold standard to zzso structural properties of zzso bone is based on the zzso parameters obtained from zzso images of clinical bone biopsy zzso The currently used image processing approaches are not able to fully explain the variation in bone zzso In this study, we introduce the zzso tree connectivity zzso as a novel zzso zzso to study zzso bone zzso With zzso we calculate a new connectivity measure for zzso bone by using zzso tree representation of zzso images and zzso graph zzso To test our approach, we use zzso bone zzso obtained from 55 female zzso We study the correlation of zzso with zzso test results as well as other zzso parameters obtained from zzso The results based on our zzso show that zzso is the 3rd best zzso feature of ultimate bone strength after bone volume fraction and degree of zzso
