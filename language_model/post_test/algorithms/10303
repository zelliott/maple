In order to build quantitative zzso relationship zzso models for virtual screening of novel zzso zzso zzso and hit ranking selections, a new zzso zzso has been developed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso using a combined molecular zzso and zzso search zzso Both zzso features and shape zzso were considered using a number of molecular zzso including zzso similarity and Unity zzso fit, in addition to other molecular properties such as molecular weight, zzso molecular volume, molecular area, molecular polar volume, molecular polar surface area and zzso zzso zzso partial least squares zzso analyses were carried out to derive zzso models linking zzso and the zzso mentioned, using a training set of 25 zzso zzso Good prediction capability was confirmed for the best zzso model by evaluation against a test set of a further 20 zzso zzso The zzso and molecular zzso zzso scoring function now established can be used to predict the biological properties of virtual hits or untested compounds obtained from zzso virtual zzso
