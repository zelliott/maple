Many methods have been described to predict the zzso location of proteins from sequence zzso However, most of these methods either rely on global sequence properties or use a set of known protein targeting motifs to predict protein zzso Here, we develop and test a novel method that identifies potential targeting motifs using a zzso approach based on hidden zzso models zzso zzso These models search for motifs that are present in a compartment but absent in other, nearby, compartments by utilizing an zzso structure that mimics the protein sorting zzso We show that both zzso motif finding and the zzso structure improve zzso prediction on a benchmark data set of zzso zzso The motifs identified can be mapped to known targeting motifs and they are more zzso than the average protein zzso Using our zzso predictions, we can identify potential zzso errors in public databases for the location of some of the zzso A software zzso and the data set described in this paper are available from zzso
