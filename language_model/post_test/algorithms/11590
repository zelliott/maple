zzso proteins have a central role in the development and zzso of an zzso These proteins are very important for understanding the mechanism of programmed cell zzso Many efforts in pharmaceutical research have been aimed at understanding their structure and zzso Unfortunately, thus far, very few zzso protein structures have been zzso In contrast, many zzso protein sequences are known, and many more are expected to come in the near zzso Because of the extremely unbalanced state, it would be worthwhile to develop a fast zzso method to identify their zzso location so as to gain some insight about their biological zzso In view of this, a study was initiated in an attempt to identify the zzso location of zzso proteins according to their sequences by means of the zzso zzso function, which was established based on the zzso distance and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were quite promising, indicating that the zzso location of zzso proteins are predictable to a considerably accurate extent if a good training data set can be zzso It is expected that, with a continuous improvement of the training data set by incorporating more and more new data, the current method might eventually become a useful tool in this area because the function of an zzso protein is closely related to its zzso zzso
