International standards draw attention to the steps that risk assessment should follow to first identify zzso then proceed to risk evaluation and zzso if necessary, risk zzso The same logic also applies to risk assessment of manual patient zzso 

To check appropriateness of approach to zzso zzso of manual patient handling using zzso a cross zzso study was carried out aimed at checking the relationship between this new risk assessment model zzso zzso and occurrence of acute low back zzso 

After proper training the zzso screening method was used to assess risk of manual handling of patients in 31 zzso covering 411 exposed subjects employed in geriatric hospitals belonging to the zzso (National Union zzso and Social Welfare zzso of the Veneto zzso At the same time health data were collected on the occurrence of low back pain episodes during the last year both in the group of exposed subjects and in an external reference group zzso zzso zzso and clinical assessment data were verified and checked by the zzso research zzso zzso analysis was used as a method to evaluate the relationship between zzso screening risk index and acute low back zzso 

zzso the relationship between acute low back pain episodes and levels of zzso screening index, carried out only on exposed subjects who reported working for at least 30 hours per week zzso showed definitely positive trends: for zzso screening index of exposure levels between zzso and 5, OR were double zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas for index levels exceeding 5, OR were about 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso These results did not show significant differences when correcting the analysis for zzso factors such as gender and age zzso 

The results of the study indicate that the proposed method, zzso zzso can be a useful tool to estimate risk due to manual handling of patients and can also be used to test the efficacy of preventive zzso
