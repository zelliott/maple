The effects of site exchange due to slow zzso changes in rapidly rotating molecules in solution are examined in zzso zzso gaps in the currently available theory are zzso The effects of site exchange on the zzso zzso of a simple zzso zzso of the even echoes in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso in a resonant zzso field are zzso Both trajectory and zzso operator approaches are formulated and shown to be completely equivalent whenever the dynamics of population transfers among the zzso sites is governed by either a stationary or a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso process may result from zzso dynamics (a stationary zzso zzso in a larger zzso space that contains the zzso of zzso zzso A continuous zzso exchange model is formulated in which a nucleus zzso continuous one-dimensional motion in a harmonic potential well that is located in a linear chemical shift zzso The effects of this zzso exchange model on the zzso simple zzso zzso and zzso of the even echoes of a zzso pulse train are treated rigorously via the trajectory zzso Compact zzso expressions are obtained for the relevant correlation functions in each zzso The relevant zzso are found to be exponential in the very short time and long time limits, which are not necessarily zzso significant in any given zzso In the fast exchange limit the relevant zzso are exponential at all times, and explicit formulas are given for their zzso zzso In the long time limit, all discrete zzso models with the same intrinsic zzso at every site are shown to be completely equivalent to a continuous zzso model with appropriate relaxation time and zzso of the zzso zzso The effects of this zzso exchange model on the zzso of the zzso zzso in a resonant zzso field are treated zzso by a trajectory zzso The intrinsic contribution zzso of rapid zzso and zzso interactions to relax the zzso zzso of two zzso of the same kind in the presence of a zzso resonant zzso field is also derived and found to be practically the same as the intrinsic contribution, zzso of those same zzso to the simple and zzso zzso zzso rates and zzso Literature data for the zzso zzso rate of the zzso even zzso and zzso zzso rate for the zzso zzso of zzso at the central zzso step in the zzso zzso are analyzed using the zzso exchange model to assess the zzso and zzso of the site exchange process as well as the intrinsic zzso zzso Although a single zzso exchange process with appropriate parameters can fit these three zzso data rather well, this particular zzso cannot be zzso with zzso relaxation data on other zzso in the same DNA zzso Rather good agreement with all of the observations is obtained by using a model of two concurrent zzso exchange zzso whose relaxation times, zzso zzso 7 and 460 zzso differ in zzso by a factor of zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of a fast site exchange process to much slower concurrent site exchange processes is explicitly zzso zzso for detecting and characterizing a second slow site exchange process are zzso
