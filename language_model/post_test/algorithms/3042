Standard DNA alignment programs are inadequate to manage the data produced by new generation DNA zzso To answer this problem, we developed zzso with the objective of improving execution time and sensitivity when compared with other available zzso zzso performs fast gapped and zzso alignments of short DNA sequences onto a reference DNA, typically a zzso zzso It is designed to handle a huge amount of reads such as those generated by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso is based on a data structure that holds in zzso the index of the zzso positions of zzso words (typically 11 and 12 zzso as well as an index of the zzso scores of short words (typically seven and eight zzso aligned against each zzso After building the zzso index, the program scans every query sequence performing three steps: zzso it finds matching seed words in the zzso zzso for every match checks the zzso alignment of the short zzso zzso zzso if passes step 2, then it performs an exact dynamic alignment of a narrow region around the zzso The performance of the program is very striking both for sensitivity and zzso For instance, gap alignment is achieved hundreds of times faster than zzso and several times faster than zzso especially when gaps are zzso Furthermore, zzso has a higher sensitivity when compared with the other available zzso 

zzso code and zzso are freely available for download at zzso implemented in zzso supported on Linux and zzso
