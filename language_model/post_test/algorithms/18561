On the surface, transcript profiling using zzso seems to offer a way of looking at the global response of the cell to zzso with a focus on changes in gene zzso The difficulty, however, is that the response of a particular gene is actually measured on the array by an element that is a short, defined zzso acid zzso zzso that map back to the same genetic locus may actually be given different names and descriptions when they are deposited in public sequence zzso when such sequences are used in zzso construction, elements that monitor the same genetic locus may have different names and zzso The zzso described here uses a zzso approach to assign a single best zzso to the elements in a given zzso in such a fashion that elements from one zzso platform may be zzso with those of zzso The zzso relies on the zzso acid zzso number for a given array element, and uses that to retrieve zzso from the most recent versions of zzso and zzso Both database resources are zzso with a priority being given to zzso derived from the curated zzso zzso In lieu of zzso found in these databases, the default zzso zzso is zzso As a final outcome, a zzso zzso is generated that may be used to zzso array zzso The program is available as a practical extraction and report language zzso script that can run under any zzso zzso
