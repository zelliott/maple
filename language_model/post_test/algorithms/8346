Computer programs that can be used for the design of synthetic genes and that are run on an Apple Macintosh computer are zzso These programs determine zzso acid sequences zzso zzso acid zzso They select DNA sequences based on zzso usage as specified by the user, and determine the placement of base changes that can be used to create restriction zzso sites without altering the zzso acid zzso A new zzso for finding restriction sites by translating the restriction zzso target sequence in all three reading frames and then searching the given zzso or protein zzso acid sequence with these short restriction zzso zzso sequences is zzso Examples are given for the creation of synthetic DNA sequences for the bovine zzso and zzso A zzso
