The zzso syndrome includes a zzso group of diseases, usually presenting as abdominal symptoms following gallbladder zzso The clinical management of these patients is frequently without an evidence-based zzso 

We evaluated 80 patients with zzso problems zzso admitted during a period of 36 zzso The liver function tests zzso assessment and zzso ultrasound zzso were followed by zzso ultrasound zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso was then performed zzso on the zzso With knowledge of the final diagnosis, the probable evaluation and outcomes were zzso assuming that zzso would have been performed as the initial zzso Final diagnosis was confirmed by a combination of imaging findings, as well as clinical follow-up of 6 zzso 

In 53 patients zzso or pancreatic diseases were zzso common zzso duct stones, chronic zzso pancreatic cancer, zzso tumors, zzso insufficient zzso or zzso of zzso zzso The other 27 patients had zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso and were consequently managed according to the zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso were high in the zzso of patients with zzso or pancreatic symptoms zzso and zzso and helped to indicate subsequent zzso 

An zzso approach which used zzso for the initial evaluation of the patients with zzso problems decreased the number of zzso by zzso having as a consequence a decreased morbidity and mortality in this group of zzso
