zzso extraction is one of the critical tasks in clinical zzso This communication presents a new approach for vessel extraction using a zzso active zzso by defining a novel local term that takes local image contrast into zzso The proposed model not only preserves the performance of the existing models on blurry images, but also overcomes their inability to handle zzso zzso The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated with experiments involving both synthetic images and clinical zzso
