Shape memory zzso zzso offer a high zzso ratio, large recovery strain, and low driving zzso and have thus attracted considerable research zzso The difficulty of controlling zzso zzso arises from their highly zzso zzso and temperature zzso This paper describes a combination of zzso and zzso control, where the model includes both the major and minor zzso zzso as well as the thermodynamics zzso The zzso zzso uses only the power zzso zzso zzso signal and requires no heavy zzso The method can achieve zzso zzso control and is especially suitable for zzso zzso
