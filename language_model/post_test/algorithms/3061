The zzso cost of a new diabetic foot zzso zzso is estimated to be zzso These costs are thought to be secondary to zzso zzso and the duration of zzso zzso that accelerate rapid and complete healing of zzso reduce the need for zzso thus reducing the costs of zzso One of the therapies previously shown to lead to more rapid and complete wound healing of zzso is zzso human zzso growth factor zzso Many centers, however, do not initiate zzso therapy, based on patient cost zzso zzso many centers reserve a potentially zzso therapy as a second- or zzso zzso The goal of the zzso analysis was to examine the actual cost to patients of a policy of initiating zzso as the initial therapy for appropriately zzso zzso 

A 12-month retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to a zzso care referral wound practice with the diagnosis of zzso was zzso The zzso the authors followed specified that all wounds of patients with an ankle zzso index of greater than zzso and a diagnosis of zzso zzso were not enrolled in a research zzso were zzso widely zzso all wounds were zzso sharply with a zzso zzso on the border and the bases of the wounds were sharply zzso to a clean zzso zzso provided zzso and initiated on zzso at the patients' first center zzso The patient payer mix and average zzso per year were zzso and the average number of tubes of zzso was zzso 

There were 121 patients with the diagnosis of zzso representing 766 zzso A total of zzso tubes of zzso were prescribed for these 121 patients over the course of 12 zzso There was an average use of zzso tubes per zzso The primary payer mix was Medicare, zzso Medicaid, zzso and zzso mix, zzso representing 10 zzso The average patient cost per tube was zzso the average cost for Medicare was $25 (many with secondary zzso as data zzso 2006 Medicare zzso Medicaid was zzso and private insurance was zzso zzso the average patient cost per course of therapy was zzso 

The average cost to patients with prescription benefits for a course of zzso therapy, over a diverse and representative patient mix, is less than $50 in an inner-city zzso care zzso Thus, patient cost alone should not provide a barrier to initiating active therapy in the form of zzso to the patient presenting with a zzso This early initiation could potentially lead to lower overall health costs by improving zzso zzso
