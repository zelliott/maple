The purpose of this prospective cohort study with zzso follow-up was to determine zzso factors for duration of sickness absence due to musculoskeletal zzso 

Workers were included when on sickness absence of 2 to 6 weeks due to musculoskeletal zzso A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect personal and zzso factors, pain, functional zzso and general health zzso zzso analysis was done with Cox zzso hazard zzso with an interaction variable with time for every risk factor of zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed on musculoskeletal disorders and, zzso for low back zzso 

The main factors that were associated with longer sickness absence were older age, zzso perceived physical zzso and poorer general health for neck, shoulder and upper zzso disorders, and functional zzso zzso worker's own perception of the ability of return to work, and chronic complaints for low back zzso Workers with a high perceived physical work load returned to work increasingly slower over time than expected, whereas workers with a high functional disability returned to work increasingly faster over zzso 

High pain intensity is a major zzso factor for duration of sickness absence, especially in low back zzso The different zzso risk profiles for prolonged sickness absence indicate that low back pain and upper zzso disorders need different approaches when applying intervention strategies with the aim of early return to zzso The interaction of perceived physical workload with time suggests that perceived physical workload would increasingly hamper return to work and, zzso supports the need for workplace interventions among workers off work for prolonged zzso
