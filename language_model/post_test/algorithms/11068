zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction problems are usually solved by using zzso zzso or zzso zzso For zzso objects, the zzso beams cannot recover all the slices of the sample at the same zzso Thus, if a zzso sample is required to be reconstructed by the above zzso one should alternately perform translation and rotation on this sample, which leads to lower zzso The zzso zzso CT may significantly improve scanning efficiency for zzso objects over other zzso In this paper, we propose a theoretically exact zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso which can be applied to reconstruct the zzso index zzso distribution of the samples directly from two-dimensional differential zzso zzso zzso simulations are conducted to verify the proposed zzso Our work provides a potential solution for inspecting the zzso samples using zzso which may be zzso with the evolution of zzso zzso
