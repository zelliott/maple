When inspecting two maps of a zzso or zzso region derived by similar or different zzso a computer-generated description of their differences is valuable, both to guide laboratory research as well as to assist version zzso Our program, zzso can be used to compare two independently derived zzso or two revisions of the same zzso Its usefulness increases in proportion to the percentage of shared objects between the two zzso zzso uses a greedy zzso to determine differences between shared zzso 

We illustrate zzso use in comparing the publicly available zzso and radiation hybrid maps of human zzso zzso 

zzso available, zzso zzso for zzso and Sun zzso zzso on request from the zzso
