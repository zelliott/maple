zzso room temperature zzso zzso detectors are of interest in many areas including diagnostic zzso imaging, radiation protection and zzso Room temperature cadmium zinc zzso zzso semiconductor detectors are promising candidates for these zzso One of the major problems for zzso detectors is low-energy tailing of the energy spectrum due to hole zzso zzso zzso methods to correct the tailing effect do not work well for a number of zzso thus it is zzso to eliminate the hole zzso effect in zzso using physical methods rather than correcting an already deteriorated energy zzso One method is using a zzso detector with an zzso zzso which zzso the electric field in the zzso volume to decrease low-energy zzso Another method is to irradiate the zzso surface at a zzso angle, which zzso depth of interaction to decrease low-energy zzso Neither method alone, however, eliminates the tailing zzso In this work, we have investigated the combination of modified electric field and zzso angle zzso in a single detector to further decrease spectral zzso A zzso zzso detector with 10 zzso 10 zzso 3 zzso size and zzso detector with 5 zzso 5 zzso 5 zzso size and zzso zzso were used in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso to as zzso zzso zzso the electric field distribution in the zzso volume and decreases the spectral tailing zzso The detectors were investigated at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two isotope sources with zzso and 122 zzso zzso energies were used for zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso was performed using zzso beams at 60, 80 and 120 zzso tube zzso in both normal and zzso angle zzso Measured zzso zzso were corrected for K zzso escape zzso that were calculated using zzso Carlo zzso The zzso zzso measured with zzso angle zzso detector at 60, 80 and 120 zzso tube zzso were compared to corresponding theoretical zzso The low-energy tailing was nearly completely eliminated from zzso and 122 zzso isotope zzso and 60, 80 and 120 zzso zzso zzso when zzso detector was used with zzso zzso angle zzso It is concluded that using a zzso detector with modified electric field in zzso angle zzso resolves problem of the tailing effect in zzso zzso opening promising possibilities in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
