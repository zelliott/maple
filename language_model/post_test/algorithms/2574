Many zzso in biology follow zzso that can be zzso well by the normal zzso The normal distribution plays an extremely important role in probability zzso However, some of the experimental data in biology are distributed zzso In order to transform such an zzso distribution into a normal distribution, for which the standard statistical tables can be used for probability analysis of the available data, one must choose suitable transformation zzso We have met this problem when we zzso classified the zzso zzso in the adult human zzso But, if one tries to test a qualitative zzso of zzso zzso a considerable class overlap between cells occurs as well as asymmetry often appears in the zzso of the zzso We have already offered a method to overcome the overlapping problem when the data zzso are zzso In order to resolve the asymmetry problem in data distribution, we transformed our zzso distributed data into an approximately normal distribution using a family of simple power functions and on a basis of appropriate probability analysis we propose a more acceptable zzso scheme for the zzso zzso The significance of our results in terms of current zzso of zzso in the adult human zzso is zzso
