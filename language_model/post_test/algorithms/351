zzso zzso loosening is the most common cause for revision total shoulder zzso zzso bone zzso may compromise long-term zzso fixation and significantly contribute to zzso zzso robust analysis of zzso zzso need to look beyond initial zzso mechanics provided by zzso finite element zzso zzso zzso bone zzso simulations based on zzso law are needed for evaluating long-term zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to take a first step towards this goal and create and validate two-dimensional zzso simulations, using the intact zzso for computing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models were created from zzso zzso zzso zzso Two distinct zzso zzso and zzso simulations, used the zzso method to zzso bone zzso zzso bone density was zzso Center and offset load combinations were zzso zzso To validate the simulations we performed zzso statistical comparisons between predicted and actual bone density, load combinations, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso simulations produced better results zzso and correlation zzso ranged zzso zzso Having met this initial work's goals, we expect zzso zzso zzso bone zzso simulations together with zzso zzso stress analyses to be effective tools for designing and evaluating zzso zzso
