A tandem zzso system for zzso zzso at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is zzso The first zzso device consisted of a zzso zzso zzso suitable for zzso zzso whereas the second zzso device was appropriate for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso entered the zzso and were captured by virtual zzso fields at the zzso tip of the inner zzso The use of the zzso with wider zzso zzso and consequently better zzso separation efficiency than the zzso lowered the number of background zzso captured in the zzso region of zzso and thus reduced the space charge effects in the zzso This tandem device was coupled to a laboratory built zzso mass zzso and was evaluated using the zzso generated zzso + zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the exponential zzso of the zzso cloud in zzso determined by monitoring the residual intensity of zzso extracted from the zzso zzso region of zzso after various delay times, was about 2 zzso
