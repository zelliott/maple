A new method for analyzing molecular dynamics simulation data is employed to study the zzso shell structure and exchange processes of zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso in zzso The instantaneous coordination environment is characterized in terms of the zzso zzso zzso network, zzso mean residence times, and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso provides a rapid frame-by-frame identification of zzso and reveals fluctuations in the zzso shell zzso unexplored dynamic behavior that in many cases can be associated with the exchange reactions of water between the first and second zzso zzso zzso zzso structure is also analyzed zzso revealing details of the hydrogen bonding network that have practical implications for connecting molecular dynamics data to zzso zzso cluster zzso Although the individual analyses of water orientation, residence time, zzso are commonplace in the literature, their combination with zzso zzso is new and provides added chemical zzso
