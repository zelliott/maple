This study presents the results of zzso zzso applied to the zzso of zzso tissue based on a simplified model using zzso zzso and zzso information extracted from the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso uses an zzso zzso laser, imaging zzso and a zzso zzso A total of 111 zzso zzso from zzso fragments were used to develop the model, and those zzso were compared to the zzso of zzso fat cells, smooth muscle cells, zzso and cholesterol in a linear fit zzso zzso zzso fatty and zzso zzso plaques zzso and zzso zzso arteries exhibited different spectral signatures related to different zzso structures presented in each tissue zzso zzso analysis based on zzso distance was employed to zzso the tissue type with respect to the relative intensity of each zzso This model was subsequently tested zzso in a set of 55 zzso The simplified diagnostic model showed that cholesterol, zzso and zzso were the tissue constituents that gave the best zzso capability and that those changes were correlated to zzso The simplified model, using zzso obtained from a few tissue zzso and zzso constituents, showed feasibility by using a small amount of zzso easily extracted from gross zzso
