The feasibility of rapid determination of the process variables zzso pH and moisture zzso in solid-state zzso zzso of wheat straw using zzso transform near infrared zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso partial least squares zzso zzso was implemented to zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso factors and the number of zzso were zzso simultaneously by zzso The performance of the prediction model was evaluated according to the root mean square error of zzso zzso the root mean square error of prediction zzso and the correlation zzso zzso The measurement results of the optimal model were obtained as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for moisture content zzso Finally, compared with classic zzso and zzso models, the zzso model revealed its superior zzso The overall results demonstrate that zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso can be used to measure process variables in solid-state zzso of wheat zzso and zzso zzso technique has a potential to be zzso in zzso zzso
