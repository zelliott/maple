We perform detailed zzso of the zzso content of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content is characterized using zzso and zzso resolved zzso imaging, revealing a variety of zzso zzso mode scattering to zzso modes are measured at small relative zzso At large group delays a zzso of surface modes and zzso modes can be zzso The zzso mode is observed to split into four different group delays with different zzso with the relative zzso preserved as the mode zzso through the zzso zzso zzso allow for zzso of the loss of different individual zzso The behavior of the modes in the low loss region of the fiber is compared to that in a high loss region of the zzso Finally, a new measurement technique is introduced, the zzso zzso transform of high-resolution transmission zzso of zzso zzso which displays the dependence of zzso content on both wavelength and group zzso This measurement is used to illustrate the zzso content as function of zzso zzso
