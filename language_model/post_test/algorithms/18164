In computer graphics, triangular mesh representations of surfaces have become very zzso Compared with zzso and implicit forms of surfaces, triangular mesh surfaces have many advantages, such as easy to zzso convenient to store and the ability to model geometric objects with arbitrary zzso In this paper, we are interested in data processing over triangular mesh surfaces through zzso zzso differential zzso We study several diffusion equations over triangular mesh surfaces, and present corresponding zzso schemes to solve zzso Our methods work for triangular mesh surfaces with arbitrary geometry (the angles of each triangle are zzso and zzso zzso zzso or closed zzso of arbitrary zzso Besides the flexibility, our methods are efficient due to the zzso time zzso We finally apply our methods to several filtering and texture applications such as image processing, texture generating and zzso of harmonic maps over triangular mesh zzso The results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our zzso
