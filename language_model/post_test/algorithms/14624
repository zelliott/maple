Chemical zzso often induce changes in protein zzso and thus influence protein activity and protein stability in zzso One difficulty in studying of chemical zzso on protein zzso properties is to obtain sufficient amount of chemically zzso protein which is well zzso Chemical degradation protocols that are often used may induce also zzso changes and zzso of the zzso In this article we studied the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso human growth hormone zzso In literature it is reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso changes on zzso In our study, zzso of zzso was performed by incubation with hydrogen zzso under mild zzso Mass zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso with hydrogen zzso resulted in more than zzso of oxidized zzso By extensive zzso zzso no zzso change in zzso and zzso of zzso after zzso was zzso In conclusion, mild zzso conditions led to selective zzso of the two more accessible zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and did not results in any zzso change of the zzso These findings prove that zzso of human growth hormone does not influence protein zzso and demonstrate the importance of employing mild conditions during production of oxidized zzso
