The remarkable advance of zzso presents significant new challenges in data zzso zzso zzso zzso are large collections of sequencing reads from anonymous species within particular zzso zzso analyses for very large zzso are extremely zzso and there are often many novel sequences in these zzso that are not fully zzso The number of available zzso is rapidly zzso so fast and efficient zzso comparison methods are in great zzso 

The new zzso data analysis method Rapid Analysis of Multiple zzso with a zzso and zzso Pipeline zzso was developed using an zzso sequence zzso algorithm, fast protein family zzso tools, and a novel statistical zzso comparison method that employs a unique graphic zzso zzso processes extremely large zzso with only moderate zzso zzso It identifies raw read clusters and protein clusters that may include novel gene families, and compares zzso using clusters or functional zzso calculated by zzso In this study, zzso was applied to the two largest available zzso collections, the zzso Ocean zzso and the zzso zzso of Nine zzso 

zzso is a very fast method that can cluster and zzso one million zzso reads in only hundreds of CPU zzso It is available from zzso
