zzso clinical pharmacology and zzso education of medical students is important for improving effective and safe drug zzso Increased education about zzso is needed because serious drug-induced adverse effects are zzso zzso the needed scientific approach to prescribing requires knowledge of evidence-based drug therapy, based on understanding clinical zzso zzso agents with novel mechanisms of action are increasingly available, and an unbiased understanding of the risks and benefits of novel agents is also zzso These issues can be addressed in clinical pharmacology zzso However, many medical schools lack sufficient clinical zzso to teach such zzso The Southern Illinois University Medical School faculty implemented an Advanced zzso course to address these zzso 

Development of this course involved defining appropriate content and organizing zzso pharmacology and clinical faculty into teaching zzso The course was offered to zzso medical students and covered clinical trial information, and cutting-edge therapeutic zzso The zzso of zzso is a mental zzso that was presented in the sophomore year and reintroduced in this zzso This zzso emphasizes zzso which stresses the balance between positive and negative effects of pharmacological zzso General principles of clinical pharmacology and zzso were covered by a clinical zzso Most sessions on specific disease treatment involved an integrated presentation by a zzso zzso and a zzso with expertise in that topic, often in the context of clinical zzso Other important topics were emphasized, which reinforce zzso of therapy, including zzso that may determine idiosyncratic zzso Feedback during and following the course was obtained via zzso 

This approach was well received by participating students and zzso Most students rated this course as a valuable zzso 

This approach appears useful for educating medical students about zzso at medical schools that lack sufficient clinical pharmacology faculty to mount such a zzso
