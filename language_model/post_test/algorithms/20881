zzso has been observed in various systems, including living zzso In a previous study, we reported a new phenomenon with zzso in calling behavior of two interacting Japanese tree zzso In this paper, we theoretically zzso zzso dynamics in a system of three coupled zzso which models three interacting zzso where the zzso of each pair have the property of zzso in particular, we perform zzso analysis and zzso function zzso
