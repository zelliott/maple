Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate zzso models in classical situations with fewer variables than zzso However, modern zzso including gene expression data increase the needs of zzso zzso modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than zzso In this paper, we propose a method to find zzso variables in a linear zzso zzso model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even under orders of magnitude more variables than zzso zzso variables work as triggers that activate zzso chains in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the zzso zzso We present experiments with artificial data and real-world gene expression data to evaluate the zzso
