Manual body weight supported treadmill training and zzso treadmill training are frequently used techniques for the gait rehabilitation of individuals after stroke and spinal zzso zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso gait training may be improved by making robotic behavior more zzso In this study, we have investigated the immediate effects of zzso versus zzso zzso gait training on individuals with incomplete spinal zzso injury zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso participated in a single training session with the gait rehabilitation robot zzso The patients were exposed to four different training modes in random order: During both zzso position control and zzso zzso control, fixed timing of movements was zzso During two zzso of the zzso path control approach, free timing of movements was enabled and the robot provided only spatial zzso The two zzso of the path control approach differed in the amount of additional support, which was either individually adjusted or zzso Joint angles and zzso of the robot as well as muscle activity and heart rate of the patients were zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso heart rate and muscle activity were compared between the different zzso 

Patients showed more spatial and zzso zzso zzso reduced interaction zzso a higher increase of heart rate and more muscle activity in the zzso path control mode with individually adjusted support than in the zzso position control zzso In the zzso zzso control mode, spatial zzso zzso was increased and interaction zzso were reduced, but zzso zzso zzso heart rate and muscle activity were not significantly higher than in the position control zzso 

zzso zzso gait training with free timing of movements made individuals with zzso participate more actively and with larger zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso gait zzso
