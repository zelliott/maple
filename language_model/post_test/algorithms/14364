This manuscript tackles the reconstruction of 3-D volumes via zzso registration of series of zzso biological images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The process of acquiring these images typically zzso composite transformations that we model as a number of rigid or zzso local transformations embedded in an elastic zzso We propose a registration approach closely derived from this zzso Given a pair of input images, we first zzso a dense similarity field between them with a block matching zzso We use as a similarity measure an extension of the classical correlation zzso that improves the consistency of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso then automatically partitions the field into a number of classes from which we extract independent pairs of zzso Our zzso zzso relies on the Earth zzso distribution metric and is additionally guided by robust zzso zzso of the transformations associated with each zzso Finally, the pairs of zzso are, zzso zzso registered and a hybrid zzso zzso scheme is used to compose the output registered zzso We investigate the behavior of our approach on several batches of zzso data and discuss its sensitivity to parameters and zzso
