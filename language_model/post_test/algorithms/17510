Various diagnostic tests are available to evaluate patients with zzso duct obstruction zzso However, the most accurate diagnostic technique, defined as the one that best predicts a successful outcome after zzso duct zzso is zzso We zzso performed zzso ultrasound zzso and 3 other tests in men with zzso and determined their relative value in this zzso 

Patients with suspected zzso on clinical evaluation that included zzso proceeded to further zzso evaluation with duct zzso seminal zzso aspiration and seminal zzso A comparative analysis of findings from each technique was performed and the success of subsequent zzso zzso procedures was zzso 

All 25 patients had evidence of zzso on diagnostic zzso a finding that merited further evaluation with other zzso However, zzso findings correlated poorly with those of the other diagnostic zzso zzso on zzso was confirmed in only zzso zzso and zzso of zzso seminal zzso aspiration and duct zzso studies, zzso A better correlation was observed between the dynamic tests of duct zzso and seminal zzso Based on all diagnostic tests only 12 patients zzso proceeded to duct zzso of whom 10 zzso showed significant improvement in zzso analysis parameters or clinical symptoms after the zzso 

A comparative analysis of 4 diagnostic techniques suggests that zzso alone has poor specificity for zzso zzso zzso dynamic tests into the zzso of zzso diagnosis may decrease unnecessary duct zzso procedures and improve the success of the zzso procedures that are zzso
