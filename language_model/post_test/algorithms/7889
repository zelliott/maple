The intricate geometry of zzso networks and internal zzso causes the space available for diffusion in zzso to be convoluted, thereby affecting zzso zzso We present a first systematic zzso study of this effect by zzso zzso structures as zzso of random overlapping obstacles of various zzso zzso diffusion zzso are zzso using a fast homogenization zzso It is found that a simple zzso power law provides a remarkably accurate description of effective diffusion over the entire range of volume zzso and for any given composition of zzso This zzso allows for fast zzso of diffusion zzso once the obstacle shapes and volume zzso are zzso We demonstrate that the excluded volume effect alone can account for a zzso reduction in zzso transport in cells, relative to diffusion in zzso The study lays the foundation for an accurate zzso zzso that would account for zzso zzso on a zzso scale and binding of zzso to zzso zzso
