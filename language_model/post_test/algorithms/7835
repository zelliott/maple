The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling techniques are employed for prediction of retention behavior of zzso secondary zzso and zzso zzso derivatives of zzso separated on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neural networks are used to obtain models predicting zzso Order Index zzso zzso - zzso selectivity zzso log alpha zzso - zzso as well as retention factors zzso zzso for two types of mobile zzso zzso and zzso zzso - zzso and zzso Additionally, a model that predicts log k for both mobile phase in function of zzso concentration is developed zzso - zzso zzso energy turns out to be the most important zzso in description of log k while mixed zzso interactions with zzso OH group and zzso ring are responsible for the zzso zzso The models are used to assess the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso of the investigated zzso The high zzso of the zzso is confirmed but zzso of zzso zzso is predicted to take place in the zzso of zzso
