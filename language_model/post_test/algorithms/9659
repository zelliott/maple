Typically, zzso zzso encodes the propagation of zzso acoustic waves in the zzso images via zzso zzso characterized by a detection frequency equal to the frequency of the mechanical zzso zzso the echo time of a conventional zzso sequence is typically longer than the zzso period which is critical for heart tissue exhibiting a short zzso Thus, fast acquisition techniques like the so-called fractional zzso of harmonic motions were developed for cardiac zzso However, fractional zzso of harmonic motions is limited since it is two orders of magnitude less sensitive to motion than conventional zzso sequences for zzso zzso Here, a new sequence is derived from the so-called displacement zzso with zzso echoes zzso zzso This sequence is more sensitive to displacement than fractional zzso of harmonic motions, and its spectral specificity is equivalent to conventional zzso zzso The theoretical spectral properties of this new zzso technique are validated in a phantom and excised pork heart zzso An excellent agreement is found for the measured displacement fields using classic zzso and displacement zzso with zzso echoes zzso zzso maximum zzso In addition, initial in zzso results on a healthy volunteer clearly show zzso zzso waves at 50 zzso Thus, displacement zzso with zzso echoes zzso is a promising technique for motion zzso within short zzso zzso
