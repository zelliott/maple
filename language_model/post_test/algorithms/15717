To establish the range of normal values for quantitative zzso measures of lung structure and function, the authors developed a method for matching pulmonary structures across individuals and creating a zzso human lung zzso 

A computerized human lung zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso images from six subjects by means of three-dimensional image zzso The authors identified a set of zzso feature points for each CT image and used these points to establish zzso across subjects, used a zzso and zzso consistent image registration zzso to register a template image volume from the population to the rest of the pulmonary CT volumes in the population, averaged these zzso and constructed an zzso by zzso the template with the average zzso 

The effectiveness of the zzso method was evaluated and zzso by means of both zzso and segmented CT zzso The method reduced the average landmark registration error from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the average relative volume overlap error from zzso to zzso for the six data sets zzso 

The method, and the computerized human lung zzso constructed and zzso by the authors with this method, provides a basis for establishing regional ranges of zzso values for structural and functional measures of the human zzso
