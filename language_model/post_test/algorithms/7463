This paper presents an automated zzso zzso method for zzso abdominal CT images based on a zzso zzso zzso Most previous abdominal organ zzso methods are ineffective to deal with the large differences among patients in organ shape and position in local zzso In this paper, we propose an automated zzso zzso method based on a zzso zzso atlas, and solve this problem by introducing a scale zzso zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso division and a zzso weighting zzso The generated zzso zzso zzso efficiently reduces the zzso zzso in organ shape and position either in global or local zzso Our proposed method was evaluated using 100 abdominal CT volumes with manually traced ground truth zzso Experimental results showed that it can segment the liver, zzso zzso and zzso with zzso similarity zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
