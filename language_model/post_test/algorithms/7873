In recent years, zzso have become a mainstream topic in biomedical zzso When biological entities are described using a common zzso such as an zzso they can be compared by means of their zzso This type of comparison is called semantic zzso since it zzso the degree of zzso between two entities by the similarity in meaning of their zzso The application of semantic similarity to biomedical zzso is zzso zzso several studies have been published in the last few years describing and evaluating diverse zzso zzso similarity has become a valuable tool for zzso the results drawn from biomedical studies such as gene zzso gene expression data analysis, prediction and validation of molecular zzso and disease gene zzso We review semantic similarity measures applied to biomedical zzso and propose their zzso according to the strategies they zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso We also present comparative assessment studies and discuss the implications of their zzso We survey the existing zzso of semantic similarity measures, and we describe examples of applications to biomedical zzso This will clarify how biomedical researchers can benefit from semantic similarity measures and help them choose the approach most suitable for their zzso zzso are evolving toward increased coverage, zzso and integration, and their use for zzso is increasingly becoming a focus of both effort by biomedical experts and application of automated zzso procedures to create zzso of higher quality and zzso than are currently zzso Given that semantic similarity measures are directly dependent on these zzso we can expect to see them gaining more relevance and even becoming as essential as sequence similarity is today in biomedical zzso
