We describe and compare four different methods for zzso sample size and power, when the primary outcome of the study is a Health Related Quality of Life zzso zzso These methods are: zzso assuming a zzso distribution and comparing two zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso method based on the zzso odds zzso zzso the zzso We illustrate the various methods, using data from the zzso For simplicity this paper deals with studies designed to compare the effectiveness (or zzso of a new treatment compared to a standard treatment at a single point in zzso The results show that if the zzso outcome has a limited number of discrete values zzso 7) and/or the expected proportion of cases at the boundaries is high zzso 0 or zzso then we would recommend using zzso method zzso zzso zzso if the zzso outcome has a large number of distinct values and the proportion at the boundaries is low, then we would recommend using zzso zzso If a pilot or historical zzso is readily available (to estimate the shape of the zzso then zzso simulation zzso 4) based on this data will provide a more accurate and reliable sample size estimate than conventional methods zzso 1, 2, or zzso In the absence of a reliable pilot set, zzso is not appropriate and conventional methods of sample size zzso or simulation will need to be zzso Fortunately, with the increasing use of zzso outcomes in research, historical zzso are becoming more readily zzso zzso speaking, our results and conclusions only apply to the zzso outcome zzso Further empirical work is required to see whether these results hold true for other zzso zzso However, the zzso has many features in common with other zzso zzso zzso zzso or discrete response categories with upper and lower bounds, and skewed zzso so therefore, we believe these results and conclusions using the zzso will be appropriate for other zzso zzso
