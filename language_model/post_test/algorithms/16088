A dynamic programming zzso is developed for zzso reconstruction of the set of all ancestral zzso acid sequences in a zzso zzso To date, exhaustive zzso that find the most likely set of ancestral states zzso zzso have running times that scale zzso with the number of sequences and are thus limited to very few zzso The time requirement of our new zzso scales zzso with the number of sequences and is therefore zzso to practically any number of zzso A detailed description of the new zzso and an example of its application to zzso b sequences are zzso
