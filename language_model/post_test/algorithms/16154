External information zzso in the cell mainly through signaling zzso and zzso zzso allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of environmental zzso zzso experiments identify numerous molecular components of such zzso that may, however, interact through unknown zzso Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration of a zzso interaction network and zzso expression zzso This zzso problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal connected zzso of a network defined by these zzso The zzso procedure turns out to be zzso intractable in zzso Here we present a new distributed zzso for this task, inspired from statistical physics, and apply this scheme to alpha factor and drug zzso data in zzso We identify the role of the zzso zzso a member of a gene family of previously unknown function, and validate the results by genetic zzso The zzso we present is specially suited for very large zzso can run in zzso and can be adapted to other problems in systems zzso On renowned benchmarks it zzso other zzso in the zzso
