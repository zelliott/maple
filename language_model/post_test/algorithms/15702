We have developed an acrylic zzso device that zzso couples zzso zzso focusing zzso and free solution zzso zzso zzso Rapid separation zzso zzso and zzso zzso of species were achieved in the initial zzso zzso Using zzso zzso imaging, we observed zzso zzso zzso on the order of 20 zzso during characterization of the zzso zzso This transport behavior allowed controlled zzso zzso of focused sample bands to a channel zzso where zzso switching was used to repeatedly inject zzso from the zzso dimension into an zzso zzso zzso This second dimension was capable of analyzing all fluid volumes of interest from the zzso dimension, as zzso was zzso during each zzso analysis and refocused prior to additional zzso zzso Investigation of each dimension of the integrated system showed zzso species displacement and zzso behavior consistent with zzso and zzso zzso The peak capacity of the zzso system was approximately zzso A comprehensive zzso analysis of a fluid volume spanning zzso of the total zzso channel length was completed in less than 5 zzso
