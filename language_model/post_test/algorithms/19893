zzso detection zzso systems have been shown to improve the diagnostic performance of CT zzso zzso in the detection of zzso zzso zzso Despite the improvement, the overall system is not zzso zzso zzso on true zzso are incorrectly dismissed, and false zzso are zzso as true zzso Here, we conduct an observer performance study utilizing distributed human intelligence in the form of anonymous knowledge workers zzso to investigate human performance in zzso zzso candidates under different presentation zzso We evaluated 600 zzso candidates from 50 patients, each case having at least one zzso zzso zzso from a large database of zzso zzso Each zzso candidate was labeled independently as a true or false zzso by 20 zzso and an expert zzso We asked each zzso to determine whether the candidate was a true zzso after looking at a single zzso image of the candidate and after watching a video zzso of the zzso We found that distributed human intelligence improved significantly when presented with the additional information in the video zzso We noted that performance zzso with increasing interpretation time and increasing difficulty, but distributed human intelligence performed better than our zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further, we observed numerous parallels between the expert zzso and the zzso Both showed similar improvement in zzso moving from zzso to video zzso Additionally, difficulty estimates obtained from the zzso using an expectation zzso zzso correlated well with the difficulty rating assigned by the expert zzso Our results suggest that distributed human intelligence is a powerful tool that will aid in the development of zzso for zzso
