zzso is a synthetic zzso for the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and has been widely used in the treatment of zzso disorders, especially zzso due to its zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso is relatively well zzso an activated zzso forms a zzso zzso and this regulates the zzso of genes involved in energy metabolism by binding to zzso response elements in their promoter regions, so-called zzso In addition, zzso also has zzso and zzso effects in vascular zzso and smooth muscle zzso We have limited information about the zzso mechanism of zzso however, zzso which suppresses production of inflammatory zzso and zzso molecules probably contributes to this zzso Furthermore, there are reports that zzso affects zzso cells in a zzso zzso In order to identify zzso and zzso regulated zzso we generated zzso data from human zzso cells treated with zzso and with and without zzso zzso of zzso We also constructed dynamic zzso zzso networks to reveal zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso network analysis identified growth differentiation factor 15 zzso as a hub gene having zzso regulated transcripts as its direct downstream zzso This result suggests that zzso may be zzso zzso of zzso action in human zzso zzso
