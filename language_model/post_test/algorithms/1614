The zzso pandemic in 2009 and the H5N1 pandemic in 2005 demonstrated that the drugs approved to treat influenza A viruses have low zzso This provided a stimulus for new studies of influenza A viruses in the context of the methods used in drug design developed over the past 100 zzso Finding new universal drugs is the ultimate goal but its long time horizon is incompatible with emergency situations created by zzso influenza zzso zzso we propose a zzso method for finding zzso drugs and drug complexes based on the use of the zzso zzso 

zzso We start by assembling a panel of target zzso zzso We then assemble a panel of zzso zzso This is followed by a selection of benchmark binding pockets based on the panel of target proteins and the panel of zzso zzso We generate a set of zzso features, which measure the efficacy of a zzso zzso We propose a universal program to search for drugs and drug zzso zzso A case study we report here illustrates how to use this universal program for finding an optimal drug and a drug complex for a given zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and Aspirin complex is provided zzso zzso Finally, we propose a simple strategy to validate our zzso prediction that the zzso and Aspirin complex should prove clinically zzso 

A set of zzso features are zzso and then based on these features, a universal program for finding the potential drug zzso complexes is zzso Using this universal program, the zzso and Aspirin complex is selected and its efficacy is predicted zzso For clinical validation of this finding, future work is still zzso
