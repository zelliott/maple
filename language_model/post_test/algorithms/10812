To separate subjects with anterior zzso and mild zzso zzso into two groups: those that can be treated successfully with a 2 zzso 4 zzso and those that should be treated with reverse zzso and zzso zzso 

Thirty mixed zzso subjects each with an anterior zzso a zzso profile, a deficient zzso and an zzso angle between zzso and zzso degrees were zzso Fifteen subjects (8 boys, 7 zzso Mean age: zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully treated with a 2 zzso 4 zzso zzso treatment zzso and remainder (5 boys, 10 zzso Mean age: zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully treated with reverse zzso and zzso expansion after initial treatment with a 2 zzso 4 zzso had failed zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso function zzso and a constant were calculated for selected zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso angle was significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso and both anterior and zzso zzso base lengths were significantly longer in the zzso treatment group zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso The prediction index developed was: zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso The critical score was zzso With positive scores a 2 zzso 4 zzso can be used and with negative scores reverse zzso and expansion are zzso 

An equation able to predict treatment success with either a 2 zzso 4 zzso or reverse zzso has been zzso
