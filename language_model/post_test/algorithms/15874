zzso plots are a suitable and valuable method for analysis of powder zzso with very small amounts of zzso The determination is based upon a zzso transformation of zzso data and thus the signal errors that might be introduced into the analysis might be enlarged and become zzso The method of determination of true density affects the results dramatically as does the accuracy of the powder height zzso The zzso should be corrected for zzso of the solid zzso The accuracy of the powder height detection is the most demanding zzso The statements are proven by simulations based on real data and zzso zzso According to these highly corrected zzso zzso the shape of the plots during the zzso phase gives the information about fragmentation and plasticity and additionally about the time dependency of the zzso zzso within one zzso on an eccentric zzso
