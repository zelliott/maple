zzso Analysis zzso plays an important role in image and signal processing fields, and it can extract information at different zzso Image fusion is a process of combining two or more images into an image, which extracts features from source images and provides more information than one zzso The research presented in this article is aimed at the development of an automated imaging enhancement system in digital zzso zzso images, which can clearly display all the defects in one image and don't bring blocking zzso In terms of characteristic of the collected zzso signals, in the proposed scheme the zzso of signals is mapped to zzso gray scale to form several gray images and then these images are fused to form a new enhanced zzso This article focuses on comparing the discriminating power of several zzso images zzso methods using contrast zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso are extensively tested and the results are compared with standard image enhancement zzso Tests indicate that the fused images present a more detailed representation of the zzso zzso zzso recognition, and search tasks may therefore benefit from zzso
