zzso schizophrenia is a severe and unremitting form of the zzso Prospective brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have found progressive loss of total cerebral volume during adolescence, primarily attributable to accelerated loss of cortical gray zzso Because there is evidence of zzso involvement in zzso the authors examined zzso volume and its relation to cortical gray matter development during adolescence in patients with zzso schizophrenia and healthy comparison zzso 

Total zzso volume was zzso calculated for 108 anatomical brain zzso scans from 50 patients (20 of whom were zzso and 101 scans from 50 zzso and zzso healthy volunteers (20 of whom were zzso The age range of the patients and comparison subjects was 8 to zzso zzso zzso area and zzso zzso lobe volume were measured by zzso Prospective zzso were obtained at approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were combined in mixed model zzso to compare zzso changes for the zzso 

In contrast to healthy volunteers, patients with schizophrenia showed a progressive loss of zzso volume during zzso zzso and cerebral volume decreases were significantly correlated in zzso zzso 

zzso schizophrenia is associated with significant progressive loss of zzso volume during adolescence, consistent with previously reported decreases in total cerebral and cortical gray zzso At least in these patients with severe zzso zzso the loss appears secondary to a generalized zzso
