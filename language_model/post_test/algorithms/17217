This paper studies the problems of zzso and prediction in a class of models known as zzso zzso zzso The statistical model underlying an zzso is a mixture model in which both the mixture zzso and the mixture components are generalized linear zzso zzso zzso regarding an zzso parameters is presented in the contexts of zzso and zzso using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso A benefit of this zzso approach is the ability to obtain a sample from the zzso distribution of any functional of the parameters of the given zzso In this way, more information is obtained than provided by a point zzso The methods are illustrated on a zzso zzso problem and on a breast cancer zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso showed good prediction performance, and also gave the additional benefit of providing for the opportunity to assess the degree of certainty of the model in its zzso
