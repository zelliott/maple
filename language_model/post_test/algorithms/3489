zzso least squares zzso analysis has been used to characterize distributed signals measured by zzso methods like zzso zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the application to zzso it has been used to extract activity patterns zzso cognitive tasks, patterns relating distributed activity to behavior, and to describe large-scale zzso interactions or functional zzso This paper reviews the more recent extension of zzso to the analysis of zzso patterns present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We present a basic mathematical description of zzso and discuss the statistical assessment using zzso testing and zzso zzso These two zzso methods provide complementary information of the statistical strength of the extracted activity patterns zzso zzso and the reliability of regional contributions to the patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso data are used to guide the basic interpretation of zzso zzso results, and examples from empirical zzso and zzso data sets are used for further zzso We conclude with a discussion of some zzso in the use of zzso including zzso zzso and interpretation zzso We further discuss its role as an important tool in a pluralistic zzso approach to zzso
