Even in the zzso era, the identification of candidate genes within zzso associated with human genetic diseases is a very demanding task, because the critical region may typically contain hundreds of zzso zzso Since genes implicated in similar zzso tend to share very similar expression profiles, high zzso gene expression data may represent a very important resource to identify the best candidates for zzso However, so far, gene zzso has not been used very successfully to prioritize zzso zzso 

We show that it is possible to reliably identify zzso relationships among genes from massive zzso zzso by concentrating only on genes sharing similar expression profiles in both human and zzso Moreover, we show systematically that the integration of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso similarity map allows the efficient identification of disease genes in large zzso zzso Finally, using this approach on zzso zzso zzso characterized by an unknown molecular basis, we propose zzso candidates for 81 genetic zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso even at the zzso zzso distance, represents a very strong criterion to predict zzso relationships among human zzso
