In this paper we describe attempts at building a robust model for predicting the length of survival of patients with zzso zzso The aim of the research, reported in this paper, is to study the effective zzso of artificial intelligence techniques in the medical zzso We suggest that an important research objective of proponents of intelligent zzso systems must be to evaluate the zzso that zzso techniques can bring to an already well-established field of medical zzso zzso this end, we compare a number of different zzso techniques that lend themselves to the task of predicting survival in zzso cancer zzso We describe the pros and cons of each of these methods using the usual metrics of accuracy and zzso We then present the notion of intelligent hybrid systems and evaluate the role that they may potentially play in developing robust zzso zzso In particular we evaluate a hybrid system that zzso the k zzso zzso technique in conjunction with zzso zzso We describe a number of innovations used within this hybrid paradigm used to build the zzso zzso We discuss the issue of censored patients and how this issue can be tackled within the various models zzso In keeping with our objective of studying the zzso that zzso techniques bring to building zzso models, we use Cox's zzso as a standard and compare each zzso technique with it, attempting to discover their capabilities in enhancing zzso methods in zzso In doing so we address two main zzso model fits the data zzso and are the results obtained by the various zzso techniques significantly different from those of Cox's zzso We conclude this paper by discussing future enhancements to the work presented and lessons learned from the study to zzso
