To develop a technique using a zzso discrete set of zzso that can detect zzso in persons with darkly pigmented zzso The resulting zzso detection approach will then be incorporated into a zzso zzso device that is clinically viable and zzso 

A zzso imaging system was used to acquire spectral images of induced zzso Individual images were combined into a single image using different fusion zzso Image fusion zzso based on published literature and using linear and zzso color space transformation were tested to zzso the contrast between zzso and zzso zzso 

A research laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, zzso 

zzso subjects, of whom 28 had darkly pigmented skin, were recruited from a pool of students, faculty, and zzso 

The ability of detection zzso to detect zzso was measured using Weber zzso A simple threshold zzso determined zzso sensitivity, and specificity for each zzso 

Four zzso enhanced contrast of zzso by an order of magnitude over that of a digital zzso The accuracy of the detection zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and specificity ranged from zzso to zzso One fusion zzso exhibited an accuracy of more than zzso and sensitivity and specificity of more than zzso 

The results indicate that zzso in different skin tones can be identified using 2 to 3 zzso zzso accuracy and discrimination will be targeted via use of filters with zzso zzso zzso more consistent camera lighting, and improved machine vision zzso
