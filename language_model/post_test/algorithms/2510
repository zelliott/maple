zzso content in air moisture, soil water, rain water and plant water samples collected around the zzso site, India was estimated and the scavenging ratio, wet deposition zzso and ratio of specific activities of zzso between soil water and air moisture were calculated and the results are zzso zzso ratio was found to vary from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso The wet deposition zzso of zzso observed in the present study was in the range of zzso to zzso m zzso with a mean of zzso m zzso The ratio of specific activity of zzso in soil moisture to that in air moisture ranged from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso The specific activity of zzso in plant water in this study varied from 73 to 310 zzso zzso The present study is very useful for understanding the process and zzso of transfer of zzso through zzso system at the zzso zzso
