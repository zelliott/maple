zzso fluid dynamics methods based on in zzso 3-D vessel reconstructions have recently been identified the influence of wall zzso stress on zzso cells as well as on vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in different events such as flow zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso Development of zzso modeling technologies for simulating zzso local blood flows is introducing a novel approach to risk prediction for coronary plaque growth and zzso In this study, we developed 3-D model of plaque formation and progression that was tested in a set of patients who underwent coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The 3-D blood flow is described by the zzso zzso together with the continuity zzso Mass transfer within the blood zzso and through the zzso wall is coupled with the blood flow and is modeled by a zzso zzso The low density zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the vessel and through the vessel tissue (which has a mass consumption zzso are coupled by zzso zzso The inflammatory process is modeled using three additional zzso partial differential zzso A full 3-D model was zzso It includes blood flow and LDL zzso as well as plaque formation and zzso Furthermore, features potentially affecting plaque growth, such as patient risk score, circulating zzso zzso and composition of the initial zzso and coronary zzso capability were also zzso The proof of concept of the model effectiveness was assessed by repetition of zzso six months zzso
