The development of efficient zzso seed reconstruction zzso is an ongoing and vivid research zzso Since the 1980s many publications about seed assignment were zzso In this paper a novel mathematical approach is described to solve the zzso assignment problem for the reconstruction of seeds with zzso we present a fast linear programming approach together with afterwards applying the so-called zzso zzso scheme to zzso good zzso zzso zzso We apply a zzso software that allows user interaction to check the solution given by the zzso and to augment partial zzso The second step is justified as the zzso zzso already returns optimal solutions is many cases, and in cases with partial assignments it fails to match only a very small number of seed zzso Our zzso transfers ideas from recent breakthrough research work on the design of efficient zzso zzso in discrete zzso and computer science to the seed reconstruction zzso
