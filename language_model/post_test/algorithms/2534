In cancer clinical zzso zzso and zzso profiling are used to search for zzso of potentially zzso zzso zzso A given number of samples must be zzso in order to detect clinically relevant differences between zzso and controls, with adequate statistical zzso From clinical zzso profiling studies, expression data for each peak zzso or zzso from two or more clinically defined groups of subjects are typically zzso Typically, both exposure and zzso information on each subject are also available, and usually the samples are not from zzso zzso Moreover, the data is usually available in zzso At the design stage, however, zzso are not typically available and are often ignored in sample size zzso This leads to the use of insufficient numbers of samples and reduced power when there are imbalances in the numbers of subjects between different zzso zzso A method is proposed for accommodating information on zzso data imbalances and zzso such as the technical replication and the zzso nature of these studies, in sample size zzso It assumes knowledge of a joint distribution for the protein expression values and the zzso When zzso zzso are considered, the effect of the zzso enters the calculations as a function of the proportions of subjects with specific zzso This makes it relatively straightforward (even when pilot data on subject zzso is zzso to specify and to adjust for the effect of the expected zzso The new method suggests certain experimental designs which lead to the use of a smaller number of samples when planning a zzso Analysis of data from the zzso profiling of zzso cancer reveals that fewer samples are needed when a study is balanced than when it is zzso and when the zzso zzso is zzso The method is implemented in the zzso package and is available in R at: zzso
