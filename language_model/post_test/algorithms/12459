Multiple structural alignment is a fundamental problem in structural zzso In this article, we define a reliable and robust algorithm, MUSTANG zzso zzso zzso zzso for the alignment of multiple protein zzso Given a set of protein structures, the program zzso a multiple alignment using the spatial information of the zzso atoms in the zzso zzso based on the progressive zzso zzso this zzso gains accuracy through novel and effective refinement zzso MUSTANG reports the multiple sequence alignment and the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso generated by MUSTANG are compared with several zzso alignments in the literature as well as with the benchmark alignments of zzso alignment families from the zzso zzso The performance of MUSTANG was compared with zzso at a zzso level, and with other multiple structural alignment tools such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso MUSTANG performs comparably to popular zzso and multiple structural alignment tools for closely related zzso and performs more reliably than other multiple structural alignment methods on hard data sets containing zzso related proteins or proteins that show zzso zzso
