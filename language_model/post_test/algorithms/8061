Information theory is an increasingly popular framework for studying how the brain encodes sensory zzso Despite its widespread use for the analysis of spike trains of single zzso and of small neural zzso its application to the analysis of other types of zzso signals zzso zzso zzso has remained relatively limited so zzso This is due to the zzso bias which affects calculation of information, to the complexity of the techniques to eliminate the bias, and to the lack of publicly available fast routines for the information analysis of zzso zzso 

Here we introduce a new zzso and zzso information zzso zzso specifically developed for zzso zzso This zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso for zzso many of the main information zzso quantities and bias correction techniques used in zzso zzso We illustrate and test the zzso in several zzso First, we verify that these zzso provide accurate and unbiased estimates of the information carried by analog brain signals zzso zzso zzso or zzso even when using limited amounts of experimental zzso This test is important since existing zzso were so far tested primarily on spike zzso Second, we apply the zzso to the analysis of zzso recorded from a subject watching natural movies, and we characterize the zzso locations, zzso and signal features carrying the most visual zzso Third, we explain how the zzso can be used to break down the information carried by different features of the neural signal into distinct components reflecting different ways in which correlations between parts of the neural signal contribute to zzso We illustrate this breakdown by analyzing zzso recorded from primary visual zzso during presentation of zzso zzso 

The new zzso presented here zzso fast and zzso zzso of the most relevant quantities used in information zzso analysis of neural zzso The zzso can be easily used within zzso the environment used by most zzso laboratories for the zzso zzso and plotting of neural zzso It can therefore significantly enlarge the domain of application of information theory to zzso and lead to new discoveries about the neural zzso
