zzso DNA sequences are abundant in zzso and efficient mining of significant repeats is important as the first step of repetitive sequence zzso Although many zzso tools for the purpose, either automatic or zzso ones, have been developed, detection and analysis of approximate repeats are still zzso zzso 

Auto zzso zzso zzso a zzso repetitive pattern zzso program with a window filtering based on zzso zzso trials, is developed and applied to zzso zzso and human T cell zzso locus zzso Typical examples found in zzso zzso 1 and 10 and a tandem repeat of periods longer than 10,000 zzso in human T cell zzso locus are zzso A complex structure composed of both direct and zzso repeats found in zzso zzso 10 is also zzso as specific dot zzso zzso time measured by a zzso 3 PC for each zzso auto zzso with a standard zzso setting is zzso scaled and below 10 s per one zzso indicating efficiency of the zzso From the examples, it is shown that zzso can zzso approximate local repeat structures and give us a diagnosis power for zzso a zzso history of zzso
