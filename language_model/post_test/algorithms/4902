An zzso research project is to develop a zzso driven actively and zzso by external magnetic zzso The zzso has great potential for being used in medical fields such as gastrointestinal zzso The ultimate goal is to develop a control mechanism capable of moving the wireless zzso through the zzso gastrointestinal tract in any direction with minimum level of harm to human zzso This paper establishes fluid dynamics model suitable for zzso movement in zzso zzso simulates pressure zzso of zzso surface, and further zzso driving and load zzso Based on the fluid simulation results, parameters for generating appropriate rotating magnetic field can be zzso This fluid dynamics simulation method provides a novel approach to analyze biomedical zzso mechanical properties under external electromagnetic zzso
