zzso selectively zzso I zzso 32 zzso exhibiting residual zzso zzso are used to acquire zzso zzso zzso from a range of biologically relevant samples containing sodium in ordered zzso Three complementary approaches to the analysis of such zzso are zzso zzso measurement of relaxation rates, zzso extraction of homogeneous zzso from two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso simultaneous fitting of detailed theoretical functions to a series of one-dimensional zzso zzso Analysis of relaxation rates provides evidence for zzso in bovine zzso zzso Each approach is used to demonstrate the presence of zzso in zzso relaxation in zzso zzso For certain samples containing zzso a good theoretical fit to the zzso was obtained using a model that allows for zzso relaxation by including the effects of slow lateral and zzso zzso
