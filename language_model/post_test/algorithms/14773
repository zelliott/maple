The performance of zzso digital imaging systems depends on several factors related with both optical and electronic zzso These concepts have originated standards, which have been conceived for photographic equipment and zzso scanning systems, and which have been aimed at zzso different parameters such as resolution, noise or dynamic zzso zzso no standard test protocols currently exist for evaluating the corresponding performances of zzso imaging systems such as laser scanners or pattern projection range zzso This paper is focused on investigating experimental processes for evaluating some critical parameters of zzso equipment, by extending the concepts defined by the zzso standards to the zzso zzso The experimental part of this work concerns the characterization of different range sensors through the extraction of their resolution, accuracy and uncertainty from sets of zzso data acquisitions of specifically designed test objects whose geometrical characteristics are known in zzso The major objective of this contribution is to suggest an easy characterization process for generating a reliable comparison between the performances of different range sensors and to check if a specific piece of equipment is zzso with the expected zzso
