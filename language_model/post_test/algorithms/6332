zzso methods have now been applied to most areas of zzso zzso including data reduction, molecular replacement, experimental phasing and zzso However, students of zzso zzso are predominantly taught only traditional zzso methods and therefore have little understanding of the methods underlying the modern software that they routinely use in structure zzso This situation zzso at least in part, because maximum likelihood is considered to be too difficult to be taught to students who lack substantial mathematical training within the limited time frame of zzso zzso A method of introducing zzso concepts with the help of dice is described here and it is then shown how these concepts can form the core of understanding zzso zzso molecular replacement and experimental zzso Within the framework zzso the zzso zzso techniques are all reduced to the same basic concepts and become easier and less time-consuming to teach than traditional methods, which rely on disparate zzso
