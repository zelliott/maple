The shape of zzso coli is approximately that of a cylinder with zzso zzso Since its size is not much larger than optical resolution, it has been difficult to zzso zzso from this zzso We show that one can bypass this limitation and obtain the cell shape with zzso zzso The resulting contours are shown to zzso from the zzso zzso In particular, the cell is zzso zzso Its two caps are different from each other and the sides are slightly zzso Most cells have convex zzso We discuss our results in light of several mechanisms that are involved in determining the shape of zzso
