As a powerful tool for analyzing full conditional zzso between random zzso zzso models have become increasingly popular to zzso genetic networks based on gene expression zzso However, full zzso conditional relationships between random variables can be only estimated accurately if the number of observations is relatively large in comparison to the number of zzso which is usually not fulfilled for zzso zzso zzso Recently, simplified zzso modeling approaches have been proposed to determine zzso between gene expression zzso For sparse zzso models such as genetic networks, it is assumed that the zzso and zzso conditional zzso still reflect reasonably well the full conditional independence structure between zzso Moreover, zzso conditional zzso have the advantage that they can be accurately estimated even when having only a small number of zzso zzso using only zzso and zzso conditional zzso to zzso the complete zzso model can be very zzso Here, we analyze the statistical and zzso properties of these zzso conditional independence zzso (called zzso zzso We find that for faithful zzso models, the zzso graph contains at least all edges of the full conditional independence graph zzso zzso For simple structures such as zzso trees, the zzso graph even zzso with the concentration zzso Furthermore, we present some zzso results and we demonstrate in a simulation study that despite their zzso zzso zzso are generally good zzso of sparse zzso zzso Finally, the biological relevance of some applications is zzso
