zzso experience suggests that zzso are encountering fewer patients with zzso zzso however, the zzso trends of zzso strictures have not been well examined in large zzso 

We examined the zzso rates of new zzso strictures as well as zzso zzso among patients presenting to VA facilities between 1998 and 2003 as a proportion of the annual frequency of all zzso procedures and/or imaging zzso zzso strictures were defined as those recorded at least 3 months after the index date of a new zzso or the date of the preceding zzso zzso zzso was defined only in the presence of an upper zzso or upper gastrointestinal zzso contrast imaging within 30 days before or after the date of zzso This zzso was validated by manually reviewing the medical records of 180 zzso the positive zzso value was approximately zzso The risk of zzso strictures was examined using Cox zzso hazards model for multiple zzso 

There were zzso patients identified between fiscal year zzso 1998 and zzso 2003 with new zzso zzso New strictures comprised a constant annual proportion of total zzso and zzso imaging zzso New strictures declined by zzso as a proportion of all upper zzso (not including zzso zzso However, zzso zzso associated with new zzso diagnoses declined among patients with new zzso zzso zzso had at least one episode of zzso The zzso zzso rate of zzso strictures declined significantly zzso from zzso per 100 zzso for patients diagnosed with new strictures in 1998 to zzso per 100 zzso in patients diagnosed with new strictures in zzso In the full multivariable model, new strictures diagnoses during zzso were associated with a reduced risk of having zzso strictures zzso in the first year and zzso throughout zzso independent of age, zzso race, geographic region, or the presence of Barrett's zzso 

The zzso of zzso strictures has declined between 1998 and 2003 by approximately zzso Although there has been only a small decline in the zzso of new zzso strictures among patients undergoing zzso the use of zzso zzso has declined considerably among these zzso The role of zzso pump zzso needs to be zzso
