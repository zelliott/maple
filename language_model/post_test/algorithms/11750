zzso effort, and time are required to identify and zzso zzso structures in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso these processes requires a technique that uses symbolic information not in the dynamic range of the zzso zzso We were developing such a technique based on mutual information for automatic zzso image fusion zzso zzso University of zzso This system previously demonstrated facility at fusing one zzso zzso with integrated symbolic structure information to a CT zzso zzso scale and zzso from the same zzso The next step of development of our technique was aimed at accommodating the zzso of anatomy from patient to patient by using zzso to fuse our standard zzso to arbitrary patient CT zzso 

A standard symbolic information zzso was created from the full color Visible Human Female by zzso the liver zzso portal zzso and zzso veins and zzso each set of zzso with a fixed zzso Two arbitrarily selected patient CT scans of the abdomen were used for reference zzso We used the zzso functions in MIAMI zzso to align the standard structure data to each patient zzso The key to successful fusion was the focused use of multiple zzso control points that place themselves around the structure of interest zzso The user assigns only a few initial control points to align the zzso Fusion 1 and 2 transformed the zzso with 27 points around the liver to zzso and zzso zzso Fusion 3 transformed the zzso with 45 control points around the liver to zzso and Fusion 4 transformed the zzso with 5 control points around the portal zzso The CT zzso is zzso with the transformed standard structure zzso such that the warped structure masks are zzso in combination with the original patient zzso This combined volume zzso is then rendered zzso in stereo on the zzso in an immersive zzso Reality zzso zzso 

The accuracy of the zzso was determined zzso by comparing the transformed zzso zzso on the appropriate zzso It was examined for where the transformed structure zzso was incorrectly zzso zzso zzso and where it was incorrectly not zzso zzso zzso According to this method, zzso 1 and 2 were correct roughly zzso of the time, while zzso 3 and 4 were correct roughly zzso The CT zzso zzso with transformed zzso was viewed arbitrarily in zzso perspective stereo taking advantage of features such as zzso zzso and zzso region of interest zzso 

This process of zzso zzso structures in variable zzso is a step toward the goal of a broader, standardized automatic structure zzso method for zzso zzso If successful it would permit zzso zzso or deletion of structures in zzso data by zzso applying zzso structure information to the zzso data (not just processing and zzso of the zzso intrinsic dynamic zzso More sophisticated selection of control points and patterns of zzso may allow for more accurate zzso and thus advances in zzso zzso education, zzso and treatment zzso
