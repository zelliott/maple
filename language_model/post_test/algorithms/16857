Parkinson's disease zzso is caused by the accelerated death of zzso zzso producing zzso Numerous studies documenting cognitive deficits of zzso patients have revealed zzso in a variety of tasks related to memory, learning, zzso skills, and zzso While there have been several studies documenting cognitive deficits of zzso patients, very few zzso models have been zzso In this article, we use the zzso model of category learning to simulate zzso depletion and show that the model suffers from cognitive symptoms similar to those of human participants affected by zzso Specifically, zzso depletion in zzso produced deficits in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rule zzso and rule zzso These were observed by simulating results from younger controls, older controls, zzso patients, and severe zzso patients in five well-known zzso zzso performance among the different age groups and clinical populations was modeled simply by changing the amount of zzso available in the zzso This suggests that zzso may not only be an adequate model of the simulated tasks and phenomena but also more generally of the role of zzso in these tasks and zzso
