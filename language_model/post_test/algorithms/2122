The problem of data zzso and feature selection for training zzso neural networks is well zzso The basic principles are to avoid zzso the underlying structure of the data, and to avoid using irrelevant zzso This is not easy in the real world, where we often receive data which has been processed by at least one previous zzso The data may contain too many instances of some class, and too few instances of other zzso Real data sets often include many irrelevant or redundant input zzso This paper examines the use of weight zzso analysis techniques and functional measures using two real (and hence zzso data zzso The first part of this paper examines the use of the weight zzso of the trained neural network itself to determine which zzso are zzso A new technique is introduced and compared with two other techniques from the zzso We present our experience and results on some satellite data zzso by a terrain zzso The task was to predict the forest zzso based on the available zzso A zzso force technique eliminating randomly selected zzso was used to validate our zzso The second part of this paper examines the use of measures to determine the functional contribution of zzso to zzso zzso which include minor but unique information to the network are more significant than zzso with higher magnitude contribution but providing redundant information, which is also provided by another zzso A comparison is made to sensitivity analysis, where the sensitivity of zzso to input zzso is used as a measure of the significance of zzso This paper presents a novel functional analysis of the weight zzso based on a technique developed for determining the behavioral significance of hidden zzso This is compared with the application of the same technique to the training and test zzso Finally, a novel zzso technique is zzso
