The construction and performance of a zzso zzso pulse electron nuclear double resonance zzso zzso for large samples is zzso The zzso is based on a zzso zzso cavity in which the radio frequency zzso zzso is generated by a two turn zzso zzso zzso crossing the zzso along the sample axis with minimal distance to the sample zzso An zzso power efficiency factor is used to define the zzso strength per zzso of the transmitted zzso power over the frequency range zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso are investigated by electromagnetic field zzso All zzso the sample tube, and zzso elements are included in the zzso The application range of the zzso and the advantages of using large sample sizes are demonstrated and discussed on a number of zzso samples containing transition metal zzso
