zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso is governed largely by zzso zzso biomass formation, ethanol and zzso production, and zzso In this work, zzso zzso models were developed with a view to determining these zzso parameters from near infrared zzso and zzso data provided by the corresponding reference zzso The models were applied to a set of samples obtained from various zzso zzso The zzso ethanol, and biomass values predicted by the models exhibited a high correlation with those provided by the reference zzso
