The random zzso of variations in the human zzso over time implicitly encodes a history of how human populations have zzso zzso and zzso since we emerged as a zzso zzso that history is a challenging zzso and statistical problem but has important applications both to basic research and to the discovery of zzso zzso We present a novel approach to zzso human evolutionary history from genetic variation zzso We use the idea of consensus trees, a technique generally used to reconcile species trees from divergent gene trees, adapting it to the problem of finding robust relationships within a set of zzso zzso derived from local regions of the zzso zzso on both simulated and real data shows the method to be effective in zzso known true structure of the data closely matching our best current understanding of human evolutionary zzso Additional comparison with results of leading methods for the problem of population zzso assignment verifies that our method provides comparable accuracy in identifying meaningful population zzso in addition to zzso relationships among zzso The consensus tree approach thus provides a promising new model for the robust zzso of zzso and ancestry from large-scale genetic variation zzso
