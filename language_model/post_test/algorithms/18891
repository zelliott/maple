zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an extensive regular zzso of zzso zzso zzso via which zzso and zzso travel in and zzso Several zzso zzso zzso have recently been used for zzso separation and as zzso We studied the dynamics of zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso dynamics zzso and molecular dynamics zzso simulations, which show how the protein zzso influence the dynamics of zzso molecules in confined regions inside the zzso In the BD simulations, zzso beads represent zzso of different zzso The diffusion of zzso molecules inside zzso zzso is investigated by long-time MD zzso The zzso diffusion zzso within a crystal are found to be orders of magnitude lower than in bulk zzso The simulation results are compared to the recent experimental studies of diffusion and reaction inside zzso zzso The insights obtained from simulations allow us to understand the nature of zzso interactions and transport phenomena in zzso which is useful for the design of novel zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso
