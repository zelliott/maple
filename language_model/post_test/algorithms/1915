zzso abnormalities such as white matter zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are of clinical importance and frequently present in patients with stroke and zzso Up to date, there are limited zzso available to automatically delineate these cerebral abnormalities partially due to their complex appearance in MR zzso In this paper, we describe an automated zzso zzso approach for labeling the zzso zzso and zzso using zzso MR zzso We first automatically segment brain zzso zzso matter, gray matter, and zzso based on the zzso image and then identify zzso zzso based on the fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso zzso We finally label the zzso zzso and zzso based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso accuracy is evaluated using a community-based sample of 272 old zzso Our results show that the automated zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso is comparable with manual labeling in terms of spatial location, volume, and the number of zzso Additionally, the zzso volume is highly correlated with the visual grading score based on the zzso White Matter Changes zzso zzso The evaluations against the manual labeling and zzso visual grading suggest that our zzso provides reasonable zzso accuracy for the zzso zzso and zzso
