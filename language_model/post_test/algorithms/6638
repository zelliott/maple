Relative real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso has become an important tool for zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso populations following differential development or stimulation of zzso or zzso However, the best methods for conducting such experiments and analyzing the zzso data remain an issue of zzso In this report we describe an appropriate experimental methodology and the computer programs necessary to generate a meaningful statistical analysis of the combined biological and experimental zzso in such zzso Specifically, zzso transformations of raw zzso data from the zzso portion of real-time zzso growth zzso for both target and reference genes are analyzed using a zzso Mixed zzso program specifically designed to give a point estimate of the relative expression ratio of the target gene with associated zzso confidence zzso The program code is zzso and is printed in the zzso
