To present a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of genetic zzso zzso for finding the best fit of hearing aids or cochlear implants for individual users in clinical or research settings, where the zzso is solely driven by zzso human zzso 

Due to varying pathology, the best settings of an auditory device differ for each zzso It is also likely that listening preferences vary at the same zzso The settings of a device customized for a particular user can only be evaluated by the zzso When zzso zzso are used for fitting purposes, this situation poses a difficulty for a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the suitability of the fitting parameters produced by the zzso In the present study, an artificial listening environment was generated by zzso speech using a zzso zzso The settings produced by the zzso for this listening problem could zzso be evaluated by measuring speech recognition and comparing the performance to the best zzso condition where speech was least zzso Nine zzso subjects participated in the zzso The parameters to be zzso were the number of zzso channels, the shift between the input frequency range and the synthesis frequency range, and the zzso of the input frequency range over the synthesis frequency zzso The subjects listened to pairs of sentences processed with the zzso and entered a preference for the sentence with better zzso The zzso modified the solutions zzso according to the subject zzso The program zzso when the user ranked the same set of parameters as the best in three consecutive zzso The results produced by the zzso were analyzed for quality by measuring speech zzso for zzso reliability by running the zzso three times with each subject, and for convergence zzso 

Speech recognition scores averaged across subjects were similar for the best zzso solution and for the solutions produced by the zzso The average number of zzso was 8 and the average convergence time was zzso zzso The settings produced by different zzso runs for the same subject were slightly zzso however, speech recognition scores measured with these settings were zzso Individual data from subjects showed that in each run, a small number of zzso solutions produced poorer speech zzso than for the best zzso This was probably a result of the combination of the inherent randomness of the zzso the convergence criterion used in the present study, and possible errors that the users might have made during the paired zzso On the other hand, the effect of these errors was probably small compared to the other two factors, as a comparison between zzso preferences and objective measures showed that for many subjects the two were in good zzso 

The results showed that the zzso was able to produce good solutions by using listener preferences in a relatively short zzso For practical applications, the program can be made more robust by running the zzso twice or by not using an automatic stopping zzso and it can be made faster by zzso the number of the paired comparisons completed in each zzso
