Expanded bed zzso zzso is an innovative zzso technology that allows the zzso of target proteins directly from zzso zzso and the most important property of an expanded bed is the perfectly classified zzso of zzso beads in the zzso Due to the variation of both size and density of bulk zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso size, zzso density and bed zzso are the inherent characteristics of an expanded zzso However, the understanding on these properties is quite zzso In this study, raw beads zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso column were used as the model system and mean zzso size, zzso density and local bed zzso along the bed height were measured systematically with the zzso sampling method for two settled bed heights zzso and zzso and different expansion factors zzso With the increase of bed zzso mean zzso size and wet density of the beads decreased from 140 to zzso and from 4 to zzso zzso The local bed zzso increased from zzso to zzso with the increasing bed zzso The relative bed height and relative bed zzso were introduced to describe the general rule of zzso zzso Some empirical equations were used to correlate the mean zzso size, zzso density and local bed zzso along the bed height with the standard zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a general equation was proposed to predict the zzso zzso of zzso size, zzso density and local bed zzso in the column with standard zzso less than zzso for most of the experimental data, which would be useful for the characterization of zzso beads distribution in an expanded bed under varying operation zzso
