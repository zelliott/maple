This paper presents a new zzso method for zzso regional heart function from two-dimensional zzso In the approach, we first track the zzso and zzso boundaries using a new zzso of the dynamic snake zzso The tracked borders are then zzso into clinically meaningful regional zzso using a novel zzso zzso motivated by the zzso model used in clinical practice for qualitative assessment of heart zzso We show how a quantitative and automatic scoring scheme for the zzso excursion and zzso zzso can be derived from zzso zzso illustrating our approach on zzso zzso zzso data from a patient with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region of the heart are zzso In a case study (five patients, nine data zzso the performance of the tracking and interpretation techniques are compared with manual zzso of borders using a number of quantitative measures of regional zzso
