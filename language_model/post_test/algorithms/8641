We have designed a computer program which rapidly scans zzso acid sequences to select all possible pairs of zzso suitable for use as zzso to direct efficient DNA amplification by the zzso chain zzso This program is based on a set of rules which define in generic terms both the sequence composition of the zzso and the amplified region of zzso These rules zzso enhance zzso sequence zzso zzso at critical zzso extension initiation sites, zzso facilitate zzso of full length extension during the 72 degrees C phase, by minimizing generation of incomplete or zzso product and zzso limit primer losses occurring from zzso or zzso zzso Three examples of primer sets chosen by the program that correctly amplified the target regions starting from zzso are zzso This program should facilitate the rapid selection of effective and specific zzso from long gene sequences while providing a flexible choice of various zzso to focus study on particular regions of zzso
