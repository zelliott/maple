New sequencing technologies are rapidly zzso Many laboratories are simultaneously working with the traditional zzso zzso and experimenting with zzso generated by the zzso Life Science zzso Though zzso zzso have been used to generate zzso for many years, no program takes full advantage of the zzso and 3' zzso information, zzso many tentative transcripts are assembled into two separate zzso The new zzso technology has the benefit of zzso expression zzso but introduces time and space problems for assembling large zzso 

The zzso zzso for zzso and Viewing zzso assembler takes advantage of the zzso and 3' zzso information by requiring that the zzso be assembled into the same zzso and joined by zzso if the two zzso do not zzso It handles the depth of zzso data sets by zzso similar zzso during zzso which retains the expression level information while zzso time and space zzso zzso uses zzso for the zzso step and zzso for zzso however it assembles zzso to enforce the zzso zzso bury zzso and reduce incorrect joins and zzso The zzso data management system uses a zzso database to store multiple libraries of zzso along with their zzso the management system allows multiple zzso with variations on libraries and zzso Analysis routines provide standard zzso for the zzso including a measure of zzso expressed genes across the zzso A zzso viewer program is provided for display and analysis of the zzso Our results clearly show the benefit of using the zzso assembler to explicitly use zzso information and bury zzso for large zzso 

The zzso assembler provides a software package for assembling zzso and/or zzso zzso The assembly software, data management software, zzso viewer and user's guide are freely zzso
