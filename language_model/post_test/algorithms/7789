In this work we report findings from an in zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso study of the human zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso Data were collected at 3 T using a zzso zzso zzso which provides images free from typical magnetic zzso zzso The general zzso features observed in the zzso zzso region were consistent across zzso They included a central area with high zzso and highest zzso in a predominately zzso direction corresponding to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso surrounded by a band of low zzso reflecting zzso orientation of fibers within the zzso and a lateral area with high zzso and highest zzso in a predominately zzso direction corresponding to zzso zzso fibers that do not zzso Animal studies indicate that there is a significant zzso reorganization of the zzso distribution of fibers along the zzso zzso We found that diffusion zzso in the central portion of the zzso zzso show considerable zzso zzso in the zzso plane indicating fiber crossings in the zzso direction, rather than strictly zzso This architectural feature of the zzso suggests that zzso reorganization of fibers in the zzso pathways also occurs in zzso We have shown that by collecting zzso resolution data, zzso can be used to investigate fine details of small and complex white matter structures, in zzso with a clinical zzso High spatial resolution, however, is necessary in the slice direction as well as zzso to reduce the zzso contribution to the signal and to increase fiber zzso within zzso
