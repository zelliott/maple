This work demonstrates the feasibility of using zzso zzso for the analysis of small quantities of chemically similar zzso and their zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso of 1 zzso solutions of zzso and/or zzso after deposition onto an zzso zzso silver zzso (and the resulting spectral features are attributed to a combination of normal and zzso zzso zzso These compounds were selected because they are representative of zzso derived from zzso modified proteins which, like these compounds, often consist of zzso of equal mass and similar zzso zzso spectral zzso were recorded and processed using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso training and testing zzso zzso derived from solutions of individual zzso were identified with zzso zzso and zzso of the two zzso were zzso with an average error of zzso in the relative zzso composition for zzso with a total zzso concentration of 1 zzso
