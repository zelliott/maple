To evaluate zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fine needle aspiration zzso zzso rate and zzso yield at a zzso teaching zzso 

All zzso of zzso zzso performed from August 1990 to October 1993 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center zzso Clinic were reviewed and the results analyzed for correlation with surgical outcome, zzso result and operator zzso zzso factors influencing the zzso zzso rate, surgical referral pattern and zzso yield were zzso 

A total of 504 aspirations in 422 patients with zzso zzso were included in the zzso The sensitivity of zzso for detecting zzso was zzso specificity was zzso and accuracy was zzso A significant negative correlation was found between recent zzso experience and the zzso zzso Repeat aspiration of zzso previously yielding benign zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with insufficient aspirations gave a low zzso yield, and aspiration of zzso that were zzso on zzso rarely yielded false positive zzso zzso 

zzso limitations of zzso zzso zzso include a large number of zzso containing insufficient zzso material and a variable zzso zzso zzso recommendations based on the findings in this report are: the establishment of uniform criteria for judging zzso zzso the performance of repeat aspiration on zzso zzso with previously benign zzso the abandonment of zzso in the routine management of zzso zzso and a conservative approach to clinically zzso zzso repeatedly found to have scant zzso on zzso Based on these findings, an zzso for the diagnostic evaluation of a solid zzso zzso can be zzso
