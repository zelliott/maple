A method aimed at the real-time monitoring of muscular fatigue was implemented and zzso The method is based on an estimate of the complex zzso function in order to zzso in real time, the mean frequency of the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is guaranteed by a zzso zzso of the complex zzso and then of the mean zzso The results show good performance on both synthetic and experimental zzso zzso signals recorded during fatiguing dynamic zzso Performance in the presence of noise is highly satisfactory on both deterministic signals and zzso zzso even when there are strong zzso Moreover, the zzso complexity is highly reduced with respect to that offered by traditional methods based on short time zzso zzso
