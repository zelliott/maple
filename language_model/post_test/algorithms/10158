Treatment of chronic zzso leukemia zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represents a successful application of zzso targeted zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso stem cells remains incompletely zzso On the basis of a statistical modeling approach that used the 10-year zzso zzso treatment response of patients with zzso and a patient cohort receiving zzso zzso therapy, we found that successful long-term therapy results in a zzso exponential decline of zzso transcripts in many zzso Within our zzso the first slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per day represents the turnover rate of zzso differentiated cells, whereas the second slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per day represents the turnover rate of zzso zzso zzso The third slope allows an zzso of the behavior of immature zzso cells, potentially stem zzso This third slope is negative in most patients, positive in others, and not zzso in some zzso This zzso in response may be because of insufficient zzso missing data, disease zzso inconsistent compliance to drug, or acquired zzso Our approach suggests that long-term zzso therapy may reduce the abundance of zzso stem cells in some zzso
