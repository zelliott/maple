An zzso zzso potential is presented for the zzso zzso together with an zzso potential for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso potential can be used as a building block for the backbone of zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso have been zzso One, zzso as zzso is stabilized by a hydrogen bonded five member ring, and the other, zzso as zzso zzso to a seven zzso zzso The interaction between one water zzso and the zzso system is also studied and compared with zzso zzso calculations and with the results obtained for some of the more commonly used force zzso The agreement between the zzso and zzso energies for the complexes is in general superior to that of the other force zzso In the zzso region the surfaces obtained from the zzso part of the commonly used force fields are too flat compared to the zzso potential and the zzso zzso zzso We further analyze the possibility of using a charge distribution obtained from one zzso to describe the charge distribution of other zzso We have found that the use of zzso and generic zzso can model most of the changes in charge density due to the different geometry of the new zzso but that one can expect additional errors in the interaction energies that are of the order of 1 zzso
