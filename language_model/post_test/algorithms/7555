Combining zzso colony zzso zzso and the zzso evolutionary zzso zzso based on decomposition zzso this paper proposes a zzso zzso zzso zzso Following other zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso problem into a number of zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso zzso is responsible for solving one zzso All the zzso are divided into a few groups, and each zzso has several neighboring zzso An zzso group maintains a zzso zzso and an individual zzso has a zzso information zzso During the search, each zzso also records the best solution found so far for its zzso To construct a new solution, an zzso combines information from its group's zzso zzso its own zzso information zzso and its current zzso An zzso checks the new solutions constructed by itself and its neighbors, and updates its current solution if it has found a better one in terms of its own zzso zzso experiments have been conducted in this paper to study and compare zzso with other zzso on two sets of test zzso On the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso with conventional genetic operators and local search on all the nine test zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso information zzso in zzso are crucial to the good performance of zzso for the zzso zzso On the zzso traveling salesman problem, zzso performs much better than the zzso on all the 12 test zzso We also evaluate the effects of zzso neighborhood, and the location information of current solutions on the performance of zzso The work in this paper shows that zzso search zzso zzso zzso the zzso while zzso principle, is effective in improving zzso zzso zzso
