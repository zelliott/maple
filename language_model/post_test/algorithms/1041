Identification of zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso has implications for the molecular epidemiology and for the molecular pathology of human zzso We have developed and evaluated an arrayed primer extension zzso for covering both strands of a region of the coding sequence containing more than zzso of the zzso described so far in zzso On average, zzso of the arrayed zzso gene sequence can be analyzed from either sense or zzso zzso and zzso from both zzso A patient DNA sample is amplified and zzso to arrayed zzso which then promote DNA zzso extension reactions with four zzso labeled zzso The zzso gene chip spans zzso zzso plus two zzso from both zzso The performance of the zzso was evaluated by using freshly extracted zzso DNA, as well as DNA extracted from archival zzso DNA zzso The arrayed primer zzso zzso gene test provides an accurate and efficient tool for DNA sequence analysis of this frequently zzso gene for both research and clinical zzso
