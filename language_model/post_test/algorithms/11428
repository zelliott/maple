zzso in knowledge of obesity zzso and mobile phone technology have created the opportunity to develop an electronic tool to predict an zzso risk of childhood zzso The study aims were to develop and validate equations for the prediction of childhood obesity and integrate them into a mobile phone application zzso 

zzso and childhood obesity risk data were obtained for 1868 zzso White or South Asian infants in the Born in Bradford zzso zzso zzso was used to develop prediction equations (at 6 zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso for risk of childhood obesity zzso at 2 years zzso zzso and weight gain from 0-2 years zzso zzso zzso incorporating sex, birth weight, and weight gain as zzso The discrimination accuracy of the equations was assessed by the area under the curve zzso internal zzso by comparing area under the curve to those obtained in zzso zzso and external zzso by applying the equations to an external zzso An App was built to incorporate six final equations zzso at each age, one of which included maternal zzso The equations had good discrimination zzso zzso with the addition of maternal zzso marginally improving zzso The zzso in the zzso and external validation samples were similar to those obtained in the development zzso The App is zzso requires a minimum amount of information, and provides a risk assessment of low, zzso or high accompanied by advice and zzso links to government zzso 

zzso equations for risk of childhood obesity have been developed and incorporated into a novel zzso thereby providing proof of concept that childhood obesity prediction research can be integrated with zzso in zzso
