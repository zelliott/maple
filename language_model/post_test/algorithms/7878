We compare measured output factors of clinical electron fields to those calculated by a commercial treatment planning system based on an electron zzso Carlo zzso The measured data is comprised of 195 fields with energies 6 to 18 zzso zzso sizes 6 zzso 6 zzso to 25 zzso 25 zzso and source to surface distances zzso of 97 to 107 zzso Due to a zzso of clinical fields for the highest energies and the largest zzso sizes, additional zzso were made at arbitrarily chosen large field sizes at previously not used zzso for a total of 223 output zzso The difference between calculation and measurement ranged from zzso to zzso with a mean difference of zzso Half of the field shapes had a difference with magnitude less than zzso Only 7 zzso of the field shapes were zzso having differences greater than zzso All zzso had field zzso at the zzso point zzso zzso zzso were applied at zzso zzso 100 zzso were zzso for the 25 zzso 25 zzso zzso or had more than one of these zzso For narrow and zzso fields the zzso slightly overestimated output factors, whereas for field shapes with aspect ratio close to 1 the zzso slightly underestimated the output zzso No strong dependence of the difference on energy was zzso
