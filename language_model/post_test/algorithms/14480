The automatic zzso of the prostate and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso images is still a challenging problem, and is critical for zzso therapy zzso We present a new, automatic zzso zzso based on zzso organ models built from previously segmented training zzso The major contributions of this work are a new zzso cost function based on a zzso framework that incorporates anatomical constraints from surrounding bones and a new appearance model that learns a zzso distribution of the intensity zzso inside and outside organ zzso We report zzso results on 185 zzso of the prostate site, demonstrating improved performance over previous zzso
