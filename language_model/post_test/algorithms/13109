zzso exploit the perception that others are zzso zzso to zzso social zzso zzso zzso This paper demonstrates how the above theory can be zzso in a social robot that uses itself as a model to recognize structural similarities with other zzso this thereby enables the student to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate zzso This is accomplished by the student robot first performing zzso a phase in which it uses zzso relationships to zzso its own zzso Second, the student models a candidate teacher using a zzso active learning approach to create an approximate physical simulation of the zzso Third, the student determines that the teacher is structurally similar (but not necessarily visually zzso to itself if it can find a neural controller that allows its self model zzso in the first zzso to reproduce the perceived motion of the teacher model zzso in the second zzso Fourth, the student uses the neural controller zzso in the third zzso to move, resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso with a physical student robot and two physical robot teachers demonstrate the effectiveness of this zzso The zzso of the proposed model allows it to be used over variations in the zzso The student robot would still be able to imitate teachers of different sizes and at different distances from itself, as well as different positions in its field of view, because change in the zzso of the teacher's body parts are used for zzso rather than absolute geometric zzso
