An automated method is being developed in order to identify corresponding zzso in serial zzso CT scans for zzso change zzso The method uses the rib zzso as the reference for initial zzso zzso A zzso zzso rib zzso method first locates the regions where the ribs join the spine, which define the starting locations for rib zzso Each rib is tracked and locally segmented by zzso The ribs are automatically labeled, and the zzso are estimated using zzso For a given zzso in the source zzso the closest three ribs are zzso A three-dimensional zzso rigid zzso transformation guided by zzso zzso zzso the zzso of each of the three rib pairs in the source and target CT zzso zzso defined control points along the zzso of the three ribs in the source scan and the registered ribs in the target scan are used to guide an initial registration using a second zzso rigid zzso zzso A search volume of interest zzso is then located in the target zzso zzso candidate locations within the search zzso are identified as regions with high zzso zzso The initial registration is refined by searching for the maximum zzso between the zzso template from the source scan and the candidate zzso The method was evaluated on 48 CT scans from 20 zzso zzso zzso identified 101 pairs of corresponding zzso Three metrics were used for performance zzso The first metric was the zzso distance between the zzso centers identified by the zzso and the computer zzso the second metric was a volume overlap measure between the zzso zzso identified by the zzso and the computer zzso and the third metric was the hit rate, which measures the fraction of zzso whose zzso zzso by the computer registration in the target scan falls within the zzso identified by the zzso The average zzso distance error was zzso zzso zzso zzso Only two pairs had an error larger than 10 zzso The average volume overlap measure was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 101 pairs had ratios larger than zzso and only two pairs had no zzso The final hit rate was zzso
