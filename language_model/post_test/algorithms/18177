We explicitly analyze the zzso of learning near zzso in zzso networks, such as zzso zzso and zzso basis function networks, which include zzso symmetry of hidden zzso and show their general zzso Such symmetry zzso zzso in their zzso space, where the Fisher information zzso zzso and odd learning behaviors, especially the existence of zzso in zzso descent learning, arise due to the geometric structure of zzso We plot dynamic zzso fields to demonstrate the universal zzso of learning near zzso The zzso zzso two types of zzso the zzso plateau and the zzso zzso depending on the stability of the zzso and the initial parameters of zzso The results presented in this letter are universally zzso to a wide class of zzso zzso zzso stability analysis of the dynamics of learning in zzso basis function networks and zzso zzso will be presented in separate zzso
