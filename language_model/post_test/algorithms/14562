In many situations we are faced with the need to estimate the number of classes in a population from observed count zzso this arises not only in biology, where we are interested in the number of zzso such as species, but also in many other fields such as public health, criminal justice, software engineering, zzso This problem has a rich history in theoretical statistics, dating back at least to 1943, and many approaches have been proposed and zzso However, to date only one approach has been implemented in readily available software, namely a relatively simple zzso method which, while straightforward to program, is not flexible and can be prone to information zzso Here we present zzso a new, zzso zzso zzso zzso software package which zzso a powerful and flexible suite of zzso models (based on current statistical zzso in addition to all existing zzso zzso We briefly describe the software and its mathematical zzso (which are treated in depth zzso and we work through an applied example from microbial ecology in zzso
