zzso technologies, such as DNA zzso have significantly advanced biological and biomedical research by enabling researchers to carry out zzso zzso One critical task in analyzing zzso zzso is to control the false discovery rate zzso so that the proportion of false positive features among those called significant is zzso Recently a number of zzso control methods have been proposed and widely practiced, such as the zzso approach, the zzso approach and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso 

This paper presents a zzso yet powerful zzso control method termed zzso which aims to minimize zzso when calling a fixed number of significant zzso We theoretically proved that the strategy used by zzso is able to find the optimal number of significant features when the desired zzso is zzso 

We compared zzso with the zzso approach, the zzso approach and SAM on both simulated zzso and public DNA zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso zzso others by identifying more significant features under the same zzso zzso Literature search showed that many genes called only by zzso are indeed relevant to the underlying biology of zzso 

zzso has been widely applied to analyzing zzso zzso allowed for rapid zzso Under the same zzso zzso zzso is capable to identify more significant features than its competitors at a compatible level of zzso zzso it can potentially generate great impacts on biological and biomedical zzso
