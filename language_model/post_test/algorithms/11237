zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that exhibit inverse temperature phase transition behavior, causing an zzso to zzso above its inverse transition temperature zzso Although this property has been exploited in a variety of zzso applications, de zzso design of zzso that display a specific zzso is not trivial because the zzso of an zzso is a complex function of several zzso including its zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and the type and concentration of zzso in zzso This paper provides a quantitative model that predicts the zzso of a family of zzso zzso where zzso zzso Ala and/or zzso from their zzso chain zzso and concentration in zzso zzso zzso This model will enable de zzso prediction of the zzso acid sequence and chain length of zzso that will display a predetermined zzso in zzso buffer within a specified concentration regime, thereby greatly zzso the design of new zzso for applications in medicine and zzso
