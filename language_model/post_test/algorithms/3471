A study has been made of the effects of zzso on the strength of zzso and zzso ceramic layers joined to zzso zzso and loaded at the top surfaces by a zzso zzso in simulation of zzso contact in ceramic crowns on tooth zzso The zzso treatment is applied to the ceramic bottom surface before bonding to the zzso as in common dental zzso zzso with polished surfaces are used as a zzso Tests are conducted with zzso increasing zzso and zzso zzso loading on the zzso zzso up to the point of initiation of a zzso fracture at the ceramic bottom surface immediately below the zzso For the polished zzso data from the dynamic and zzso tests zzso consistent with a dominant slow crack growth mode of zzso zzso of zzso specimens show significant reductions in both dynamic and zzso tests, indicative of larger starting zzso However, the shift is considerably greater in the zzso data, suggesting some mechanically assisted growth of the zzso zzso These results have implications in the context of lifetimes of dental zzso
