There has been much interest in using patterns derived from zzso laser zzso and zzso zzso protein mass zzso from serum to differentiate samples from patients both with and without zzso Such patterns have been used without identification of the underlying proteins zzso However, there are questions as to the stability of this procedure over multiple zzso 

We compared zzso zzso zzso from serum from three experiments by the same group on separating zzso cancer from normal zzso These zzso are available on the web at zzso In general, the results were not zzso across zzso zzso correction prevents reproduction of the results for two of the zzso In one experiment, there is evidence of a major shift in protocol zzso which could bias the zzso In another, structure in the noise regions of the zzso allows us to distinguish normal from cancer, suggesting that the zzso and zzso were processed zzso zzso of features found to discriminate well in one experiment do not zzso to other zzso Finally, the mass zzso in all three experiments appears zzso Taken together, these and other concerns suggest that much of the structure uncovered in these experiments could be due to artifacts of sample processing, not to the underlying biology of zzso We provide some guidelines for design and analysis in experiments like these to ensure better zzso biologically zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso code used in our analyses is available at zzso
