Recent studies suggest that exposure to repetitive episodes of zzso and transient zzso can lead to increased risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso To obtain an improved understanding of and to zzso characterize the zzso effects of zzso from sleep, a zzso zzso model was used to determine the zzso among zzso heart rate and blood pressure in 8 normal zzso A zzso least squares zzso was used in combination with the zzso expansion technique to estimate the zzso impulse responses of the 4 model zzso We found that during zzso 1) zzso zzso gain increases in zzso movement zzso but not in zzso sleep; 2) in both zzso and zzso sleep, zzso gain shows an initial increase, but this is followed by a more sustained decrease below zzso baseline levels, allowing sympathetic tone to be elevated over a relatively long zzso 3) the gains of other model components show increases with zzso that are consistent with the increased sympathetic zzso of systemic vascular resistance and zzso of the zzso These findings establish a zzso database against which further zzso of cardiovascular zzso responses in zzso may be zzso
