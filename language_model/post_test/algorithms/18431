zzso evidence demonstrates the importance of long zzso proteins for the spatial organization of cellular zzso Although several protein classes with long zzso zzso have been studied in animals and zzso our knowledge about plant long zzso proteins is very zzso The repeat nature of the zzso sequence motif often prevents the simple identification of zzso of animal zzso proteins by generic sequence similarity zzso As a consequence, counterparts of many animal proteins with long zzso zzso like zzso zzso or zzso organization center zzso have not been identified yet in zzso Here, all zzso proteins predicted to contain long stretches of zzso zzso were identified by applying the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso A zzso protein database, zzso zzso was established that zzso information on number, size, and position of predicted zzso zzso with zzso zzso signals, zzso zzso and available functional zzso zzso serves as a tool to sort and browse zzso long zzso proteins to facilitate the identification and selection of candidate proteins of potential interest for specific research zzso Using the database, candidate proteins were identified for zzso zzso zzso and zzso long zzso zzso
