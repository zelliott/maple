zzso validation indexes are intended to assess the goodness of zzso zzso Many methods used to estimate the number of clusters rely on a validation index as a key element to find the correct zzso This paper presents a new validation index based on graph concepts, which has been designed to find arbitrary shaped clusters by exploiting the spatial layout of the patterns and their zzso zzso This new zzso index is combined with a solid statistical detection zzso the gap zzso The resulting method is able to find the right number of zzso clusters in diverse situations, as we show with examples where this information is zzso A comparison with several relevant validation methods is carried out using artificial and gene expression data zzso The results are very encouraging, showing that the underlying structure in the data can be more accurately detected with the new zzso zzso Our gene expression data results also indicate that this new index is stable under zzso of the input zzso
