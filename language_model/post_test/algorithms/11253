Our objective was to estimate the correlation of zzso and textural features, using ultrasound and digital image analysis, between plaques in patients with bilateral carotid zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing carotid zzso were recruited from zzso Surgery at the Royal Victoria and Jewish General hospitals in Montreal, zzso zzso zzso carotid ultrasound and digital image analysis was performed to extract zzso and textural features using a commercially available zzso zzso Analysis software zzso zzso Principal component analysis zzso was zzso zzso correlation zzso for zzso and individual imaging variables between surgical and zzso plaques were calculated with adjustment for age, sex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In the whole group zzso zzso zzso the six identified zzso variables and zzso individual imaging variables were moderately correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso between sides were increased in patients with zzso zzso zzso and symptomatic zzso 

zzso and zzso features of carotid plaques were similar between two sides in patients with bilateral zzso supporting the notion that plaque instability is determined by systemic zzso Patients with unstable features of one plaque should perhaps be monitored more closely or treated more aggressively for their zzso zzso particularly if this is zzso zzso
