The beam angle selection zzso problem in zzso radiation therapy is often interpreted as a zzso zzso problem, zzso finding the best combination of zzso beams in a discrete set of candidate zzso It is well established that the zzso zzso problem may be solved efficiently with zzso such as simulated zzso or genetic zzso However, the underlying parameters of the zzso process, such as the inclusion of zzso candidate beams, the angular resolution in the space of candidate beams, and the number of evaluated beam ensembles as well as the relative performance of different zzso have not yet been systematically zzso We study these open questions in a zzso of four strategies for zzso zzso in order to provide a reference for future research related to the zzso problem in zzso radiation therapy treatment zzso We introduce a zzso inverse planning engine for zzso It performs a full zzso zzso for zzso treatment plans per hour while handling up to zzso of dose influence data zzso candidate zzso For three head and neck patients, we compare the relative performance of a zzso a zzso a simulated zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The selection of ensembles with 5, 7, 9 and 11 beams considering either only zzso or all feasible candidate beams is studied for an angular resolution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the space of candidate zzso The impact of different convergence criteria is investigated in comparison to a fixed termination after the evaluation of zzso beam zzso In total, our simulations comprise a full zzso zzso for about zzso treatment zzso All four zzso zzso strategies yield significant improvements of the objective function value and of the corresponding dose zzso compared to standard beam zzso with zzso zzso zzso The genetic and the zzso zzso showed faster convergence in the very beginning of the zzso but the simulated zzso zzso eventually arrived at almost the same objective function zzso These three strategies typically yield clinically equivalent treatment zzso The zzso zzso showed the worst convergence zzso The choice of the termination criterion had a stronger influence on the performance of the simulated zzso zzso than on the performance of the genetic and the zzso zzso We advocate to terminate the zzso process after the evaluation of 1000 beam combinations without objective function zzso For our simulations, this resulted in an average zzso of the objective function from the reference value after zzso evaluated beam ensembles of zzso for all zzso On average, there was only a minor improvement when increasing the angular resolution in the space of candidate beam angles from zzso to zzso However, we observed significant improvements when considering zzso candidate beams for challenging head and neck zzso
