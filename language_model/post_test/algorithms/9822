Conventional zzso methods employing zzso technique are suitable for locating acoustic zzso zzso source in a zzso structure without structural zzso But these methods cannot be extended to structures with complicated zzso and, also, the problem gets compounded if the material of the structure is zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso A zzso approach using zzso construction is proposed in this work to locate the zzso source in a composite zzso The approach is based on the fact that the wave takes minimum energy path to travel from the source to any other point in the connected zzso The zzso are zzso on the zzso surface of the structure using graph theory based on zzso zzso By zzso the waves in reverse virtually from these sensors along the zzso path and by locating the first intersection point of these waves, one can get the zzso source zzso In this work, the zzso approach is shown more suitable for a zzso source location solution in a composite structure with arbitrary surface containing finite zzso zzso have been conducted on composite plate specimens of simple and complex geometry to validate this zzso
