Numerous studies have revealed structural brain changes in late life depression, mainly in white matter or whole zzso with few zzso just on zzso matter zzso The objective was to investigate zzso changes in older depressed and similar aged healthy subjects using two different methods, cortical thickness in frontal lobe structures and zzso zzso zzso 

Sixty eight subjects participated (30 healthy comparison subjects, 38 zzso and underwent zzso zzso MR imaging as well as clinical and cognitive zzso zzso cortical thickness was measured using zzso while zzso was undertaken using the zzso zzso in zzso Group differences in cortical thickness and zzso volumes were assessed using zzso zzso of cortical thickness and zzso results on cognitive and depression variables were also zzso 

No significant differences in frontal lobe cortical thickness were observed between groups zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In addition, no significant relationships of cortical thickness on cognitive and depression scores were identified zzso correlation zzso p zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso volumes were indistinguishable between groups but significant age effects were apparent, independent of zzso 

zzso suggest that cortical zzso changes in late life depression zzso are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive zzso Changes to white matter and zzso zzso structures may be more relevant in explaining the underlying zzso of zzso
