Traditional zzso recognition systems rely on a single zzso signature for zzso While the advantage of using multiple sources of information for establishing the identity has been widely zzso zzso models for zzso zzso recognition have only recently received zzso We propose a zzso sparse representation method, which represents the test data by a sparse linear combination of training data, while constraining the observations from different zzso of the test subject to share their sparse zzso Thus, we simultaneously take into account correlations as well as zzso information among zzso zzso A zzso quality measure is also proposed to weigh each zzso as it gets zzso Furthermore, we also zzso the zzso to handle zzso in zzso The zzso problem is solved using an efficient alternative direction zzso Various experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with competing zzso zzso
