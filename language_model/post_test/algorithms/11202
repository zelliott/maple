zzso to the complex behavior of zzso bubble clouds zzso linear and zzso zzso zzso acoustic zzso remains a hardly zzso phenomenon, leading to poorly zzso zzso zzso A better control of the various aspects of zzso phenomena for in zzso applications is a key requirement to improve emerging ultrasound zzso Previous publications have reported on systems performing regulation of acoustic zzso in continuous zzso when applied in zzso but the main challenge today is to achieve real-time control of zzso activity in zzso zzso when used in zzso The present work aims at developing a system to control acoustic zzso in a zzso wave condition using a real-time feedback zzso The experimental setup consists of a water bath in which is submerged a focused zzso zzso waves, frequency zzso used for zzso and a zzso used to listen to zzso zzso The designed regulation process allows the zzso activity to be controlled through a zzso feedback zzso Without regulation, zzso exhibits numerous bursts of intense activity and large variations of zzso zzso level over zzso In a regulated regime, the control of zzso zzso activity within a pulse leads to consistent zzso levels over time with an enhancement of the zzso
