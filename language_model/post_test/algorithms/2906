Clinical trials in patients with zzso for zzso zzso dysfunction or zzso block have highlighted the fact that zzso of zzso contraction induced by right zzso zzso pacing is associated with long-term morbidity and zzso These clinical data confirm zzso results indicating that right zzso zzso pacing causes abnormal zzso contraction, reduces pump function and leads to zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this zzso we discuss the clinical evidence for the adverse and beneficial effects of various right zzso pacing sites, left zzso pacing sites and zzso zzso We also propose a zzso zzso for pacing zzso based on zzso zzso left zzso function and expected zzso
