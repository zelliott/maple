We present several image reconstruction zzso for generating three-dimensional zzso renderings of zzso zzso that are founded on maximum likelihood zzso zzso zzso The basic principle of the zzso is in zzso the values of the optical zzso of the zzso A computer simulation and initial experimental testing of a zzso ascent version of the zzso is zzso The computer simulation demonstrates that the zzso zzso has an advantage over previously used inverse filtering techniques in that it partially restores the zzso zzso components in the well-known zzso zzso We present 3-D reconstructions from real biological data to show the potential of the zzso in practical zzso
