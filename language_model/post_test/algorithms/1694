This paper aims to investigate the synchronization problem of coupled zzso networks with zzso zzso zzso without or with zzso zzso Different from cluster synchronization of zzso zzso networks in the previous literature, this paper focuses on the problem of complete zzso which is more challenging than cluster zzso By applying an impulsive zzso some sufficient criteria are obtained for complete synchronization of the coupled zzso networks of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso simulations are given to verify the theoretical zzso
