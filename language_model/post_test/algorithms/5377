The sense of hearing depends on the faithful transmission of sound information from the ear to the brain by spiral zzso zzso zzso However, how zzso zzso develop the connections and properties that zzso auditory processing is largely zzso We zzso gene expression in mouse zzso zzso from embryonic day 12, when zzso zzso first extend projections, up until zzso day 15, after the onset of zzso For comparison, we also analyzed the closely related zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso analysis confirmed enriched expression of genes associated with gene regulation and zzso outgrowth at early zzso with the zzso and zzso often expressing different members of the same gene zzso At later zzso the zzso transcribe more genes related to mature function, and exhibit a dramatic increase in immune gene zzso Comparisons of the two populations revealed enhanced expression of zzso zzso components in zzso zzso and established new markers that consistently distinguish auditory and zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso a zzso factor commonly associated with auditory development, is also expressed in zzso zzso at early zzso We therefore defined new zzso of zzso factors and zzso guidance molecules that are uniquely expressed in zzso zzso and may drive zzso aspects of their differentiation and zzso We show that one of these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso of the zzso central zzso zzso our zzso provides a useful resource for uncovering the molecular basis of specific auditory circuit assembly zzso
