In biological networks of molecular interactions in a cell, network motifs that are biologically relevant are also functionally zzso or form functional zzso These functionally coherent zzso combine in a zzso manner into larger, less cohesive zzso thus revealing one of the essential design principles of zzso cellular organization and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been explicitly taken into consideration by most, if not all, functional zzso zzso As a result, the existing methods would often fail to assign a statistically significant functional zzso score to biologically relevant molecular zzso We developed a methodology for zzso functional zzso Given the zzso zzso of functional concepts zzso Gene zzso and the association of individual genes or proteins with these concepts zzso GO zzso our method will assign a zzso zzso zzso zzso to each zzso in the hierarchy of functional zzso the zzso score and its zzso measure functional zzso of each module in the zzso While existing methods zzso each module with a set of zzso functional terms in a bag of zzso our complementary method provides the zzso functional zzso of the zzso and their zzso organized zzso A zzso organization of functional zzso often comes as a zzso of cluster analysis of gene expression data or protein interaction zzso Otherwise, our method will automatically build such a hierarchy by directly incorporating the functional zzso information into the hierarchy search process and by allowing zzso genes to be part of more than one component in the zzso In addition, its underlying zzso scoring metric ensures that functional specificity of the terms across different levels of the zzso zzso is properly zzso We have evaluated our method using zzso zzso data from zzso and zzso databases and several other zzso derived and curated zzso The code and additional supplemental files can be obtained from zzso zzso 2012 March zzso
