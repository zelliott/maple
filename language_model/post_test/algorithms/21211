Current zzso studies primarily focus on identifying individual genes with differential expression levels across different conditions or zzso A potential problem is that they may disregard zzso information hidden in gene zzso In this study, we propose an approach to detect gene interactions related to study zzso through identifying gene pairs with correlations that appear to be class or condition zzso In addition, we explore the effects of ignoring zzso correlations zzso on zzso zzso zzso Our simulation studies show that ignoring zzso can significantly decrease the accuracy of gene zzso and increase the zzso within zzso Our results from a zzso zzso types of diffuse large B cell zzso data set illustrate that zzso are clearly present and have great adverse effects on zzso results if zzso Meanwhile, interesting biological interpretations may be derived from studying gene pairs with zzso This study demonstrates that our zzso is simple and zzso efficient and has the ability to detect gene pairs with zzso that are zzso for uncovering interesting regulation zzso
