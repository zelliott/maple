zzso zzso zzso were prepared by modified double emulsion zzso A zzso full zzso experiment was designed to study the effects of the composition of outer zzso phase in terms of amount of zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso on the zzso efficiency and % yield and zzso zzso The results of analysis of zzso test for responses measured indicated that the test is significant zzso The contribution of sodium zzso concentration was found to be higher on zzso efficiency and % yield, whereas zzso produced significant effect on the mean diameter of zzso zzso demonstrated zzso particles in the size range of zzso zzso In zzso release profile of zzso zzso demonstrated sustained release for 24 h following zzso zzso Finally, drug zzso was found to remain intact after zzso Response surface zzso are presented to examine the effects of independent variables on the responses zzso Thus, by zzso design important parameters affecting zzso characteristics of zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso can be identified for controlled delivery with desirable characters in terms of maximum zzso and zzso
