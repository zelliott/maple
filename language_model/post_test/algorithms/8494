The mixed zzso zzso method was evaluated for the routine determination of total zzso zzso zzso in municipal raw and treated zzso zzso in wastewater samples were enriched with a zzso zzso extraction zzso zzso with zzso zzso and separated from zzso with stacked strong zzso zzso ammonium zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso exchange zzso Sample extracts were evaporated to dryness and zzso in distilled zzso The total amount of zzso on a weight basis, was determined by measuring the critical zzso concentration of a mixed zzso made up of zzso and the zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso used as the zzso The dye zzso zzso Blue G was used as a zzso zzso The minimum amount of zzso required for a single determination was 1 zzso For raw sewage samples, mean zzso and standard zzso were 98 zzso 6 and 98 zzso zzso at zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso For treated sewage samples, mean zzso and standard zzso were 95 zzso 2 and 100 zzso zzso at zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The MA method and the classical zzso active substances and zzso zzso active substances procedures were zzso The former offers some significant advantages over the classical procedures in terms of sensitivity, zzso precision, zzso and zzso the type of response is independent of both the molecular weight and the chain length of the zzso
