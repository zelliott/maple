zzso spectral zzso zzso has been adopted to test the three-dimensional distribution parameters of fluid fields, such as burning gas, flame and plasma zzso In most cases, zzso spectral data received by the video cameras are enormous so that the zzso spectral zzso calculation is often zzso zzso accelerating calculation becomes the chief factor that one must consider for the practical application of zzso To solve the problem, a hardware zzso method was proposed in this paper, which adopted a digital signal zzso zzso zzso in an zzso spectral zzso test zzso The zzso zzso was fulfilled in the zzso then calculation results were transmitted to the main computer via the user zzso zzso Compared with purely zzso software zzso this new approach can decrease the calculation time zzso
