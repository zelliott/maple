zzso models have been widely used with success in medical image zzso They combine bottom-up information derived from image appearance cues, with zzso zzso constraints within a zzso zzso However, in many real world problems the observations extracted from the image data often contain gross zzso which adversely affect the deformation zzso To alleviate this issue, we introduce a new family of zzso models that are inspired from compressed zzso a technique for efficiently reconstructing a signal based on its zzso in some zzso In this problem, we employ zzso to represent the zzso or gross zzso and combine it seamlessly with zzso zzso The proposed new zzso is applied to the analysis of cardiac motion, using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso where the automated tagging line tracking results are very noisy due to the poor image zzso Our new zzso models track the heart motion zzso and the resulting strains are consistent with those calculated from manual zzso
