The basis of the zzso alertness model used at the heart of the System for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso software tool is zzso A number of extensions to the basic model that are zzso to the civil aviation environment are zzso based on the analysis of eight studies involving sleep zzso gathered from pilots zzso a range of duty zzso The relationship between zzso alertness and performance of laboratory tasks is described and it is concluded that different tasks are affected zzso by zzso In general, there is a larger impact on the zzso of errors than on response zzso The zzso of the full model in the Integrated Performance Modeling Environment is described and the application of both the alertness and performance models to two scenarios provided by the workshop organizers is zzso It is concluded that further work is needed in three zzso cumulative fatigue, the impact of sleep architecture, and the prediction of performance for complex tasks in zzso
