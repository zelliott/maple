Since hormone replacement therapy given for long periods is now zzso to produce serious side effects, patients with troublesome zzso symptoms are increasingly using zzso treatment including zzso Several zzso controlled trials have shown that acupuncture reduces zzso symptoms in patients experiencing the normal zzso It may have this effect by raising zzso levels which alter the temperature set point in the zzso zzso symptoms can be extreme in breast cancer patients and patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing zzso zzso The safety of some herbal medicines and zzso has been questioned, as they could potentially interfere adversely with the zzso of zzso zzso A previous study reports short term benefit from zzso and the aim of this report is to describe our approach to long term zzso 

After zzso several approaches, six weekly treatments were given initially at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two upper zzso points, but avoiding any limb with existing zzso or prone to developing zzso If there were no zzso patients were given clear instructions on how to perform self acupuncture using either zzso needles or conventional needling at zzso weekly for up to six years, for long term zzso 

A retrospective audit of electronic records was carried out by a doctor not involved in zzso A total of zzso patients were treated, predominantly with breast and prostate zzso One hundred and zzso two patients were zzso The number of zzso hot zzso per day was estimated by the zzso in the 159 cases providing adequate records, the mean was 16 zzso per zzso Following treatment, 114 zzso gained a 50% or greater reduction in hot zzso and 30 zzso a less than 50% zzso Treatment was abandoned in those who responded poorly or not at zzso The duration of treatment varied from one month to over six years with a mean duration of nine zzso zzso patients zzso experienced minor side effects over the six year period, mostly minor zzso one patient described leg swelling but this was likely to be due to a concurrent zzso 

zzso including self acupuncture is associated with long-term relief of zzso symptoms in cancer zzso Treatment is safe and costs appear to be zzso An zzso is presented to guide clinical zzso We recommend the use of self acupuncture with needles at zzso in preference to zzso needles in the first instance, but poor zzso use zzso zzso if they fail to respond adequately to self acupuncture with regular zzso Point location may be of less importance than the overall zzso and an appropriate minimum dose may be required to initiate the zzso
