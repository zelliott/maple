Glide SP mode enrichment results for two preparations of the zzso zzso and native zzso zzso zzso for two preparations of the zzso zzso are zzso Following a zzso preparation zzso an average zzso of zzso zzso for native zzso zzso with Glide SP is zzso Following the same zzso preparation scheme for the zzso zzso an average area under the zzso curve zzso of zzso and average early enrichment via the zzso zzso metric of zzso were zzso 74 and zzso of the 39 zzso prepared targets showed zzso over zzso and zzso zzso Average zzso was greater than zzso for all zzso protein families demonstrating consistent enrichment performance across a broad range of proteins and zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso zzso performance is significantly improved employing a zzso preparation scheme over using zzso structures from the zzso zzso results for zzso a new scoring function and sampling methodology zzso zzso and zzso are presented for four zzso targets, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso performance in early enrichment is consistently strong and all systems examined show zzso and superior early enrichment to zzso zzso Glide SP zzso
