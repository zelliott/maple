Those motion parameters that cannot be recovered from image zzso are zzso in the visual dynamic zzso This paper studies this important issue of zzso in the context of zzso tracking and presents a novel approach that is based on a motion field representation which employs redundant but sparsely correlated local motion parameters instead of compact but zzso global zzso This approach makes it easy to design fully zzso zzso motion zzso This paper shows that these zzso motion fields can be estimated efficiently by the collaboration among a set of simpler local zzso motion zzso which makes the new approach very zzso
