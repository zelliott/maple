The aim of this study was to find objective zzso methods to study the degradation of edible oils during heating and thus to suggest solutions to improve their zzso The efficiency of zzso seed extract as natural zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso during accelerated zzso of edible vegetable oils at 120 and 140 zzso The modifications during heating were monitored by zzso zzso zzso along with Independent zzso Analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso and classical zzso methods such as zzso value and zzso The results of the study clearly indicate that the natural seed extract at a level of 800 zzso exhibited zzso effects similar to those of the synthetic zzso zzso at a level of 200 zzso and thus contributes to an increase in the zzso stability of the zzso
