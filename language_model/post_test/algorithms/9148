zzso nearest neighbor zzso fails to exploit the additional information in image zzso We propose zzso zzso coding to define between set distance for robust face zzso Set distance is measured between the nearest set points zzso that can be zzso from their zzso basis zzso as well as from the set samples under the respective constraints of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso basis zzso to be similar to the zzso nearest zzso The zzso constraint ensures that each nearest point is zzso from a positive linear combination of the set zzso Both constraints are formulated as a single convex zzso problem and the accelerated zzso zzso method with zzso zzso projection is adapted to efficiently find the optimal nearest points between two image zzso Using the nearest points between a query set and all the gallery sets as well as the active samples used to approximate them, we learn a more zzso zzso distance for robust face zzso The proposed zzso works independently of the chosen features and has been tested on gray zzso values and local zzso zzso zzso on three standard data sets show that the proposed method consistently zzso existing state-of-the-art zzso
