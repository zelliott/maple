We describe an zzso for aligning two sequences within a diagonal band that requires only zzso zzso time and zzso space, where N is the length of the shorter of the two sequences and W is the zzso of the zzso The basic zzso can be used to calculate either local or global alignment zzso Local alignments are produced by finding the beginning and end of a best local alignment in the band, and then applying the global alignment zzso between those zzso This zzso has been incorporated into the zzso program package, where it has decreased the amount of memory required to calculate local alignments from zzso to zzso and decreased the time required to calculate zzso scores for every sequence in a protein sequence database by zzso On computers with limited memory, such as the zzso this improvement both allows longer sequences to be aligned and allows zzso within wider bands, which can include longer zzso
