The distribution of carbon monoxide after zzso in the zzso zzso pocket has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations at 300 zzso The results show that both zzso (one close to the zzso iron and one further zzso observed in recent low temperature X-ray studies of zzso CO have a high probability of zzso even at ambient zzso The fact that the O of CO is oriented toward the zzso iron in the closer intermediate provides an explanation for the slow rate of CO zzso zzso A refinement against X-ray data generated from the molecular dynamics simulations indicates that the CO has a broader distribution in the zzso pocket than is apparent from the experimental electron zzso This effect is likely to be general for systems containing highly mobile zzso
