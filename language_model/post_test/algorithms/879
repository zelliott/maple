A proposal to calculate and use the reference change value zzso as an objective guide for interpreting the zzso results obtained in clinical laboratory serial testing is introduced in this zzso 

A database showing the results of a compilation of 191 publications on biological variation and including information on a number of zzso provided the standardized criterion based on biology for calculating the zzso 

For each of the 261 zzso included in the study, the zzso was determined using Harris's formula, replacing zzso zzso with the desirable zzso of zzso quality based on half the zzso biological variation at zzso probability zzso The result is a guide for a common criterion to identify clinically significant changes in serial zzso 

The zzso concept is an approach that can be offered by laboratories to assess changes in serial zzso The zzso data in this study are presented as a point of departure for a widely zzso objective guide to interpret changes in serial zzso
