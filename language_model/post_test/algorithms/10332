zzso movement along zzso and zzso is indispensable for the survival and maintenance of zzso zzso Key parameters of this transport such as particle zzso and pausing times are often studied using zzso construction, which converts the transport along a line of interest from a zzso movie into a position versus time zzso Here we present a method for the automatic analysis of such zzso based on the zzso zzso which is a robust and fast technique to extract lines from zzso The zzso of the method was tested on simulated zzso images and real data from zzso transport of zzso and zzso toxin as well as the zzso analysis of synaptic zzso sharing between adjacent zzso in zzso zzso Efficiency analysis revealed that the zzso is able to detect a wide range of zzso and can be used at low zzso zzso The present work enables the zzso of zzso transport parameters with high zzso with no a zzso assumptions and minimal human zzso
