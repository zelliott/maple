Analysis of zzso profiles from liquid zzso transform mass zzso zzso reveals a zzso distortion in zzso Investigation of the measured zzso ratios comparing with theoretical ones shows that the zzso can be attributed to signal suppression of low abundance zzso zzso We find that the suppression is zzso for different zzso of identical peptides but zzso for different zzso We develop an zzso correction zzso that zzso the intensity zzso for peptides with relatively high zzso This zzso can be applied in a wide range of applications using zzso We also analyze the distortion characteristics of the instrument for lower abundance zzso which should be considered when interpreting zzso results of zzso
