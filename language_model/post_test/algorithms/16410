In zzso studies, a fundamental problem of interest is zzso concerning the consensus mean, when the zzso are made by several laboratories which may exhibit different zzso zzso apart from the between laboratory zzso A zzso one-way random model is very often used to model this zzso Under such a model, a modified signed zzso ratio procedure is developed for the zzso zzso of the common zzso Furthermore, simulation results are presented to show the accuracy of the proposed confidence zzso especially for small zzso The results are illustrated using an example on the determination of zzso in zzso milk powder by combining the results of four zzso Here, the sample size is small, and the confidence limits for the common mean obtained by different methods produce very different zzso The confidence zzso based on the modified signed zzso ratio procedure appears to be quite zzso
