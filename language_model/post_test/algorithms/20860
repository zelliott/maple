While a number of strategies have been developed to reduce data collection requirements for zzso zzso based on zzso methods of spectrum analysis, there is an increasing awareness that the principal differences in the performance of these methods is attributable to the sampling strategies zzso and not the method of spectrum analysis per zzso The ability of maximum zzso reconstruction to zzso essentially arbitrary sampling schemes makes it a useful platform for comparative analysis of sampling zzso Here we use maximum zzso reconstruction to demonstrate that artifacts characteristic of sparse sampling result from zzso in the sampling pattern, and that they can be substantially reduced by introducing a degree of randomness to an otherwise regular sampling zzso without requiring additional zzso
