A novel zzso mesh technique is introduced for problems of image reconstruction in zzso optical zzso A zzso adaptation of the three-dimensional scheme based on the zzso zzso reduces zzso time and balances the zzso nature of the inverse zzso The arbitrary shape of the zzso surface is handled by an additional refinement of zzso cells on the zzso zzso shrinking of the search volume is introduced to improve zzso performance and accuracy while locating the zzso zzso Light propagation in the medium is modeled by the telegraph zzso and the zzso zzso is derived from the zzso integral equation of the first zzso zzso and zzso efficiency of the introduced method are demonstrated for image reconstruction of one and two zzso zzso objects embedded within a zzso tissue zzso Experimental zzso are simulated by the solution of the forward problem on a grid of zzso light guides attached to the surface of the zzso
