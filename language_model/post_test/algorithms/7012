The use of several mathematical methods for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso of body surface zzso has been reported in the zzso most of these methods are based on zzso reconstruction principles and operate in the zzso zzso In this paper we introduce a general zzso maximum a zzso zzso framework for time domain inverse solutions in the presence of zzso The two most popular previously applied zzso methods, constrained zzso zzso and zzso approximation through the singular value decomposition, are placed in this zzso each of them requiring the a zzso knowledge of a zzso zzso which defines the degree of smoothing to be applied to the zzso zzso of simulations using these two methods are zzso they compare the ability of each method to reconstruct zzso zzso We used the geometric zzso of the torso and internal zzso of an individual subject as reconstructed from CT zzso The accuracy of each method at each zzso location was tested as a function of measurement noise, the size and shape of the zzso of torso sensors, and the zzso zzso We paid particular attention to an assessment of the potential of these methods for clinical use by testing the effect of using zzso zzso zzso of torso zzso while maintaining a high degree of resolution on the zzso
