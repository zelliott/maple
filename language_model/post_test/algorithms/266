The purpose of this study was to examine the zzso capabilities used in the zzso Analysis Software Program for zzso Windows zzso for measuring fundamental frequency zzso its dependent measures, and zzso ratio zzso The stability, zzso and zzso of its zzso to systematic changes in aspiration noise and/or spectral slope (to mimic the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using its analysis output to five female and five male zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate zzso zzso zzso and zzso for each of the zzso zzso The findings indicate that although zzso produced stable results for male zzso samples, they were not accurate when measuring zzso zzso and zzso with the addition of noise and variations in open zzso independently and in zzso In contrast, zzso was neither stable nor accurate in making the same zzso for female zzso zzso However, zzso was stable and accurate in measuring zzso for male and most of female zzso These results point to an inappropriate zzso extraction zzso in zzso and stress the need for further research to zzso the zzso or to identify a superior zzso
