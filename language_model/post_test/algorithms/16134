In zzso zzso acid test zzso screening zzso the donations implicated in zzso test pools are released for zzso when they are zzso in a repeat test on the individual samples, but in zzso zzso screening zzso the release of zzso zzso zzso donations is under zzso 

A previously developed window phase zzso transmission risk model for zzso blood zzso has been refined to take the effect of repeat tests of initially zzso zzso zzso or zzso results into zzso The model has then been applied to simulate the effect of different screening zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso Plus zzso zzso zzso on transmission risk for zzso B virus zzso zzso C virus zzso and human zzso virus zzso 

We calculated zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso with and without duplicate zzso of zzso results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso days for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso days for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso days for zzso zzso These latter infectious zzso zzso reduced to zzso zzso zzso and zzso days, respectively, with the more sensitive zzso Plus zzso 

zzso Plus zzso screening reduces the virus transmission risk in the zzso by zzso to zzso compared to zzso zzso while the incremental risk caused by releasing donations with duplicate zzso zzso results is zzso to zzso To achieve maximum safety and specificity a similar repeat test zzso can be applied to zzso as used for zzso zzso
