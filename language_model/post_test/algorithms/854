The possibility of using existing hardware makes pinhole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attractive when pursuing the zzso resolution required for small animal brain zzso Unfortunately, the poor sensitivity and the heavy weight of the zzso hamper the use of pinhole zzso in animal studies by generating noisy and zzso zzso To improve the image quality we have developed a new zzso reconstruction method, pinhole median root prior zzso which prevents the excessive noise zzso from the projections to the reconstructed zzso The zzso zzso was used to reconstruct data acquired with our small animal rotating device, which was designed to reduce the rotation orbit zzso Phantom experiments were performed to test the device and compare the zzso with the conventional zzso zzso and pinhole ordered zzso maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso reconstruction zzso The feasibility of the system for small animal brain imaging was studied with zzso rats injected with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Considering all the experiments, no shape zzso due to orbit zzso were encountered and remarkable improvements in noise characteristics and also in overall image quality were observed when the zzso was applied instead of the zzso or zzso In addition, the proposed methods zzso existing hardware and require only a certain amount of construction and programming work, making them easy to zzso
