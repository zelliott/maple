The global analysis of zzso can be used to define the zzso of cells, zzso or zzso zzso groups of samples based on their zzso profile is one of the main topics of zzso zzso Crisp zzso methods assign each feature to one zzso thereby omitting information about the zzso of sample zzso Here, we present the application of fuzzy zzso zzso method for the zzso of samples based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sample zzso was performed on zzso zzso of cancer cell line extracts and of urine samples of type 2 diabetes patients and animal zzso The cell line zzso included zzso zzso of zzso cell extracts for two normal and three cancer cell lines with cancer cell lines including two invasive and one zzso zzso The second zzso included previously published zzso zzso of urine samples of human type 2 diabetics and healthy controls, mouse wild type and diabetes model and rat obese and lean zzso The fuzzy zzso zzso method allowed more accurate sample zzso in both zzso relative to the other tested methods including principal component analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the cell line samples, fuzzy zzso provided a clear separation of individual cell lines, groups of cancer and normal cell lines as well as zzso and invasive zzso cell zzso In the diabetes zzso clear separation of healthy controls and diabetics in all three models was possible only by using the fuzzy zzso zzso
