zzso ultrasound is used clinically to detect zzso in the carotid zzso The presence of zzso may be identified by disturbed flow patterns zzso to the zzso that cause spectral broadening in the spectrum of the zzso signal around peak zzso This paper investigates the zzso of the spectral broadening index zzso derived from zzso zzso obtained using zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso based on the zzso transform zzso zzso zzso zzso signals were created using white noise and shaped filters to zzso zzso typically found around the zzso peak and to assess the magnitude and zzso of zzso and zzso for a range of zzso zzso The results of the analysis show a strong correlation between the zzso calculated using the zzso and zzso zzso Despite the qualitative improvement of the zzso zzso over the zzso the zzso of zzso for short data frames is not significantly improved using zzso
