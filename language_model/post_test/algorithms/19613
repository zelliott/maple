We introduce a family of positive zzso kernels specifically zzso for the manipulation of zzso structures of molecules with kernel zzso The kernels are based on the comparison of the zzso zzso present in the zzso structures of zzso a set of molecular features known to be particularly relevant for virtual screening zzso We present a zzso demanding exact zzso of these zzso as well as fast approximations related to the classical zzso zzso Experimental results suggest that this new approach is competitive with state-of-the-art zzso based on the zzso structure of molecules for the detection of zzso of several drug zzso
