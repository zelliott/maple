This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the zzso distance on the zzso response properties of an auditory nerve fiber zzso by electric current zzso This analysis was based upon results from a zzso model of a zzso auditory nerve fiber zzso having 50 zzso of zzso each consisting of 130 zzso sodium channels and 50 zzso zzso channels, making it possible to represent the zzso fluctuations of action potential initiation and zzso A zzso stimulus zzso was located above a central zzso zzso at zzso distances of 1, 4, and 7 zzso while the recording zzso was located at the 36th zzso Action zzso zzso were generated by the zzso model using the zzso method to solve a zzso partial differential zzso By observing the occurrence times of spikes in response to 2000 zzso zzso stimulus zzso zzso jitter zzso the standard zzso of spike zzso was calculated and the zzso time zzso zzso was generated as zzso Furthermore, by computing the zzso zzso for each initiation zzso as functions of space zzso zzso and time zzso it was shown that spike initiation was distributed not only zzso but also temporally for stimulus levels producing firing efficiencies zzso near zzso However, at levels producing zzso near zzso while zzso variations approached zero, the spatial distribution of initiating zzso was comparable to that observed for the zzso near zzso As zzso fluctuations are important for speech coding in cochlear zzso we conclude that spatial characteristics of the zzso nerve fiber interface may play a significant role in influencing these zzso zzso zzso
