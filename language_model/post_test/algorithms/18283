zzso interactions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso in zzso solution are investigated by zzso zzso The zzso intensity of zzso gradually increases with the addition of the zzso The formation zzso zzso of the zzso inclusion complexes are determined using a zzso zzso The association abilities of zzso with the CDs decrease in the order zzso approximately zzso Both the intrinsic binding abilities of the CDs and the structural effect of zzso are taken into consideration when comparing the K zzso Based on the results of zzso experimental and theoretical zzso calculations both in zzso and in water, it is found that zzso stays near the wider rim of zzso zzso Both the number of zzso groups zzso in a guest and the zzso volume ratio of the guest to host cavity zzso play an important role in forming the CD zzso complexes of a zzso series of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an appropriate zzso or zzso in an inclusion system, such as in zzso zzso and zzso systems, can maximize the zzso interaction between host and zzso
