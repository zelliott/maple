The zzso value of zzso in septic shock is zzso However, as current definitions do not include zzso as a mandatory zzso some zzso patients may be diagnosed as having septic shock despite exhibiting zzso The significance of persistent zzso zzso without zzso is zzso Is it really septic zzso Our aim was to determine differences in outcome between patients diagnosed as having septic shock but exhibiting normal vs elevated zzso levels during zzso We also explored the potential implications of including zzso as an obligatory diagnostic zzso 

We performed retrospective analyses on a cohort of zzso septic shock zzso 

When we divided patients according to the presence of zzso zzso evolved without zzso and exhibited a very low mortality risk zzso compared with zzso of those with zzso These patients also presented less severe organ zzso and higher central zzso zzso zzso values, and required lower zzso zzso The potential inclusion of zzso in septic shock definition would reduce zzso in zzso but increase absolute mortality risk in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso without zzso may not constitute a real septic zzso Our results support the need to review the current definition of septic zzso zzso could represent an objective zzso worth to be explored as a potential diagnostic criterion for septic zzso
