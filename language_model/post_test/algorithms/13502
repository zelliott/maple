zzso noise is a major factor limiting direction discrimination performance in zzso zzso In the current study we investigated the influence of correspondence noise on zzso which is the upper limit for the spatial displacement of the dots for which coherent motion is still zzso Human direction discrimination performance was measured, using zzso zzso having zzso motion, over a zzso range of zzso and a zzso range of dot zzso From this data zzso was estimated for the different dot zzso zzso A model was proposed to evaluate the correspondence noise in the zzso This model summed the zzso of a set of elementary zzso local detectors that had receptive fields zzso the stimulus and were tuned to the two directions of motion in the zzso A key assumption of the model was that the local detectors would have the radius of their zzso areas scaled with the displacement that they were tuned to zzso the zzso factor k linking the radius to the displacement was the only free zzso in the model and a single value of k was used to fit all of the zzso data zzso This zzso zzso based model was able to account for zzso of the zzso in the human performance across all of the conditions zzso The results highlight the importance of correspondence noise in constraining the largest displacement that can be zzso
