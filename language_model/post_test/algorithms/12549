An accurate and zzso efficient means of zzso zzso zzso signal patterns has been the subject of considerable research effort in recent zzso zzso analysis of zzso signals provides an important source of information for the diagnosis of zzso zzso Following the recent development of zzso zzso equipment, different zzso in the time domain and frequency domain have been followed for quantitative zzso In this study, zzso error zzso artificial neural networks zzso and zzso neural networks zzso based zzso were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in zzso of zzso zzso In these methods, we used an zzso zzso model of zzso signals as an input to zzso zzso A total of 1200 zzso obtained from 7 normal subjects, 7 subjects suffering from zzso and 13 subjects suffering from zzso disease were zzso The success rate for the zzso technique was zzso and for the zzso technique zzso The comparisons between the developed zzso were primarily based on a number of zzso performance measures pertaining to the zzso The zzso zzso outperformed the zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso may support expert decisions and add weight to zzso differential zzso
