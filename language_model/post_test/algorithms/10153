We have developed an zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso tool for improving zzso efficiency, increasing zzso coverage, and zzso analysis time for zzso zzso applications based on the zzso zzso zzso The underlying principle of zzso is to limit zzso analyses to a subset of molecular zzso that are likely to identify a maximum number of zzso zzso reduces zzso of zzso analyses by excluding from the precursor zzso peak lists zzso peptides derived from the already identified proteins and uses a retention time prediction zzso to limit the degree of false zzso It also increases the zzso rate of zzso zzso by removing zzso zzso zzso targets like zzso and peptides carrying large loads of zzso which are flagged by their zzso zzso mass zzso For some samples, zzso increases the number of identified proteins by zzso when compared to the data dependent zzso zzso zzso an zzso run at the zzso point when zzso zzso time of zzso start to overrun zzso zzso number of identified zzso without prior knowledge of sample contents and zzso To facilitate analysis of closely related samples, zzso inclusion list functionality is currently under zzso
