zzso interactions zzso are essential to most fundamental cellular zzso There has been increasing interest in reconstructing zzso zzso However, several critical difficulties exist in obtaining reliable zzso zzso false positive rates can be as high as zzso zzso correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient due to the difficulty of covering the errors from multiple levels of data processing procedures within a single zzso We propose a novel zzso integration method, deemed zzso zzso ensemble learning zzso to lower the zzso rate (both false zzso and zzso through automatically zzso data sources that are most zzso while zzso less zzso and biased zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is significantly more robust than the classic zzso zzso to zzso zzso and contaminated zzso On a large human data set our zzso approach predicts many more zzso than zzso zzso This suggests that previous studies may have large numbers of not only false zzso but also false zzso The validation on two human zzso zzso having high quality supports our zzso Our experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to predict zzso zzso zzso with substantially reduced false zzso and false zzso The ability of predicting large numbers of zzso both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use zzso approaches to correct data errors in general, and may speed up zzso prediction with high zzso Such a reliable prediction may provide a solid platform to other studies such as protein functions prediction and roles of zzso in disease zzso
