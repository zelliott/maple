Testing one zzso at a time does not fully zzso the potential of zzso association studies to identify multiple zzso zzso which is a plausible scenario for many complex zzso We show that simultaneous analysis of the entire set of zzso from a zzso study to identify the subset that best predicts disease outcome is now zzso thanks to developments in zzso search zzso We used a zzso zzso maximum likelihood approach in which every zzso can be considered for zzso dominant, and zzso contributions to disease zzso zzso mode estimates were obtained for zzso zzso that were each assigned a prior with a sharp mode at zzso A zzso zzso estimate was interpreted as corresponding to a significant zzso We investigated two prior zzso and show that the zzso prior leads to improved zzso selection in comparison with zzso zzso We also derived an explicit approximation for zzso error that avoids the need to use zzso zzso As well as zzso zzso our method is zzso to fine mapping with very dense zzso sets obtained from zzso and/or zzso It can accommodate quantitative as well as zzso zzso zzso adjustment, and can be extended to search for zzso Here, we demonstrate the power and empirical zzso error of our approach using simulated zzso data sets of up to 500 K zzso a real zzso data set of 300 K zzso and a zzso zzso each of which can be zzso in a few hours on a zzso zzso
