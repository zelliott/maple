Adult zzso have frequency responses that are essentially flat over the range of zzso encountered in the measurement of zzso gas volume zzso An infant zzso is necessarily much smaller than an adult zzso This means that there is a smaller mean distance over which heat diffusion must occur between the air in the zzso and its zzso This in turn leads to a much reduced zzso time zzso We examined the effects of zzso time constant of a 60 L infant zzso on zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso time constant was measured by rapidly injecting 20 zzso of air into the zzso and found to be zzso zzso zzso when the box was zzso We calculated from this time constant that zzso of zzso should be quite dependent on the frequency at which the associated zzso maneuvers are zzso zzso was measured in 5 infants less than 6 months old in the recovery phase following acute viral zzso When we performed a digital correction of the zzso to compensate for the zzso time constant of the zzso the zzso values decreased by a mean of zzso zzso the air in the zzso with a fan decreased the zzso time constant of the box and reduced measured zzso by a mean of zzso These results indicate that thermodynamics of infant zzso can be an important source of error in zzso zzso
