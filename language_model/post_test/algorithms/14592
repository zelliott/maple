zzso resistant to available drug therapies are a pressing global health zzso Short, zzso peptides represent a novel class of agents that have lower rates of drug resistance than derivatives of current zzso Previously, we created a software system utilizing artificial neural networks that were trained on quantitative zzso relationship zzso calculated for a total of zzso synthetic peptides for which zzso activity was zzso Using the trained system, we correctly identified additional peptides with activity of zzso zzso active peptides were 47 of the top rated 50 peptides chosen from an in zzso library of nearly 100,000 zzso Here, we report a method of generating candidate zzso sequences using the zzso evolutionary programming method of genetic zzso zzso which provided a large zzso improvement in identification of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of peptides evaluated during the zzso method were classified as highly active, while only zzso of the nearly 100,000 sequences we previously screened were classified as highly zzso A selection of these peptides was tested in zzso and activities reported zzso While zzso significantly improves the possibility of identifying candidate zzso we encountered important pitfalls to this method that should be considered when using zzso
