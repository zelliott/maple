We introduce a system identification method based on zzso component zzso zzso This approach aims to identify the dynamics in a linear zzso zzso model which may represent a resting zzso zzso It tackles the zzso system identification problem by considering, zzso frequency information inherent in the given zzso By including in the model only dominant frequency components of the input zzso this method enables construction of candidate models that are specific to the data and zzso a reduction in zzso zzso error when the signals are colored (as are most zzso zzso Additionally, this method allows incorporation of zzso about the system through a weighting zzso We present the method in the context of zzso and zzso zzso systems operating in zzso and zzso In each scenario, we compare the zzso method with conventional approaches and approaches that also build zzso candidate zzso Through both simulated and experimental data, we show that the zzso method enables more accurate identification of the system impulse response function than the other methods when the input zzso is zzso
