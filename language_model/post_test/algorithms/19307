We study a zzso model of zzso zzso in order to characterize the zzso of zzso delay and of zzso zzso zzso delay is the time which zzso between the binding of zzso zzso to a promoter sequence and its zzso from the DNA template strand with zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso is the process by which the zzso zzso slides along the template zzso The model considers a DNA template strand with one promoter site and zzso zzso sites, and five types of reaction zzso which we think are key ones in zzso The chemical master equation is a set of ordinary differential equations in zzso zzso where zzso is the number of bases in the zzso This model is too huge to be handled if zzso is zzso We manage to get a reduced zzso model which has only zzso independent variables and can well approximate the original zzso We obtain a number of zzso and zzso results for this model, including delay and transcript zzso rate zzso Recent studies of zzso zzso zzso by using zzso techniques raise an issue of whether the zzso rates measured in a population are zzso or zzso Our model implies that in the cases zzso different zzso zzso molecules move at different characteristic rates along the template zzso We also discuss the implications of this work for the mathematical modeling of genetic regulatory zzso
