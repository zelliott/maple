In this paper, a novel zzso zzso within breast ultrasound zzso image based on the cellular zzso principle is zzso Its energy transition function is formulated based on global image information difference and local image information difference using different energy transfer zzso First, an energy decrease strategy is used for modeling the spatial relation information of zzso For modeling global image information difference, a seed information comparison function is developed using an energy preserve zzso Then, a texture information comparison function is proposed for considering local image difference in different regions, which is helpful for handling blurry zzso Moreover, two neighborhood systems zzso Neumann and Moore neighborhood systems) are integrated as the evolution environment, and a zzso criterion is used for suppressing noise and reducing zzso zzso The proposed method was applied to 205 clinical zzso images for studying its characteristic and zzso and several overlapping area error metrics and statistical evaluation methods are zzso for evaluating its zzso The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can handle zzso images with blurry boundaries and low contrast well and can segment breast zzso accurately and zzso
