zzso bind to other proteins efficiently and specifically to carry on many cell functions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine the geometry and strength of binding of a protein pair, an energy function is zzso An zzso to design an optimal energy function, based on empirical data of protein complexes, is proposed and zzso zzso is made on negative design in which incorrect zzso are presented to the zzso that learns to avoid zzso For the zzso problem the search for plausible zzso can be performed zzso The possible zzso of the complex are generated on a grid with the help of a fast zzso transform zzso A novel zzso of negative design makes it possible to investigate zzso hundreds of millions of negative examples while zzso improving the quality of the zzso Experimental structures for 640 protein complexes are used to generate positive and negative examples for learning zzso The zzso designed in this work finds the correct binding structure as the lowest energy minimum in zzso cases of the 640 zzso Further benchmarks on independent sets confirm the significant capacity of the scoring function to recognize correct modes of zzso
