zzso a zzso zzso task using a small zzso database of patterns of high dimension is difficult due to the zzso and the bias of the training toward the majority zzso Such a problem has arisen while diagnosing genetic abnormalities by zzso a small database of zzso in zzso zzso signals of types having different zzso of zzso We propose and zzso study using the zzso domain two solutions to the zzso The first is zzso decomposition of the zzso task, where each hierarchy level is designed to tackle a simpler problem which is represented by classes that are approximately zzso The second solution is balancing the data by zzso the minority classes accompanied by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso neural network, both solutions have diminished the problem and contributed to accuracy zzso In addition, the experiments suggest that coping with the zzso of the data is more beneficial than dealing with its zzso
