zzso CT scanners have shown limitations in clinical application for zzso coronary CT zzso zzso We evaluate advances in zzso scanning of the heart and the coronary arteries with recently introduced zzso CT equipment zzso zzso 16, Siemens, zzso zzso 

The technical principles of zzso cardiac zzso scan zzso and detector design of the new scanner are zzso zzso scan and image reconstruction techniques and zzso dose zzso zzso zzso for a reduction of the patient dose are zzso key parameters for image quality and simulation results zzso and phantom studies and initial patient experience zzso The impact of reduced zzso rotation time zzso zzso on zzso resolution and initial zzso of the patient dose are zzso 

zzso of zzso reconstruction zzso used for zzso CT provide adequate image quality for up to 16 zzso For each detector zzso different slice zzso are available for retrospective reconstruction with zzso slice sensitivity profiles zzso For coronary zzso the heart can be covered with zzso zzso zzso within a zzso zzso The best possible spatial resolution is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso s zzso rotation time, zzso resolution reaches its optimum zzso zzso at a heart rate of 81 zzso zzso patient dose for coronary zzso is 4-5 zzso using zzso zzso 

The clinical performance of coronary zzso by means of spatial resolution, zzso resolution and scan time is substantially improved with the evaluated zzso CT zzso Also, display of smaller coronary segments and zzso zzso are substantially zzso
