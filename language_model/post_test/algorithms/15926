zzso to predict zzso and zzso times during normal walking using only zzso data are zzso The accuracy of these methods was compared with the results obtained using synchronized force platform recordings of two subjects walking at a variety of speeds for a total of 12 zzso Using a zzso data collection system, the absolute value errors zzso in predicting zzso averaged zzso while the zzso in predicting zzso times averaged zzso True average errors zzso for an early zzso were zzso for both zzso and zzso indicating that no systematic errors zzso It was concluded that the proposed zzso provide an easy and reliable method of determining event times during walking when zzso data are collected, with a considerable improvement in resolution over visual inspection of video records, and could be zzso in conjunction with any zzso or 3-D zzso data collection zzso
