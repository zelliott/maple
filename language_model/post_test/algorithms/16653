The zzso model of zzso generation in zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is generated by local zzso zzso Various zzso zzso fire zzso at different zzso zzso raising the question of how these zzso zzso contribute to the generation of zzso zzso We here recorded zzso in the zzso zzso area of freely behaving mice, and identified a unique subset of zzso zzso by using the zzso causality zzso These cells fired in an extremely reliable zzso pattern at high firing rates zzso zzso during exploration and always locked to ascending zzso of the zzso zzso Among zzso zzso we recorded, only these cells generated strong zzso zzso influences on local field potential zzso signals within the zzso band zzso zzso and the influences were persistent across behavioral zzso Our results suggest that this unique type of zzso zzso serve as the local zzso zzso zzso control cells in shaping zzso zzso zzso
