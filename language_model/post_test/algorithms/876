In the current study, the effects of reconstruction zzso on quantitative measures derived from zzso zzso zzso lung images were assessed in patients with zzso CT image data sets were reconstructed with a standard zzso and alternative zzso for 42 zzso zzso were grouped as zzso sharp, standard, or zzso zzso mask and volume zzso from the alternative zzso data sets were compared with standard zzso data zzso The zzso category yielded an average shift of zzso zzso a shift in average score from zzso to zzso the sharp category, a shift of zzso and the smooth category, a shift of zzso zzso in total lung volume zzso were less than zzso In conclusion, the CT reconstruction zzso may strongly affect density mask results, especially for certain reconstruction zzso
