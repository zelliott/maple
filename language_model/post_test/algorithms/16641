We report on the physical mechanism underlying the temperature dependence of phase zzso Changes in zzso index and thickness of the wave plate are the two main contributions to phase zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso index are described by zzso zzso zzso in this equation need to be determined by fits to experimental zzso A new zzso instrument was used to measure phase zzso at various zzso Once determined, the fitting equation can be used to calculate the phase zzso at any temperature, and thus has implications for zzso industrial zzso
