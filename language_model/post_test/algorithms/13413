zzso particle zzso can be used to generate three-dimensional zzso We present a unique method to create zzso zzso in which we can control the amount of particles and their packing zzso To this end, we zzso zzso zzso droplets on a special type of zzso zzso surface, on which the zzso remains in zzso state during the entire zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso consist of a massive zzso cluster of the zzso with diameters ranging from a few tens up to several hundreds of zzso We present zzso arguments to show how the final particle packing fraction of these balls depends on the dynamics of the zzso zzso particle size, and number of particles in the zzso
