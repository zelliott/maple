In this paper, we present the development of a data glove system based on fingertip tracking zzso To track the fingertip position and orientation, a sensor module and two generator coils are attached on the fingertip and zzso of the corresponding zzso By tracking the zzso object manipulation tasks in a virtual environment or zzso system can be carried out more precisely, because fingertips are the zzso areas that reach the surface of an object in most of grasping zzso To calculate the zzso angles of a finger, we also propose a method of constructing the shape of the zzso Since the coils are installed on the fingertips and zzso there is no contact point between the sensors and finger zzso zzso the shape of the sensors does not change as the fingers are bending, and both the quality of measurement and the lifetime of the sensors will not decrease in zzso For the convenience of using this zzso a simple and efficient zzso process consisting of only one zzso gesture is also zzso so that all required parameters can be determined zzso So far, the experimental results of the sensors performing linear movement and zzso angle zzso are very zzso It reveals that our data glove is available for a zzso zzso
