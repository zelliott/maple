The zzso zzso intensity in different materials is usually a zzso increasing function of the dose, which quite often reaches a zzso zzso In several materials, however, zzso dose dependence has been zzso The zzso intensity reached a maximum at a certain dose and decreased at higher zzso Some authors refer to this effect as zzso zzso In the present work, we show that the zzso dependence can easily be demonstrated to result from competition between transitions model with two zzso states and two kinds of zzso zzso Two kinds of competition are zzso One in which competition during zzso zzso the filling of the active zzso zzso is zzso and the resulting zzso is zzso In the other, the filling of traps and zzso is zzso zzso but the competition during heating causes zzso intensity to reach a maximum and decline at higher zzso
