To address the vulnerability of geographic zzso to multiple security threats such as false zzso information, selective forwarding and the zzso attack in wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a zzso defending model against zzso multiple zzso Considering the characteristics of zzso sensor zzso trust values of neighboring zzso on the zzso path can be calculated through the zzso distribution function, which is based on data zzso zzso in a certain period instead of zzso zzso Trust is combined with the cost of geographic and energy aware zzso for selecting the next hop of zzso At the same time, the initial trust is zzso determined, service requests are restricted for malicious zzso in accordance with trust values, and the impact of zzso mobility is weakened by the trust zzso The simulation results and analysis show that the proposed model under multiple attacks has advantages in packet delivery ratio and network lifetime over the existing zzso
