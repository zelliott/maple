zzso satisfactory results with neural networks depends on the availability of large data zzso The use of small training sets generally reduces zzso Most classical zzso zzso zzso zzso studies for a specific zzso system have been performed on small data zzso We focus on the zzso prediction of biological activities of zzso zzso zzso compounds when zzso from small training zzso We propose two zzso intelligence prediction techniques which are suitable for small training sets, at the expense of some zzso zzso Both techniques are based on the zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso zzso incremental learning system used for zzso and probability zzso During the learning phase, each sample pair is assigned a relevance factor zzso to the importance of that zzso The two proposed zzso in this paper are: 1) The zzso algorithm, which is new, consists of two zzso a) During the first stage, we use a genetic zzso zzso to zzso the zzso assigned to the training zzso This improves the zzso capability of the zzso b) In the second stage, we use the zzso zzso to train the zzso 2) The zzso zzso is derived from a known zzso Instead of zzso zzso it zzso the order of data presentation using the zzso of zzso et zzso In our experiments, we compare these two zzso with an zzso not based on the zzso the zzso introduced in zzso zzso We conclude that when zzso from small training sets, both techniques are efficient, in terms of zzso capability and execution zzso The zzso overhead introduced is compensated by better zzso Finally, the proposed techniques are used to predict the biological activities of newly designed potential zzso zzso zzso
