Several applications involving quantum dots require perfect long-range ordered zzso Unfortunately, zzso (the choice method to zzso quantum zzso leads to patterns that, although short range ordered, exhibit defects equivalent to grain boundaries and zzso on a large zzso We note that zzso zzso of film growth is one reason for formation of zzso and hence study an zzso model of quantum dot zzso However, zzso stability analysis shows that even in the extreme limit of zzso square zzso whose zzso are in a finite range are zzso zzso consequently structures created in the film continue to have zzso Building on insights developed by the authors earlier on a simpler zzso zzso model, we propose controlling the deposition through a mask to generate ordered quantum dots zzso General principles to estimate geometrical characteristics of the mask are zzso zzso integration of the model shows that perfectly ordered square zzso of quantum dots can indeed be created using masked zzso
