zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso known to regulate a wide range of cellular processes by zzso the gene expression at the protein and/or zzso zzso zzso prediction of zzso targets is essential for zzso the detailed functions of zzso However, the prediction specificity and sensitivity of the existing zzso are still poor to generate zzso zzso hypotheses for subsequent experimental zzso zzso a richer and more reliable training data set and developing an zzso that properly exploits this data set would be the key to improve the performance current prediction zzso 

A comprehensive training data set is constructed for zzso zzso with its positive targets obtained from the most up-to-date zzso target depository called zzso and its negative targets derived from 20 zzso zzso A new zzso zzso is developed, which assumes a zzso structure including a site support zzso machine zzso followed by a zzso zzso makes prediction based on 21 optimal site features and 18 optimal zzso features, selected by training from a comprehensive collection of 113 site and 30 zzso zzso Comprehensive evaluation of zzso performance has been carried out on the training data, zzso data, and zzso zzso pull-down zzso Comparisons with some popular zzso demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction zzso sensitivity and precision in all tested zzso All the related materials including source code and zzso prediction of human targets are available at zzso 

A zzso zzso based new zzso target prediction zzso called zzso is zzso zzso is shown to be able to achieve robust zzso It holds the promise to achieve continuing improvement whenever better training data that contain additional verified or high confidence positive targets and properly selected negative targets are zzso
