zzso structure prediction and design of proteins and zzso complexes have long been zzso to those not directly involved in the zzso A key missing component has been the ability to zzso the progress of calculations to better understand zzso zzso is one simulation suite that would benefit from a robust real-time zzso zzso Several tools exist for the sole purpose of visualizing zzso one of the most popular tools, zzso zzso is a powerful, highly zzso user friendly, and attractive zzso zzso zzso and zzso directly has many technical and logistical obstacles zzso zzso To circumvent these issues, we developed a novel solution based on zzso zzso structure and energy information via zzso zzso zzso and zzso run as separate zzso thereby avoiding many technical obstacles while visualizing information on-demand in zzso When zzso detects changes in the structure of a zzso new coordinates are sent over a zzso network zzso to a zzso instance running a zzso zzso zzso zzso then zzso and displays the zzso This zzso also allows remote execution of zzso When combined with zzso this zzso solution provides an interactive environment for protein structure prediction and zzso
