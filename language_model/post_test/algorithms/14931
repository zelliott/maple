zzso of the active cell populations on the cortical surface via electric and magnetic zzso are known as electromagnetic source images zzso of the human zzso zzso solution of the potential and magnetic fields for a given electrical source distribution in the human brain is an essential part of electromagnetic source zzso In this study, the performance of the boundary element method zzso is explored with different surface element zzso A new zzso zzso is derived that makes use of zzso zzso zzso or cubic zzso The surface integration is performed with zzso zzso The potential fields are solved assuming a concentric zzso model of the human head for a zzso zzso at different zzso In order to achieve zzso accuracy in potential solutions, the number of zzso elements is of the order of zzso However, with linear zzso this number is of the order of ten zzso The relative difference measures zzso are obtained for the zzso models that use different element zzso The zzso models that employ zzso and cubic element types provide superior performance over linear elements in terms of accuracy in zzso Assuming a homogeneous sphere model of the head, the zzso are also obtained for the three components zzso and zzso of the magnetic zzso The zzso obtained for the zzso fields are, in general, much higher than those obtained for the zzso zzso Both zzso and cubic elements provide superior performance compared with linear elements for a wide range of zzso zzso
