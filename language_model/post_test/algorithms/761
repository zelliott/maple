zzso zzso zzso refers to a zzso procedure that is used to search DNA sequences for sequence zzso sites zzso each of which is defined by a pair of primer sequences and an expected zzso product zzso To gain speed, our zzso extracts short zzso from the 3' end of each primer and stores them in a sorted hash table that can be zzso efficiently during the zzso One recent improvement is the use of overlapping zzso words to allow matches to be found despite the presence of a zzso Moreover, it is possible to allow gaps in the alignment between the primer and the zzso The effect of these changes is to improve sensitivity without significantly affecting zzso The new software provides a search mode using a query zzso against a sequence database to augment the previously available mode using a query sequence against an zzso zzso Finally, zzso may now be used through a web service, with search results linked to other web resources such as the zzso database and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso web server may be found at zzso
