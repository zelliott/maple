zzso zzso is a zzso modification performed by a group of zzso known as the protein zzso or zzso zzso Commission zzso zzso It is essential to the correct functioning of both proteins and cells, being involved with zzso control, cell zzso and zzso The major problem when attempting prediction of these sites is the broad zzso specificity of the zzso This study employs zzso neural networks zzso the decision tree zzso zzso and the reduced zzso function neural network zzso to predict zzso zzso The aim is to compare prediction efficiency of the three zzso for this problem, and examine knowledge extraction zzso All three zzso are effective for zzso site zzso zzso indicate that zzso is the fastest and most sensitive of the zzso zzso has the highest area under the zzso curve and is therefore the most zzso and zzso has the highest prediction zzso zzso also reveals the zzso acid 2 zzso upstream from the zzso site is important for zzso zzso whilst the zzso acid 3 zzso upstream is important for zzso zzso
