The purpose of this study is to investigate zzso graph cut image zzso via kernel mapping of the image zzso The image data is transformed implicitly by a kernel function so that the zzso constant model of the graph cut zzso becomes zzso The objective function contains an original data term to evaluate the zzso of the transformed data, within each zzso region, from the zzso constant model, and a zzso boundary preserving zzso zzso The method zzso an effective alternative to complex modeling of the original image data while taking advantage of the zzso benefits of graph zzso Using a common kernel function, energy zzso typically consists of zzso image zzso by graph cut zzso and evaluations of region parameters via fixed point zzso A quantitative and comparative performance assessment is carried out over a large number of experiments using synthetic zzso level data as well as natural images from the Berkeley zzso The effectiveness of the method is also demonstrated through a set of experiments with real images of a variety of types such as zzso synthetic zzso zzso and motion zzso
