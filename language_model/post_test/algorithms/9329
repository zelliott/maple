Various zzso zzso a zzso zzso based on demographic data, and zzso oral reading methods of zzso zzso ability were compared in a diverse research sample of 119 zzso These methods were correlated with one another and with a modified version of the Raven Standard Progressive zzso zzso data are provided to illustrate advantages and disadvantages of various methods of zzso zzso ability when no formal intellectual testing is zzso While predicting zzso ability for individual subjects involves varying degrees of error, we found that the revised zzso formula was superior to the original formula for subjects at the upper end of ability zzso When researchers have screened out learning disability and have subject samples with few individuals likely to be of superior zzso intelligence, oral reading scores are a reasonable measure of zzso zzso Otherwise, researchers are advised to use both demographic and oral reading methods to estimate zzso zzso
