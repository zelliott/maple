Digital holographic zzso allows determination of dynamic changes in the optical thickness profile of a transparent object with zzso zzso Here, we report a quantitative phase laser zzso system for evaluation of zzso zzso dynamic changes during laser zzso The proposed method takes advantage of the precise optical manipulation by the laser zzso and quantitative phase imaging by digital holographic zzso with high spatial and zzso zzso This system will permit quantitative evaluation of the damage and/or the repair of the cell or cell zzso in real zzso
