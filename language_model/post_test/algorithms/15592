zzso zzso zzso pools are important for zzso activities initially isolated by zzso or zzso and for locating zzso critical for zzso Here we present a method for calculating the number of unique sequences in a pool, and the expected copy number of each unique sequence with a specified number of changes from the original zzso Surprisingly, small differences in doping can have large consequences for the number of copies of sequences with certain numbers of changes from the original zzso We demonstrate the effects of pool size, percentage doping, length of the random region and taking zzso from the original pool on the exploration of sequence space in a doped zzso zzso A web form is provided for customized zzso
