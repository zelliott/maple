The prediction of zzso is an important element of protein secondary structure zzso Recently, a highly accurate neural network based method zzso has been developed for predicting zzso in proteins using zzso scoring zzso zzso generated by zzso and secondary structure information predicted by zzso However, the major limitation of zzso is that it predicts only zzso and zzso zzso and does not provide any information of different zzso zzso Thus, there is a need to predict zzso types using an approach based on multiple sequence zzso which will be useful in overall zzso structure zzso 

In the present work, a method has been developed for the prediction of zzso types I, II, IV and zzso For each turn type, two consecutive zzso zzso networks with a single hidden layer have been used where the first zzso network has been trained on single sequences as well as on zzso zzso The output from the first network along with zzso predicted secondary structure has been used as input for the zzso zzso zzso The networks have been trained and tested on a zzso zzso of zzso proteins chains by zzso zzso It has been observed that the prediction performance for each turn type is improved significantly by using multiple sequence zzso The performance has been further improved by using a second level zzso network and zzso predicted secondary structure zzso It has been observed that Type I and II zzso have better prediction performance than Type IV and VIII zzso The final network yields an overall accuracy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for Type I, II, IV and VIII zzso respectively, and is better than random zzso 

A web server for prediction of zzso types I, II, IV and VIII based on above approach is available at zzso and zzso zzso zzso
