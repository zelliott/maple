zzso the zzso compositions of unknown molecules is an important goal of zzso zzso The isotope pattern revealed by a mass zzso provides valuable information regarding the zzso composition of a zzso In order to employ spectral accuracy considerations for zzso composition determination, it is important to know how faithfully a mass zzso can record the isotope pattern and to understand the magnitude of the errors of the relative zzso zzso 

zzso small zzso drugs and two natural products representing a diverse range of zzso compositions and ranging in molecular weight from 236 to zzso were measured on a new hybrid zzso acceleration zzso zzso zzso mass zzso by flow infusion zzso The similarity between the observed profile isotope pattern and the theoretical isotope pattern, zzso spectral zzso was calculated using a zzso zzso in the program zzso 

The spectral accuracy for all compounds averaged better than zzso When using spectral accuracy to rank zzso compositions with the zzso constraints zzso further restricted by empirical rules and a mass tolerance zzso zzso the correct formula was ranked first over zzso of the zzso In contrast, when using mass accuracy for ranking, only two compounds zzso were ranked zzso For zzso and zzso the initial spectral accuracy zzso were lower than expected and further analysis indicated that minor, structurally related components were zzso 

Our work has determined the magnitude of spectral accuracy that can be expected on a new zzso mass zzso In addition, we demonstrate the utility of spectral accuracy zzso both for ranking zzso compositions and also for obtaining insight into the chemical nature of the zzso that might otherwise be zzso
