The zzso dependence of the zzso zzso zzso was measured in single rat zzso zzso with the fluorescent zzso indicator dye zzso The zzso zzso clamp technique was used to measure the membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso was loaded into the cell by including it in the zzso solution of the patch zzso A mechanical light zzso operating at 1200 zzso was used to obtain simultaneous zzso of the zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso on either side of the zzso point zzso zzso and 410 zzso The symmetry of the two optical zzso signals was used as a criterion to guard against artifacts zzso for instance, from zzso The zzso dependence of peak zzso current and the zzso transient measured 25 zzso after zzso zzso from a holding potential of zzso zzso were zzso and virtually zzso The zzso entry estimated from the integral of the zzso current zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso to a zzso zzso increase in the total zzso zzso zzso whereas the optical signal indicated a 100 zzso increase in total zzso zzso zzso of clamp zzso from highly positive zzso were accompanied by a second zzso zzso the magnitude of which, when summed with that measured during zzso was nearly zzso zzso (10 zzso had little or no effect on the peak zzso current but reduced the magnitude of the early zzso zzso by zzso zzso (1 zzso increased the zzso current and the zzso zzso accelerated the rate of decline of the zzso zzso at zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and reduced the zzso zzso below baseline at zzso positive to zzso or negative to zzso zzso where clamp zzso did not elicit any zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso at zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso did zzso These results suggest that most of the zzso zzso in rat zzso cells is released from the zzso zzso as a graded response to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a graded zzso zzso release we find that zzso increases the internal zzso release by increasing the zzso zzso zzso may also increase the zzso content of the zzso zzso that may, in turn, increase the zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso appears to be caused by enhanced rate of zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso
