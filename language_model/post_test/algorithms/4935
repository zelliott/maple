Current outcome zzso based on zzso zzso rely on gene lists selected without consideration for their molecular zzso This study was designed to demonstrate that we could learn about genes related to a specific mechanism and further use this knowledge to predict outcome in patients - a paradigm shift towards accurate zzso zzso We propose a novel algorithm, zzso which predicts a zzso zzso network associated to zzso regulation consisting of zzso genes and zzso Genes termed as zzso in this network meet all of the following criteria: zzso they are zzso with genes known to be involved in the biological mechanism of interest, zzso they are also zzso expressed between distinct zzso relevant to the study, and zzso as a zzso genes correlate with both the mechanism and the zzso 

This zzso study, which focuses on zzso mechanisms, was conducted in a well-studied set of 132 acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso with nine distinct zzso and three measures of response to zzso We used established zzso and non zzso statistics to derive the zzso zzso network that consisted of 10 zzso and 33 significant clusters of zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso The significance of zzso was estimated from empirical zzso and a robust zzso derived from ALL outcome data was produced by repeated random zzso The evaluation of derived robust network to predict outcome zzso of zzso was significant zzso zzso zzso using one hundred zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first method predicting zzso networks of genes associated with zzso mechanisms and to demonstrate its inherent capability to predict therapeutic zzso This zzso approach can be applied to any regulatory mechanisms including zzso or zzso regulation in order to derive zzso molecular profiles that are mechanistically zzso The zzso of zzso in R is freely available at zzso
