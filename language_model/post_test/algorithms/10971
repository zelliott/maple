An autonomous evolutionary zzso for constructing decision trees is zzso The zzso requires no or minimal human interaction and shows some interesting properties when used on different medical zzso The zzso uses a zzso implicit fitness evaluation in the selection phase of a zzso zzso Together with zzso of evolution parameters and with some other improvements it can monitor and adjust its own zzso The zzso capability to zzso to a given problem is used as a measure to predict if some zzso is just difficult or impossible to zzso The autonomous zzso on average produces very general solutions or gives no solution if the zzso is prone to the zzso zzso
