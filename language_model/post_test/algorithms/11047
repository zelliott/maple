The aim of the present paper is to present the methodology of the molecular zzso family zzso as an zzso tool in molecular modeling and its abilities as a zzso zzso modeling zzso An zzso for zzso useful information from the zzso and geometrical representation of chemical compounds was developed and integrated to calculate zzso zzso The zzso methodology was implemented and the software is available online zzso This zzso tool was developed in order to maximize performance, zzso efficiency and zzso The zzso methodology is able to provide reliable and valid multiple linear zzso zzso Furthermore, in many cases, the zzso models were better than the published results in the literature in terms of correlation zzso zzso significant zzso Z test at a significance level of zzso and/or in terms of values of information criteria and zzso zzso The zzso methodology developed and implemented as a platform for investigating and characterizing quantitative relationships between the chemical structure and the zzso of active compounds was used on more than 50 study zzso In almost all cases, the methodology allowed obtaining of zzso models improved in explanatory power of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso applied in the zzso of geometric and zzso zzso zzso in modeling zzso or biological properties of zzso and those used in searching for reliable and valid multiple linear zzso models certain enrich the pool of low-cost zzso drug design zzso
