In this paper, we propose a tracking technique for a zzso guide wire in a sequence of zzso A technique in which the zzso technique was embedded was zzso It gives the center line of a zzso guide zzso A sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 bit zzso zzso zzso with a carotid phantom and head phantom was obtained with a zzso zzso America Medical Systems, zzso CA, zzso zzso zzso system and a zzso Standard zzso guide wire zzso zzso Systems, zzso CA, zzso To evaluate the technique, we manually traced the guide wire in each sequence frame three times, and a zzso zzso zzso guide wire was created from zzso The number of zzso on the true guide wire and inside the zzso tolerance of the center line was counted in each zzso and the percentage of that count based on the number of all zzso on the true guide wire was calculated as true positive zzso In addition, the number of zzso on the center line and outside the zzso tolerance of the true guide wire was counted in each frame as false positive zzso The tracking technique has a mean zzso of zzso and a mean zzso of zzso zzso Several frames have low zzso and high zzso but the technique could continue to track the zzso guide wire until the end of the zzso We therefore concluded that we had developed an accurate automatic tracking technique for zzso guide wires in zzso zzso
