Rate zzso which is available in some zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to prevent zzso de zzso in patients with long zzso zzso Its efficacy in general zzso zzso prevention has not been zzso 

The purpose of the zzso zzso zzso Trial zzso was to zzso investigate whether rate smoothing could significantly reduce the zzso of zzso zzso in a large, broad population of patients with zzso 

Five hundred zzso patients were enrolled at 57 participating centers and implanted with a commercially available zzso zzso A zzso crossover design was used in which each patient was zzso at implant to one of two treatment zzso either rate smoothing on zzso zzso followed by rate smoothing off zzso zzso or zzso Off followed by zzso zzso This mode sequence was randomly determined and assigned in a zzso fashion using zzso zzso blocks by zzso Each mode was followed for 6 zzso zzso of rate smoothing was prescribed as zzso Down and zzso Up for the duration of the zzso On zzso 

Of enrolled patients, 281 were zzso to zzso Off followed by zzso zzso and 288 to zzso On followed by zzso zzso With zzso zzso 75 zzso patients experienced a reduction in zzso 76 zzso saw an increase in zzso and the remaining 176 zzso had no zzso No significant difference zzso zzso zzso in frequency of zzso with zzso On vs zzso Off was zzso 

Rate smoothing does not result in a reduction in zzso zzso in a zzso population of patients receiving zzso
