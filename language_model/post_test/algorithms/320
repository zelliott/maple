The recent proposal to use zzso transformation field zzso zzso Express 17, zzso zzso for describing tightly focused laser beams is investigated here in zzso In order to validate the accuracy of zzso we derive the zzso field zzso from the plane wave spectrum zzso zzso is compared with zzso and zzso series field zzso zzso show that zzso is accurate close to the beam axis and divergent far from the beam zzso and zzso is always zzso Moreover, electron dynamics in a tightly focused intense laser beam are simulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained by zzso are shown to be zzso
