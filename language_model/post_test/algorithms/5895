The objectives of these analyses were to zzso develop a zzso population zzso zzso model to describe zzso response to zzso and to zzso identify influential zzso with respect to zzso zzso 

Data from 279 patients who received zzso treatment cycles without zzso acid or vitamin B12 supplementation during participation in one of eight phase II cancer trials were available for zzso Starting doses were 500 or 600 zzso zzso per zzso body surface area zzso administered as zzso intravenous infusions every 21 days (1 zzso The primary analyses included 105 patients zzso zzso for which selected zzso vitamin zzso marker data zzso homocysteine, zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso II, and zzso plasma zzso zzso Classical statistical zzso zzso analyses and a zzso population zzso model were used to evaluate zzso response to zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso following zzso zzso administration was adequately described by a zzso zzso zzso estimates for zzso model parameters zzso baseline zzso count, mean transit time, and the feedback zzso which zzso represent current understanding of the process and physiology of zzso were consistent with previously reported zzso The population zzso model included homocysteine, zzso zzso total zzso and zzso as zzso relative to zzso zzso 

These results support the zzso decision to introduce zzso acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during zzso clinical development as a means of zzso patient homocysteine levels, thereby managing the risk of severe zzso secondary to zzso zzso The current results also suggest that the addition of vitamin B6 supplementation to zzso patient zzso levels may further decrease the zzso of grade 4 zzso following zzso zzso The results also suggest the use of zzso acid as a means of zzso zzso toxicity following administration of zzso agents other than zzso
