This paper deals with the problem of zzso robot zzso and proposes a new method for position zzso that has been developed for the zzso Standard zzso League zzso zzso a complete vision system has been implemented in the zzso robot platform that enables the detection of relevant field zzso The detection of field markers provides some zzso of distances for the current robot zzso To reduce errors in these distance zzso zzso and intrinsic camera zzso procedures have been developed and zzso To validate the zzso algorithm, experiments covering many of the typical situations that arise during zzso games have been developed: ranging from degradation in position zzso to total loss of position zzso to falls, zzso zzso or zzso The zzso method developed is based on the classical particle filter zzso The main contribution of this work is a new particle selection zzso Our approach reduces the CPU computing time required for each iteration and so zzso the limited resource availability problem that is common in robot platforms such as zzso The experimental results show the quality of the new zzso in terms of zzso and CPU time zzso
