Development and application of zzso gene zzso for zzso applications lag far behind those of biomedical zzso Many such zzso discovered thus far lack vigorous statistical and experimental zzso A combination of genetic zzso zzso machines and genetic zzso nearest neighbors was used in this study to search for zzso of zzso chemicals zzso in zzso zzso were conducted on both zzso and zzso zzso either across the entire zzso or within individual zzso factor zzso networks previously linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by gene set enrichment analysis zzso on both the original training data and a dedicated validation zzso 

zzso zzso yielded no zzso Among the 19 zzso conditions zzso the zzso searches yielded zzso for six of them, each having approximately 20 to 30 gene features unique to a zzso zzso within individual zzso networks produced zzso for 15 zzso conditions, each containing 100 or fewer top-ranked gene features pooled from those of multiple zzso networks and also unique to each zzso For the training zzso 10 out of 11 zzso successfully identified the gene expression profiles zzso of their targeted zzso conditions by zzso For the validation zzso zzso for zzso and zzso also correctly identified the zzso of corresponding conditions while no zzso could predict the zzso from zzso 

The discrepancies in the performance of these zzso were attributed in part to varying data complexity among the conditions, as measured to some degree by zzso zzso ratio zzso This variation in data complexity could likely be compensated by adjusting sample size for individual zzso conditions, thus suggesting a need for a preliminary survey of zzso responses before launching a full scale zzso discovery zzso zzso discovery based on individual zzso networks could yield more zzso zzso zzso proved to be a flexible and effective tool for application of gene zzso but a similar and more refined algorithm, connectivity zzso should also be zzso The distribution characteristics of zzso across zzso zzso and zzso networks suggested a differential biological impact among the zzso on zzso zzso involving some basic cellular zzso
