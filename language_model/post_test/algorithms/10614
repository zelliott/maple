To predict the zzso structure of full-length sequences of all targets in zzso regardless of their potential category (from easy comparative modeling to fold recognition to apparent new zzso we used a novel combination of two very different approaches developed independently in our laboratories, which ranked quite well in different categories in zzso First, the zzso zzso was used to identify zzso predict secondary structure, and generate fold recognition zzso zzso which were converted to zzso models using the zzso zzso approach for comparative modeling zzso by zzso of protein zzso Additional models generated zzso zzso by fully automated servers were obtained from the zzso zzso All these models were evaluated by zzso and zzso with scores better than zzso were used as a source of spatial zzso Second, a new zzso of the zzso protein modeling tool zzso was used to carry out folding guided by the zzso restraints with the zzso Exchange zzso Carlo sampling zzso zzso generated in the course of simulation were subject to the average linkage zzso zzso For a representative decoy from each zzso a zzso model was zzso Finally, five models were selected for submission based on combination of various criteria, including the size, density, and average energy of the corresponding zzso and the visual evaluation of the zzso structures and their relationship to the original zzso The combination of zzso and zzso was one of the best-performing zzso over all categories in zzso (it is important to note that our human intervention was very zzso and all steps in our method can be easily zzso We were able to generate a number of very good models, especially in the Comparative Modeling and New zzso zzso zzso the best models were closer to the native structure than any of the templates zzso The main problem we encountered was in the ranking of the final models (the only step of significant human zzso due to the insufficient zzso power, which precluded the possibility of zzso refinement and zzso zzso
