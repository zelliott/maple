A zzso computer program termed Discovery of General zzso and zzso zzso was developed, which uses zzso and zzso analysis to process liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso The output of the program is a list of integration areas as a function of retention time and molecular zzso A feature of the computer program is spectral filtering to facilitate the detection of zzso zzso with a particular zzso zzso The program zzso was used to automatically select zzso products formed from zzso zzso two chlorine zzso and zzso (one zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The recognized isotope ratio can be changed to permit a natural or artificial mixture of zzso to be monitored for zzso This computer program can be used to analyze zzso data for zzso zzso profiling experiments, zzso to assign zzso functions to newly characterized zzso zzso zzso In a representative example, an incubation of testosterone, zzso and a zzso zzso mixture yielded products with M and zzso zzso resembling zzso zzso Another use of the program is the zzso of one set of zzso zzso data from another, zzso in comparisons of changes in patterns during zzso zzso
