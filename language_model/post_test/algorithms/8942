Nile perch zzso zzso suddenly invaded Lake Victoria between 1979 and 1987, 25 years after its introduction in the Ugandan side of the zzso Nile perch then replaced the native fish diversity and zzso altered the zzso and its role to zzso zzso it is now a zzso export product that supports millions of zzso The delay in the Nile perch boom led to a hunt for triggers of the sudden boom and generated several hypotheses regarding its growth at low zzso hypotheses having important implications for the management of Nile perch zzso We use zzso growth as a zzso zzso model to predict when the Nile perch invasion should have been expected, given its growth rate, initial stock size and introduction zzso We find the first exponential growth phase can explain the timing of the perch boom at the scale of Lake Victoria, suggesting that complex mechanisms are not necessary to explain the Nile perch invasion or its zzso However, the boom started in Kenya before Uganda, indicating perhaps that zzso effects act at smaller scales than that of the whole zzso The Nile perch invasion of other lakes indicates that habitat differences may also have an effect on invasion zzso Our results suggest there is probably no single management strategy zzso to the whole lake that would lead to both efficient and sustainable exploitation of its zzso
