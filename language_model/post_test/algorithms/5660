zzso zzso zzso zzso prediction is becoming a focal problem in zzso because the structure of TM proteins is difficult to determine using experimental zzso zzso methods that can zzso predict the zzso of zzso membrane proteins are highly zzso In this paper we introduce zzso a method for detecting zzso segments using only the zzso acid sequence zzso Each zzso acid in a protein sequence is represented by a zzso Index, which is deduced from a combination of the difference in zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso segments in training protein sequences and the zzso acid composition zzso Furthermore, a genetic zzso was employed to find the optimal threshold value for the separation of zzso segments from zzso zzso The method successfully predicted 376 out of the zzso zzso segments in a zzso consisting of 70 test protein zzso The sensitivity and specificity for zzso each zzso acid in every protein sequence in the zzso was zzso and zzso zzso To assess the zzso of zzso we also tested the approach on another standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correctly predicted zzso of proteins based on TM zzso The level of the accuracy achieved using zzso in comparison to other recent approaches for predicting the zzso of TM proteins is a strong argument in favor of our proposed zzso
