The term clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso describes an examination with direct clinical impact on the zzso zzso of clinical zzso especially in children, however, is often difficult due to zzso data zzso The current gold standard is standardized visual zzso To evaluate such data in an automated and objective way, we developed an approach to identify successful zzso 

Average zzso inside a zzso zzso region of interest zzso is compared with average zzso in the rest of the brain, and their ratio zzso factor zzso is determined for different statistical thresholds zzso The approach was tested and validated using 239 clinical pediatric zzso sessions zzso perceptive zzso zzso Performance was assessed in terms of sensitivity, zzso and positive likelihood zzso 

Best performance was found for zzso and zzso achieving a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso Comparing the different zzso sensitivity was lowest for language production tasks, mainly due to zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that an objective, automated framework for the zzso of clinical pediatric zzso sessions may provide important additional information, supporting visual zzso especially from zzso and language perception zzso In the current form, zzso or strong network zzso is not easily zzso
