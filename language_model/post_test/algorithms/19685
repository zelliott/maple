This paper describes an application of neural networks in the field of objective measurement method designed to automatically assess the perceived quality of digital zzso This challenging issue aims to emulate human judgment and to replace very complex and time consuming zzso quality zzso Several metrics have been proposed in literature to tackle this zzso They are based on a general framework that combines different zzso each of them addressing complex zzso The ambition of this paper is not to present a global perfect quality metric but rather to focus on an original way to use neural networks in such a framework in the context of reduced reference zzso quality zzso zzso we point out the interest of such a tool for combining features and pooling them in order to zzso quality zzso The proposed approach zzso some problems inherent to objective metrics that should predict zzso quality score obtained using the single stimulus continuous quality evaluation zzso zzso This latter has been adopted by video quality expert group zzso in its recently zzso reduced referenced and no reference zzso test zzso The originality of such approach compared to previous attempts to use neural networks for quality assessment, relies on the use of a zzso neural network zzso that allows a continuous time scoring of the zzso zzso features are extracted on a frame-by-frame basis on both the reference and the distorted zzso they are derived from a zzso representation and integrated along the zzso axis using a zzso neural network zzso zzso conducted on different zzso videos, with bit rates ranging 2-6 zzso show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to get a plausible model of zzso pooling from the human vision system zzso point of zzso More specifically, a linear correlation criteria, between objective and zzso scoring, up to zzso has been obtained on a set of typical TV zzso
