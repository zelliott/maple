The large number of redundant sequences available in zzso databases provides a resource for the identification of zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes can be used to determine the zzso status of the zzso and zzso in genes that are subject to zzso can then be used as tools to examine zzso zzso status in zzso zzso In this study, we have identified six new zzso zzso zzso and determined the zzso status of these genes by examination of expression patterns in female cells previously demonstrated to have skewed zzso as well as by analysis of zzso cell hybrids retaining the inactive human X zzso zzso was seen from both zzso in females zzso for the zzso zzso confirming the previously reported expression from the inactive X zzso zzso of only a single zzso was seen in females zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that these genes are subject to zzso zzso
