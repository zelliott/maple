zzso cardiac death is the most common cause of death among individuals undergoing zzso The epidemiology of sudden cardiac death has been well zzso and efforts are shifting to risk zzso This study aimed to test whether assessment of acute changes during zzso that are captured in electronic health records improved risk zzso 

Data were collected from all zzso sessions of patients 66 years and older receiving zzso from a large national dialysis provider between 2004 and zzso The primary outcome of interest was sudden cardiac death the day of or day after a dialysis zzso This study used data from 2004 to 2006 as the training set and data from 2007 to 2008 as the validation zzso The machine learning algorithm, Random zzso was used to derive the prediction zzso 

In 22 million sessions, zzso people between 2004 and 2006 and 826 people between 2007 and 2008 died on the day of or day after a dialysis session that was serving as a training or test data session, zzso A reasonably strong predictor was derived using just zzso information zzso zzso which showed modest but significant improvement after inclusion of zzso information zzso zzso zzso However, risk prediction decreased the farther out that it was zzso (up to 1 year), and zzso information became less zzso 

zzso changes in the experience of zzso aid in the assessment of sudden cardiac death and are captured by modern electronic health zzso The collected data are better for the assessment of zzso risk as opposed to longer-term zzso
