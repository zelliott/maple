To evaluate zzso directed brush zzso as a substitute for directed biopsy of zzso zzso identified during zzso 

zzso patients eligible for the study were referred for zzso evaluation for either newly diagnosed abnormal cervical zzso or follow-up of a previously diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients with zzso zzso underwent zzso directed brush zzso followed by directed zzso 

Of 81 pregnant patients zzso 50 paired samples of zzso directed brush zzso and directed zzso were evaluated from 49 zzso One patient was sampled in the first and third trimesters and one patient's brush zzso was unsatisfactory for interpretation because of zzso artifact, leaving 49 zzso pairs that were satisfactory for zzso One patient in the study group had an zzso fetal death of uncertain cause, remote from the time of zzso Compared with the corresponding zzso the directed brush caused significantly less blood loss zzso zzso zzso For all diagnostic categories, directed zzso demonstrated a good degree of correlation with biopsy zzso zzso zzso The brush technique correctly identified 12 of 14 cases zzso of zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso as high-grade zzso If one considers zzso zzso cells, favor human zzso zzso as a true positive, brush sensitivity was 88 zzso zzso and specificity was 74 zzso zzso with an accuracy of zzso 

In the absence of zzso suspicious for zzso zzso directed brush zzso is a safe substitute for directed biopsy in pregnant zzso
