zzso response theory analyses confirmed the zzso of 5 zzso zzso basic mobility (54 zzso fine motor function zzso zzso zzso (90 zzso zzso zzso zzso and wheelchair mobility zzso zzso All zzso scales revealed strong zzso zzso High correlations of scores on simulated computer zzso testing zzso with the overall zzso domain scores indicated excellent potential for zzso to accurately characterize functional profiles of adults with zzso Overall, there was very little loss of measurement reliability or precision using zzso compared with the full item bank; however, there was some loss of reliability and precision at the lower and upper ranges of each scale, corresponding to regions where there were few questions in the item zzso 

zzso evaluation revealed that the zzso achieved considerable breadth of coverage in each content domain and demonstrated acceptable zzso zzso The use of zzso to administer the zzso will minimize assessment burden, while allowing for the comprehensive assessment of the functional abilities of adults with zzso
