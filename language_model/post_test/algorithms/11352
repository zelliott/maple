The use of DNA zzso and zzso chips of high density in modern biomedical research provides complex, high zzso data which have been proven to convey crucial information about gene expression levels and to play an important role in disease zzso zzso there is a need for developing new, robust statistical techniques to analyze these zzso 

zzso is an R package for a robust statistical analysis of gene expression data, based on an efficient zzso of a feasible notion of depth, the zzso Band zzso This software includes several zzso and zzso tools successfully applied to high zzso gene expression zzso A zzso interface is also provided via an zzso zzso 

We illustrate the utility of the zzso package, that could be used, for instance, to achieve a better understanding of zzso variation between tumors and to facilitate the development of personalized zzso
