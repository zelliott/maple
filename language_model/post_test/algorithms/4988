The development of zzso zzso zzso zzso does not necessarily require surgical zzso The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of avoiding early operative intervention, which can lead to significant sacrifice of the small zzso 

Patients with zzso were identified using the zzso registry for the years between 2003 and zzso Each patient's past medical history, history of prior deep zzso zzso or zzso state, clinical and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results were zzso The proportion of zzso zzso observed on the CT scans was compared with the length of the zzso zzso 

Nine patients were admitted for extensive zzso during the time period evaluated (six men, three zzso All CT scans demonstrated signs of severe zzso zzso with a mean zzso zzso proportion of zzso zzso zzso Four patients received medical management zzso Five patients underwent zzso The mean admission time for these patients prior to the operation was zzso days zzso zzso Surgery was required only in cases of zzso zzso The mean length of the zzso zzso was 33 zzso zzso zzso At 6 months after admission, none of the patients required zzso zzso The mean follow-up evaluation period was 27 months zzso zzso One patient died secondary to zzso lateral sclerosis during the zzso 

zzso zzso management comprised of zzso observation on a surgical ward along with systemic zzso must be considered an alternative treatment strategy for zzso This strategy delays surgery and therefore avoids short zzso zzso
