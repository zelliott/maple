We investigate a zzso model of zzso The model is a mirror zzso of the zzso model zzso the zzso of letting the zzso spins vary, keeping the zzso zzso static, we keep the spins zzso and sample different underlying zzso Our zzso simulations show complex zzso behaviors with various zzso as the system grows and temperature approaches zero, but no zzso universal critical zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for zzso finite zzso are a fragmented set of isolated network zzso zzso of higher energy are typically more zzso The connected networks of lowest energy are stretched out giving the network large average zzso For the finite sizes we zzso there are three zzso low-energy regime of fragmented networks, an intermediate regime of zzso networks, and a zzso regime of zzso zzso zzso Scaling up the system size, the borders between these regimes approach zero temperature zzso but different zzso quantities approach their zzso values with different zzso We argue this is zzso perhaps rare, example of a zzso model where finite sizes show a more interesting behavior than the zzso zzso
