One of the major challenges in medical domain is the extraction of comprehensible knowledge from medical diagnosis zzso In this paper, a zzso hybrid evolutionary zzso technique is proposed to extract zzso rules that can be used in clinical practice for better understanding and prevention of unwanted medical zzso In the first phase, a hybrid evolutionary zzso zzso is zzso to zzso the search space by evolving a pool of good candidate rules, zzso genetic programming zzso is applied to evolve nominal attributes for free structured rules and genetic zzso zzso is used to zzso the zzso attributes for concise zzso rules without the need of zzso These candidate rules are then used in the second phase to zzso the order and number of rules in the evolution for forming accurate and comprehensible rule zzso The proposed evolutionary zzso zzso is validated upon zzso and breast cancer zzso obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso results show that the evolutionary zzso produces comprehensible rules and good zzso accuracy for the medical zzso zzso obtained from zzso further justify its zzso and zzso to random partition of zzso
