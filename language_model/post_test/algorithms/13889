This study was designed to set up a zzso image processing zzso for boundary detection from two-dimensional zzso and to establish a computerized model for quantitative analysis of left zzso wall motion with the application of automatic boundary zzso The zzso view zzso images of seven normal subjects and five patients with acute zzso zzso were zzso The main steps of image processing in this zzso included automatic threshold zzso contrast zzso zzso search of zzso boundary, and smoothing of the zzso The zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso frame were measured using a sample point connection zzso For analysis of the regional contraction, the left zzso zzso zzso was divided equally into six zzso The wall motion zzso in patients were compared with the normal wall motion pattern established from the normal subjects to identify the segments with normal or abnormal wall zzso The results of this quantitative method were compared with those of qualitative zzso In the 30 segments of the five patients, quantitative analysis correctly identified nine of the 11 segments with abnormal wall motion diagnosed by qualitative analysis zzso zzso and identified 17 of the 19 segments with normal wall motion zzso zzso The positive and negative zzso values of quantitative analysis were zzso (9 of zzso and zzso (17 of zzso respectively, and the diagnostic accuracy was zzso zzso of zzso Our preliminary results suggest that zzso boundary detection can be applied to establish an objective and useful model for quantitative analysis of left zzso regional wall zzso
