We report the application of zzso correlation zzso zzso in characterizing zzso changes zzso of chemically zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso length zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso were zzso by a zzso zzso microscope using two fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It became clear that the DNA zzso exhibits discrete zzso change between the zzso and zzso states with the addition of a small amount (the order of magnitude being zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso ammonium zzso zzso When the zzso of both condensing agents are smaller than zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M for the 10 and zzso zzso both plasmids are in the extended zzso state with diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the condensing agent in a concentration higher than zzso zzso zzso M is added to zzso (10 zzso plasmids are in the condensed zzso state and their diffusion zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids is characterized by diffusion zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
