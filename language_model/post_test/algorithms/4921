zzso zzso zzso and zzso measurement of flow zzso zzso have been the widely reported zzso techniques to assess zzso during zzso zzso zzso 

zzso monitoring of zzso and tone of the zzso during zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been presently attempted using simple zzso measures of zzso zzso 

zzso characteristics that include pulse zzso zzso zzso and pulse transit time zzso were studied before (1 zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso (5 zzso in 11 healthy zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly increased to maximum at 2nd zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to the zzso meanwhile, no significant changes zzso in zzso zzso was observed during zzso zzso increase in zzso was evident at 1st zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was maintained significantly longer through zzso zzso of zzso Relatively small but significant increase in zzso was noticed only at 1st zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by an immediate recovery to baseline by 2nd zzso of zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso was higher at 1st zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso 

zzso suggests that zzso response reflects the zzso components in the early part of zzso and zzso zzso response reflects the zzso component reinforcing the later course of zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be used to zzso the changes in diameter and tone of the vessel wall, respectively during zzso The collective responses of zzso zzso and zzso can be more appropriate to facilitate zzso technique for monitoring of zzso caused by zzso
