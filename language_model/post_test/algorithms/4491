Minor head injury is the most common type of head zzso Despite of high zzso and numerous studies performed, there is much controversy about correct evaluation of these zzso The aim of this study was to find clinical signs and symptoms which help to predict the indications for brain CT scan following minor head zzso 

A series of zzso consecutive patients who had been attended at two university hospitals zzso and zzso with minor head injury zzso were zzso enrolled in this cohort zzso In all cases clinical signs and symptoms were collected and a zzso computerized zzso zzso scan was zzso The relationship between the occurrence of clinical findings and appearance of zzso zzso zzso on zzso CT was analyzed by zzso tests and statistic zzso zzso methods, with zzso confidence zzso 

Of zzso patients, 46 zzso presented brain injuries on CT zzso All patients with abnormal CT scans had at least one of the following factors zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of consciousness, zzso seizure, headache, zzso focal neurological deficit, skull zzso zzso or zzso of treatment with zzso and patient age older than 60 zzso No abnormal CT scans were found among patients without any of those risk factors on zzso zzso skull fracture and age greater than 60 years were risk factors significantly correlated to an abnormal zzso CT after head zzso The presence of several risk factors in a patient increased the probability of zzso zzso on CT zzso 

Some clinical risk factors can be used as a guide to predict the probability of abnormal CT following minor head zzso
