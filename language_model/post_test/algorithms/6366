This paper presents a coordinated zzso unequal zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso transmitted over zzso zzso In the proposed zzso we divide the video sequence corresponding to a group of pictures into two zzso and independently zzso each zzso using a three-dimensional zzso zzso We use two different zzso schemes to generate the zzso each of which offers some advantages under the appropriate channel zzso Each zzso is protected by an zzso unequal zzso algorithm, which assigns unequal forward error correction codes to each bit zzso Any information that is lost during the transmission for any zzso is estimated at the receiver by using the correlation between the zzso and the zzso of the video zzso zzso results show that the proposed zzso zzso zzso is simple, fast, and robust in hostile network conditions, and that the proposed zzso zzso can achieve zzso zzso gain over the case when error zzso is not used at high zzso zzso
