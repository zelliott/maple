Shape zzso is emerging as an important tool for the statistical analysis of time dependent zzso In this paper, we develop a new zzso model which describes shape change over time, by extending simple linear zzso to the space of shapes represented as currents in the large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso zzso By zzso with linear regression, we estimate a baseline shape zzso and initial zzso zzso which fully zzso the zzso shape zzso This is in contrast to previous shape zzso methods which assume the baseline shape is zzso We further leverage a control point zzso which provides a discrete and low zzso zzso of large zzso zzso This flexible system zzso the zzso of zzso from the specific shape zzso allowing the user to define the zzso of the deformation zzso We present an zzso scheme that estimates the baseline shape, location of the control points, and initial zzso simultaneously via a single zzso descent zzso Finally, we demonstrate our proposed method on synthetic data as well as real anatomical shape zzso
