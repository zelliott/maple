zzso geometrical reconstructions of zzso architecture are indispensable for the investigation of zzso zzso zzso shape is important for the wiring of networks, and zzso architecture strongly affects zzso integration and firing properties as demonstrated by modeling zzso zzso zzso allows to scan zzso with zzso zzso However, it is still a tedious task to reconstruct complex zzso trees with fine structures just above zzso zzso We present a framework assisting the zzso zzso time investment is strongly reduced by automatic methods, which fit a skeleton and a surface to the data, while the user can interact and thus keeps full control to ensure a high quality zzso The reconstruction process composes a successive gain of metric zzso First, a structural description of the zzso is built, including the zzso and the exact zzso lengths and zzso We use generalized zzso with circular cross zzso The user provides a rough zzso by marking the branching zzso The axes and zzso are fitted to the data by minimizing an energy functional, which is zzso by a zzso zzso The investigation of proximity to other structures throughout zzso trees requires a precise surface zzso In order to achieve accuracy of zzso zzso and below, we additionally implemented a zzso zzso based on zzso active contours that allow for arbitrary cross sections and uses locally adapted zzso In zzso this new reconstruction tool saves time and increases quality as compared to other methods, which have previously been applied to real zzso
