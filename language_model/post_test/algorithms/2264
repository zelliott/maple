The zzso cost, in terms of both storage requirements and calculation required, of performing an elimination ordering on a graph is considered as a function of the order in which the zzso of the moral graph are zzso zzso properties of the moral graph of a pedigree with respect to zzso elimination are observed and these properties extended to define a zzso as a graph permitting allocation of one of k sexes to each zzso of the zzso such that the zzso induced by zzso of a single six contains no zzso Properties of zzso include an upper bound of zzso on zzso zzso A novel algorithm, zzso based upon these properties is proposed and its performance compared with other zzso used to generate elimination zzso It is found to give a widely dispersed range of of zzso including some sequences requiring under a quarter of the storage and under a half of the zzso time than had previously been found using standard zzso
