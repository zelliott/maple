zzso wall reconstruction continues to evolve with improvement in technique and zzso This study reviews our experience with challenging full thickness zzso muscle, and zzso defects following tumor zzso often in high-risk zzso 

All patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction following full thickness tumor zzso were included in the zzso Data zzso included patient zzso zzso tumor zzso risk factors, type of repair, zzso and recurrence of the zzso 

A total of 30 patients underwent reconstruction after full thickness zzso of abdominal wall tumors or tumors of zzso zzso involving abdominal zzso The indications included zzso tumors zzso abdominal wall zzso zzso colon cancer invading abdominal wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with abdominal wall invasion zzso and other zzso In all, 17 patients underwent simultaneous zzso of one or more zzso zzso The type of repair included primary closure zzso zzso or zzso closure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used more commonly in the patients with tumors of gastrointestinal zzso The average follow-up period was 23 zzso zzso complications developed in 6 patients zzso zzso of zzso complications was higher in patients with colon cancer invading the abdominal wall or those with zzso zzso or radiation zzso An abdominal zzso or zzso developed in 4 patients zzso it was higher in patients who did not have mesh zzso 

zzso wall reconstruction after full thickness tumor zzso is zzso It can be performed safely and effectively with attention to surgical technique, patients' risk of infection, and type of zzso zzso zzso zzso graft has been a useful addition to minimize morbidity and recurrence in these high-risk zzso
