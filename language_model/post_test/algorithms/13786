We describe a new image processing method for semiautomatic quantitative analysis of zzso zzso It has been developed in a specific image analysis environment zzso zzso but the zzso and the methods can be employed zzso The program is versatile and allows the analysis of zzso preparations of different quality on the basis of different levels of evaluation and image zzso Some significant zzso have been implemented zzso one for multiple focus image acquisition and one for automatic cell body shape recognition and zzso A wide set of specific zzso parameters has been defined to allow a better mathematical characterization of zzso zzso as regards both zzso trees and cell zzso Cell zzso shapes can be classified automatically, defining different zzso zzso This is done by evaluating the number of main zzso and zzso shapes through a zzso based method, tested on zzso cells in mouse zzso The methods presented have been applied to analysis of zzso but they can well be used for any quantitative zzso study of other cell zzso
