Defining viability and the potential for recovery of zzso brain tissue can be very valuable for patient selection for acute stroke zzso zzso MR imaging analysis of zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso is zzso in degree of zzso injury and recovery zzso We sought to define MR imaging characteristics of zzso zzso that are compatible with viable zzso 

We included patients with zzso zzso stroke who underwent zzso MR imaging studies zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso imaging, and zzso zzso at the acute zzso 24 zzso and outcome (3 zzso zzso of zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso Data Analysis zzso zzso the zzso was segmented into clusters and each was assigned a number, called the tissue signature zzso matter zzso 1, zzso zzso 12, all others between these zzso Recovery was defined as at least a zzso size reduction from the acute phase zzso zzso volume to the outcome phase zzso imaging zzso zzso The tissue signature data were collapsed into the following zzso zzso or zzso 3, 4, 5, and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis included the following zzso zzso volume, tissue signature value, apparent diffusion zzso zzso value, relative zzso zzso expressed as a ratio, zzso value, and zzso zzso The model with the largest goodness of fit value was zzso 

We included 48 patients zzso ratio, zzso age, 64 zzso years; 15 treated with zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso within 3 hours of zzso median National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score, 7 zzso zzso Median symptom zzso imaging time zzso was zzso zzso With zzso processing, we generated 200 zzso tissue records (one to nine tissue records per zzso Regarding tissue recovery, we detected a three-way interaction among zzso zzso tissue signature, and previous treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso In the group not treated with zzso zzso zzso with acute zzso greater than the median zzso and tissue signature zzso or zzso 4 were more likely to recover zzso zzso zzso and zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for tissue signatures 5 and 6, zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging of acute stroke clearly shows zzso and different viability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with lower acute phase zzso tissue signature values zzso or zzso 4) and higher zzso values zzso or zzso zzso are much more likely to recover than those with higher signature values or lower zzso zzso The effect of these factors on tissue recovery, however, is dependent on whether preceding treatment with zzso had been zzso Our approach can be a valuable tool in the design of therapeutic stroke trials with an extended time zzso
