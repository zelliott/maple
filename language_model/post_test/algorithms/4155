zzso of tumor zzso is among the hallmarks of cancer and a driver of zzso cascade zzso Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the zzso zzso zzso This enormous increase in complexity of zzso data zzso the application of zzso methods for the analysis, mining and reconstruction of these spatial graph data zzso We present a novel methodology that combines zzso high-resolution zzso zzso imaging data with a zzso zzso zzso to track and reconstruct the zzso zzso of a human breast cancer zzso The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a zzso model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor zzso zzso This zzso involves a well-established zzso model and an zzso zzso that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor zzso zzso zzso maps for the zzso zzso network are zzso zzso and zzso zzso from different regions are compared to zzso their role in overall tumor zzso
