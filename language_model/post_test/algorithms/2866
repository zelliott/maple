zzso of the designing parameters in the planning of a controlled clinical trial may yield an zzso or an zzso zzso Internal pilot study, a kind of zzso design, has gained increased attention for its allowing for sample size adjustment, especially blinded sample size adjustment that do not affect the type I error zzso Several methods were proposed to implement internal pilot design in recent years and some software emerges to simulate or implement zzso But most of the software is only running on a zzso terminal or zzso zzso We develop a system to simulate it based on zzso mode and realized on zzso It allows the web users to input corresponding parameters from the web browser such as Internet Explorer to make zzso The system was constructed with generic database zzso design method and coded with Microsoft Visual Basic and Active zzso Pages zzso programming zzso Web users on zzso can use the system to make blinded zzso estimate, sample size adjustment and zzso test for internal pilot zzso The application of the simulation is demonstrated through an zzso Not only blinded sample size adjustment is implemented but also a zzso test is zzso With applications of blinding zzso zzso for sample size zzso and zzso test, the type I error rate is also controlled zzso
