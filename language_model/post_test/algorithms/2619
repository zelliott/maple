zzso zzso CT could replace zzso zzso CT scans in the cardiac zzso zzso However, cardiac gating results in view angle zzso and the small size of the detector results in projection data zzso These problems are incompatible with conventional zzso reconstruction zzso In this paper, the prior image constrained compressed sensing zzso reconstruction method was adapted to solve these zzso The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of zzso zzso with zzso projection data zzso and total zzso compressed zzso A canine projection zzso acquired using a clinical zzso imaging system supplied realistic cardiac motion and anatomy for this zzso Three different levels of zzso were zzso The relative root mean squared error and the universal image quality index were used to zzso the reconstruction zzso Three main conclusions were zzso zzso The adapted version of the zzso zzso offered the highest image quality and reconstruction zzso zzso No meaningful variation in performance was observed when the amount of zzso was zzso zzso This study showed evidence that accurate interior zzso with an zzso acquisition is possible for realistic objects if a prior image with minimal artifacts is zzso
