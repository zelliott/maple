An extremely reliable source to sink communication is required for most of the contemporary zzso applications especially pertaining to military, zzso and zzso However, due to their intrinsic energy, bandwidth and zzso constraints, Wireless Sensor Networks zzso encounter several challenges in reliable source to sink zzso In this paper, we present a novel reliable zzso that uses reliable zzso between sensor zzso to boost the reliability of zzso zzso This reliable and efficient zzso alternative reduces the number of average hops from source to the zzso We zzso with the help of zzso zzso that communication using zzso is considerably more reliable than traditional zzso zzso We use reliability theory to analyze the cost and benefit of adding gateway zzso to a zzso zzso However, in zzso assisted zzso some scenarios where source and the sink are just a couple of hops away might bring more zzso therefore, we present a Signature Based zzso zzso zzso zzso enables the zzso to make intelligent zzso decisions, based upon the derived signature, hence providing lesser zzso delay between source to the sink zzso Finally, we evaluate our proposed zzso based zzso with the help of a simulation tool and show that the proposed zzso provides zzso increase in zzso zzso
