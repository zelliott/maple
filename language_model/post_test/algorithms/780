zzso II zzso is a server for the prediction of zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of TM segments zzso zzso positions and zzso zzso based on a consensus approach by combining the results of several proposed zzso The zzso II system is constructed from zzso and zzso zzso named zzso proposed earlier by our zzso The prediction accuracy of zzso is almost zzso which is achieved by sacrificing the prediction coverage zzso zzso predicts TM zzso for all the input sequences with zzso improved by up to zzso over individual proposed zzso In the zzso II system, the TM zzso prediction of input TM protein sequences is executed following a zzso process: zzso input sequences are first run through the zzso program; zzso sequences for which zzso does not give the TM zzso are delivered to the zzso program for TM zzso zzso Users can get access to the zzso II system automatically by submitting sequences to the zzso The zzso II server will return the predicted TM zzso models and zzso representations of their contents zzso zzso zzso wheel zzso of predicted zzso and zzso zzso
