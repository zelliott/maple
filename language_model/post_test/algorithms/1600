The free energy of zzso can play an important or even dominant role in the accurate prediction of binding affinities and various other zzso interaction phenomena critical to the study of zzso zzso Many research applications for zzso zzso such as zzso drug design, require zzso that are both accurate and zzso zzso We have developed a calculation of zzso free energy which runs fast enough for interactive applications, functions for a wide range of chemical species relevant to simulating molecules for biological and pharmaceutical applications, and is readily extended when data for new species becomes zzso We have also demonstrated that the incorporation of zzso zzso data provides necessary access to sufficient reference data for a broad range of chemical zzso Our empirical model, including an zzso term and a different set of atom types, demonstrates improvements over a zzso zzso surface zzso model by Wang et zzso when fit to identical training sets zzso absolute error of zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso reported by zzso The incorporation of zzso zzso zzso free energies provides a significant increase in the breadth of chemical features for which the model can be applied by introducing classes of compounds for which little or no experimental data is zzso The increased breadth and the speed of this zzso model allow for zzso zzso zzso search, and zzso binding free energy calculations that economically account for the complex interplay of zzso zzso and zzso free energies as zzso with varying zzso surfaces are zzso
