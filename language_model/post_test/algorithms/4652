Modern zzso imaging devices enable the acquisition of spatial and zzso image zzso But, the spatial and zzso resolution of such devices is limited and therefore image zzso techniques are needed to represent images at a desired level of zzso This paper presents a method for zzso zzso between neighboring slices in zzso or spatial image zzso 

In a first step, the zzso zzso field between image slices is determined using an optical zzso registration method in order to establish spatial correspondence between adjacent zzso An zzso zzso is applied using the spatial and zzso image derivatives and a zzso smoothing zzso zzso the calculated zzso field is used to generate an zzso image at the desired time by averaging zzso between corresponding zzso Three quantitative measures are defined to evaluate the performance of the zzso zzso 

The behavior and capability of the zzso is demonstrated by synthetic zzso A population of 17 zzso and spatial image sequences are zzso to compare the optical zzso zzso method to linear and zzso zzso The quantitative results show that the optical zzso method zzso the linear and zzso zzso statistically zzso 

The zzso method presented is able to generate image sequences with appropriate spatial or zzso resolution needed for image comparison, analysis or zzso zzso zzso and qualitative measures extracted from synthetic zzso and medical image data show that the new method definitely has advantages over linear and zzso zzso
