This paper presents a new zzso image zzso method based on particle swarm zzso and scaled active contours with shape zzso The proposed method uses particle swarm zzso over a polar coordinate system to perform the zzso task, increasing the searching capability on medical images with respect to different interactive zzso zzso This method is used to segment the human heart and zzso areas from zzso of zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images, where the shape prior is acquired by zzso and it is zzso as the initial active zzso Moreover, to assess the performance of the cardiac medical image zzso obtained by the proposed method and by the interactive techniques regarding the regions delineated by experts, a set of validation metrics has been zzso The experimental results are promising and suggest that the proposed method is capable of zzso human heart and zzso areas accurately, which can significantly help zzso in clinical decision zzso
