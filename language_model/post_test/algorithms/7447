A novel dynamic zzso PET to PET image registration procedure is proposed and applied to multiple PET scans acquired with the high resolution research zzso zzso the highest resolution human brain PET scanner available in the zzso By extending the recent zzso zzso zzso method and applying it to multiple dynamic zzso scans from the zzso an important step towards construction of a PET zzso of unprecedented quality for zzso imaging of the human brain has been zzso zzso for the zzso dimension in PET data improves registration accuracy when compared to registration of zzso to zzso zzso PET zzso The zzso approach was chosen for its ease in providing both an intensity and shape template, through zzso sequential zzso registrations with fast zzso The proposed method is zzso to any PET zzso providing zzso zzso with useful applications in high accuracy PET data simulations and automated PET image zzso
