A zzso zzso zzso zzso scanner for zzso imaging of soft zzso to depths of several zzso with a spatial resolution in the tens to hundreds of zzso range is zzso The system comprises a zzso optical zzso zzso laser system that provides zzso laser zzso between 600 and 1200 zzso for generating the zzso signals and an optical ultrasound mapping system based upon a zzso zzso film sensor for detecting zzso The system enables zzso signals to be mapped in zzso over a 50 zzso diameter zzso in steps of 10 zzso with an zzso defined element size of 64 zzso Two sensors were used, one with a 22 zzso thick zzso film zzso and the other with a 38 zzso thick zzso providing zzso zzso acoustic zzso of 39 and 22 zzso zzso The measured noise equivalent pressure of the 38 zzso sensor was zzso zzso over a 20 zzso measurement zzso The instrument zzso function zzso was measured as a function of position and the minimum lateral and vertical zzso found to be 38 and 15 zzso zzso To demonstrate the ability of the system to provide high-resolution zzso images, a range of absorbing objects were zzso Among these was a blood vessel phantom that comprised a network of blood filled tubes of diameters ranging from 62 to 300 zzso immersed in an zzso scattering zzso In addition, to demonstrate the zzso of the system to zzso imaging, a phantom zzso tubes filled with zzso of different spectral characteristics was zzso at a range of zzso It is considered that this type of instrument may provide a zzso alternative to zzso zzso systems for high-resolution structural and functional imaging of the skin zzso and other superficial zzso
