zzso were obtained for the quantitative analysis of the following parameters of zzso in zzso 1) the lifetime of electronic zzso 2) the numbers of zzso runs along the DNA zzso 3) the energy loss by an zzso for one run; 4) the maximum length of the DNA sequence capable of zzso an zzso for one zzso The maximum and minimum ranges for the constant of electronic zzso migration was determined to meet the requirement of zzso energy transfer for the case of strong zzso The constant of zzso energy migration was shown to depend on the zzso energy, which is equal to the energy of absorbed zzso An zzso formula was derived to determine the number of zzso the DNA zzso is able to zzso depending on its zzso without zzso effects (without overlapping of spatial areas of electronic zzso By this formula, DNA sequences consisting of only identical AT and zzso zzso pairs and zzso AT + zzso (in the ratio zzso DNA sequences ranging from 1 up to zzso base pairs were zzso The results of the analysis suggest that the overlapping of spatial areas of electronic zzso induced by a single ultraviolet quantum occurs in short DNA sequences characteristic of zzso To achieve the same effects on long DNA sequences specific for zzso DNA must zzso absorb a great number of ultraviolet zzso Based on the above results, the following conclusions were made: 1) disturbances in the normal activity of DNA and zzso zzso may be due to electromagnetic field, which is caused by the zzso relaxation of zzso levels of zzso The energy enters the zzso levels of zzso from an zzso running along the DNA zzso 2) the increase in the zzso DNA sequences in zzso due to evolution is a way of DNA protection from zzso zzso 3) zzso must possess a greater zzso and a higher rate of zzso in comparison with zzso which is proved by their greater diversity in zzso
