The ability to estimate tissue zzso (in zzso per minute per zzso in zzso using zzso zzso zzso harmonic and zzso ultrasound imaging was zzso 

A zzso 9 scanner zzso zzso Milwaukee, zzso equipped with a zzso probe was modified to perform zzso harmonic imaging zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso 10 zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso imaging was performed in the lower pole of both zzso in 5 zzso zzso after injection of the ultrasound contrast agent zzso zzso zzso Medical Imaging, N zzso zzso The zzso received a zzso zzso injection of zzso for zzso and a zzso zzso for zzso in zzso for each zzso zzso data acquisition was started just before the injection of zzso (to capture the zzso and continued until zzso A zzso zzso technique based on stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Laboratory, zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the degree of zzso in each kidney (the reference zzso zzso a surgically exposed branch of the zzso arteries induced lower zzso zzso This was followed by additional zzso imaging and zzso injections to measure zzso zzso Slice data were extracted from the zzso ultrasound volumes and used to generate zzso zzso zzso in the regions corresponding to the tissue samples used for zzso zzso The zzso plane was also selected from the zzso volume (as a zzso zzso zzso and compared with the zzso imaging zzso zzso was estimated from the initial slope of the fractional blood volume zzso (for both zzso and zzso and compared with the reference standard using linear zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso were able to provide zzso of flow and, thus, zzso in the zzso However, zzso provided near-complete tissue suppression and improved zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data were available for 4 zzso (1 was excluded because of an error with the reference blood zzso and showed a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per gram before and after the zzso zzso The reference standard showed significant correlation with the overall zzso zzso zzso estimates zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but it correlated more strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, these results showed an improvement over the zzso zzso and zzso zzso estimates zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso estimates previously reported by our group zzso zzso zzso 

In this preliminary study, zzso zzso zzso ultrasound was able to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in better overall agreement with the reference standard than zzso zzso did and was superior to previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the other methods for zzso blood zzso because of the improved zzso of the complete zzso vascular zzso
