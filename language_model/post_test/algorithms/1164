The zzso structures impart structural and functional credibility to zzso In a zzso zzso it is important to understand the factors that drive the association or zzso of the zzso It is a well known fact that both zzso and charged interactions contribute to the stability of the protein zzso The interface zzso are also known to be highly zzso Though they are buried in the zzso these zzso are either exposed or partially exposed in the zzso It is felt that a systematic and objective method of identifying interface clusters and their analysis can significantly contribute to the identification of a zzso or a collection of zzso important for zzso Recently, we have applied the techniques of zzso methods to a variety of problems related to protein structure and zzso A major advantage of this methodology is that the problem is viewed from a global protein zzso point of view rather than localized regions of the protein zzso In the present investigation, we have applied the methods of zzso analysis to identify side chain clusters at the interface and the centers of these clusters in a set of zzso zzso These clusters are analyzed in terms of properties such as zzso acid zzso accessibility to zzso and conservation of zzso zzso results such as participation of charged and aromatic zzso like zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso consistent with earlier zzso have emerged from these zzso Important additional information is that the zzso involved are a part of a zzso and that they are zzso distant zzso which have come closer to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso These zzso can easily be detected using our zzso zzso This method has also been used to identify important zzso zzso zzso in zzso and also to detect zzso sites on the zzso The zzso predicted using the present zzso have correlated well with the experiments indicating the efficacy of this method in predicting zzso involved in zzso zzso
