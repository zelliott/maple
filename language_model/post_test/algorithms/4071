The traditional method for calculating acoustic pressure zzso is to divide a zzso output zzso measurement by the zzso sensitivity at the acoustic working frequency, but this approach zzso frequency dependence of zzso zzso Another method is to perform a complex zzso between the zzso output zzso and the zzso impulse response (the inverse zzso transform of the zzso In this paper, the effects of zzso on zzso of peak zzso pressure zzso peak zzso pressure zzso and pulse intensity integral zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure complex sensitivities from 1 to 40 zzso for 8 zzso used in medical ultrasound zzso These included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso needle, zzso and fiber-optic zzso zzso the 8 zzso were used to measure a zzso 3 zzso pressure zzso mimicking a zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters were measured for the 8 zzso using the traditional approach and zzso Average zzso zzso all 8 zzso of acoustic parameters from zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared with the traditional method, zzso reduced the zzso of variation zzso of standard zzso to mean across all 8 zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
