zzso of one protein to another in a highly specific manner to form stable complexes is critical in most biological zzso yet the mechanisms involved in the interaction of proteins are not fully zzso The identification of hot spots, a small subset of binding zzso that account for the majority of binding free energy, is becoming increasingly important in understanding the principles of protein zzso Despite experiments like zzso scanning zzso and a variety of zzso methods that have been applied to this problem, comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and reliable solutions is still in its infant zzso We developed zzso zzso of Hot zzso a zzso method that can effectively identify hot spots on zzso zzso by using 38 zzso chosen zzso The optimal combination of features was selected from a set of 324 novel structural neighborhood properties by a zzso feature selection method consisting of a random forest zzso and a sequential backward elimination zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso using a benchmark of 265 zzso interface zzso zzso I) and a trimmed subset zzso zzso with zzso zzso Compared with the zzso art approaches, zzso achieves a significant improvement on the prediction quality, which stems from the new structural neighborhood properties, the novel way of feature generation, as well as the selection power of the proposed zzso zzso We further validated the capability of our method by an independent test and obtained promising zzso
