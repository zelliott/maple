zzso into cognitive zzso from zzso techniques are now required to go beyond the zzso of well-known cognitive zzso Fundamental to this is the notion of zzso of experimental zzso This paper addresses the central issue that functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments will produce more desirable information if researchers begin to search for zzso evidence rather than only p value zzso The study proposes a methodology for investigating zzso evidence without conducting separate zzso zzso The zzso evidence is gathered from the separate runs within the zzso The associated empirical zzso and zzso extensions of the linear model provide zzso estimates to determine zzso zzso applications of the methodology suggest that zzso evidence is robust to small sample sizes and sensitive to both the magnitude and zzso of brain zzso It is demonstrated that research findings in zzso studies would be more compelling with supporting zzso evidence in addition to standard hypothesis testing zzso
