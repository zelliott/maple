This paper proposes a method to segment the zzso in cervical cell images using graph zzso zzso First, the zzso channel in zzso zzso color space is extracted for contrast zzso Then, in order to effectively extract zzso boundaries when image zzso present zzso distribution, zzso multiple zzso is performed on the contrast enhanced image to generate initial zzso based on which the segments are refined by the zzso graph cut zzso We use 21 cervical cell images with zzso imaging condition to evaluate zzso zzso zzso The proposed method achieved a zzso accuracy which outperformed state-of-the-art zzso
