zzso is a unique antipsychotic with very low propensity to cause motor side zzso In contrast to most other zzso that block more than zzso of zzso zzso receptors at therapeutic doses, zzso occupies less than zzso Furthermore, even at maximum occupancy, zzso is not zzso Several mechanisms have been proposed as explanations for this low zzso zzso occupancy, but clear evidence is zzso 

In patient studies the data are limited by the zzso that can be safely zzso therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the maximum occupancy of zzso zzso receptors with up to zzso zzso of zzso injection of zzso to zzso primates and to measure the time course of zzso 

PET examination with zzso was performed to measure the zzso zzso zzso occupancy in the zzso of two monkeys after the zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso to follow the time course of occupancy up to 7 h after the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso occupancy reached up to zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso Occupancy decreased with a zzso of zzso h after zzso zzso zzso and zzso h after zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could occupy a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso The time course of occupancy was relatively fast, with a zzso of several zzso
