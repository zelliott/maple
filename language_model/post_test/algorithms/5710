zzso zzso is an essential index for analysis of complex zzso However, the calculation of zzso zzso is quite time-consuming and the fastest known zzso uses zzso + N log zzso time and zzso + zzso space for weighted networks, where N and M are the number of zzso and edges in the network, zzso By inserting virtual zzso into the weighted edges and transforming the shortest path problem into a zzso search zzso problem, we propose an zzso that can zzso the zzso zzso in zzso time for zzso networks, where w is the average weight of edges and D is the average degree in the zzso zzso time can be saved with the proposed zzso when w zzso log zzso + 1, indicating that it is suitable for lightly weighted large sparse zzso A similar concept of virtual zzso transformation can be used to calculate other shortest path based zzso such as closeness zzso graph zzso stress zzso and so zzso zzso simulations on various randomly generated networks reveal that it is feasible to use the proposed zzso in large network zzso
