zzso bias is a potential problem, especially in trials where blinding is not zzso zzso with a constrained block of large size provides better protection from selection bias than using a sequence of blocks of small size with the same maximum zzso We propose an zzso that efficiently generates constrained block allocation zzso and we describe two clinical trials in which such a constrained zzso was zzso
