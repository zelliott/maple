We report the design of an integrated platform for zzso electrical zzso of the surface zzso resonance supported by a zzso metal zzso The latter is zzso on the active area of a zzso zzso and simultaneously works as the electronic gate of the zzso The gold zzso crystal has a zzso profile and has been designed by zzso optical zzso By showing that the zzso models accurately reproduce the zzso experimental response, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is suitable for the development of a new class of compact and zzso zzso zzso
