zzso structure comparison, an important problem in structural biology, has two main zzso zzso comparing two protein structures in order to identify the similarities and differences between them, and zzso searching for structures similar to a query zzso Many zzso resources for both applications are available, but all are based on rigid structural alignment zzso zzso server zzso the recently developed flexible protein structure comparison zzso zzso which automatically identifies hinges and internal zzso in two protein zzso The server provides access to two zzso zzso for zzso flexible structure comparison and zzso for database searching for structurally similar zzso Given two protein structures zzso the zzso Data Bank zzso zzso zzso reports their structural alignment and the corresponding statistical significance of the similarity measured as a zzso Users can view the zzso of the structures online in web browsers that support the zzso zzso or download the superimposed structures in zzso zzso In zzso users provide one query structure and the server returns a list of protein structures that are similar to the zzso ordered by the zzso In addition, zzso server can report the zzso changes of the query structure as compared to other proteins in the structure zzso zzso server is available at zzso
