zzso interaction zzso zzso models are now widely used in predicting blood flow zzso This is because of the importance of the interaction between the flowing blood and the zzso zzso wall to blood flow zzso Unfortunately, most of these zzso models lack rigorous validation and, thus, cannot guarantee the accuracy of their zzso This paper presents the comprehensive validation of a zzso coupled zzso zzso model, developed to predict flow zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso The model is validated using zzso solutions and experiments conducted on zzso mock zzso zzso parameters such as pressure and zzso stress (and zzso wave speeds, wall zzso and zzso frequency, fluid zzso and zzso zzso effects, were used as the basis of this zzso zzso show very good comparison between zzso predictions, zzso solutions and experimental zzso The agreement between the three approaches is generally over zzso The model also shows accurate prediction of zzso zzso effects in unsteady flows through flexible pipes, which up to this stage have only being predicted zzso zzso this zzso model can accurately predict flow zzso in zzso vessels such as zzso
