A general approach for assigning the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in their unfolded state is zzso The assignment approach takes advantage of the spectral zzso of the zzso nitrogen chemical shifts in zzso proteins by zzso side chain and backbone carbon and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the same and adjacent zzso The zzso zzso of the individual zzso acid spin systems are correlated with their zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso experiment, which allows the spin systems to be assigned to zzso acid zzso The spin systems are then linked to the adjacent zzso spin system using the zzso zzso zzso Complete zzso assignments are obtained from the zzso zzso zzso Unlike other methods for assigning zzso zzso this approach does not require previous knowledge of the native state assignments or specific zzso rates between the native and zzso zzso The strategy is demonstrated by assigning the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso binding protein zzso in zzso M zzso
