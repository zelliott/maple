While there are published equations for calculating the hybrid zzso rates zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso model from its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there appears to be no report of an analogous method for a zzso zzso The hybrid rate zzso are the zzso of the zzso equation describing the zzso of the predicted blood zzso 

Using the method of Wagner, the differential equations of a zzso model were solved by transformation into the zzso domain then zzso zzso The inversion of the result back into the time domain requires finding the roots of a cubic zzso The equations of a convenient method for doing so are zzso This zzso method for finding the hybrid rate zzso was compared with an alternative zzso and zzso zzso For this, a model with known zzso zzso was used to predict a zzso of blood zzso for a zzso dose, which was then fitted to a zzso equation to find the hybrid rate zzso 

The hybrid rate zzso for the two methods were identical to at least four significant figures, confirming the zzso of the zzso zzso 

The equations presented here fill a gap in the zzso literature, which may be useful in some applications considering the widespread use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
