The accurate and effective interpretation of zzso data in X-ray zzso is becoming increasingly important as structural initiatives turn toward large zzso zzso zzso challenges remain due to the poor information content and ambiguity in the interpretation of electron density maps at low zzso Here, we describe a zzso procedure that employs a zzso zzso search algorithm, zzso to produce a starting model for the structure determination of zzso interacting factor 1 in complex with a zzso of DNA zzso IV at low zzso The combined use of experimental data and a zzso knowledge of protein structure enabled us not only to generate an zzso model but also to zzso the zzso sequence zzso This approach provides a means to extract quickly from experimental data useful information that would otherwise be discarded and to take into account the uncertainty in the zzso overriding issue for zzso zzso
