Different methods for the automated zzso of microscopic cell scenes are presented with zzso The techniques discussed include edge detection by zzso zzso detection by zzso algorithm, global zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso using color information, global zzso using two-dimensional zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso are more robust against insignificant changes in the scene and perform more reliably as more a zzso knowledge about the scene is incorporated in the zzso zzso The inclusion of both zzso and geometric a zzso knowledge can result in a high level of correct zzso the cost of which is increased zzso zzso
