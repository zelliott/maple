zzso pedestrian detection systems zzso are currently a hot research topic in the field of intelligent zzso A zzso detects zzso in real time on moving zzso A practical zzso demands not only high detection accuracy but also high detection zzso However, most of the existing zzso approaches mainly seek for high detection zzso while the detection speed is not purposely zzso for practical zzso At the same time, the performance, particularly the speed, is primarily tuned based on experiments without theoretical zzso leading to a long training zzso This paper starts with measuring and zzso detection speed, and then a practical zzso pedestrian detection solution with high detection speed and training speed is zzso First, an extended zzso speed zzso named zzso zzso is proposed to measure the detection speed independently from zzso Then, an zzso zzso model with accuracy constraints is formulated based on a tree zzso ensemble, where the minimum zzso can guarantee the highest detection zzso Finally, the zzso problem is solved efficiently by using zzso fitting based on zzso basis function neural zzso In addition, the optimal solution is directly used to instruct zzso zzso thus, the training speed could be accelerated zzso zzso a rapid and accurate zzso detection technique is proposed for the zzso Experimental results on urban traffic videos show that the proposed method has a high detection speed with an acceptable detection rate and a zzso rate for onboard zzso moreover, the training procedure is also very zzso
