A study was performed to determine the zzso and zzso of the CT numbers of simulated lung zzso zzso with zzso CT zzso The zzso were simulated by zzso balls of three diameters zzso zzso and 16 zzso and two compositions zzso and 100 zzso zzso in zzso zzso All were scanned in a zzso container at the center of a zzso phantom and in air cavities within the same phantom using GE zzso CT zzso The zzso were also scanned within simulated lung regions in an zzso zzso section phantom that was zzso on both sides with zzso zzso zzso were compared for three scanning zzso protocol for the National Lung zzso Trial zzso the protocol for the Lung zzso Research zzso zzso study, and a high resolution zzso pitch, thin slice and small scan zzso higher dose zzso zzso zzso zzso were repeated three times with each protocol to assess zzso The CT numbers of the zzso in water were found to be nearly independent of zzso zzso However, the presence and the size of an air cavity surrounding a zzso had a significant effect zzso the CT number of a 50 zzso zzso was 64 zzso in water, 37 zzso in a zzso zzso diameter air zzso and 19 zzso in a zzso zzso diameter air zzso This zzso of CT number with size of air cavity may affect the results of the zzso study in which patients are scanned at both full inspiration and full zzso The CT numbers of the zzso and 16 zzso diameter zzso within the zzso phantom were highly zzso zzso standard zzso of 2 zzso or less) for all zzso On the other hand, both accuracy and zzso were significantly zzso for the zzso zzso diameter zzso especially for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso slice zzso zzso Use of thinner slice zzso zzso and slice zzso zzso zzso scans that can be reconstructed zzso from the zzso zzso CT projection data of the standard zzso protocol yield CT numbers for the zzso zzso diameter zzso that are more accurate and zzso than those of the standard zzso zzso In general, the CT numbers of the zzso were found to be lower at positions near the centers of the lungs and near the spine, which is probably due to increased beam zzso in those zzso Also, larger zzso were found to have higher CT numbers than smaller zzso consistent with results obtained on early single slice GE CT zzso Until manufacturers develop quantitative CT scanners with improved zzso beam zzso and scatter corrections, it is recommended that reference zzso be employed to more accurately assess the calcium contents of patient lung zzso in screening and tissue characterization studies and in eventual zzso detection and diagnosis zzso
