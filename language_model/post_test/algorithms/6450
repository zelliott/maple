zzso resonance diffusion zzso imaging zzso provides a powerful tool for mapping neural zzso in zzso However, zzso can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging zzso due to the constraints of the zzso zzso For example, zzso cannot resolve fibers zzso bending, or twisting within an individual zzso zzso fiber crossing can be resolved using zzso diffusion imaging, but zzso imaging requires large zzso field zzso and zzso zzso It is also possible to resolve zzso fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging zzso zzso but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion zzso it has been shown that the zzso signal can be reconstructed zzso using a zzso zzso inversion called the zzso zzso also known as the zzso zzso zzso The resulting imaging method, termed zzso imaging, can resolve multiple zzso fiber zzso and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as zzso or zzso The present paper reviews the theory of zzso imaging and describes a simple linear zzso zzso for the zzso reconstruction based on zzso zzso basis function zzso Open aspects of the zzso reconstruction zzso are zzso
