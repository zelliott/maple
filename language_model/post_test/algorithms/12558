zzso zzso coupled receptors zzso zzso specificity is very important for further understanding the functions of zzso A successful method in this area will benefit both basic research and drug discovery zzso Previously published methods rely on the zzso zzso prediction at training step, even at prediction zzso However, the zzso zzso predicted by even the best zzso is not of high zzso In this study, we developed a new method, zzso zzso transform based support zzso machine zzso to predict zzso specificity between zzso and zzso The primary zzso acid sequences are translated into zzso based on the principal zzso properties of the zzso acids and the data are transformed into a uniform zzso by applying zzso zzso zzso for zzso coupled zzso and zzso coupled zzso were trained and validated by zzso test and the results thus obtained are very zzso All zzso were also evaluated by the test zzso with good zzso Besides the high prediction zzso the most important feature of this method is that it does not require any zzso zzso prediction at either training or prediction step but only the primary sequences of zzso The results indicate that this relatively simple method is zzso Academic users can freely download the prediction program at zzso
