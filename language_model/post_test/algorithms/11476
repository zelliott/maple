zzso recognition of regulatory elements in promoters is an essential prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation at the level of zzso Composite regulatory elements represent a particular type of such zzso regulatory elements consisting of pairs of individual DNA zzso In contrast to the present approach, most available recognition techniques are based purely on statistical evaluation of the occurrence of single zzso Such methods are limited in application, since the accuracy of recognition is greatly dependent on the size and quality of the sequence zzso zzso that exploit available knowledge and have broad zzso are evidently zzso 

We developed a novel method to identify composite regulatory elements in promoters using a library of known zzso In depth investigation of zzso zzso in known composite elements allowed us to introduce a new characteristic measure and to improve the specificity compared with other zzso Tests on an established benchmark and real zzso data show that our method zzso other available methods based either on known examples or statistical zzso In addition to better recognition, a practical advantage of this method is first the ability to detect a high number of different types of composite zzso and second direct biological interpretation of the identified zzso The program is available at zzso and includes an option to extend the provided library by user supplied zzso 

The novel zzso for the identification of composite regulatory elements presented in this paper was proved to be superior to existing zzso Its application to tissue specific promoters identified several highly specific composite elements with relevance to their biological zzso This approach together with other methods will further advance the understanding of zzso regulation of zzso
