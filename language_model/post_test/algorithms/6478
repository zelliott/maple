The forward problem of electromagnetic source imaging has two zzso a zzso model to solve the related integral equations and a model of the head zzso This study is on the boundary element method zzso zzso for zzso solutions and realistic head zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso elements and the zzso integration technique increase the accuracy in the zzso Two new zzso are developed for the calculation of the transfer zzso to obtain the potential and magnetic field patterns using realistic head zzso The zzso incorporate the use of the isolated problem approach for increased accuracy in zzso If a personal computer is used for zzso each transfer zzso is calculated in zzso zzso After this zzso period, solutions for arbitrary source zzso can be obtained in milliseconds for a realistic head zzso A hybrid zzso that uses zzso zzso operations, region growing and zzso is used for zzso The zzso skull, zzso matter, white matter and eyes are segmented from the zzso magnetic resonance images and zzso for the corresponding surfaces are zzso A mesh generation zzso is developed for zzso the zzso tissue zzso such as zzso To obtain more accurate results zzso elements are used in the realistic zzso The zzso zzso zzso provides more accurate forward problem solutions and more efficient zzso Thus it can be the firm basis of the future inverse problem zzso
