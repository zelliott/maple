zzso zzso Active Sites with zzso is a simple zzso tool that uses geometry to characterize regions of buried volume in proteins and to identify positions likely to represent binding sites based upon the size, shape, and burial extent of these zzso Its utility as a zzso tool for binding site identification is tested by predicting known binding sites of proteins in the zzso using both zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso can serve as a front-end to fast zzso The main utility of zzso lies in the fact that it can analyze a zzso protein zzso 30 zzso in under 20 zzso which makes it suitable for interactive molecular zzso protein database analysis, and aggressive virtual screening zzso As a modeling zzso zzso zzso rapidly identifies favorable regions of the protein surface, zzso zzso zzso of zzso modulating binding in these regions, and zzso provides a means of directly visualizing buried volume, which is often zzso indirectly from zzso in a surface zzso zzso produces output in the form of standard zzso files, which are suitable for any modeling package, and provides script files to simplify zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is freely available to zzso
