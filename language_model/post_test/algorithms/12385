zzso of population zzso and individual zzso from genetic markers is an zzso part of a study in diverse situations, such as association mapping and evolutionary zzso zzso methods have been proposed for population zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso and widely used in zzso However, these zzso methods demand intensive zzso resources and may run into convergence problem in zzso zzso zzso Carlo based zzso zzso 

We have developed zzso an R package based on maximum likelihood method using zzso algorithm, for zzso of population zzso and individual zzso 

Compared with software based on zzso methods zzso zzso zzso has similar zzso but more efficient zzso and its supplemental documents are freely available at zzso
