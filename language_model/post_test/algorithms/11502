zzso structural analysis from electron zzso of biological zzso inevitably requires the synthesis of data from many parts of the same zzso and, ultimately, from multiple zzso Higher resolutions require the inclusion of progressively more data, and for the particles analyzed to be consistent to within ever more stringent zzso zzso in zzso between zzso or even within the field of one zzso arising from lens zzso or zzso limit the resolution of such zzso A quantitative assessment of this effect shows that its severity depends on the size of the particle under zzso for particles that are 100 zzso in diameter, for example, a zzso zzso in zzso restricts the resolution to approximately 5 zzso In this study, we derive and describe the properties of a family of zzso designed for zzso the zzso of particles from different zzso or from widely differing parts of the same zzso This approach is based on the assumption that all of the particles are of identical size: thus, it is zzso primarily to zzso zzso in which native dimensions are precisely zzso As applied to zzso virus zzso this procedure is accurate to within zzso provided that at least five randomly oriented particles are included in the zzso The zzso is stable in the presence of noise levels typical of those encountered in practice, and is readily adaptable to zzso zzso It may also be used to discriminate zzso of subtly different zzso
