Data zzso among health information exchange zzso systems is a major concern for zzso practitioners to enable zzso of zzso zzso zzso exists in these systems not only at the data level but also among different zzso zzso standards with which these are zzso The relationship between zzso organization data and different zzso standards is necessary to achieve the goal of data level zzso We propose a zzso clinical model zzso approach for the generation of customized zzso that creates the necessary linkage between zzso zzso standards concepts and clinical model concepts to ensure data zzso among zzso zzso 

We consider electronic health record zzso standards, zzso and zzso zzso instances transformation using zzso zzso concepts associated with zzso and zzso zzso help in transformation of instances among these zzso We investigated two zzso zzso data of 100 diabetic patients, including 50 each of type 1 and type 2, from a local hospital in Korea and zzso data of a single Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso were created for both scenarios, which provided the basis for zzso instances for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

For proof of concept, we present case studies of encounter information for type 2 diabetes zzso patients and monitoring of daily routine activities of an Alzheimer's disease zzso These reflect zzso customized zzso generation with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are generated based on the relationship of zzso concepts with zzso and zzso zzso 

The objective of this work is to achieve semantic data zzso among zzso zzso This would lead to effective zzso of resources and allow timely information exchange among zzso zzso
