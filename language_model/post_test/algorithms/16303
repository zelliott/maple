zzso zzso are currently used to determine which patients may be at prohibitive risk for surgical zzso valve replacement, and thus candidates for zzso zzso valve zzso zzso invasive surgical approaches have been successful in reducing morbidity and improving survival after zzso valve replacement, especially in zzso We documented outcomes after minimally invasive zzso valve replacement in high-risk zzso who may be considered candidates for zzso zzso valve zzso 

From 1996 to 2009, minimally invasive zzso valve replacement was performed in zzso consecutive zzso We used the modified European System for zzso zzso zzso zzso and Society of zzso Surgeons score to zzso patients and characterize all early and late zzso 

The mean age at operation was zzso zzso zzso years, and 111 patients zzso were zzso zzso percent zzso had previous cardiac zzso zzso mortality was zzso zzso The median modified European System for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso and Society of zzso Surgeons score zzso zzso range, zzso were not zzso of 30-day mortality in this cohort of patients zzso System for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Society of zzso Surgeons score zzso zzso Despite their poor zzso power, the Society of zzso Surgeons score and European System for zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated with each other zzso zzso zzso complications included stroke in 10 patients zzso pneumonia in 3 patients zzso zzso failure requiring dialysis in 2 patients zzso cardiac arrest in 2 patients zzso pulmonary embolism in 1 patient zzso and zzso in 1 patient zzso zzso was available for zzso patients zzso and extended up to 12 zzso Overall, long-term survival after minimally invasive zzso valve replacement at 1, 5, and 10 years was zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant difference in long-term survival compared with that of a US zzso and zzso population zzso mortality ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso hazards model indicated that increasing age zzso ratio, zzso zzso and severe chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso ratio, zzso zzso were significant zzso of zzso By using these factors, a clinical prediction model zzso was developed and demonstrated that low-risk patients zzso zzso prediction zzso had zzso zzso and zzso survival of zzso zzso and zzso whereas high-risk patients zzso zzso prediction zzso had zzso zzso and zzso survival of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Patients thought to be high-risk candidates for surgical zzso valve replacement have excellent outcomes after minimally invasive surgery with long-term survival that is no different than that of an zzso and zzso US zzso These data provide a benchmark against which outcomes of zzso zzso valve zzso could be zzso
