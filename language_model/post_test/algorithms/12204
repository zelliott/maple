An upward zzso soil remedial zzso technology was proposed to remove heavy metals from contaminated zzso Unlike conventional zzso treatment that uses zzso or zzso for horizontal migration of heavy metals, the zzso technology, applying vertical zzso electric fields, caused upward transportation of heavy metals to the top surface of the treated zzso The effects of current density, treatment zzso cell diameter, and different zzso chamber zzso zzso water or zzso M zzso zzso were zzso The removal efficiencies of heavy metals positively correlated to current density and treatment zzso Higher heavy metals removal efficiency was observed for the reactor cell with smaller zzso A substantial amount of heavy metals was accumulated in the nearest to zzso 2 zzso layer of zzso when distilled water was continuously supplied to the zzso zzso Heavy metals accumulated in this layer of zzso can be easily excavated and disposed zzso The main part of the removed heavy metals was dissolved in zzso chamber zzso and moved away with zzso chamber zzso when zzso M zzso acid was used, instead of distilled zzso Energy saving treatment by zzso technology with highest metal removal efficiencies was provided by two zzso zzso by application of zzso M zzso acid as zzso chamber zzso cell diameter of 100 zzso duration of 18 days, and constant zzso of zzso V zzso k zzso of zzso and zzso by application of zzso M zzso acid as zzso chamber zzso cell diameter of 100 zzso duration of 6 days, and constant current density of zzso zzso zzso k zzso of zzso
