By using the composite zzso with zzso of diversity, position conservation scoring function, and zzso secondary structures to express the information of zzso a support zzso machine zzso zzso for predicting zzso and zzso in the proteins is zzso The zzso and 320 zzso protein chains described by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2000, zzso are used for training and testing the zzso model of the zzso and zzso zzso The overall prediction accuracy and the Matthews correlation zzso in zzso zzso are zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso The overall prediction accuracy in zzso zzso is zzso for the zzso These results are significantly higher than the other zzso in the prediction of zzso and zzso using the same zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso protein chains described by Fuchs and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005, 59, zzso are used for training and testing the zzso model of the zzso and zzso and better results are zzso This zzso may be helpful to improve the performance of protein zzso zzso To ensure the ability of the zzso method to correctly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the receiver operating characteristic threshold independent measure zzso are zzso
