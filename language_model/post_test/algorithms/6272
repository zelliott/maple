zzso neural systems have been a subject of great interest in the last few years, due to their abilities to facilitate the exchange of information between symbolic and zzso zzso However, the models in the literature are not able to deal with structured organization of information, that is typically required by symbolic zzso In many application zzso the patterns are not only zzso but a fuzziness degree is attached to each zzso pattern zzso The purpose of this paper is to show how zzso neural networks, properly conceived for dealing with structured information, can represent zzso fuzzy zzso tree zzso Whereas available prior knowledge expressed in terms of fuzzy state transition rules are injected into a zzso network, unknown rules are supposed to be filled in by zzso zzso We also prove the stability of the zzso algorithm, extending previous results on the injection of fuzzy zzso dynamics in zzso zzso zzso
