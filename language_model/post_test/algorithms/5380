zzso shock is a leading cause of death in both civilian and battlefield zzso Currently available medical monitors provide measures of standard vital signs that are insensitive and zzso More important, zzso and other signs and symptoms of shock can appear when it may be too late to apply effective zzso zzso The resulting challenge is that early diagnosis is difficult because zzso shock is first recognized by zzso vital signs and zzso The purpose of these experiments was to test the hypothesis that state-of-the-art zzso techniques, when integrated with novel zzso monitoring technologies, could detect early indicators of blood volume loss and impending circulatory failure in conscious, healthy humans who experience reduced central blood zzso 

zzso were exposed to progressive reductions in central blood volume using lower body negative pressure as a model of zzso until the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso measured zzso signals were used for the development of zzso zzso zzso estimates were obtained by building models using signals from all but one subject and testing on that zzso This process was zzso each time using a different zzso 

The model was zzso accurate in predicting the estimated amount of reduced central blood volume, and the correlation between predicted and actual lower body negative pressure level for zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso modeling can accurately identify reduced central blood volume and predict impending zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Such a capability can provide decision support for earlier zzso
