In this paper we present a zzso zzso simulation environment that zzso zzso for zzso zzso on the cellular level and zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso provides an zzso of the zzso Cellular zzso Model or zzso (also known as the zzso or zzso zzso and a zzso Carlo method based on the zzso zzso for system zzso The integration of zzso for cellular systems with zzso for zzso systems enables us to develop a zzso mathematical model and to study the evolution of cell zzso due to the dynamics inside of the cells, capturing aspects of cell zzso and interaction that is not possible using zzso zzso We then apply this zzso zzso technique to a model of cancer growth and invasion, based on a previously published model of zzso et zzso zzso where individual cell zzso is driven by a molecular network describing the dynamics of zzso and zzso In this model, which we refer to as the zzso model, an alternative zzso zzso technique was used, zzso a zzso zzso In many respects, the zzso or zzso methodology and the approach of the zzso model have the same overall goal, that is to mimic zzso and interactions of biological zzso Although the mathematical foundations and zzso zzso of the two approaches are very different, the results of the presented simulations are compatible with each other, suggesting that by using zzso approaches we can formulate a natural way of describing complex zzso zzso zzso The ability to easily reproduce results of one zzso approach using an alternative approach is also essential from a model zzso standpoint and also helps to identify any zzso zzso specific to a given zzso zzso
