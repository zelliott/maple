A new theoretical approach was used to zzso and calculate the zzso peak efficiency of the zzso zzso detectors based on the direct statistical method proposed by zzso and Abbas for zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the source zzso the zzso by the source container and the detector housing materials were considered in the mathematical zzso zzso were compared with those measured by a zzso zzso zzso detector with resolution zzso at zzso zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso radioactive zzso sources covering the energy range from 121 to zzso zzso were zzso In comparison, the calculated and the measured zzso peak efficiency values were in good zzso
