With only 14 zzso acid zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso is the smallest naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso It consists of two zzso fragments (with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso In our previous paper, we showed that the removal of the zzso bridge produced zzso lower zzso Here, we present the total zzso analysis of the zzso zzso analog by means of zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with theoretical zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso It was zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso studies were performed in zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso studied were calculated by the following three zzso distance geometry zzso molecular dynamics zzso and determination of the statistical weights of zzso The first two zzso use a zzso force field, whereas the last uses an zzso force zzso Our calculations resulted in three sets of zzso with 7, 9 and 6 representatives, zzso All our results were compared with published zzso It was found that the zzso has an zzso zzso Despite its zzso flexibility, the binding loop zzso zzso displayed geometry similar to the corresponding fragments of the other zzso zzso and to the inhibitor zzso Furthermore, the zzso bond between the zzso and zzso zzso adopts zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso
