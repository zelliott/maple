We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso zzso for gene zzso in zzso Analysis Workshop zzso 12 isolate zzso In zzso association is analyzed by searching all zzso zzso zzso Data mining zzso are zzso to make the search zzso The strength of the zzso associations is measured by a linear model, into which a zzso set of zzso is zzso zzso patterns of association are used for predicting the disease gene zzso zzso scans of zzso genes for affection status as well as for the quantitative traits zzso were zzso First analyses were made with small sample sizes, zzso trios per zzso which is compared with a pilot study of a larger complex zzso zzso zzso the analysis was repeated with approximately 600 cases and 600 controls per trait to give higher power to the zzso With small sample sizes, only the zzso genes having the strongest effects on the traits could be zzso The larger sample size gave very good zzso all zzso zzso except one, could be correctly zzso First experiments on candidate genes suggested that zzso is zzso even to fine mapping of zzso in DNA zzso
