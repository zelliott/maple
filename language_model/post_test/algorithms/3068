The zzso zzso is a unique marker of zzso degradation that is formed by the sequential action of 3 zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso First, zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso which zzso and serve as a template for factor zzso and zzso zzso Second, zzso activates plasma factor zzso bound to zzso zzso to produce the active zzso factor zzso Factor zzso zzso the formation of zzso bonds between zzso in the zzso zzso Finally, zzso degrades the zzso zzso to release zzso degradation products and expose the zzso zzso zzso zzso can exist on zzso degradation products derived from soluble zzso before its incorporation into a zzso zzso or after the zzso zzso has been zzso by zzso The clinical utility of zzso measurement has been established in some scenarios, most notably for the exclusion of zzso This article consists of 2 zzso in the first, the dynamics of zzso zzso formation is discussed and an overview of commercially available zzso zzso is zzso The second section reviews available evidence for the clinical zzso of zzso zzso measurement in zzso as well as emerging areas of zzso zzso as a marker of zzso zzso in other clinical zzso
