The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an unusual parallel supercomputer that promises ease of use and high zzso We describe our experience on the zzso with a molecular dynamics code, zzso that we are using to simulate the zzso of DNA through a zzso in a silicon based zzso zzso Our zzso is constructed using standard zzso technology and consists of a zzso surrounded by Field Effect zzso zzso We propose to use the zzso to sense variations in charge as a DNA zzso zzso through the pore and thus differentiate between the four building block zzso of zzso We were able to port zzso a serial C code, to the zzso with only a modest effort and with good zzso Our zzso process needed neither a zzso support platform nor attention to the intimate details of parallel programming and zzso communication, as would have been the case with more conventional zzso
