The purpose was to assess the clinical utility of diagnostic tests for identifying zzso within a solitary pulmonary zzso zzso and to create a zzso or zzso table using clinical data and zzso zzso zzso test results to estimate zzso probability of zzso Studies that examined zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the evaluation of zzso Two zzso independently zzso data and assessed study zzso zzso and overall positive likelihood ratios zzso for each diagnostic test confirming a diagnosis of zzso and negative zzso for each diagnostic test excluding a diagnosis of zzso within an zzso were zzso zzso of 242 articles were zzso Positive zzso for diagnostic tests were: CT zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were: CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in performance for all tests were zzso therefore, the zzso may confidently use any of the four tests presented in further evaluating an zzso Given the low cost and prevalence of the technology, zzso appears to be the leading choice for additional testing in zzso zzso
