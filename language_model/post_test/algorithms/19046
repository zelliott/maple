We have developed a new extended replica exchange method to study thermodynamics of a system in the presence of external zzso Our idea is based on the exchange between different force zzso to accelerate the equilibrium zzso This new approach was applied to obtain the zzso phase zzso and other zzso quantities of the zzso zzso Using the zzso model and the zzso zzso we have shown that the zzso pathways of single zzso depend on which zzso is zzso If the N end is fixed then the folding pathways are different compared to the case when both zzso are free, but fixing the C terminal does not change zzso Surprisingly, we have found that the zzso terminal does not affect the pathways of individual secondary structures of zzso zzso indicating the important role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, in which one end of a protein is kept zzso can probe the zzso pathways of a single zzso zzso if one uses either the zzso or a single domain with the C zzso zzso However, it is shown that zzso one end does not affect zzso pathways of the zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso is always capable to predict folding sequencing of this zzso We have obtained the reasonable estimate for unfolding barrier of zzso using the microscopic theory for the dependence of unfolding time on the external zzso The linkage between zzso zzso and the C terminal of zzso is found to have the dramatic effect on the location of the transition state along the zzso distance reaction zzso but the zzso construction leaves the transition state almost zzso We have found that the maximum force in the zzso profile from constant zzso force pulling simulations depends on temperature zzso However, for some narrow temperature zzso this dependence becomes zzso as have been observed in recent zzso
