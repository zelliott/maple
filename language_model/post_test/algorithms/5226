The purpose of this study was to produce zzso zzso made from zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and containing the zzso drug zzso suitable for pulmonary zzso For the first time, this drug was tested in ex zzso experiments performed in mast cells, in order to investigate the potential of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were combined to form zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso loaded with zzso were between 162 and 217 zzso in size, and those prepared with zzso were 152 zzso The zzso potential of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and in selected zzso both types of zzso were associated with a high degree of efficiency, which was approximately zzso The zzso were stable in zzso zzso saline zzso pH zzso for at least zzso and released zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso within zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that fluorescent zzso zzso zzso were effectively zzso by rat mast zzso zzso zzso experiments aimed at evaluating the capacity of zzso to prevent zzso release in rat mast cells indicated that the free or zzso drug exhibited the same zzso zzso
