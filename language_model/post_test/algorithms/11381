zzso wireless transmission has attracted a lot of interest due to its wider available bandwidth zzso zzso zzso In this article, we propose a zzso zzso frequency division zzso radio over fiber zzso system via two zzso zzso zzso at center frequency of 103 zzso We discuss maximum bandwidth of different zzso formats under forward error correction zzso threshold zzso zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso zzso signals is achieved over zzso fiber and zzso wireless zzso To overcome the penalty from uneven frequency response, zzso zzso is applied to discuss data rate and spectral efficiency with signal bandwidth from 5 to 10 zzso With zzso zzso zzso data rate and zzso spectral efficiency was zzso To achieve zzso data rate, the required bandwidth of zzso signal with zzso is 2 zzso less than that without zzso
