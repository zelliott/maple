zzso behavior relies on the zzso ability to zzso sensory flow to motor programs whenever demanded by a changed behavioral zzso To investigate the circuit basis of such flexible behavior, we have developed a zzso based decision-making network model of zzso zzso for arbitrary zzso zzso The model zzso reproduces behavioral and prefrontal zzso data from an experiment in which monkeys learn zzso associations that are reversed unpredictably from time to zzso We show that when synaptic modifications occur on multiple zzso the model behavior becomes flexible only when zzso slow components of learning usually dominate the decision zzso However, if behavioral contexts change frequently enough, fast components of plasticity take over, and the behavior exhibits a quick zzso zzso This model prediction is confirmed by monkey zzso zzso our work reveals a scenario for conditional zzso learning that is distinct from instant switching between sets of well-established zzso zzso
