For the small radiation field sizes used in zzso zzso lateral electronic zzso and steep dose zzso exist in a large portion of these fields, requiring the use of high-resolution measurement zzso These relatively large areas of electronic zzso make accurate zzso as well as dose calculation more difficult, and this is exacerbated in regions of tissue zzso zzso zzso was considered insignificant in the brain where zzso zzso was first zzso However, as this technique is expanded to the head and neck and other body sites, dose calculations need to account for dose zzso in and beyond air zzso zzso and zzso In a previous study we have evaluated zzso zzso film zzso zzso Products, Wayne, zzso for zzso and characterization of the zzso radiation beams and found that it was comparable to other common detectors used for small zzso beams in solid water equivalent zzso In the present work zzso film is used to measure dose in zzso slab zzso containing lung and bone equivalent materials for the 6 zzso radiation beams of diameter zzso to 40 zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are compared to calculations done with both the clinically zzso zzso zzso as well as the newly developed zzso Carlo based zzso available on the zzso treatment planning zzso Within the low density material both the zzso and zzso Carlo calculations correctly model the decrease in dose produced by a loss of electronic zzso whereas the zzso zzso incorrectly predicts an enhancement of dose in this zzso Beyond the low density material an enhancement of dose is correctly calculated by both zzso Within the high density bone zzso the zzso film zzso represent dose to unit density tissue in bone and agree with the zzso Carlo results when corrected to dose to unit density tissue in zzso We conclude that zzso film is an appropriate dosimeter for measuring dose in zzso materials and these zzso agree with zzso Carlo calculations of dose as implemented in the zzso treatment planning zzso
