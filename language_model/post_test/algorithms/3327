zzso of zzso zzso and misuse are paramount and lead to zzso morbidity and zzso Although evidence-based practice is zzso the widespread zzso of this kind of practice remains a zzso This is also the case for evidence-based practice related to the prevention of pressure ulcers, which varies widely in process and outcome in Belgian hospital zzso One major obstacle to bridging this zzso gap is data zzso We propose using large-scale hospital administrative data combined with the latest evidence-based methods as part of the solution to this zzso 

To test our proposal, we applied this approach to pressure zzso zzso using an administrative zzso with regard to zzso patients in 22 Belgian hospitals as a sample of nationally available zzso zzso include a systematic review approach, evidence zzso recommendations zzso zzso construction, programming of the rule set and application on the zzso 

We found that Belgian hospitals frequently failed to provide appropriate prevention zzso zzso levels of zzso up to zzso in pressure zzso prevention education and zzso in the use of dynamic systems zzso were zzso Figures for overuse were mostly not zzso zzso couldn't be zzso 

These results demonstrate that this approach can indeed be successfully used to bridge the zzso gap in medical practice, by implementing an innovative method to assess zzso and overuse in hospital zzso The zzso use of administrative data and clinical applications should be zzso in other patient groups, other zzso and other zzso
