Computer decision support systems are potentially effective methods for adjusting insulin, but current models do not take into account simultaneous changes of more than one zzso We describe the development of the zzso zzso zzso System zzso zzso zzso Systems, zzso zzso for predicting zzso outcome in response to concurrent dose adjustments in oral zzso agents and zzso 

zzso data from a patient cohort with type 2 diabetes who had simultaneous changes in insulin and zzso were zzso zzso markers zzso zzso random zzso or zzso zzso expected at the visit subsequent to dose changes were calculated using two zzso the previously reported zzso zzso System zzso mark, zzso zzso zzso which accounts for changes in only one agent, and the zzso zzso results from both systems were correlated with levels actually zzso 

We analyzed 32 patients with 40 paired zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 paired zzso the correlation between expected and observed values was zzso when using the zzso but zzso when using the zzso For random zzso zzso zzso 16 paired zzso the correlation between expected and observed levels was zzso for the zzso but zzso for the zzso With zzso zzso as the marker zzso zzso 16 paired zzso the correlation was zzso when using the zzso but zzso with the zzso 

The zzso allows better prediction of zzso outcome in circumstances where both insulin and an oral zzso drug are changed zzso Application of the zzso to other clinical scenarios, such as simultaneous adjustment of insulin and zzso zzso requires further zzso
