With the advent of zzso sequencing technology, zzso DNA zzso profiling methods have emerged as the most promising approaches due to their zzso resolution and zzso zzso However, statistical analysis methods for analyzing this type of zzso data are not well zzso Although the most widely used zzso zzso method is simple and zzso it is not statistically adequate in dealing with the various sources of noise in zzso zzso Furthermore, it is not biologically satisfactory in applications that require zzso zzso status zzso 

In this article, we use a mixture of zzso model to characterize zzso data, and based on the model, we propose to use a zzso zzso called the zzso status calling zzso zzso to make zzso zzso status zzso The zzso procedure is optimal in terms of maximizing the overall correct allocation rate, and the false discovery rate zzso and false zzso rate zzso of zzso can be zzso To control zzso at any given level, we further develop an zzso zzso zzso which combines a local zzso zzso procedure with the zzso zzso Both simulation study and real data application are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed zzso It is shown in our simulation study that the estimates of zzso and zzso of the zzso procedure are zzso zzso study also demonstrates that the zzso zzso procedure is valid in controlling zzso at a zzso level and is more powerful than the individual zzso testing zzso In the real data application, the zzso procedure exhibits an estimated zzso of zzso and an estimated zzso of zzso The overall correct allocation rate is zzso These results suggest the effectiveness of our proposed zzso 

The proposed procedures are implemented in R and are available at zzso
