The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were generated by a zzso program that works in conjunction with zzso The shapes of the rings are analyzed in terms of previous work by Dale and others, and in terms of zzso of zzso zzso angle zzso and zzso angle zzso A new shape element called the zzso has been discovered, and it seems to be increasingly important with zzso and larger zzso Previously suggested relationships between ring size and energy distribution were observed, and a geometrical explanation is provided for the relative zzso of stable zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
