zzso variation for environmental sensitivity indicates that animals are genetically different in their response to environmental zzso Environmental factors are either identifiable zzso zzso and called zzso or unknown and called zzso The objectives of this study were to develop a statistical method to estimate genetic parameters for zzso and zzso sensitivities zzso to investigate bias and precision of resulting estimates of genetic parameters and to develop and evaluate use of zzso information criterion using zzso to select the best fitting zzso 

We assumed that genetic variation in zzso and zzso sensitivities is expressed as genetic zzso in the slope of a linear reaction norm and environmental zzso zzso A reaction norm model to estimate genetic zzso for zzso sensitivity was combined with a structural model for residual zzso to estimate genetic zzso for zzso sensitivity using a double zzso generalized linear model in zzso zzso information criterion was constructed as model selection criterion using zzso zzso zzso of zzso with large zzso offspring groups were simulated to investigate bias and precision of estimated genetic zzso 

zzso with 100 zzso each with at least 100 zzso are required to have standard zzso of estimated zzso lower than 50% of the true zzso When the number of offspring increased, standard zzso of estimates across replicates decreased zzso especially for genetic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Standard zzso of estimated genetic correlations across replicates were quite large (between zzso and zzso especially when zzso had few zzso zzso no bias was observed for estimates of any of the zzso Using zzso information criterion the true genetic model was selected as the best statistical model in at least zzso of 100 replicates when the number of offspring per zzso was zzso Application of the model to zzso milk yield in dairy cattle showed that genetic zzso for zzso and zzso sensitivities zzso 

The zzso and model selection criterion presented here can contribute to better understand genetic control of zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso should have at least 100 zzso each with 100 zzso
