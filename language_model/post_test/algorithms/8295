zzso association studies have been widely used in search for genetic zzso for complex traits in recent zzso Yet, fiscal constraints still prohibit many zzso research projects from recruiting a large number of individuals for zzso to reach a desired level of statistical zzso zzso in this article, we describe a novel zzso pair sampling strategy for zzso in zzso association zzso With the use of zzso scores (and zzso zzso probabilities if available), the genetic effect of a zzso additive trait locus can be properly zzso within the zzso zzso components framework proposed by zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pairs can be zzso by use of zzso zzso The performance of our method was investigated using zzso The power of our approach was shown to be higher when compared with other zzso selection zzso An zzso implementing all the selection approaches (including the traditional zzso ones) used in the simulation is available at zzso zzso
