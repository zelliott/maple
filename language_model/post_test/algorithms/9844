New zzso zzso is proposed to find zzso functions which are the zzso of expansion of the zzso free energy of zzso zzso zzso whose zzso comprise an arbitrary number of types of side zzso This zzso zzso no restriction on length zzso of side chains in zzso zzso as well as on distribution of distances between two successive zzso points along the zzso By way of example, with this zzso the expressions for the second, third, and fourth order contributions into the free energy have been zzso The obtained results can be used for construction of the phase zzso of zzso zzso zzso
