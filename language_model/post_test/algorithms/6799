zzso analysis zzso based on singular value decomposition zzso has been widely accepted for zzso of cerebral blood flow zzso using dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso When using this method, the elements in the diagonal zzso obtained by zzso are set to zero when they are smaller than the threshold value given zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of the threshold value on the accuracy of the zzso values obtained by this method using computer zzso We also investigated the threshold value giving the zzso closest to the assumed value zzso threshold zzso under various zzso The zzso values obtained by this method largely depended on the threshold zzso Both the mean and the standard zzso of the estimated zzso values decreased with increasing threshold zzso The optimal threshold value decreased with increasing zzso ratio and zzso and increased with increasing cerebral blood zzso Although delay and zzso in the zzso input function also affected the relationship between the estimated zzso and threshold values, the optimal threshold value tended to be nearly zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that the threshold value should be carefully considered when zzso zzso in terms of absolute values using zzso for zzso based on zzso We believe that this study will be helpful in selecting the threshold value in zzso
