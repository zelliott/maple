Approximate methods for zzso zzso and synonymous substitution rates zzso and zzso among zzso sequences have adopted different zzso zzso zzso In the past two decades, several methods have been proposed but they have not considered unequal transitional zzso (between the two zzso A and G, or the two zzso T and zzso that become apparent when sequences data to be compared are vast and significantly zzso 

We propose a new method zzso a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso for evolutionary analysis of zzso sequences in zzso zzso adopts the zzso Model that considers the difference among rates of transitional and zzso zzso as well as factors in zzso frequency zzso We evaluate the performance of zzso by comparing to other methods, especially to zzso and to show that zzso has minimal zzso when parameters vary within normal ranges defined by empirical zzso 

Our comparative results zzso from consistency analysis, computer simulations and authentic zzso indicate that ignoring unequal transitional rates may lead to serious biases and that zzso performs well in most of the tested zzso These results also suggest that acquisitions of reliable synonymous and zzso substitution rates primarily depend on less biased estimates of zzso rate zzso
