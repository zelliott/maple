To investigate the feasibility of real time cancer tissue diagnosis zzso based on in zzso tissue compliance zzso obtained by a recently developed zzso smart zzso 

Cancer tissue is stiffer than its normal zzso Modern forms of remote surgery such as zzso and robotic surgical techniques diminish direct assessment of this important tissue zzso In zzso human tissue compliance of the normal and cancer gastrointestinal tissue is zzso A Clinical Real Time zzso Compliance zzso System zzso with a zzso power comparable to the human hand and zzso in routine surgical practice has been recently zzso 

The zzso is employed in the operating theater to collect data from 50 patients undergoing zzso surgical interventions zzso men, 10 women, aged between 32 and 89 zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso This includes 10 zzso and 27 gastric cancer zzso A total of zzso compliance zzso of normal and zzso in zzso gastrointestinal zzso were zzso The data were used to zzso the zzso to predict zzso tissue in a further 12 patients (3 cancer esophagus and 9 cancer zzso involving 175 zzso 

The system demonstrated a high prediction power to diagnose cancer tissue in real time during routine surgical procedures zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso An in zzso human tissue compliance data bank of the gastrointestinal tract was zzso 

Real time cancer diagnosis based on in zzso tissue compliance zzso is zzso The reported data open new avenues in cancer zzso surgical zzso and development of more realistic surgical zzso
