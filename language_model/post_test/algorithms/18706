zzso zzso zzso is a recent zzso method of investigation of internal zzso structures that provides direct observation of zzso structures in zzso zzso Indeed, breast cancer zzso from the zzso zzso and develops first in zzso zzso Our research aims at developing an zzso scanner zzso zzso that will allow three-dimensional measurement of the field zzso by the zzso The present reconstruction procedure is an alternative solution to the standard zzso zzso zzso technique based on the Born approximation zzso scattering zzso The latter implicitly assumes that the sound speed is zzso constant within the zzso This unrealistic a zzso is inconsistent with our zzso media characterization purpose, and leads both to geometrical distortion in the reconstruction and to poor focusing of the zzso waves zzso contrast zzso However, the zzso technique retains a zzso advantage: zzso it does not make any other assumption concerning the distribution of mechanical parameters apart from low zzso zzso it shows great zzso a high resolving power, and is easy to zzso Thus, in order to account for strong zzso zzso we integrate zzso compensation of the scattered signals acquired into the scattering zzso zzso The adjustment relies on a time of flight zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso tests based on finite difference time domain simulations of data scattered by a random zzso phantom are zzso
