zzso zzso the branch of calculus dealing with derivatives of zzso order zzso the zzso allows the zzso of fractional differential equations zzso which have recently been applied to zzso zzso for zzso zzso In this work we extend that theory to zzso zzso Unlike systems defined by a single ordinary differential equation zzso considering fractional zzso models is not as simple as changing the order of the ordinary derivatives of the zzso side of the zzso to fractional zzso The latter may produce inconsistent systems which violate mass zzso We present a rationale for zzso of zzso which produces consistent systems and allows processes of different fractional orders in the same zzso We also apply a method of solving such systems based on a zzso inverse zzso transform algorithm, which we demonstrate that is consistent with zzso solutions when these are zzso As examples of our approach, we consider two cases of a basic zzso zzso model with a single IV dose and multiple oral zzso where the transfer from the peripheral to the central compartment is of fractional order zzso accounting for anomalous zzso and deep tissue zzso while all other processes are of the usual order zzso zzso with the studied systems are performed using the zzso inverse zzso transform zzso It is shown that the presence of a transfer rate of fractional order produces a zzso terminal phase, while multiple dose and constant infusion systems never reach steady state and drug zzso carries on zzso The IV fractional system is also fitted to zzso data and zzso values are zzso In conclusion, our approach allows the zzso of systems of zzso mixing different fractional orders, in a consistent manner and also provides a method for the zzso solution of these zzso
