The prediction of zzso units zzso which are similar to zzso is an important problem that has been tackled using many different zzso The availability of complete microbial zzso has made zzso zzso predictions zzso zzso databases zzso add zzso and other organizational zzso protein zzso information to the zzso zzso and are able to capture zzso organization zzso These characteristics of zzso make them a suitable framework for the development and zzso of zzso zzso 

We implemented a zzso predictor that uses only zzso distance and functional zzso of genes to predict zzso zzso and applied it to zzso our zzso of zzso zzso To this original zzso we added information on zzso zzso protein complexes and zzso all readily available in zzso in order to generate an enhanced zzso The enhanced predictor correctly predicted zzso of the known zzso zzso zzso of the known zzso a moderate improvement over the original zzso performance zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso correctly zzso demonstrating that the extra information available in the zzso does indeed improve prediction zzso Performance of this zzso predictor on a zzso other than that of zzso was tested on zzso our zzso generated zzso for zzso zzso for which a set of 100 known zzso is zzso zzso accuracy decreased substantially zzso of the known zzso correctly zzso This was due in part to missing information in zzso which prevented full use of the zzso zzso The zzso predictor has been implemented as part of our zzso zzso software suite, and can be used to populate a zzso with predicted zzso 

The zzso predictor is included in version zzso of the zzso zzso software zzso zzso zzso zzso is available free of charge to academic institutions and for a fee to commercial zzso It runs on Sun Solaris 8, Linux and zzso zzso predicted on the zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso are available in our zzso and zzso databases, available at the zzso web site zzso To obtain version zzso of zzso zzso follow the directions in our web site, zzso
