zzso of tissue can be accurately estimated from zzso ultrasound data using a zzso zzso cross correlation zzso zzso This zzso however, is very zzso zzso A major time reduction can be achieved by zzso the numerous zzso of zzso In this paper, two approaches for zzso have been zzso the zzso interface on a zzso system and zzso zzso Device Architecture zzso on a graphics processing unit zzso The performance of the zzso and zzso approaches were compared with a conventional zzso zzso of zzso The zzso approach with 8 threads achieved a maximum zzso factor of 132 on the computing of zzso whereas the zzso approach on an Nvidia zzso zzso achieved a maximum zzso factor of zzso Neither zzso approach resulted in a significant loss in image quality of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using the zzso therefore, significantly reduces the zzso time and increases the frame rate for motion zzso
