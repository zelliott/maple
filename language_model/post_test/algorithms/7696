zzso markers have been widely used to predict the cognitive functions relevant to the progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso Most previous studies identify the imaging markers without considering the brain structural correlations between zzso zzso However, many zzso markers zzso and work together to reveal the cognitive functions, such that these relevant markers should be selected together as the zzso zzso To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel network constrained feature selection zzso model to identify the zzso markers guided by the structural brain network, which is constructed by the sparse representation method such that the zzso between zzso features are zzso into zzso Our new methods are evaluated by the zzso and zzso data from zzso and zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso In all cognitive function prediction tasks, our new zzso method zzso other state-of-the-art zzso zzso Meanwhile, we show that the new method can select the correlated imaging zzso which are ignored by the competing zzso
