zzso of the exposure of zzso infants and children to zzso is likely to be more successful using zzso based zzso models than simplistic zzso zzso particularly in younger zzso However, such models require comprehensive information on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso data that are not available from single zzso The zzso software zzso zzso zzso zzso and pathological information on adults with in zzso data on human drug metabolism and transport to predict population zzso of drug clearance zzso and the extent of zzso zzso zzso The zzso have now been extended to predict clearance and its zzso in zzso populations by incorporating information on zzso physiology and the zzso of specific zzso zzso 

zzso of the clearance zzso and zzso of 11 drugs zzso zzso and zzso caffeine, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predicted for 2,000 virtual subjects zzso to 18 zzso In zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso rate of metabolism zzso and zzso constant zzso and in zzso clearance data were obtained from the zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso of predicted median clearance values were within zzso of the observed zzso zzso results for zzso children and adolescents were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso was within zzso of the observed values in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cases, zzso The accuracy of the zzso based model incorporated in the zzso software was superior to that of simple zzso especially in children zzso years zzso 

The in zzso prediction of zzso zzso in zzso patients is not intended to replace clinical zzso However, it provides a valuable aid to decision-making with regard to first-time dosing in children and study zzso The clinical study then becomes zzso rather than zzso
