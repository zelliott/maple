In November 2005, institution of a zzso burn resuscitation zzso requested the documentation of the initial 24-hour resuscitation of severely burned military casualties on a burn flow sheet to provide continuity of zzso The guidelines instruct the providers to calculate predicted 24-hour fluid requirements and initial fluid rate based on the American zzso Association Consensus recommendation of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % total body surface area zzso to 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the estimated fluid volumes zzso either by the zzso Brooke or the zzso formulas, and actual volumes zzso 

From November 2005 to December 2008, 105 patients were globally evacuated with zzso zzso zzso of whom 73 had burn flow sheets zzso Of these, 58 had completed burn flow zzso Total zzso administered in the first 24-hour period for each patient were zzso zzso reviews were performed to extract demographic and clinical outcomes zzso 

Of the 58, the modified Brooke formula was used in 31 patients zzso Brooke zzso to estimate 24-hour fluid requirements and the zzso formula was used in 21 zzso zzso In six, 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used and were excluded from zzso No significant difference was detected between the two groups for age, zzso burned, inhalation injury, or zzso zzso zzso zzso 24-hour resuscitation in the modified Brooke group was significantly lower than in the zzso group zzso L zzso zzso L zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A greater percentage of patients exceeded the Ivy index zzso zzso in the zzso group compared with the modified Brooke group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso On average, those who had 24-hour fluid needs estimated by the modified Brooke formula received a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso group received a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resuscitation zzso zzso zzso No differences in measured outcomes were detected between the two zzso On zzso zzso regression, exceeding the Ivy index was an independent predictor of death zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In severely burned military casualties undergoing initial burn zzso the modified Brooke formula resulted in significantly less 24-hour volumes without resulting in higher morbidity or zzso
