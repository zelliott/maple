This zzso aims at unifying and zzso the zzso for detecting all types of documented drug interactions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions zzso zzso from patient profile information and zzso test interactions in real-time prescribing zzso zzso the system should conform to the following criteria: zzso data zzso zzso software zzso zzso knowledge zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resource zzso We propose a robust zzso zzso Language zzso zzso to detect drug interactions and drug zzso according to such zzso We believe that this is the first public domain zzso in zzso that could be easily implemented into most zzso prescribing software which support zzso zzso The zzso comprises two major zzso zzso and zzso The former expands all information in the prescription with their zzso groups, or zzso The latter extracts the documented interactions by zzso zzso with two independent copies of the expanded prescription list zzso zzso study for speed performance indicates that this zzso is well zzso for the speed of zzso does not grow faster than the growth in prescription zzso
