zzso zzso zzso increased cardiovascular disease zzso zzso however, the variation in risk and how treatment and control rates may differ according to extent of risk needs zzso We examined zzso risk distribution and treatment and control patterns according to risk zzso 

We estimated 10-year zzso global risk in zzso zzso persons aged zzso years from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the proportion of subjects in low zzso intermediate zzso and high zzso risk groups, or with pre-existing zzso or who otherwise had high zzso risk according to European Society of zzso zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso stage 3 zzso or 3 additional zzso risk zzso We also examined zzso treatment and control rates by risk zzso 

From zzso risk assessment, zzso of subjects were low risk, zzso intermediate risk, zzso high risk, and zzso had zzso An additional zzso of low and 51% of intermediate risk subjects were at high or very high risk based on European criteria, for a total of zzso classified high risk or with zzso by either zzso Treatment rates across zzso risk groups ranged from 58 to zzso zzso control rates were over zzso for lower risk zzso but under 50% for higher risk zzso 

There is a wide variation in zzso risk in persons with zzso with control rates still zzso in higher risk zzso Future guidelines should consider risk zzso combining shorter and longer-term risk assessment to best identify those who have the greatest zzso zzso
