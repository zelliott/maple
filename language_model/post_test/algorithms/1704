zzso nerve zzso is zzso related to insulin resistance as both a cause and a zzso zzso heart rate zzso reflects sympathetic nerve zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in patients with clinically manifest vascular zzso 

Data were used from the second manifestations of zzso disease zzso zzso a prospective cohort study of patients with clinically manifest vascular diseases zzso 

zzso was obtained using an zzso Patients were followed up for incident type 2 diabetes zzso during a median period of zzso zzso range zzso zzso The relation between zzso and incident zzso was estimated by Cox zzso hazard zzso As age was an effect modifier zzso analyses were zzso for zzso 

Patients in zzso 4 zzso of zzso had a zzso increased risk of zzso compared with those in zzso zzso hazard ratios zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for age, zzso smoking, estimated zzso zzso rate, zzso blood pressure, location of vascular disease, and zzso zzso Every 10 beats per minute zzso increase in zzso increased the risk for zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the total zzso This risk was particularly high in subjects aged zzso years zzso 10 zzso HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso and was independent of the location of vascular disease and zzso zzso 

Increased zzso an indicator of sympathetic nerve activity, is associated with an increased risk for zzso in patients with manifest vascular diseases, particularly in middle-aged zzso
