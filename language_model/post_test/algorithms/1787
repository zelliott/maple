Based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso an inverse approach of attaining accurate mapping of both transmit and receive sensitivity of zzso coils is zzso This paper extends our previous study of inverse methods of zzso mapping at low fields, to allow accurate mapping of zzso magnetic fields zzso for zzso zzso zzso receive sensitivity mapping is essential to image domain parallel imaging methods, such as sensitivity zzso zzso to reconstruct high quality zzso zzso transmit sensitivity mapping will facilitate zzso and parallel transmission techniques that directly address the zzso zzso issue, arguably the most challenging issue of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The inverse zzso approach proposed zzso is based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso It fits an experimental image to the zzso calculated signal intensity by zzso zzso the zzso geometry to better resemble the zzso zzso transmit and receive sensitivities are derived as intermediate results of the zzso zzso The method is validated by imaging studies using homogeneous saline phantom at zzso A simulation study at zzso demonstrates that the proposed method is able to obtain zzso mapping with errors an order of magnitude less than that of the conventional zzso The more accurate zzso mapping and simultaneously obtained transmit sensitivity mapping could enable zzso and zzso image zzso It is hoped that by providing an approach to the accurate mapping of both transmit and receive sensitivity, the proposed method will facilitate a range of applications in zzso zzso and parallel zzso
