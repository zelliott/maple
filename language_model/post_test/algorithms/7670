Many zzso imaging studies have zzso being widely conducted to use diffusion zzso imaging zzso to better understand white matter maturation in normal controls and diseased zzso There is an urgent demand for the development of statistical methods for analyzing diffusion properties along major fiber tracts obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzing zzso diffusion properties and zzso from zzso studies raises several major challenges including zzso zzso functional response data, zzso complex zzso correlation structure, and zzso complex spatial zzso To address these challenges, this article is to develop a zzso functional analysis framework zzso to delineate the dynamic changes of diffusion properties along major fiber tracts and their association with a set of zzso of interest zzso age and group zzso and the structure of the zzso of these white matter tract properties in various zzso zzso Our zzso consists of a functional mixed effects model for addressing all three challenges, an efficient method for zzso smoothing varying zzso functions, an zzso method for zzso the zzso correlation structure, a test procedure with a global test statistic for testing hypotheses of interest associated with functional response, and a simultaneous confidence band for zzso the uncertainty in the estimated zzso zzso zzso data are used to evaluate the finite sample performance of zzso and to demonstrate that zzso significantly zzso a zzso mixed model zzso We apply zzso to study the zzso dynamics of zzso fiber tracts in a clinical study of zzso
