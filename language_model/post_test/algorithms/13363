The emergence of drug-resistant strains of human zzso virus during zzso therapy is a major cause of treatment failure and disease zzso Development of a resistant strain zzso switching to a new zzso regimen composed of novel zzso Recent work has shown that current methods of switching zzso therapies carry significant unnecessary risk of subsequent failures, and optimal switching schedules to minimize this risk have been zzso These switching schedules require frequent sampling of viral load during an induced phase of transient viral load reduction, with the goal of switching to the new zzso regimen at an induced viral load zzso The proposed frequent sampling carries an unacceptable level of cost both in terms of measurement expense and inconvenience to the zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso sampling zzso to reduce the number of samples required to achieve the desired reduction in zzso We demonstrate through the zzso analysis that the proposed method is able to robustly achieve an average 50% reduction in the number of required samples while maintaining a reduction in the risk of subsequent failure to under zzso despite zzso verified levels of model and measurement zzso
