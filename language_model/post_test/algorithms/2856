We present a zzso zzso filtering framework for the task of zzso zzso from a single zzso There are several approaches in the literature for zzso zzso but few include the errors in estimates of surface zzso and light source direction to improve the zzso zzso The proposed approach effectively zzso the error statistics of surface zzso and zzso direction for robust zzso of zzso for images illuminated by single and multiple light zzso The zzso estimate obtained is subsequently used to generate zzso zzso images for recovering the shape of an zzso Traditional zzso zzso approaches often assume zzso constant zzso and known light source direction to recover the underlying zzso Using the estimated zzso the general problem of zzso the shape of an object with varying zzso map and unknown zzso source is reduced to one that can be handled by traditional zzso zzso Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach and its application to zzso matching and shape zzso The estimated zzso maps are compared with the ground zzso The maps are used as zzso signatures for the task of face recognition across zzso zzso The recognition results obtained compare well with the current state-of-the-art zzso zzso shape recovery results are obtained using images downloaded from the Web with little control over imaging zzso The recovered shapes are also used to zzso novel views under novel zzso zzso
