zzso of plants according to their echoes is an elementary component of bat behavior that plays an important role in spatial orientation and food zzso zzso echoes are, however, highly complex zzso zzso from an zzso point of view, a plant can be thought of as a three-dimensional array of leaves reflecting the zzso bat zzso The received echo is therefore a zzso of many zzso In this work we suggest that the zzso of these echoes might not be such a troublesome routine for bats as formerly zzso We present a rather simple approach to zzso signals from a large database of plant echoes that were created by zzso plants with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso uses the zzso of a single echo from which it only uses features that are undoubtedly accessible to zzso We used a standard machine learning zzso zzso to automatically extract suitable linear combinations of time and frequency cues from the zzso such that zzso with high accuracy is zzso This demonstrates that zzso echoes are highly zzso about the species membership of an zzso plant, and that this information can be extracted with rather simple, biologically plausible zzso Thus, our findings provide a new explanatory basis for the poorly understood observed abilities of bats in zzso vegetation and other complex zzso
