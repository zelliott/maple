zzso surgical procedures requiring zzso circulatory arrest are associated with altered zzso and increased zzso In a zzso clinical trial, we evaluated effects of zzso guided zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso with acute type A zzso undergoing zzso surgery with zzso circulatory arrest were enrolled in a zzso trial during a zzso zzso Patients were randomly allocated to treatment group zzso with zzso guided zzso zzso or control group zzso with routine zzso practices zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso according to zzso test zzso zzso end point was cumulative zzso blood units (red blood cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso blood was significantly reduced in the zzso group: median zzso units zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso units zzso units, zzso Most significant decrease was in the use of zzso plasma zzso units, zzso units, vs zzso units, zzso units, zzso zzso blood loss zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 950 zzso zzso zzso zzso and rate of surgical zzso zzso vs zzso zzso were similar between zzso zzso guided zzso significantly decreased need for massive zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in multivariable zzso zzso zzso 

zzso guided zzso is associated with a decreased use of zzso blood units and reduced zzso of massive zzso in patients undergoing zzso surgery with circulatory zzso
