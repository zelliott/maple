zzso is a highly effective secondary prevention in patients with zzso stroke and zzso zzso zzso However, the condition remains zzso because zzso zzso may be missed by diagnostic tests in the acute zzso In this study, the sensitivity of zzso detection was assessed for serial zzso recordings and continuous stroke unit zzso monitoring with or without a structured zzso to analyze zzso data zzso 

Three hundred zzso consecutive patients with acute zzso stroke were zzso included and subjected to standard zzso zzso In addition, zzso data were separately analyzed following zzso consisting of a structured evaluation of episodes with high risk for zzso and a zzso zzso screening of the full zzso zzso zzso were conducted in 24-hour zzso 

Median effective zzso monitoring time was zzso hours zzso range zzso zzso Overall, zzso was diagnosed in 119 of zzso patients zzso The structured reading zzso was the most sensitive method to detected zzso Conventional zzso and serial zzso assessments were less zzso However, only zzso of patients with previously documented zzso zzso and negative baseline zzso demonstrated zzso episodes during zzso 

Continuous stroke unit zzso using zzso shows a significantly higher detection rate for zzso compared with daily zzso assessments and standard zzso without structured zzso The low overall probability to detect zzso zzso with either method during the first days after stroke demonstrates the urgent need for complementary diagnostic strategies such as long-term monitoring and frequent follow-up zzso Clinical Trial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
