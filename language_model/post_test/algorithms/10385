To review records of 108 children with zzso neck fractures and develop an zzso for zzso 

Records of 50 girls and 58 boys aged 2 to 14 zzso zzso years with zzso neck fractures were zzso The most common injury mechanism was tripping and falling on an outstretched hand while running zzso followed by falling from monkey bars zzso zzso were classified into grade 1 zzso grade 2 zzso grade 3 zzso grade zzso zzso and grade zzso zzso 21 patients had associated fractures involving the zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso The time from injury to treatment ranged from 0 to 7 zzso zzso included casting without manipulation zzso closed reduction and casting zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction and casting zzso and open reduction and casting zzso 

Patients were followed up for a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was excellent in 93 patients, good in 11, and fair in zzso Higher fracture grades correlated positively with poorer outcomes zzso and more invasive treatment zzso Nonetheless, the zzso angles of all the patients were not significantly different zzso Older children sustained more severe fractures zzso and had poorer zzso even after correction for fracture grade zzso Patients with associated fractures had significantly poorer outcomes zzso Two patients developed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso One of whom had an associated zzso fracture and underwent open reduction and zzso The other had an associated zzso zzso fracture and underwent repeated zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso to loss of zzso Five patients developed zzso zzso Four of whom had associated fractures (3 involved the zzso and one the zzso zzso 14 patients developed zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso 

Open reduction should only be performed after more conservative treatments fail to achieve zzso
