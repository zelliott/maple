The performance of a nuclear resonance detection system can be zzso using zzso detection zzso Within this zzso signal averaging increases the probability of a correct detection and decreases the probability of a false alarm by reducing the zzso of the noise in the average zzso In conjunction with signal zzso we propose another method based on feedback control concepts that further improves detection zzso By maximizing the nuclear resonance signal zzso feedback raises the probability of correct zzso Furthermore, information generated by the feedback zzso can be used to reduce the probability of false zzso We discuss the advantages afforded by feedback that cannot be obtained using signal zzso As an example, we show how this method is zzso to the detection of explosives using nuclear zzso zzso
