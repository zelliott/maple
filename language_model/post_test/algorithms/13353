zzso can detect small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in patients with zzso We investigated whether small zzso zzso can be detected more often by increasing the resolution of zzso 

Of 31 consecutive patients with zzso 27 underwent zzso twice at the first visit zzso zzso hours; mean 10 zzso and at follow-up zzso zzso hours; mean zzso zzso after the onset of their zzso Each zzso included 2 different spatial resolutions with the same zzso (2000 zzso conventional resolution in a 128 zzso 128 zzso with zzso section thickness and high resolution in a 220 zzso 220 zzso with zzso section zzso The number and contrast of zzso zzso were compared between the 2 zzso 

Twenty-two of the 27 patients had single or multiple zzso zzso The total number of zzso detected on conventional and high-resolution zzso was 11 and 22, respectively, at the first visit, and was 24 and 37, respectively, at zzso The number of zzso was significantly larger on high-resolution zzso than on conventional resolution at the first visit zzso zzso zzso and at the follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast was significantly increased on high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Higher zzso resolution increased zzso zzso in patients with zzso Considering the small size of zzso zzso the resolution of zzso is an important zzso influencing zzso zzso
