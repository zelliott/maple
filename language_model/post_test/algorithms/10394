In this article, a novel zzso neural network combining elements from zzso zzso zzso and zzso neural networks is zzso It enables stable zzso zzso of stationary and zzso input data by learning their inherent zzso Here, two network components representing two different levels of detail are trained zzso By virtue of several filtering mechanisms, the sensitivity to noise is diminished, which renders the proposed network suitable for the application to real-world zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that this network constitutes an excellent basis to learn and recall associations between real-world zzso zzso Its incremental nature ensures that the capacity of the corresponding zzso memory fits the amount of knowledge to be zzso Moreover, the formed clusters efficiently represent the relations between the keys, even if noisy data is used for zzso In addition, we present an zzso recall mechanism to retrieve stored information based on one of the zzso keys used for zzso As different levels of detail are zzso the recall can be performed with different degrees of zzso
