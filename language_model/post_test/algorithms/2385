This paper describes a method for planning the duration of a zzso parallel group study in which the response of interest is a potentially zzso zzso At the design stage we assume patients zzso at a constant rate, we model events via a homogeneous zzso process, and we zzso an independent exponential zzso mechanism to reflect loss to zzso We derive the appropriate study duration to ensure satisfaction of power requirements for the effect size of interest under a zzso zzso zzso An application to a kidney transplant study illustrates the potential savings of the zzso design relative to a design based on the time to the first zzso zzso design criteria are also derived to accommodate zzso zzso count zzso We examine the frequency properties of two zzso tests recently proposed by Lawless and zzso for trials based on the above design zzso In simulation studies involving homogeneous and zzso zzso processes they performed well with respect to their type I error rate and zzso zzso from supplementary simulation studies indicate that these tests are also robust to zzso variation and to zzso in the event times, making these tests attractive in their zzso We illustrate both tests by application to data from a completed kidney transplant zzso
