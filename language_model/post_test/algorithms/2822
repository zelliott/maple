zzso urinary tract infections are common in diabetic zzso The aim of this 10 months prospective study is to evaluate urinary zzso tests versus zzso examination to conclude the absence of urinary tract infection in diabetic zzso Each diabetic patient zzso for less than 8 hours and for whom it was decided a zzso examination was included in the study zzso zzso At the same time (and at patient's zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood, zzso and zzso was carried zzso zzso zzso negative zzso value, post test probability and negative zzso ratio were zzso 

the combination of zzso zone with zzso zone (both zzso has a zzso sensitivity, avoids zzso of zzso but has an odd ratio at zzso Those results are improved when the zzso zone zzso test or less than 4 zzso is taken into account, with a zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso avoided and a negative zzso ratio at zzso 

The addition of the zzso test to the usual zzso and zzso tests seems to allow one to conclude the absence of urinary tract infection in diabetic zzso this is worth studying with a more extensive zzso
