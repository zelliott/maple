Several zzso were employed to calculate the Gibbs standard free energy of binding for a collection of zzso complexes, where the zzso is a zzso and the protein is representative for various protein zzso Almost 40 zzso complexes were employed for a zzso approach, which considers the protein and the zzso at the atomic level, but includes zzso as a zzso zzso Five zzso complexes were employed for an zzso approach that relies on a combination of the double decoupling method with zzso integration and molecular zzso These affinities were also zzso by means of the linear interaction energy zzso Although it generally proved rather difficult to predict the absolute free energies correctly, for some protein families the experimental ranking order was correctly reproduced by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso attention has also been given to correctly analyze the affinities of charged zzso where it is required to judge the effect of one or more zzso that are being zzso in an zzso approach to preserve zzso The various methods are further judged upon their zzso
