In an ideal world, every zzso cross peak would have a unique zzso However, the interpretation of zzso zzso is frequently complicated by overlapping zzso In theory, ambiguous assignments could be resolved by performing separate structure calculations with each possible zzso Unfortunately, this would require an zzso amount of computing zzso A modified genetic zzso has been developed that efficiently resolves hundreds of ambiguous restraints in zzso Each zzso assignment becomes a gene that can be passed on to a new zzso New individuals are constructed by making a constraint lists from a subset of the zzso The constraint lists are then tested for zzso by using molecular dynamics to generate new structures for each zzso To a first-degree zzso there is enough information retained in each list to determine the global fold of the zzso zzso constraint lists receive higher scores and their genes (or zzso stand a better chance of surviving into the next zzso The process selects zzso that are consistent with the global zzso Under normal conditions, the program zzso in 3 to 8 generations using 70 structures per zzso The final constraints are zzso and contain almost no residual zzso zzso
