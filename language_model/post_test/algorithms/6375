The instantaneous zzso of variation zzso edge zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso operators, has been proposed for edge detection in ultrasound zzso In this paper, the edge detection and zzso performance of the zzso zzso detector are zzso First, a simplified version of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso magnitude zzso is scrutinized in order to reveal the statistical performance of edge detection and zzso in speckled ultrasound zzso Both the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm are evaluated for the zzso Edge zzso is characterized by the position of the peak and the zzso zzso of the detector zzso Then, the zzso response of the zzso as applied to a realistic edge model is zzso Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the zzso effects of the zzso zzso operator in the zzso edge detector for zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso is implemented in which the zzso detector is embedded in a diffusion zzso in an zzso diffusion zzso zzso with real ultrasound images have shown that the proposed zzso is effective in zzso edges in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso provides a lower zzso error, and zzso a dramatic improvement in zzso performance over an existing zzso method for speckled zzso
