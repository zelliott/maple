zzso resonance tagging is used to evaluate the dynamic deformation of lines or zzso superimposed on the zzso during the cardiac zzso From these data, a specific zzso procedure provides two kinds of zzso zzso three zzso components of zzso motion zzso zzso and zzso and zzso rotation and zzso zzso expresses the local zzso deformation and is prone to important zzso zzso Peak zzso strain is in the range of zzso to zzso for the zzso and zzso components zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso component zzso zzso The zzso arrangement of zzso that run in opposite directions at the zzso and zzso explains zzso twist zzso This zzso may be enhanced during the early stage of several diseases zzso zzso zzso or in heart failure with a normal left zzso ejection zzso zzso is generally impaired in zzso heart disease and zzso but the most zzso significant finding is the early identification of zzso dysfunction on the basis of zzso and zzso strain reduction in patients with apparently preserved zzso zzso Thus, strain impairment appears to be a sensitive and promising marker of zzso disease, with the potential for improving patient zzso
