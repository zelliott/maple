zzso response to carbon dioxide concentration can provide data on a number of important parameters related to leaf zzso The genetic zzso zzso which is a robust zzso evolutionary zzso zzso inspired by both natural selection and natural zzso is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters zzso maximum zzso rate allowed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso potential zzso electron transport rate zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf dark zzso in the light zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the photosynthesis models presented by zzso von zzso and Berry, and zzso and zzso The results show that by properly constraining the zzso bounds the zzso estimate methods can effectively and efficiently obtain globally (or, at least near zzso optimal solutions, which are as good as or better than those obtained by zzso curve fitting methods used in previous zzso More complicated problems such as taking the zzso variation response to zzso into account can be easily formulated and solved by using zzso The influence of the crossover probability zzso zzso probability zzso population size and generation on the performance of zzso was also zzso
