We investigated how zzso zzso of heart rate zzso can detect changes in cardiovascular zzso drive with respect to traditional measures of zzso This was done by analyzing healthy subjects and zzso patients with different zzso impairment due to low zzso impairment only) or high zzso and vascular zzso spinal zzso injury, during progressive zzso zzso While traditional techniques only zzso the effects of the zzso zzso not distinguishing the effects of the zzso level, some recently proposed complexity zzso could also reveal the zzso zzso in the zzso control of heart zzso These zzso included the zzso fluctuation analysis zzso zzso to both low and high zzso zzso sample zzso zzso to low-level zzso and the largest zzso zzso zzso to high-level zzso Thus zzso methods provide information on the zzso function from the heart rate dynamics that cannot be obtained by traditional zzso This finding supports the combined use of both zzso and traditional methods to investigate the zzso cardiovascular control from a more comprehensive zzso
