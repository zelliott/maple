To reduce zzso charging effects in scanning electron microscope images, zzso contrast stretching is developed and zzso First, zzso is performed on the input image zzso with zzso zzso Then, contrast stretching or contrast adjustment is implemented to improve the images while reducing the contrast charging zzso This technique has been compared to some existing zzso zzso zzso extension zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast stretching dynamic zzso zzso HE and zzso mean separate zzso Other post processing methods, such as zzso approach, spatial zzso and exponential contrast zzso are compared as zzso Overall, the proposed method produces better image compensation in reducing charging zzso
