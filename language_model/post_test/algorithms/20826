Currently implanted prosthetic heart valves, both mechanical or biological ones, are used to restore the proper blood zzso when the native valves zzso However, these medical devices are not free from zzso such as zzso or zzso also presenting the relevant disadvantage of being unable to growth, repair and zzso An improvement could be represented by zzso zzso zzso heart zzso In this paper a zzso zzso zzso heart valve zzso realized by means of zzso and its in zzso functional characterization in a pulse zzso resembling pulmonary conditions, is zzso zzso examination revealed zzso zzso fibers randomly oriented with an average zzso of about 90 zzso Pulse zzso testing highlighted that leaflets opened zzso and showed a correct zzso in the zzso phase, even if a slight rotation of the leaflets was zzso In zzso study by zzso simulation of the closed phase predicted the stress distribution within the zzso showing that peak levels are reached at the zzso and sustained by the structure without zzso The present study highlighted the technical feasibility to produce zzso zzso functional heart valves by means of zzso Further studies and design changes are needed in order to zzso the final scaffold to bear zzso zzso zzso
