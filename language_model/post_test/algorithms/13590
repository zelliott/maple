zzso error and transient zzso affect vital zzso These issues are zzso considered in published reports and clinical zzso We investigated the association between major zzso injury and vital signs, successively applying zzso techniques that excluded unreliable zzso reduced transient variation, and then controlled for ambiguity in individual vital signs through zzso zzso 

Vital sign data from zzso adult zzso trauma patients were analyzed zzso Computer zzso were used to identify and exclude unreliable data and to apply time zzso An ensemble zzso was developed and tested by zzso zzso outcome was zzso injury plus red cell zzso Areas under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso were compared by the test of DeLong et zzso 

Of initial vital signs, zzso blood pressure zzso had the highest zzso zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The zzso zzso improved after excluding unreliable data, significantly for heart rate and respiratory rate but not significantly for zzso Time averaging to reduce zzso zzso further increased zzso significantly for zzso and not significantly for heart rate and respiratory zzso The ensemble zzso yielded a final zzso zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso to reduce zzso in vital sign data can lead to significantly improved diagnostic zzso Failure to consider such zzso could significantly reduce clinical effectiveness or confound research zzso
