A probability zzso model zzso for zzso reasoning is zzso An informational ordering over zzso statements suggests simple probability based zzso for zzso zzso The most important is the zzso choose the type of the least zzso premise as the type of the zzso The zzso of this zzso is confirmed by an analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso reasoning which treats logical zzso as a limiting case of zzso zzso A zzso of past experiments reveals close fits with zzso zzso also compares favorably with alternative accounts, including mental zzso mental models, and deduction as verbal zzso zzso zzso extends naturally to generalized zzso such as Most and zzso which have not been characterized logically and are, consequently, beyond the scope of current mental logic and mental model zzso Two experiments confirm the novel predictions of zzso when generalized zzso are used in zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso reasoning performance may be determined by simple but rational informational strategies justified by probability theory rather than by zzso
