zzso zzso of pharmaceutical zzso is a complex process that results in a zzso density distribution inside the zzso In the present study, we have used a zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso method to access to zzso information zzso zzso about the porous structure of the zzso obtained with three different pharmaceutical zzso the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso calcium zzso These materials were chosen since their mechanical properties under pressure are highly zzso To probe the pore space with the zzso technique, the zzso were initially impregnated with silicone oil that is zzso sensitive zzso zzso The zzso apparent zzso zzso was measured over a suitable range of diffusion time in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the zzso zzso from which the zzso factor and the zzso of the porous structure can be zzso These results show that the porous structure varies with pressure and depends on the zzso zzso under zzso Then, this work demonstrates that zzso could be an alternative and a very interesting technique to obtain useful information on the structural properties of such zzso zzso
