The concept of zzso is applied to zzso large zzso zzso Scopes are defined as sets of zzso that can be zzso by a zzso network when it is provided with given seeds zzso of initial zzso zzso Thus, zzso represent zzso capacities of the seeds in the zzso A hierarchy is discussed in the sense that compounds, which are part of the scope of another compound, possess zzso themselves that are zzso of the former zzso This hierarchy is zzso by means of a directed zzso zzso Using a simple chemical model, it is found that this hierarchy contains specific structures that can, to a large extent, be explained by the chemical composition of the participating zzso In this way, it represents a new kind of map of zzso networks, arranging the zzso compounds according to their chemical zzso
