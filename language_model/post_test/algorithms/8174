zzso approaches, which naturally incorporate left zzso due to limit of zzso are commonly zzso to analyze censored zzso normal zzso However, the maximum likelihood zzso zzso typically zzso zzso zzso The restricted maximum likelihood zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso zzso cannot be easily extended to analyze censored zzso normal zzso In the light of the connection between the zzso and a zzso approach discovered in 1974 by Dr zzso this paper describes a zzso approach to censored zzso normal zzso This zzso approach is justified through its link to the zzso via zzso approximation and its performance is evaluated through a simulation zzso We consider the zzso approach as a valuable alternative because it yields less biased zzso zzso estimates than the zzso and because a solid zzso is technically difficult when data are left zzso
