The native state of a protein is regarded to be an ensemble of zzso which allows association with binding zzso While some of this structural zzso is retained upon zzso reliably zzso zzso features from zzso data has remained a zzso In this study, a new zzso for the automatic zzso of discrete zzso is zzso At high resolution, the zzso single zzso model, with correlated structural features to represent zzso shows improved agreement with the zzso data compared with a zzso zzso The model appears to be representative of the set of structures present in the zzso In contrast, below 2 A resolution representing ambiguous electron density by correlated zzso in a single model does not yield better agreement with the experimental zzso zzso with previous studies, this suggests that zzso in zzso models at lower resolution levels reflects uncertainty more than coordinated zzso
