The combined zzso zzso zzso of an zzso crystal and platinum zzso zzso in a zzso sensor are used to monitor temperature and oxygen concentration in the zzso range from zzso degrees C and zzso zzso with precision of zzso degree C and zzso zzso and accuracy of zzso degree C and zzso zzso A zzso cubic zzso crystal bound to the zzso end of a zzso optical fiber core and the zzso coated zzso with a length of 1 zzso from the end of the same fiber are excited with zzso zzso blue LED zzso This apparatus uses a zzso zzso for data acquisition and frequency domain methods for signal zzso The instrument zzso both the zzso and zzso components of the zzso output and band limits the signal to 20 zzso The fundamental frequency of the zzso is set to zzso zzso and the highest harmonic used is the zzso This zzso signal is sampled and averaged over a few hundred cycles in the time zzso The frequency domain representation of the data is obtained by employing fast zzso transform zzso The phase delay and the zzso ratio of each sampled harmonic are then zzso At least four zzso harmonic zzso or zzso are averaged before decoding the two lifetimes of temperature and oxygen zzso zzso A component of zero lifetime is introduced to account for the zzso zzso leakage through optical interference filters seen by the zzso Linear and zzso empirical zzso are employed to zzso the temperatures and oxygen zzso from the inverse zzso In the situation of constant oxygen zzso the lifetime of zzso changes with temperature but can be compensated using the measured temperature zzso The system drift is zzso degree C for the temperature measurement and zzso for the oxygen concentration measurement over 30 h of continuous zzso The zzso and methods allow for zzso update times and zzso zzso zzso
