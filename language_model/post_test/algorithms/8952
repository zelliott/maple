zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the product of two zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and aims to preserve the local geometric structure of the zzso by minimizing squared zzso distance or zzso zzso divergence between X and zzso The zzso update rule zzso is usually applied to zzso zzso but it suffers from the drawback of zzso because it zzso advances one step along the zzso negative zzso direction with a zzso step zzso Recently, a multiple zzso fast zzso descent zzso method has been proposed for zzso zzso which zzso zzso by searching the optimal zzso along the zzso negative zzso direction with Newton's zzso However, the zzso cost of zzso is high because 1) the zzso zzso zzso is dense and costs too much zzso and 2) the zzso inverse operator and its zzso with zzso cost too much zzso To overcome these deficiencies of zzso we propose an efficient zzso zzso zzso method for zzso zzso In particular, we apply the zzso zzso zzso method to directly approximate the zzso of the inverse zzso and the zzso for searching the optimal step size in zzso The preliminary results on real-world zzso show that zzso is more efficient than both zzso and zzso To evaluate the effectiveness of zzso we validate its zzso performance for zzso zzso based zzso on two popular face image zzso including zzso and zzso and two text zzso including Reuters and zzso The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of zzso by comparing it with the representative zzso zzso
