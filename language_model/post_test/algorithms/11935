Research on zzso signals zzso using the zzso technique has shown promising results, when the time difference zzso of a zzso in two sample volumes zzso placed serially has been measured zzso On the other hand, the computerized discrimination of zzso and zzso has been reported not to be superior to zzso based on a single zzso zzso a zzso containing zzso as well as four types of zzso was made to test a preliminary version of a new zzso for automated zzso zzso We monitored 20 patients during carotid zzso zzso zzso 17) and heart surgery zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso signals with a partial overlap of the zzso were recorded online and zzso zzso with an zzso based on three consecutive steps: zzso Is there an intensity increase in both channels zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso What is the expected time difference zzso with the zzso measured in channel 1 as the calculation zzso zzso What is the zzso zzso zzso power zzso Two human experts decided whether a signal was a zzso or belonged to one of the four zzso zzso Of a total of 97 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be detected in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were present in both channels and could be zzso based on the zzso zzso Of these 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were correctly identified zzso We assessed zzso rejection for four different types of zzso changes of zzso settings, probe movement, low flow zzso and zzso The reliability of zzso rejection was zzso for setting changes zzso zzso zzso zzso for probe movement zzso zzso zzso and zzso for low flow zzso zzso zzso zzso but only zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso These preliminary results are promising, but need careful interpretation: zzso of the zzso were not zzso in the zzso zzso probably due to a poor zzso ratio zzso and anatomical zzso zzso signals were insufficiently zzso However, even an zzso rejection of zzso can be insufficient if the number of zzso is very small compared to the number of zzso
