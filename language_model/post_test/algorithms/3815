zzso of submerged culture conditions for the production of zzso growth and zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso The optimum temperature and the initial pH for zzso production in a zzso culture of zzso zzso were found to be 20 degrees C and zzso zzso Among the various zzso constituents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most suitable zzso zzso and mineral sources for zzso production, zzso The optimum concentration of the zzso ingredients determined using the zzso zzso method was as zzso 30 zzso of zzso 20 zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso of zzso and 1 zzso of zzso Under the zzso culture conditions, the maximum concentration of zzso in a zzso zzso reactor was zzso zzso which was approximately five times higher than that in the zzso zzso A comparative zzso result showed that the zzso productivity in an zzso reactor was higher than that in the zzso reactor despite the lower zzso growth zzso The specific zzso and the yield zzso in the zzso reactor were higher than those in the zzso reactor even though the zzso zzso were higher in the zzso reactor than in the zzso zzso
