All the patients were found to have typical CT signs of zzso abnormal contrast enhancement of the pulmonary zzso their zzso and zzso signs of right cardiac zzso right zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso artery zzso decreased peripheral vascular pattern, mosaic pulmonary zzso and zzso zzso defects on the zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso areas were also found in all the zzso zzso defects were more clearly zzso when zzso CT by constructing zzso zzso maps was zzso zzso the zzso maps in 6 patients operated on revealed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso 

Information on the vascular bed and pulmonary zzso may be obtained in patients with zzso within one investigation, which is important to plan surgical zzso Construction of zzso pulmonary zzso maps allows evaluation of zzso recovery after artery zzso
