The process of separating water and fat signal in magnetic resonance images with the Dixon pulse sequence is hindered by phase errors in the zzso opposed zzso These errors arise from zzso field zzso varying magnetic zzso of different body zzso and other zzso Phase correction performed with data from phantom imaging can compensate for zzso field zzso but not for the other zzso A regional zzso zzso is presented that removes zzso phase effects and produces true water and fat zzso The technique has been applied with good results to 21 patients and healthy zzso The images include ones of the abdomen, knees, hips, spine, and zzso This method of regional phase correction is an zzso way of producing separate water and fat images with the Dixon pulse zzso
