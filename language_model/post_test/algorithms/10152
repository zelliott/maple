Current zzso for zzso zzso identification confidence in the accurate mass and time zzso tag approach assume that the zzso tags themselves have been correctly zzso However, there is uncertainty in the identification of zzso zzso because this is based on matching zzso fragmentation zzso to zzso zzso In this paper, we incorporate confidence measures for the zzso tag identifications into the calculation of probabilities for correct matches to an zzso tag database, resulting in a more accurate overall measure of identification confidence for the zzso tag zzso The method is referenced as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso additionally provides a uniqueness probability zzso to help distinguish between multiple matches to an zzso tag and a method to calculate an overall false discovery rate zzso zzso is freely available for zzso as both a command line and a Windows zzso zzso
