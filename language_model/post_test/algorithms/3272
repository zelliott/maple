This paper investigates the synchronization problem for a class of complex delayed zzso networks by pinning periodically intermittent zzso Based on a general model of complex delayed zzso networks, using the zzso stability theory and periodically intermittent control method, some simple criteria are derived for the synchronization of such zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso network consisting of coupled delayed zzso zzso is finally given as an example to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical zzso
