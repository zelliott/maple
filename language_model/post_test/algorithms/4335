In this paper, we use an adapted zzso version of the differential evolution zzso zzso for the design and generation of reliable DNA libraries that can be used for zzso DNA sequence design is a very relevant task in many recent research fields, zzso zzso or DNA zzso Specifically, DNA computing is a new zzso model which uses DNA molecules as information storage and their possible biological interactions as processing zzso zzso the possible reactions and interactions among molecules must be strictly controlled to prevent incorrect zzso The design of reliable DNA libraries for zzso computing is an zzso zzso problem which involves many zzso and conflicting design zzso For this reason, we zzso DNA sequence design as a zzso zzso problem and we solved it by using an adapted zzso version of DE zzso Seven different zzso design criteria have been simultaneously considered to obtain high quality DNA sequences which are suitable for molecular zzso Furthermore, we have developed the zzso standard fast zzso sorting genetic zzso zzso in order to perform a formal comparative study by using zzso zzso Additionally, we have also compared our results with other relevant results published in the zzso We conclude that our proposal is a promising approach which is able to generate reliable real-world DNA sequences that significantly improve other DNA libraries previously published in the zzso
