zzso gait event detection is a requirement for functional electrical stimulation and gait zzso This gait event detection should zzso be achieved using an ambulatory system of zzso lightweight, low-cost zzso Previous research has reported issues with durability in zzso zzso zzso this study describes the development and assessment of novel detection zzso using zzso and zzso sensors on 12 healthy zzso zzso were equipped with one force sensitive zzso on the zzso one zzso at the foot, and one zzso at the zzso zzso performed 10, zzso walking trials in each of three conditions: normal, slow, and altered zzso knee zzso zzso Data from a subset of four subjects were used to develop prediction zzso for initial contact zzso zzso these zzso were tested on the remaining eight subjects against standard zzso zzso data zzso of 5 N on a rising zzso The zzso force threshold zzso was most accurate for zzso detection zzso absolute error of zzso zzso and was significantly more accurate zzso than the optimal zzso zzso zzso absolute error of zzso zzso The optimal zzso zzso used data from both zzso with zzso determined from the second zzso of foot zzso zzso The error results for zzso and zzso zzso are lower zzso zzso than in previous research on ambulatory real-time gait event detection zzso Currently, zzso systems must be recommended over zzso systems for accurate detection of zzso however, further research into zzso zzso is merited due to its advantages as a zzso low-cost zzso
