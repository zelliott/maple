In the present paper, the zzso Colony System zzso zzso is used for the identification of optimal routes in the case of municipal solid waste zzso zzso The proposed zzso management system is based on a zzso spatial database supported by a geographic information system zzso The zzso takes into account all the required parameters for solid waste zzso These parameters include zzso and dynamic data, such as the positions of waste zzso the road network and the related traffic, as well as the population density in the area under zzso In addition, waste collection schedules, truck capacities and their characteristics are also taken into zzso zzso statistical analysis is used to estimate zzso between dynamic factors, like network traffic changes in residential and commercial zzso The user, in the proposed system, is able to define or modify all of the required dynamic factors for the creation of alternative initial zzso The objective of the system is to identify the most cost-effective scenario for waste collection, to estimate its running cost and to simulate its zzso Finally, the results of the zzso zzso are compared with the empirical method currently used by the zzso of zzso
