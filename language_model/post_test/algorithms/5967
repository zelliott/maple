To design a new management zzso for all zzso cell tumors and zzso based on zzso findings and the zzso molecular zzso 

A retrospective medical record zzso 

A large zzso care teaching zzso 

zzso consecutive cases of zzso cell zzso were gathered from a database of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso compiled over 22 zzso Data collected included patient information, tumor information, and treatment zzso 

zzso parameters included tumor and treatment zzso which were analyzed statistically using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso survival and zzso survival analyses were performed using zzso zzso 

A zzso ratio of zzso was found, with a median patient age of 57 zzso zzso patients had American Joint Commission on Cancer stage II zzso Treatment factors had no significant effect on disease recurrence or zzso More than half of the patients had zzso proved regional zzso zzso invasion significantly diminished zzso survival and zzso zzso 

We found a high zzso of zzso cell zzso with cervical zzso On the basis of findings of this study and our previous clinical and molecular findings, we propose a treatment zzso that combines zzso examination and molecular zzso for the zzso gene zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso After permanent section analysis demonstrating zzso cell zzso the zzso mandates completion zzso in patients with zzso zzso cell tumors and clinical observation for zzso zzso cell zzso We recommend more aggressive treatment of zzso zzso cell zzso (or zzso cell zzso zzso zzso because of the higher zzso of regional zzso zzso
