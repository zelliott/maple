For neural networks with constant or zzso delays, the problems of determining the exponential stability and zzso the exponential convergence rate are studied in this zzso An approach combining the zzso zzso with the linear zzso inequality is taken to investigate the problems, which provide bounds on the zzso zzso and the zzso functions, so as to guarantee the zzso exponential zzso Some criteria for the zzso stability, which give information on the zzso property, are zzso The results obtained in this paper provide one more set of easily verified guidelines for determining the zzso stability of delayed neural networks, which are less conservative and less restrictive than the ones reported so far in the zzso
