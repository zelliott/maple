We show how statistical methods based on directed zzso may be useful in modeling traffic fatalities by comparing models specified using directed zzso to a model originally developed by zzso The comparison uses zzso original data, as well as zzso data (and zzso through zzso zzso forecasts of traffic fatalities from zzso model are compared with those from a model constructed using directed zzso over data for the more recent zzso The directed zzso model zzso zzso model in root mean squared forecast zzso
