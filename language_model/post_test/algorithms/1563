zzso zzso zzso have been widely used for zzso zzso monitoring zzso Currently at least zzso trials are required to generate a zzso zzso zzso This study introduces a novel approach that yields accurate detection results of the zzso signal yet with a significantly reduced number of trials, resulting in an zzso monitoring zzso The analysis was performed on data recorded in seven patients undergoing surgery, where the zzso zzso nerve was zzso and the zzso response was recorded from scalp zzso using two bipolar electrodes, zzso and zzso The proposed approach employs an innovative, simple yet effective zzso based on a zzso zzso template to detect the zzso using only 30 zzso The time zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso are detected along with the zzso zzso The time zzso are detected with a mean accuracy greater than zzso Also, the zzso and zzso peak zzso and the zzso zzso were found to be consistent throughout the surgical procedure within the zzso and 50% acceptable clinical limits, zzso The results obtained support the assertion that the zzso is capable of detecting zzso with high accuracy and consistency throughout the entire surgical procedure using only 30 zzso
