In this paper, the problem of zzso the attitude of a zzso satellite, obtaining zzso field zzso via a zzso zzso and obtaining angle rate via zzso is zzso For this application, a zzso zzso filtering method is proposed, which uses the zzso and zzso zzso to estimate the rotation zzso and the gyro bias zzso zzso The zzso zzso related to the particle filtering technique is eliminated by introducing a zzso approach that permits a significant reduction in the number of zzso This renders zzso zzso filter zzso efficient and enables its zzso with a remarkably small number of zzso zzso results by using zzso are given, which demonstrate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
