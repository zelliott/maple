We developed a method of effective zzso screening that combines experiments and zzso zzso The method is based on the concept that screening efficiency can be enhanced from even limited data by use of a model derived from zzso analysis that serves as a guide to screening and combining the model with subsequent repeated zzso Here we focus on zzso peptides as a model application of this zzso zzso zzso peptides were screened by use of a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Starting with the screening data obtained from a zzso random zzso library zzso zzso a rule regarding structural characteristics of zzso peptides was extracted by fuzzy neural network zzso zzso According to this rule, peptides with zzso zzso in certain positions that led to inefficient binding were eliminated from the random zzso In the zzso second random library zzso zzso the yield of zzso peptides having an zzso rate more than zzso to that of the zzso array support was significantly high zzso compared with the unrestricted random library zzso In the restricted third library zzso zzso the yield of zzso peptides increased to zzso We conclude that a repeated cycle of experiments screening limited numbers of peptides can be assisted by the zzso feature of zzso
