zzso zzso zzso is used by clinicians to evaluate zzso zzso However, some would improve diagnostic zzso The goal of this study was to investigate potential zzso factors that might affect zzso zzso zzso differences depending on different speed of injection, lengths of connecting tubing and locations of sensors were evaluated using an in zzso model zzso 

Two sets of automated zzso devices were arranged to record zzso pressure pressures zzso and zzso pressures zzso in an zzso chamber disk zzso representing zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured simultaneously while varying injection speeds, and using zzso and zzso pressure sensors and contrast zzso tubing of different zzso All zzso zzso were collected and viewed zzso and stored for further zzso 

At injection speed of zzso zzso the mean pressure difference zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso As injection speed was reduced, mean zzso was zzso zzso Mean zzso was zzso zzso at injection speed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso Mean zzso values were significantly higher when pressures were recorded using zzso zzso at injection speed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, compared with zzso and zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso Mean zzso due to increased length of tubing was not zzso 

zzso can be better performed with low speed injection zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso of length of connecting zzso did not cause significant pressure zzso These data suggest that automated zzso is a helpful adjunct to improve diagnostic zzso due to zzso location of pressure sensor and greater control of injection zzso
