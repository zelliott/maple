A sine wave method was used to measure zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso Model calculations show that zzso reflects the equivalent zzso of the series arrangement of zzso and zzso membrane zzso Cell swelling induced by reducing the zzso zzso from 260 to 140 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso The decrease in zzso zzso ) reached its maximum 30 s after the onset of cell swelling and a complete recovery of zzso was attained within zzso zzso zzso could be diminished by zzso that reduced the rate or zzso of cell zzso zzso lowering the temperature or treatment with low zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased with the magnitude of the zzso zzso but saturated at large volume zzso zzso increased with culture zzso zzso zzso showed a clear correlation between time course of zzso changes and the closure of the lateral zzso zzso A striking correlation between the occurrence of zzso recovery and the ability of the cells to develop a regulatory volume decrease zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso The frequency dependence of CT was obtained from zzso zzso recorded over the range of 4 zzso to 22 zzso These data agree with model calculations in which the contribution of the access resistance to the lateral membrane was zzso All observations are consistent with the idea that zzso originates from the closure of the zzso during cell zzso The latter phenomenon increases the access resistance to the lateral zzso which results in a marked reduction of the zzso membrane area detected at high zzso with zzso zzso
