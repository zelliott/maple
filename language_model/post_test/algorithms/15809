We introduce a zzso Carlo approach to combined segregation and linkage analysis of a quantitative trait observed in an extended zzso In conjunction with the zzso Carlo method of zzso evaluation proposed by Thompson and zzso the method provides for zzso and hypothesis zzso The greatest attraction of this approach is its ability to handle complex genetic models and large zzso Two examples illustrate the practicality of the zzso One is of simulated data on a large zzso the other is a zzso of published data previously analyzed by other zzso
