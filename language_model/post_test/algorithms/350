The purpose of this study was to use a zzso rotation zzso in combination with an integration approach to transform zzso zzso of the zzso of mass zzso from an zzso measurement unit zzso during walking, from the object system onto the global zzso Second, this paper zzso double integration to determine the relative change in position of the zzso from the vertical acceleration zzso Five participants were tested in which an zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso was attached on the lower spine estimated zzso of zzso Participants were asked to walk three times through a zzso volume at their self-selected walking zzso zzso data were collected by an zzso and an optical motion capture system zzso both measured at 100 zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso onto the global frame using a zzso rotation zzso zzso zzso speed and relative change in position from the zzso were compared with the derived data from the zzso Peak acceleration in vertical axis showed no significant difference zzso or zzso zzso between peak and trough speed showed significant difference zzso but relative zzso position between the zzso and zzso did not show any significant difference zzso or zzso These results indicate that zzso in combination with zzso rule integration, can be used in transforming zzso acceleration from the object frame to the global frame and therefore obtain relative change in position, thus offering a solution for using zzso in accurate global frame zzso gait zzso
