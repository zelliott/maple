A zzso speech feature extraction zzso was developed by modeling human cochlear functions, and demonstrated as a zzso front-end for speech recognition zzso The zzso was based on a model of the zzso of zzso in the human zzso with such features as such as zzso membrane zzso outer hair cells zzso and inner hair cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and amplification of zzso were modeled by lateral zzso to enhance spectral zzso In particular, the zzso zzso had frequency dependency based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso adaptation were applied in the zzso zzso With long-term and short-term adaptation zzso these factors remove stationary or slowly varying components and amplify the zzso changes such as onset or zzso The proposed features were evaluated with a noisy speech database and showed better performance than the baseline methods such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in unknown noisy zzso
