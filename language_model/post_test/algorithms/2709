zzso chronic total zzso zzso are frequently identified during coronary zzso and remain the most challenging zzso group to zzso Patients with zzso are frequently left zzso due to perceptions of high failure rates and technical complexity even if they have symptoms of coronary disease or zzso In this review, the authors describe a North American contemporary approach for zzso coronary interventions for zzso Two guide zzso are placed to facilitate seamless transition between zzso zzso zzso dissection zzso and retrograde zzso or dissection zzso techniques, the zzso zzso zzso After dual coronary injection is performed, 4 zzso parameters are zzso 1) clear understanding of location of the zzso cap using zzso or zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso 3) presence of zzso as well as size and quality of the target vessel at the zzso zzso and 4) suitability of zzso for retrograde zzso On the basis of these 4 zzso an initial strategy and rank order hierarchy for technical approaches is zzso zzso exposure, contrast zzso and procedure time are monitored throughout the zzso and thresholds are established for zzso strategy conversion to maximize safety, efficiency, and zzso
