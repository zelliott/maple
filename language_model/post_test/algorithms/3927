This paper considers fundamental aspects determining the processes of drug compound dissolution and distribution in zzso modeling biological zzso Special attention is paid to the complex analysis of zzso functions of zzso and zzso processes during structural modification of zzso compounds and their influence on dissolution zzso The paper shows that at the first stages of drug design it is necessary to develop zzso of zzso the properties determining zzso distribution, zzso and zzso zzso characteristics of zzso in particular, diffusion flux density through zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso drugs zzso as an example, we have demonstrated the efficiency of approaches to manipulating zzso functions of the basic processes that result from delivering compounds to the points of their zzso We have formulated several criteria of compound selection for further zzso
