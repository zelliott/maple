This paper presents a method to decompose zzso long-term intramuscular zzso zzso zzso In contrast to existing decomposition methods which only support short registration periods or single-channel recordings of signals of constant muscle effort, the decomposition software zzso zzso zzso zzso is especially designed for zzso long-term recordings of signals of slight muscle zzso A zzso zzso cluster analysis zzso estimates the number of classes zzso units zzso zzso single zzso from zzso and sets up the shape of the template for each zzso Using three channels and a weighted averaging method to track action potential (AP) shape changes improve the zzso In the last step, zzso zzso zzso segments containing superimposed zzso are zzso into their units using zzso zzso Based on experiments on simulated and long-term recorded zzso signals, our software is capable of providing reliable zzso with satisfying zzso zzso is suitable for the study of zzso discharge patterns and recruitment order in healthy subjects and patients during long-term zzso
