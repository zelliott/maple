A new zzso equation is presented to describe the damage evolution process in zzso zzso zzso such as zzso The model is formulated by accounting for the zzso structure of the zzso The zzso stress is defined as the average of the collagen zzso zzso The fibers are assumed to be zzso and zzso out at different stretches that are randomly defined according to a zzso zzso After becoming straight, each collagen fiber is assumed to be linear zzso zzso is defined as a reduction in collagen zzso zzso and occurs at different stretches that are also randomly defined by a zzso zzso Due to the lack of experimental data, the predictions of the zzso equation are analyzed by varying the values of its structural zzso Moreover, the results are compared with the available zzso data in the zzso literature that evaluate damage produced by zzso stretches in rat zzso collateral zzso
