The duration of immunity to zzso zzso zzso has been believed to be from 6 months to 2 zzso However, several observations are inconsistent with this short zzso To gain better estimates of the duration of immunity to zzso we developed a mathematical model of community zzso zzso The model was zzso from the literature and also fit to zzso zzso data from England and Wales by using maximum zzso We developed several scenarios to determine the effect of unknowns regarding transmission and immunity on estimates of the duration of zzso In the various models, duration of immunity to zzso zzso was estimated at zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we calculated that children zzso zzso are much more infectious than older children and zzso If a vaccine can achieve protection for duration of natural immunity indicated by our results, its potential health and economic benefits could be zzso
