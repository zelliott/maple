Recent advances in mass zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have made it possible to generate high-resolution zzso of entire zzso While these methods offer new opportunities for performing zzso studies of zzso the zzso tools for analyzing zzso data are still zzso In this paper we investigate the application of spectral alignment to the problem of identifying protein forms in zzso mass zzso zzso identifying the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate how spectral alignment efficiently discovers protein forms even in the presence of numerous modifications and how the zzso can be extended to discover zzso zzso from zzso of zzso of zzso protein zzso
