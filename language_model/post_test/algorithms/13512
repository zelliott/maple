zzso zzso from the zzso zzso is evoked by brief trains of high frequency electrical activity and continues for several zzso Here we studied how active zzso transport towards the plasma membrane contributes to this slow phenomenon in zzso zzso zzso zzso by combining electron zzso the zzso of zzso obtained from zzso dye zzso as zzso fuse with the plasma zzso and a diffusion equation incorporating the forces of local confinement and molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso at rest or after stimulation with 1 zzso trains showed zzso clusters of dense core zzso at zzso and zzso zzso distances from the plasma zzso to which they were bound through zzso zzso By contrast, after 20 zzso stimulation zzso clusters were zzso to the plasma zzso suggesting that transport was induced by electrical zzso zzso 20 zzso stimulation of cultured zzso induced spotted zzso zzso increases with one or two slow zzso zzso suggesting zzso from an equal number of zzso zzso These zzso increases were prevented by zzso which suggested zzso zzso zzso Model fitting to the zzso zzso predicted that zzso zzso were transported along zzso zzso distances at average zzso zzso zzso The zzso cost per zzso fused zzso calculated from the ratio of the zzso depended on the ratio of the traveling zzso and the number of zzso in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso of the zzso cost per zzso was zzso with low energy values at zzso and zzso zzso similar to the average resting distances of the zzso zzso and a high energy barrier at zzso zzso Our study confirms that active zzso transport is an intermediate step for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and provides a quantitative method for analyzing similar phenomena in other cell zzso
