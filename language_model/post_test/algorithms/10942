The quality of zzso data can seriously affect the accuracy of downstream zzso In order to reduce zzso and enhance signal zzso in these data, many zzso methods have been proposed and zzso most of which are for data obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are a newly emerged, zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, there are no reported studies that evaluate zzso methods for zzso zzso 

We compared five existing zzso approaches, in terms of both noise reduction and signal zzso Median zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These methods were applied to two real zzso (a time course zzso and a lung zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso and were assessed using multiple statistical significance zzso Compared to zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a significant and the most consistent improvement in reduction of zzso and retention of zzso zzso appears to retain more signal than zzso zzso reduces more zzso than Median in both zzso yet fails to consistently retain more signal in the time course zzso zzso does not improve over Median in either noise reduction or signal enhancement in the time course zzso 

Median is insufficient either to reduce zzso or to retain signal effectively for zzso zzso zzso zzso is a more suitable approach for zzso these zzso zzso also seems to be the most effective method among the five different zzso strategies zzso
