zzso of the protein zzso landscape remains a challenging problem, whether it concerns zzso folding mechanisms, predicting native structures or modeling functional zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulation methods enable exhaustive sampling of the energetic landscape at resolutions of biological zzso The general utility of zzso models is reviewed along with their differing levels of zzso zzso zzso models incorporate attractive native interactions and repulsive zzso zzso resulting in an ideal smooth zzso zzso zzso models reduce the zzso set as needed but do not include bias to any desired native zzso While zzso models have achieved limited success in protein zzso they can be combined with native zzso zzso to create a balanced and powerful force zzso Recent applications of such zzso models have yielded insight into complex folding mechanisms and zzso transitions in large zzso The accuracy and usefulness of reduced representations are also revealed to be a function of the mathematical treatment of the intrinsic bonded zzso
