The drift behavior of spiral waves under the influence of a polarized electric field is investigated in the light that both the polarized electric field and the spiral waves possess rotation zzso zzso simulations of a zzso model show that the drift zzso of the spiral tip can be controlled by changing the polarization mode of the polarized electric field and some interesting drift phenomena are zzso When the electric field is zzso polarized and its rotation follows that of the zzso the drift speed of the spiral tip reaches its zzso zzso On the contrary, opposite rotation between the spiral and electric field locks the drift of the spiral zzso zzso results based on the weak deformation approximation are consistent with the zzso zzso We hope that our theoretical results will be observed in experiments, such as the zzso zzso
