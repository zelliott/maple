zzso equation models that describe the dynamic changes of zzso signaling states are important tools to understand cellular zzso An essential task in building such representations is to zzso the zzso rate constants, and other parameters of a model from actual measurement zzso However, intuitive measurement protocols often fail to generate data that restrict the range of possible zzso zzso Here we zzso a zzso method to zzso design optimal zzso zzso zzso experiments in order to reveal pharmacological and kinetic parameters of a zzso zzso zzso second zzso signaling process that is zzso in many zzso The experimental approach included the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by chemically induced recruitment of a regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso and monitoring of the zzso production of zzso lipids using the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso We found that an intuitively planned and established experimental protocol did not yield data from which relevant parameters could be zzso Starting from a set of poorly defined model parameters derived from the intuitively planned experiment, we calculated zzso profiles for both the inducing and the zzso compound that would minimize the predicted uncertainty of zzso zzso Two cycles of zzso and zzso were sufficient to narrowly zzso the model zzso with the mean zzso of estimates dropping more than zzso Thus, optimal experimental design proved to be a powerful strategy to minimize the number of experiments needed to zzso biological parameters from a cell signaling zzso
