The question of whether it is possible to automate the scientific process is of both great theoretical interest and increasing practical importance because, in many scientific areas, data are being generated much faster than they can be effectively zzso We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific zzso The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain zzso devises experiments to test these zzso physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, zzso the results to zzso hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the zzso Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso We built and tested a detailed logical model zzso zzso proteins and zzso of the aromatic zzso acid synthesis zzso In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly zzso with a cost decrease of zzso and zzso zzso both cheapest and zzso zzso
