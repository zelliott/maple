To evaluate usefulness of applying either the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or the three-step zzso (all three zzso for better confirmation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can accurately identify the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso it is used in combination with a zzso zzso zzso line culture zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso for toxins A and B zzso zzso to provide specific evidence of zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 151 zzso stool specimens were tested by zzso zzso zzso and zzso All tests were performed according to the zzso instructions and the results of zzso and zzso zzso were read using a zzso at a wavelength of 450 zzso 

A total of 61 zzso 38 zzso and 52 zzso specimens tested positive with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the sensitivity, zzso negative zzso value, and positive zzso value for zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas for zzso zzso the sensitivity, zzso negative zzso value, and positive zzso value were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the zzso algorithm, all 61 zzso cases required 2 days for zzso With the three-step algorithm, 37 zzso cases were reported immediately, and the remaining 24 zzso required further testing by zzso By applying the zzso algorithm, the workload and cost could be reduced by zzso compared with the three-step zzso 

The zzso zzso is the most practical for accurately detecting zzso zzso zzso but it is zzso
