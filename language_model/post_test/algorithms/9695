zzso zzso experiments are widely used to study the zzso profiles of gene zzso zzso et zzso (2005) developed a method for analyzing zzso zzso studies that can be applied to discovering genes whose expression zzso change over time within a single biological group, or those that follow different time zzso among multiple zzso They estimated the expression zzso of each gene using natural cubic zzso under the zzso (no zzso and alternative zzso zzso and used a goodness of fit test statistic to zzso the zzso The zzso distribution of the statistic was zzso through a zzso zzso Gene expression levels in zzso data are often zzso zzso An accurate type I error control adjusting for multiple testing requires the joint zzso distribution of test statistics for a large number of zzso For this purpose, zzso methods have been widely used because of zzso ease and their intuitive zzso 

In this paper, we propose a zzso multiple testing procedure based on the test statistic used by zzso et zzso zzso We also propose an efficient zzso zzso zzso simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of the zzso multiple testing zzso The application of the proposed method is illustrated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our method is zzso efficient and zzso for identifying genes whose expression levels are zzso in a single biological group and for identifying the genes for which the zzso depends on the group in a zzso zzso
