The advent of zzso zzso across zzso zzso has provided a rich source of information for zzso However the search for zzso from this data is generally performed on a zzso case without any specific hypothesis of the location for zzso that are zzso for the zzso We have designed a method zzso very large zzso lists (several gigabytes in zzso combining several zzso studies at once, can be sorted and traced back to their ultimate consequence in protein zzso Given a working hypothesis, researchers are able to easily search whole zzso zzso data for zzso that link genetic locations to zzso This allows a targeted search for correlations between zzso and potentially relevant systems, rather than utilizing statistical methods zzso zzso returns results that are less data dense, allowing more thorough analysis, including zzso zzso We have applied our method to correlate DNA zzso to cancer zzso using four of the available cancer databases in zzso zzso zzso and derived zzso analysis indicates that zzso previously zzso are statistically zzso zzso zzso from this work link zzso to breast cancer and zzso to prostate cancer with an increase in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations on zzso and one of the zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso provide insights at the atomic level on the functional impact of this cancer related zzso Furthermore, zzso has been designed to allow application to any zzso The program is available upon request from the zzso
