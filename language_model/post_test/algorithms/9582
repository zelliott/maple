Real time zzso of soft tissue deformation is important for the use of zzso reality devices and for providing zzso feedback during operation or surgeon zzso This requires zzso that are fast, accurate and can handle material zzso and large zzso A set of such zzso is presented in this paper, starting with the finite element zzso and the integration scheme used and addressing common problems such as hourglass control and zzso The zzso examples presented prove that by using these zzso real time zzso become possible without sacrificing the accuracy of the zzso For a brain model having more than 7,000 degrees of freedom, we zzso the reaction forces due to zzso with frequency of around 1,000 zzso using a standard dual core zzso Similarly, we conducted simulation of brain shift using a model with more than 50,000 degrees of freedom in less than one zzso The speed benefits of our models result from combining the Total zzso zzso with explicit time integration and low order finite zzso
