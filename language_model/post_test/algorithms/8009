One of the open problems in neural network research is how to automatically determine network zzso for given zzso In this brief, we propose a simple and efficient approach to automatically determine the number of hidden zzso in generalized zzso zzso networks zzso which need not be neural zzso This approach referred to as error minimized extreme learning machine zzso can add random hidden zzso to zzso one by one or group by group (with varying group zzso During the growth of the networks, the output weights are updated zzso The convergence of this approach is proved in this brief as zzso zzso results demonstrate and verify that our new approach is much faster than other zzso zzso with good zzso zzso
