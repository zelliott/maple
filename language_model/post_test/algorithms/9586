This paper presents a novel zzso method for image intensity zzso which is a prerequisite step for any kind of image zzso The method involves a novel application of the zzso zzso that was developed initially for fast reconstruction of zzso images and is based on a linear zzso model with either one or two zzso The latter are estimated by zzso the line zzso zzso using the zzso algorithm, in the zzso joint intensity distribution space of image zzso The proposed zzso method, referred to as zzso Line zzso zzso zzso was compared with three other zzso namely background ratio zzso zzso linear fitting and zzso zzso using a large number of zzso zzso zzso was also compared with BAR zzso when applied to phantom data and two clinical zzso The new method was found to be more accurate and less biased than its counterparts for the range of characteristics selected for the zzso zzso These findings were in agreement with the results from the analysis of the experimental and clinical zzso
