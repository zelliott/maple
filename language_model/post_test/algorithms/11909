zzso models constitute a powerful framework to analyze zzso data from single-channel recordings and model the dynamics of zzso zzso and synaptic transmission between zzso In particular, the accurate simulation of a large number of synaptic zzso in zzso network models may result in a zzso highly demanding zzso We present a generalized consolidating zzso to simulate efficiently a large number of synaptic zzso of the same kind zzso or zzso zzso on an zzso zzso independently modeling each synaptic current by a generic zzso zzso model characterized by zzso constant transition zzso We extend our findings to a class of simplified zzso descriptions of synaptic transmission that incorporate zzso zzso such as short-term zzso depression, and synaptic zzso
