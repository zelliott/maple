zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso is one of the key zzso to detect early neurodegenerative changes in the course of Alzheimer's disease zzso There is active research aimed at identifying automated zzso able to extract accurate zzso indexes from zzso magnetic resonance images zzso Such indexes should be fit for identifying zzso patients as early as zzso 

A reference group composed of zzso patients and 189 zzso controls was used to train and test the zzso It was then applied on a study group composed of zzso zzso subjects, 136 having progressed to clinically probable zzso zzso and 166 having remained stable or recovered to normal condition after a zzso follow-up zzso zzso All subjects came from the zzso zzso 

We sampled the brain with 7 relatively small volumes, mainly centered on the zzso and 2 control zzso These volumes were filtered to give intensity and textural zzso zzso Each filtered region was analyzed with a Random Forest zzso zzso to extract relevant features, which were subsequently processed with a Support zzso zzso zzso zzso Once a prediction model was trained and tested on the reference group, it was used to zzso a zzso index zzso on the zzso cohort and to assess its accuracy in predicting zzso conversion in zzso zzso The performance of the zzso based on the features extracted by the whole 9 volumes is compared with that derived from each single zzso All experiments were performed using a zzso sampling zzso and zzso performance was zzso with a zzso zzso 

We identified a restricted set of image features correlated with the conversion to zzso It is shown that most information originate from a small subset of the total available features, and that it is enough to give a reliable zzso We found zzso highly localized zzso features which alone are responsible for the overall clinical diagnosis and zzso The zzso index is able to discriminate zzso from zzso with an Area Under zzso zzso zzso zzso at specificity zzso and zzso from zzso with an zzso zzso zzso at specificity zzso zzso are separated from zzso zzso with zzso zzso at specificity zzso 

The present automated zzso technique revealed a strong relationship between highly localized zzso features and the baseline clinical zzso In addition, the zzso index was also used to predict the probability of zzso conversion within a time frame of two zzso The definition of a single index combining local analysis of several regions can be useful to detect zzso zzso in a typical zzso zzso
