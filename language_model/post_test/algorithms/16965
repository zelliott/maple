With the decrease of DNA sequencing costs, zzso typing methods are rapidly becoming the gold standard for zzso zzso These methods provide zzso and comparable results needed for a global scale bacterial population analysis, while retaining their usefulness for local zzso zzso Online databases that collect the generated zzso profiles and associated zzso data are available but this wealth of data remains zzso and are frequently poorly zzso since no zzso tool exists to analyze and explore zzso 

zzso is platform independent zzso software that allows the integrated analysis of zzso typing methods, including zzso data generated from whole zzso sequence approaches, and associated zzso zzso zzso and its Minimum zzso Tree expansion are used for visualizing the possible evolutionary relationships between zzso The results can be displayed as an zzso graph zzso the query results of any other zzso data zzso 

zzso is a zzso software that allows the combined analysis of multiple data sources for microbial zzso and population zzso It is freely available at zzso
