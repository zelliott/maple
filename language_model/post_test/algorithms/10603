In this work, a simple method for zzso obtaining the value of the zzso zzso or zzso of the spectral lines zzso by an zzso plasma generated at atmospheric pressure is zzso The value of this zzso indicates the proportion existing between the zzso and zzso components of the total line profile, which can be zzso to a zzso function for our experimental zzso The zzso values found were within the value zzso recorded in the zzso The results obtained showed that the zzso zzso of the lines next to the fundamental level remains practically constant along the plasma column, whereas for the spectral lines involving zzso levels, the zzso is sensitive to the changes in the electron density in the zzso In this work it is also proved that the self-absorption phenomenon zzso errors in the calculation of zzso due to an increase in the broadening of the line profile produced by this zzso
