Human and animal behavior exhibits power law correlations whose origin is zzso In this work, the spontaneous motion of laboratory zzso was recorded during several zzso It is found that animal motion is zzso and that the zzso is introduced by the zzso pauses both by its length as well as by its specific zzso Furthermore, the zzso is also zzso in the rates of event's zzso A comparison with related results in humans is made and candidate models are discussed to provide clues for the origin of such zzso
