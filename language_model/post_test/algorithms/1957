Our previous study indicated that zzso chest zzso could significantly improve zzso performance for lung zzso detection in clinical zzso In this study, the authors further verify that zzso chest zzso can greatly improve the performance of a zzso diagnostic zzso zzso 

Our database consisted of 59 subjects, including 43 subjects with 45 zzso and 16 subjects without zzso The 45 zzso included 7 real and 38 simulated zzso The authors developed a conventional zzso scheme and a new fusion zzso scheme to detect lung zzso The conventional zzso scheme consisted of four steps for zzso identification of initial zzso candidates inside zzso zzso zzso candidate zzso based on dynamic programming, zzso extraction of 33 features from zzso candidates, and zzso false positive reduction using a zzso linear zzso The conventional zzso scheme processed each of the three projection images of a subject independently and discarded the correlation information between the three zzso The fusion zzso scheme included the four steps in the conventional zzso scheme and two additional steps for zzso registration of all candidates in the three images of a subject, and zzso integration of correlation information between the registered candidates in the three zzso The integration step retained all candidates detected at least twice in the three images of a subject and removed those detected only once in the three images as false zzso A zzso testing method was used for evaluation of the performance levels of the two zzso zzso 

At the sensitivities of zzso zzso and zzso our conventional zzso scheme reported zzso zzso and zzso false zzso per image, respectively, whereas our fusion zzso scheme reported zzso zzso and zzso false zzso per image, and zzso zzso and zzso false zzso per patient, zzso The low performance of the conventional zzso scheme may be attributed to the high noise level in chest zzso and the small size and low contrast of most zzso 

This study indicated that the fusion of correlation information in zzso chest zzso can markedly improve the performance of zzso scheme for lung zzso zzso
