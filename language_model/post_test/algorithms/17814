The thesis of this review is that fully assembled zzso pathways in living systems, rather than genes or zzso are the true units of function in biology and zzso A zzso is that measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso is thereby required to understand zzso control and gene zzso Recent zzso advances for improving zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques discussed here include mass zzso distribution analysis zzso zzso for measurement of zzso zzso zzso administration, for measuring synthesis of DNA zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other classes of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by sampling zzso zzso in accessible body zzso after zzso labeling of the zzso zzso and measurement of multiple molecular zzso zzso particularly through use of zzso Examples are given of zzso zzso measured by each of these techniques, noting the zzso zzso It is concluded that the introduction of zzso zzso as tools for zzso zzso could radically alter many signature areas of contemporary biology, including functional zzso drug discovery and development, and disease zzso
