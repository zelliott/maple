The shape of a cell, the sizes of zzso zzso and the spatial distribution of molecules within the zzso can all control how molecules interact to produce a cellular zzso This chapter describes how these spatial features can be included in zzso mathematical models of cell zzso The zzso Cell zzso modeling and simulation software is used to illustrate the considerations required to build a spatial zzso An explanation of how to appropriately choose between physical zzso that implicitly or explicitly account for cell geometry and between deterministic versus zzso zzso for molecular dynamics is zzso along with a discussion of their respective strengths and zzso As a first step toward constructing a spatial model, the geometry needs to be specified and associated with the zzso zzso and membrane flux processes of the zzso zzso conditions, diffusion zzso zzso and boundary conditions complete the specifications required to define the mathematics of the zzso The zzso methods used to solve zzso problems both zzso and zzso are then described and some guidance is provided in how to set up and run zzso A study of zzso signaling in zzso ends the chapter, providing an example of the insights that can be gained in interpreting experimental results through the application of spatial zzso
