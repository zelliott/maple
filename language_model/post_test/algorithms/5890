The aim of salient feature detection is to find distinctive local events in zzso zzso features are generally determined from the local differential structure of zzso They focus on the zzso of the local zzso The majority of these detectors are zzso which has the disadvantage that the distinctiveness of the local color information is completely ignored in determining salient image zzso To fully exploit the possibilities of salient point detection in color images, color distinctiveness should be taken into account in addition to shape zzso In this paper, color distinctiveness is explicitly incorporated into the design of zzso zzso The algorithm, called color zzso zzso is based on an analysis of the statistics of color image zzso Color zzso boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature zzso zzso show that substantial improvements in information content are acquired by targeting color salient zzso
