zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso zzso zzso allow the acquisition of quantitative three-dimensional zzso flow by zzso the zzso shift caused by moving zzso zzso the zzso of red blood cells is currently the principal application of these zzso In many biological zzso blood flow is often perpendicular to the optical zzso creating the need for a quantitative measurement of lateral zzso Previous work has shown that lateral flow can be measured from the zzso zzso albeit only for simplified optical zzso In this work, we present a generalized model to analyze the influence of relevant zzso system parameters such as light source spectrum, zzso zzso and beam geometry on the zzso zzso Our analysis results in a general framework relating the mean and zzso of the zzso frequency to the zzso and lateral flow zzso zzso Based on this model, we present an zzso acquisition protocol and zzso to reconstruct quantitative zzso of lateral and zzso flow from the zzso spectrum for any given zzso zzso To validate this approach, zzso spectrum analysis is employed to zzso measure flow in a zzso with both extended focus zzso and zzso
