The zzso zzso of zzso pressure zzso zzso holds essential information about zzso and cerebrovascular zzso Automatic analysis of the zzso zzso may help to predict abnormal increase of zzso and thus prevent severe complications in patients treated for traumatic brain injuries zzso This article describes a zzso framework to track the zzso zzso zzso in real zzso The model represents the correlation between different zzso zzso metrics extracted within a single pulse as well as the zzso dependence of metrics extracted between successive zzso zzso tracking is solved using zzso zzso in a dynamic zzso model that associates a random variable to each zzso zzso
