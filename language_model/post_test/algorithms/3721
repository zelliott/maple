The purpose of this article is to explore the use of the accelerated exhaustive search strategy for developing and zzso methods for zzso beam zzso for zzso radiation therapy zzso Combining zzso zzso zzso with intensity distribution zzso is expected to improve the quality of zzso treatment zzso However, zzso is one of the most difficult problems to solve adequately because of the huge zzso of possible beam zzso zzso selecting 7 of 36 zzso spaced zzso beams would require the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso approximation technique for high-speed zzso of zzso dose zzso was used in combination with a fast zzso search zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso In the IV zzso it is assumed that the change in intensity of a ray (or zzso zzso changes dose along the zzso Evidence is presented that the IV approximation is valid for zzso The scatter contribution at points away from the ray is accounted for fully in zzso zzso after the optimum beam orientation has been zzso zzso for all candidate beam angles are generated before the start of zzso For all zzso of beams selected from a given pool of beams zzso 5 of 24 zzso spaced zzso the distribution of planning scores for the best and the worst plans, optimum angle zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for one prostate and two lung cancer zzso The results of the exhaustive search technique were used to develop a zzso search zzso In this approach, a smaller number of beams zzso three) is first used to explore the zzso of solutions to determine the most preferred and the least preferred zzso The results of such exploration are then used as a starting point for determining an optimum zzso zzso a larger number of beams zzso zzso This zzso process is considerably faster than full exhaustive zzso The question to be answered was whether the two methods lead to the same or similar zzso The results of exhaustive search and zzso approaches were also compared with a previously published approach that used zzso zzso zzso 

The relative ranks of plans zzso by an accurate dose calculation method were highly correlated with those of the plans zzso by the fast calculation method zzso using the IV zzso which suggests that an approximate dose calculation zzso can be used effectively for ranking of plans during zzso We found that dose zzso and zzso of many beam zzso within a specified subset from a given pool of beams zzso 5 of zzso may be clinically indistinguishable and zzso Their zzso zzso scores fall in a narrow range, although beam zzso and dose zzso may be zzso We used the frequency zzso as a function of beam angles for the best 100 and the worst 100 plans to determine the most and the least preferred beam zzso We found that the most and the least preferred angle zzso for 3 of 18 zzso were very similar to those for 5, 6, 7, or 8 of 18 or 24 zzso but the size of the search space was much smaller for the 3 of 18 zzso Using fewer than three beams was discovered to be zzso This information was used to select the most preferred angles and eliminate the least preferred ones before searching for the optimum angles for the remaining zzso For the cases we studies, the zzso strategy produced very similar results to the full exhaustive zzso Based on the observation that the worst plans had at least one zzso pair of beams and virtually all of the best plans had none, we were able to further reduce the size of the search space dramatically by using a pool of only zzso zzso beams zzso 7 of 19 instead of 7 of zzso Another observation was that the probability of finding an optimum zzso in a smaller beam pool is substantially lower than in a larger pool zzso 5 of 18 zzso 5 of zzso The implication of this zzso is not very important when a large number of beams zzso or more) is used and vice zzso Our results showed that the plans with fewer but zzso placed beams could be as good as or better than plans using a larger number of zzso or zzso placed zzso 

Exhaustive search with fast zzso zzso provides a novel and realistic approach to study the characteristics of zzso dose zzso as a function of beam angles and to design practical zzso strategies for zzso zzso
