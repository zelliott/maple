The difficulty of zzso zzso patients increases zzso to the panel zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of the high likelihood of a positive final zzso these patients are often excluded from a prospective transplant unless there is a 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso To address this problem, we developed a computerized algorithm, termed the Kentucky zzso Testing System zzso that predicts class I zzso zzso that would be both zzso and zzso to the zzso This report describes the results of a prospective trial among voluntarily participating centers that agreed to share zzso based on the zzso predictions for patients whose zzso exceeded zzso 

The results of three zzso screens on each patient were compared with the zzso zzso of the cells in the panel in zzso tables with calculation of zzso and correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso and public zzso were identified and a list of acceptable and unacceptable zzso were entered into the zzso computer for each patient listed in the zzso sharing zzso 

Of the total zzso patients meeting the zzso criteria, the largest single group submitted was zzso zzso The mean zzso of the patients was zzso The first transplant via zzso allocation was performed on March 8, zzso Between that time and the last transplant on July 31, 2000, 145 zzso were offered to the participating centers and 48 transplants were zzso Of the many reasons listed for not accepting an offer or not zzso the shared kidney into its intended recipient, only two occurred because of a positive T cell zzso and six because of a positive B cell zzso As compared to all other high zzso patients within Southeastern zzso zzso Foundation who were transplanted during the study period, they were more likely to be zzso to be less well matched for private zzso B, and DR zzso and to have waited for a longer time than the other zzso Although there was a higher zzso of delayed graft function, there was no significant difference in cold zzso rejection episodes, or patient or graft zzso 

We conclude that zzso or some other system to zzso identify a list of acceptable and unacceptable zzso zzso could improve the access of highly zzso patients to a successful kidney zzso
