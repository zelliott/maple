We have developed a new package of computer programs and zzso for different zzso applications, including zzso zzso multiplex zzso and long zzso The package is included in the upcoming zzso suite software and attempts to incorporate most of the current knowledge about zzso primer zzso A wide range of primer characteristics is available for user manipulation to provide improved efficiency and increased flexibility of primer zzso To accelerate the primer calculations, we have zzso zzso using recent advances in computer science such as dynamic trees and lazy zzso Proper structural organization of input parameters provides further program zzso New zzso zzso primer design software allows calculations of primer pairs for long zzso amplification of zzso zzso DNA in 5 zzso under most stringent input parameters and zzso 435 primer pairs for multiplex zzso within 30 zzso on a standard zzso III zzso Our program allows the user to take advantage of zzso zzso by applying different kinds of filtering features during zzso primer zzso
