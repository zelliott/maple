Recent studies have demonstrated poor reliability of the King et zzso zzso of idiopathic zzso The purpose of the present work was to determine whether the reliability of the King zzso would be improved by employing zzso rules for zzso zzso in a computer zzso Thus the only possible source of zzso in zzso a given zzso would be variable landmark identification on the zzso zzso of the four zzso of each zzso and zzso vertebra were obtained by zzso zzso using the central zzso line to define the zzso A computer zzso located curve zzso as the most zzso deviated vertebra in a range of two above to two below a change in the sign of zzso zzso End zzso of each curve were located as those with the greatest tilt of the superior zzso end zzso or inferior zzso end zzso In a zzso curve, the zzso vertebra was defined as zzso the zzso if all four corners laid on one side of the vertical central zzso zzso zzso were defined as in Table I in King et zzso except that curve flexibility data were not zzso The zzso was verified on the five examples in King et zzso It then classified the six examples in zzso et zzso and zzso et zzso which were classified zzso by human zzso The zzso was also tested on 33 zzso of 17 patients with zzso 8 zzso were repeat marked by two zzso The zzso overcame accuracy and reliability problems, except in rare cases when it was borderline whether or not a zzso curve crossed the zzso when the zzso level was zzso or when a Cobb angle was close to 10 zzso
