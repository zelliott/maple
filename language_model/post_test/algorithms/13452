One of the major complications of diabetes is diabetic zzso As manual analysis and diagnosis of large amount of images are time zzso automatic detection and grading of diabetic zzso are zzso In this paper, we use zzso zzso zzso and color zzso images zzso extract 6 features employing zzso zzso and feed them to support zzso machine in order to determine diabetic zzso severity zzso These features are area of blood vessels, area, zzso of zzso avascular zone, and the number of zzso zzso total number of zzso and area of zzso In order to extract zzso and vessels, we respectively modify zzso zzso of color zzso images and zzso The end points of extracted vessels in zzso region of interest based on zzso disk are connected together to segment zzso avascular zone zzso To extract zzso from zzso first extracted vessels are zzso from original image, and after removing detected background by zzso operators and enhancing bright small zzso zzso are zzso 70 patients were involved in this study to zzso diabetic zzso into 3 groups, that is, zzso no diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetic zzso zzso severe zzso diabetic zzso and our simulations show that the proposed system has sensitivity and specificity of zzso for zzso
