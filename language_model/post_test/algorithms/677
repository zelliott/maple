In studies designed to compare different methods of measurement where more than two methods are compared or replicate zzso by each method are available, standard statistical approaches such as zzso of limits of agreement are not directly zzso A model is presented for comparing several methods of measurement in the situation where replicate zzso by each method are zzso zzso are viewed as classified by method, subject and zzso Models assuming zzso as well as zzso replicates are zzso A fitting zzso is presented that allows the zzso of linear relationships between methods as well as relevant zzso zzso The zzso only uses methods already implemented in most statistical zzso
