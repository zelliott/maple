The loss of zzso zzso in the zzso cartilage is an early signature of zzso zzso The ensuing changes in the fixed charge density in the cartilage can be directly linked to sodium concentration via charge zzso zzso zzso in the knee joint appear in two pools: in the zzso zzso or joint zzso where the zzso are in free motion and bound within the cartilage tissue where the zzso zzso have a restricted zzso The zzso in these two compartments have therefore different zzso and zzso relaxation zzso The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a zzso zzso zzso TE zzso sodium sequence by implementing an inversion recovery zzso preparation of the zzso at zzso This method could allow a more accurate and more sensitive zzso of loss of PG in patients with zzso It is shown that zzso zzso offer significantly improved performance in terms of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso when compared to the hard pulse zzso Power deposition considerations further pose a limit to the zzso inversion power, and we demonstrate in simulations and experiments how a practical compromise can be struck between clean suppression of fluid signals and power deposition zzso Two zzso sequences with different types of inversion zzso (a zzso pulse and an zzso zzso were tested on a liquid zzso ex zzso on a human knee zzso and then in zzso on five healthy volunteers, with a zzso resolution of zzso zzso and a zzso ratio of zzso in cartilage without zzso and zzso with zzso Due to specific zzso rate limitations, the total acquisition time was zzso zzso for the zzso zzso sequence without inversion or with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso sequence generates a more uniform fluid suppression over the whole sample than the zzso zzso zzso
