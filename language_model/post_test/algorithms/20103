zzso time since last zzso zzso exposure is important in clinical, workplace, and forensic zzso zzso models calculating time of last exposure from whole blood zzso typically employ a theoretical zzso whole zzso zzso zzso No studies previously evaluated zzso models utilizing zzso zzso ratios, or whole blood zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

Ten male zzso daily zzso smokers received escalating zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso for 8 zzso zzso were zzso in whole blood and plasma by two-dimensional gas zzso zzso 

zzso whole blood zzso occurred zzso h after the first oral zzso dose and zzso zzso zzso during multiple zzso zzso Median zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models utilizing these zzso ratios accurately estimated last zzso exposure in zzso and zzso of specimens collected within zzso after a single oral zzso dose and throughout multiple zzso zzso Models were only zzso and zzso accurate zzso and zzso after the last zzso dose, zzso 

zzso models zzso time since last zzso intake from whole blood and plasma zzso zzso were inaccurate during zzso but highly accurate during active zzso zzso zzso zzso from large zzso body stores and high circulating zzso zzso create different zzso profiles than those in less than daily zzso smokers that were used to derive the zzso Thus, the models do not accurately predict time of last zzso intake in individuals consuming zzso zzso
