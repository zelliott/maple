Respiratory motion poses a major challenge in lung zzso Based on zzso CT images, a variety of zzso zzso registration techniques have been proposed to study the pulmonary zzso However, the accuracy achievable with these approaches can be zzso because the deformation is defined globally in zzso zzso the accuracy of the alignment of local structures may be zzso In this work, we propose a novel method to detect a large collection of natural junction structures in the lung and use them as the reliable markers to track the lung zzso Specifically, detection of the junction centers and sizes is achieved by analysis of local shape profiles on one segmented zzso To track the zzso trajectory of a zzso the image zzso within a small region of interest surrounding the center are selected as its zzso Under the assumption of the zzso motion, we describe the trajectory by a closed zzso curve and search for the control points by maximizing a metric of combined correlation zzso Local zzso are suppressed by improving the initial conditions using random walks from zzso zzso Several zzso are introduced to analyze the motion zzso Our method was applied to 13 real zzso CT zzso More than 700 junctions in each case are detected with an average positive zzso value of greater than zzso The average tracking error between automated and manual tracking is zzso and smaller than the published results using the same set of zzso
