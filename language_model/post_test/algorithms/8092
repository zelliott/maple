A new class of open zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed in order to overcome the limitations of standard zzso cavities and zzso zzso at zzso zzso This paper presents the first applications of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso electron zzso resonance zzso It consists of a zzso cavity having a lateral zzso that represents about zzso of its total zzso zzso zzso performed on different samples show that the zzso ratio and the optimal pulse length obtained with the proposed device are comparable to those obtained with the closed cavity used in the commercial zzso zzso at both zzso and room zzso Similar results have been obtained for zzso species zzso activated by means of an optical fiber inserted in the zzso of the zzso The zzso losses estimated for the probe employed with the zzso zzso are higher than those of the commercial probe, zzso demonstrating that the proposed cavity holds the promise of improved zzso zzso
