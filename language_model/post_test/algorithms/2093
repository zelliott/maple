The structural comparison of proteins has become increasingly important as a means to identify protein motifs and fold zzso In this paper we present a new zzso for the comparison of proteins based on a hierarchy of structural zzso from the secondary structure level to the atomic zzso Our technique represents zzso and zzso as zzso and uses a set of seven scoring functions to compare pairs of zzso from different zzso The scores obtained are used in a dynamic programming zzso that finds the best local alignment of the two sets of zzso The second step in our zzso is based on the atomic coordinates of the protein structures and improves the initial zzso alignment by zzso minimizing the zzso between pairs of nearest atoms from the two zzso We refine the final alignment by determining a core of well aligned atoms and minimizing the zzso of this zzso In a comparison of our method to zzso and Sander's zzso algorithm, our program was able to detect structural similarity at the same level as zzso We also performed searches of a representative set of the zzso Data Bank zzso using our program and detected structurally similarity between several zzso related zzso
