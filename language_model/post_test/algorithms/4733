zzso techniques were combined with zzso zzso to realize zzso scaffolds resembling zzso zzso The scaffolds were seeded with human zzso cells in zzso as well as in zzso with human zzso To enhance the process of zzso zzso cells were zzso with an zzso zzso carrying the gene for human tissue zzso The results demonstrate that both the presence of a structured scaffold as well as zzso in zzso contribute zzso to the promotion of a metabolically active zzso The zzso scaffolds have several possible applications for example in zzso tissue engineering and therapeutic zzso A broader implication of these results is that zzso cellular zzso and zzso interactions cooperate zzso both at a zzso as well as zzso zzso
