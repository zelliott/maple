We introduce a method for quickly determining the rate of implicit zzso 

The task involves making a zzso prediction for a zzso sequence over 10 minutes; from this it is possible to determine the influence of events of a different number of trials in the past on the current zzso This profile directly reflects the learning rate zzso of a large class of learning zzso including the delta and zzso zzso To illustrate the use of the method, we compare a person with zzso with normal controls and we compare people with induced happy and sad zzso 

Learning on the task is likely both zzso and zzso We argue theoretically and demonstrate zzso that both zzso and also transient negative moods can be associated with an especially large learning rate: People with zzso can learn quickly and happy people zzso
