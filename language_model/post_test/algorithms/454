To identify operative zzso zzso and long-term outcome after operative treatment for symptomatic zzso liver disease zzso and develop a treatment zzso for patients with zzso 

zzso represents a challenging clinical problem that can result in massive zzso and various zzso leading to significant decline in health status and quality of zzso The optimal surgical treatment for this disease is still zzso 

All patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso or liver transplantation for zzso from 1985 to 2006 were identified zzso zzso outcomes were evaluated by patient zzso Mean follow-up was 8 zzso zzso zzso 

Of 141 patients zzso zzso age: 51 zzso 1 zzso with zzso 117 had zzso zzso kidney zzso All patients suffered from symptomatic zzso with zzso being functionally impaired zzso Cooperative Oncology Group Performance zzso zzso Despite significant inferior zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso function was commonly zzso A total of 124 patients underwent partial zzso with zzso zzso 10 underwent zzso zzso alone, and 7 underwent liver transplantation for primary treatment of zzso zzso operative morbidity and mortality was zzso and zzso respectively, with major complications zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 10-year survival was zzso and zzso zzso Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance zzso performance status zzso or improved in zzso of patients and zzso returned to work zzso At zzso health survey scores were similar to the general population despite subsequent recurrence of symptoms in zzso of zzso 

Selective patients with massive zzso from zzso benefit from operative zzso The type of operation performed is mainly dependent on the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso and zzso preservation, and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be performed with acceptable morbidity and zzso prompt and durable relief of symptoms, and maintenance of liver zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso though effective in selected patients, are less broadly zzso
