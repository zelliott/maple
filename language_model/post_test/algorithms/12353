The zzso simulation environment has been extended to support parallel network zzso Each zzso zzso the equations for its zzso over an zzso equal to the minimum zzso zzso spike generation to zzso spike delivery connection zzso The performance of three published network models with very different spike patterns exhibits zzso zzso on zzso clusters and demonstrates that spike communication overhead is often less than the benefit of an increased fraction of the entire problem fitting into high speed zzso On the zzso zzso Blue zzso almost linear zzso was obtained up to 100 zzso zzso one model from 500 to 40,000 realistic cells exhibited almost linear zzso on 2,000 processors, with an integration time of zzso seconds and communication time of zzso zzso The potential for zzso of several orders of magnitude makes practical the running of large network simulations that could otherwise not be zzso
