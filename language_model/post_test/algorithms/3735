This paper is devoted to presenting a new strategy for zzso objects recognition using a flexible similarity measure based on the recent Modeling Wave zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso allows us to establish an zzso relationship in zzso objects modeling zzso Using the complete object model, a study on considering different partial information of the model has been carried out to recognize an zzso For this, we have introduced a new feature called zzso zzso which originates from the zzso zzso zzso gives an extended geometrical surroundings knowledge for every zzso of the mesh model and allows us to define a robust and adaptable similarity measure between objects for a specific model zzso The defined similarity metric has been successfully tested in our lab using range data of a wide variety of zzso zzso Finally, we show the zzso of our method presenting zzso for recognition on noise and zzso conditions in complex zzso
