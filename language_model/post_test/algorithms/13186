This study intends to develop protocols for sampling and characterizing zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso in zzso or during inhalation zzso zzso dry powder containing zzso combined with soot and metal zzso form complex zzso and diverse zzso The aerosols, examined in this study, were produced using an zzso zzso Representative samples were collected from an exposure chamber using filters and a cascade zzso for microscopic and zzso zzso zzso from filters showed that a density of zzso particles per zzso filter surface provided adequate samples for particle counting and zzso zzso counting indicated that zzso zzso at a concentration of zzso contained zzso zzso Each particle structure contained an average of 18 zzso resulting in a total of zzso zzso In addition, zzso particles within the zzso had a count median length of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso while the zzso particles had a count median diameter of zzso zzso A combination of zzso and microscopic zzso established that the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the mixture was zzso zzso It was also determined that the mean effective density of zzso zzso particles was between zzso and zzso and the mean shape factor of individual zzso was between zzso and zzso The information obtained from this study can be used for designing animal inhalation exposure studies and adopted as guidance for sampling and characterizing zzso zzso in zzso The measurement scheme should be relevant for any carbon zzso zzso
