zzso stimulation represents a useful tool for zzso investigation of zzso excitable cells such as zzso The stimulation threshold and zzso response to precisely timed zzso yields valuable information regarding zzso zzso However, determining these parameters accurately, while simultaneously resolving zzso or transient effects has been difficult or impossible with previous zzso This paper presents a zzso zzso controller used for zzso electrical stimulation of zzso zzso zzso cultured on, and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso We introduce the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to control using capture zzso a low data rate, highly zzso feedback zzso describing stimulation zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and resulting parameters were used to develop a representative model of partial capture, enabling extensive analysis of the zzso The performance of this approach is compared via computer simulation to a previously introduced conditional convergence zzso to zzso its performance and relative zzso Operation of the zzso is demonstrated by tracking the real-time biological response of stimulation threshold to a rapid increase in zzso zzso concentration in four independent cell zzso This work enables the use of stimulation threshold as a zzso continuously monitored zzso with considerable utility in cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso
