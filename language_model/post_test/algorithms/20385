Five functions of merit were used for the registration of zzso brain zzso zzso The correlation zzso zzso the zzso sign change zzso the standard zzso of ratios zzso the sum of the absolute differences zzso and a new function based on a local correlation zzso zzso were tested in the registration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Wada zzso zzso zzso The comparison included simulated and real zzso The translation error in registration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all functions of merit for the complete set of simulated studies (10 runs for each ACT, zzso and zzso For zzso zzso yielded the best results with a mean error of zzso zzso zzso degree and a maximum error of zzso zzso zzso higher errors were found with zzso zzso zzso zzso degree, maximum zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso degree, maximum zzso zzso The highest errors were found with zzso zzso zzso zzso degree, maximum zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees, maximum zzso zzso The results obtained from five real studies of ACT, of zzso and of zzso were in agreement with the findings from the simulated studies, thus confirming the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for the registration of zzso brain zzso zzso
