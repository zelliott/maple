An zzso zzso zzso was used to determine accurately the zzso distribution of the mobile phase zzso and of the column efficiency at the exit of three common zzso zzso namely a 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso bonded zzso monolithic column, a 150 zzso zzso zzso column packed with zzso zzso porous shell particles of zzso bonded zzso zzso and a 150 zzso zzso zzso column packed with 3 zzso fully porous zzso bonded zzso particles zzso The results obtained demonstrate that all three columns are not zzso zzso In all three cases, the efficiency was found to be lower in the wall region of the column than in its core region (the central core with a radius of 1/3 the column inner zzso The decrease in local efficiency from the core to the wall regions was lower in the case of the zzso zzso zzso than in that of the two zzso columns zzso zzso The mobile phase zzso was found to be zzso zzso higher in the wall than in the core region of the monolithic column while, in contrast, it was zzso zzso lower in the wall region for the two zzso zzso
