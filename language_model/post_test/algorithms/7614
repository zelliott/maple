During the last decade, many approaches have been proposed for improving the zzso of diffusion zzso These techniques have already shown an increase in accuracy based on theoretical considerations, such as incorporating prior knowledge of the data zzso The increased accuracy of diffusion metric zzso is typically observed in zzso simulations, where the assumptions regarding properties of the data distribution are known to be zzso In practice, however, correcting for subject motion and geometric zzso current zzso alters the data distribution tremendously such that it can no longer be expressed in a closed zzso The image processing steps that zzso the model fitting will render several assumptions on the data distribution zzso potentially zzso the benefit of applying more advanced diffusion zzso In this work, we present a generic diffusion model fitting framework that considers some statistics of diffusion zzso zzso A central role in the framework is played by the conditional least squares zzso We demonstrate that the accuracy of that particular zzso can generally be zzso regardless the applied zzso steps, if the noise zzso is known a zzso To fulfill that condition, we also propose an approach for the zzso of zzso varying noise zzso
