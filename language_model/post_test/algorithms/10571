A new measure, to zzso the difference between two probability zzso called the zzso zzso has been zzso Based on the zzso zzso a new zzso zzso to partition a given zzso or DNA sequence into zzso distinct zzso is put zzso The new zzso has been applied to segment the 24 human zzso zzso and the boundaries of zzso for each zzso were zzso Compared with the results obtained by using the zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso both zzso resulted in all identical coordinates of zzso zzso An explanation of the zzso of the two zzso zzso is zzso The new zzso has a number of zzso zzso it is much simpler and faster than the zzso zzso zzso the new zzso is more suitable for analyzing long zzso zzso such as human and other newly zzso zzso zzso zzso
