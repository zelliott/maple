A computer analysis of zzso protein sequences zzso about zzso of the zzso coli gene products was performed using methods for database screening with individual sequences and alignment zzso A high fraction of zzso coli zzso significant sequence similarity to other proteins in current zzso about zzso show conservation at least at the level of zzso related bacteria, and about zzso contain ancient zzso regions zzso shared with zzso or zzso zzso For zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso either functional information or sequence zzso or both, are zzso zzso percent of the zzso coli proteins belong to 299 clusters of zzso zzso zzso defined on the basis of zzso zzso Another zzso could be included in 70 zzso using motif detection zzso The majority of the clusters contain only two to four zzso In contrast, nearly zzso of all zzso coli proteins belong to the four largest zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that bacterial protein sequences generally are highly zzso in evolution, with about 50% of all zzso protein families represented among the zzso coli gene zzso With the current sequence databases and methods of their zzso computer analysis yields useful information on the functions and evolutionary relationships of the vast majority of genes in a bacterial zzso zzso similarity with zzso coli proteins allows the prediction of functions for a number of important zzso zzso including several whose products are implicated in human zzso
