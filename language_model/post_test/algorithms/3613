zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the electroencephalogram zzso is generally difficult when both zzso and zzso are zzso In this paper we focus on the problem of zzso zzso in particular those observed in some zzso zzso assumed causing random delays of zzso due to an abnormal zzso of the zzso The technique developed in this paper, called the Time zzso Correction zzso method, allows us to estimate the averaged zzso by an optimal alignment of responses based on a correlation zzso We demonstrate that the zzso method avoids wave zzso generally produced with the classical ensemble averaging method, especially in the case when the hypothesis of the time delay zzso is zzso The zzso method is performed using simulated zzso zzso algorithm, since the criterion to be zzso is zzso Real signals recorded from pathological subjects are used to validate the model of zzso
