To zzso nuclear zzso texture in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of low zzso potential zzso 

zzso three zzso features were zzso on zzso and zzso stained sections from 20 zzso zzso 10 from patients with a solitary zzso zzso who were disease free during at least eight years' follow up, and 10 from patients with zzso zzso one or more zzso being seen during follow zzso 

zzso analysis was used to search for features showing significant differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was better than zzso for more than 20 zzso Based on significance, six texture features were selected for zzso zzso zzso linear zzso analysis reduced zzso zzso to zzso indicating a highly significant difference between the two zzso data sets, but only modest ability to discriminate zzso correct case zzso A box sequential zzso was used based on data derived from zzso zzso The zzso took three zzso steps and classified 19 of the 20 cases correctly zzso correct case zzso To determine whether significant case grouping could also be obtained based on an objective zzso the merged data sets of zzso and zzso cases were submitted to the zzso learning zzso zzso Two clusters were formed with significant zzso The subsequent application of a zzso zzso resulted in an overall correct case zzso rate of zzso 

zzso and zzso analyses detect zzso differences in zzso zzso state between zzso and zzso zzso thus allowing identification of zzso that do or do not zzso
