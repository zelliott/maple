zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso uses respiratory gating combined with acquisition of zzso data for the entire heart in a single zzso which permits reconstruction of any plane with high zzso We investigated the optimal scan parameters and compared zzso with the conventional scanning zzso 

We employed inversion recovery zzso fast field echo using a zzso system and scan zzso repetition time zzso zzso zzso echo time zzso zzso zzso number of zzso 2; parallel imaging factor, zzso zzso size, 128 zzso zzso field of view zzso 320 zzso 320 zzso and acquisition slice zzso 3 zzso zzso slice zzso zzso zzso Five healthy volunteers underwent scanning during free breathing with real-time motion zzso from which we determined optimal scan zzso We then used those parameters to scan 25 patients with zzso zzso to compare scan time and image quality between the zzso and conventional zzso zzso methods zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso size, 128 zzso zzso 

zzso in volunteers showed optimal scan parameters of zzso flip angle, fat suppression turned off in zzso and zzso zzso In clinical cases, scan times did not differ zzso zzso of the margins of normal zzso at the zzso of the heart and contrast between enhanced and zzso zzso improved significantly with zzso 

zzso yields high resolution images during free breathing and is considered useful for accurately zzso the area and zzso extent of zzso zzso
