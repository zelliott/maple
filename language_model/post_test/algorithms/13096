Single zzso of the free radical zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso and carbon zzso zzso were characterized by the X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The X-ray structural analysis and zzso zzso showed that the zzso form zzso from zzso zzso is zzso free, whereas that one obtained from zzso zzso is a zzso of the composition zzso Principal values of the zzso were estimated by the zzso zzso zzso at room and low (10 zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the presence of zzso coupled zzso in both types of zzso However, the way of zzso as well as the strength of exchange zzso are different in the two zzso samples, which is in zzso with their crystal zzso The obtained results improved parameters accuracy and enabled better understanding of properties of zzso as a standard sample in the zzso zzso
