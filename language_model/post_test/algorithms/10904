The zzso and distribution of normally placed and displaced A horizontal cells were studied in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso zzso size reaches a minimum in the visual streak, of about 9,000 zzso and increases toward the retinal periphery both in the zzso and zzso zzso There is a zzso zzso with zzso cells being larger than zzso cells at equal distances from the zzso The peak value for cell density of 281 zzso 28 zzso occurs in the center of the visual streak, decreasing toward the zzso and zzso retinal zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso Along the visual streak, the decline in cell density is less zzso remaining between zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso horizontal cells are rare and occur in the retinal zzso They tend to be smaller than normally placed horizontal cells in the zzso region, whilst no systematic difference was observed between the two cell groups in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso analysis and the Ripley zzso When mosaic zzso was determined removing the displaced horizontal cells, there was a slight increase in the conformity ratio, but the zzso Ripley function indicated some repulsive dependence between the two zzso Both results were near the level of zzso A similar analysis performed in the zzso zzso a closely related zzso zzso bearing a higher density of displaced horizontal cells than found in the zzso suggested spatial independence between the two zzso normally placed versus displaced horizontal zzso
