zzso systems are often used to model anatomical structures in medical zzso They can produce plausible zzso in soft zzso and are zzso zzso zzso zzso values for a stable zzso system can be zzso Previously stable models can become unstable with zzso changes, such as during zzso In this paper, we derive bounds for the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Our zzso can be used to evaluate the stability for user specified zzso values, or to zzso values that are unconditionally zzso
