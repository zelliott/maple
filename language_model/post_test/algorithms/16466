The zzso nuclear spin polarization zzso that can be achieved via zzso optical pumping zzso is typically limited at high zzso xenon zzso zzso due primarily to corresponding reductions in the zzso metal electron spin polarization zzso zzso caused by increased zzso zzso zzso While demonstrating the utility of volume holographic grating zzso zzso for zzso zzso we recently reported zzso zzso et zzso zzso 197 zzso zzso an anomalous dependence of the observed zzso on the zzso xenon partial pressure zzso wherein zzso values were zzso low at decreased zzso peaked at moderate zzso zzso zzso and remained surprisingly elevated at relatively high zzso values zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso zzso it is shown that the above effects result from an unexpected, inverse relationship between the xenon partial pressure and the optimal cell temperature zzso for zzso zzso This zzso appears to result directly from changes in the efficiency of one or more components of the zzso zzso process, and can be exploited to achieve improved zzso with relatively high xenon zzso measured at high field (including averaged zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 50, zzso 500, and 2000 zzso zzso
