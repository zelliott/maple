Various experimental techniques yield peptides that are biologically active but have zzso pharmacological zzso The design of structurally similar organic compounds, zzso zzso zzso is a challenging field in medicinal zzso 

zzso identifies compounds that mimic parts of a zzso or positions in proteins that are suitable for inserting zzso The application provides libraries that contain zzso building blocks on the one hand and protein structures on the zzso The search for promising zzso zzso for a given zzso is based on the zzso of the zzso with several zzso of the zzso New synthetic elements or proteins can be imported and used for zzso 

We present a zzso user interface for finding zzso zzso that can be inserted into a protein or for fitting small molecules into a zzso Using zzso promising locations in proteins for the zzso of zzso can be found quickly and zzso
