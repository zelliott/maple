The phase problem has been formulated as one of constrained global zzso and it leads to the minimal principle, which is the theoretical basis of zzso zzso for the automatic solution of the phase problem, zzso zzso A related approach zzso zzso that, as in zzso zzso phase refinement in zzso space with density modification in real space, has recently been zzso The traditional techniques of direct methods have been integrated with zzso replacement and anomalous scattering and the first applications have been zzso The accurate measurement of a limited number of structure zzso by means of multiple beam X-ray zzso has become a zzso A feasibility study shows that, in combination with the direct method, the ability to measure the values of the structure zzso zzso will strengthen existing zzso
