When matching images for applications such as zzso and zzso zzso the distribution of features across the overlap region affects the accuracy of the zzso This paper uses the spatial statistics of these features, measured by Ripley's zzso to assess whether feature matches are clustered together or spread around the overlap zzso A comparison of the performances of a dozen state-of-the-art feature detectors is then carried out using analysis of zzso and a large image zzso zzso show that zzso introduces significantly less zzso than the other detectors zzso When the detectors are zzso by this performance measure, the order is broadly similar to those obtained by other means, suggesting that the ordering reflects genuine performance zzso zzso on zzso images into mosaics confirm that better coverage values yield better quality zzso
