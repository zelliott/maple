We used zzso density of states zzso Carlo to study a zzso zzso zzso mixture in bulk and films between zzso zzso zzso properties are calculated using two different ensembles and film data are compared with the zzso Bulk properties are in good agreement with previous zzso We confirm the formation of a glass using various properties, zzso energy, heat capacity, and pressure with zzso We find a change in slope in the energy per particle and pressure as a function of zzso We do not find any defined crystal zzso A higher glass transition temperature is found for the zzso
