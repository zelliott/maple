To meet the needs of gene zzso for newly zzso organisms, zzso spaced seeds can be implemented into zzso sequence alignment programs to accurately align gene sequences to the zzso of a related zzso So far, seed performance has been tested for comparisons between closely related species, such as human and zzso or on simulated zzso As the number and variety of zzso increases, it becomes desirable to identify a small set of universal seeds that perform zzso or zzso on a large range of zzso 

Using statistical zzso methods, we investigate the sensitivity of seeds, in particular good seeds, between four zzso comparisons at different evolutionary distances zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identify classes of comparisons that show similar seed behavior and therefore can employ the same zzso In addition, we find that with high confidence good seeds for more distant comparisons perform well on closer zzso within zzso of the optimal seeds, and thus represent universal good zzso 

We show for the first time that optimal and zzso seeds for distant zzso comparisons are more generally zzso to a wide range of zzso This finding will be instrumental in developing practical and zzso zzso alignment applications, to aid in the zzso of new model zzso
