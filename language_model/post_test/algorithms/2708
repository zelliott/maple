The ability to track zzso T cells zzso in response to pathogen infection or vaccination is critical because of the role these cells play in protective zzso zzso with advances in zzso sequencing of zzso organisms, there is considerable appeal for zzso of computer-based zzso to predict peptides that bind to the class II zzso forming the complex recognized by zzso T zzso Despite recent progress in this area, there is a paucity of data regarding the success of these zzso in identifying actual zzso zzso In this study, we sought to rigorously evaluate the performance of multiple zzso zzso by comparing their predictions with our zzso by purely empirical methods for zzso discovery in influenza that used overlapping peptides and zzso zzso three independent class II zzso We analyzed the data in different ways, trying to anticipate how an investigator might use these zzso tools for zzso zzso We come to the conclusion that currently available zzso can indeed facilitate zzso discovery, but all shared a high degree of zzso and zzso zzso zzso efficiencies were zzso We also found dramatic disparities among zzso and between predicted zzso values and true zzso rates of zzso class II zzso We suggest that improved success of zzso zzso will depend less on changes in zzso methods or increased data sets and more on changes in parameters used to zzso the zzso that factor in elements of T cell repertoire and zzso acquisition by class II zzso
