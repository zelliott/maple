Breast cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world, meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the zzso In this paper, a swarm intelligence technique based support zzso machine zzso zzso is proposed for breast cancer zzso In the proposed zzso the issue of model selection and feature selection in zzso is simultaneously solved under particle swarm zzso zzso zzso A weighted function is adopted to design the objective function of zzso which takes into account the average accuracy rates of zzso zzso the number of support zzso zzso and the selected features zzso Furthermore, time varying acceleration zzso zzso and inertia weight zzso are employed to efficiently control the local and global search in zzso zzso The effectiveness of zzso has been rigorously evaluated against the Wisconsin Breast Cancer zzso zzso which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer zzso The proposed system is compared with the grid search method with feature selection by zzso The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only zzso much more appropriate model parameters and zzso feature zzso but also needs smaller set of zzso for training, giving high zzso zzso In addition, Compared to the existing methods in previous studies, the proposed system can also be regarded as a promising success with the excellent zzso accuracy of zzso via zzso cross validation zzso zzso Moreover, a combination of five zzso features is identified, which might provide important insights to the nature of the breast cancer disease and give an important clue for the physicians to take a closer zzso We believe the promising result can ensure that the physicians make very accurate diagnostic decision in clinical breast cancer zzso
