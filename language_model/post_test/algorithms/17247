This study investigates a method for zzso the zzso support to a bone fracture site that is provided by a fracture zzso zzso The method is demonstrated with the zzso zzso unilateral external zzso for which a mathematical zzso zzso is defined using experimental zzso in six degrees of zzso Single forces or zzso moments are applied to a model fracture zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are measured by an zzso spatial zzso The zzso zzso zzso for the fracture site is calculated from the product of the zzso of forces and moments and the inverse of the zzso of zzso A transformation zzso is used to determine the zzso zzso for a range of anatomical angles (between the plane of the zzso frame and the zzso zzso zzso between measured zzso (for an angle of 30 zzso and the corresponding calculated zzso showed agreement to within zzso The method enables fracture site zzso for a fixation device to be zzso zzso and its properties to be identified in comparison with other zzso It also provides the means of zzso zzso zzso motion that may arise from zzso zzso regardless of zzso
