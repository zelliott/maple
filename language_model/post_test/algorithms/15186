To investigate the zzso dependence of zzso zzso transfer zzso and nuclear zzso zzso image contrasts in a rat zzso model at zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso rats zzso zzso 8) and fresh chicken eggs zzso zzso 4) were scanned on a zzso animal magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso over an offset range of zzso zzso were acquired with different zzso powers, followed by the zzso zzso asymmetry analyses around the water zzso 

The nuclear zzso enhancement signal zzso from the water resonance zzso to -5 zzso was clearly visible at lower zzso powers zzso zzso zzso and was larger in the zzso normal brain tissue than in the zzso zzso the zzso effect downfield from the water resonance was zzso at relatively higher zzso powers zzso zzso zzso and was larger in the tumor than in the zzso normal brain zzso The nuclear zzso enhancement decreased the zzso image zzso based on the zzso zzso asymmetry analysis, but increased the zzso image contrast between the tumor and zzso normal brain zzso 

The zzso and nuclear zzso enhancement image signals in tumor are zzso at different zzso zzso The zzso power of roughly 2 zzso is ideal for zzso imaging at clinical zzso field zzso
