zzso structure comparison is one of the most important problems in zzso biology and plays a key role in protein structure zzso fold family zzso motif finding, zzso tree reconstruction and protein zzso 

We propose a novel method to compare the protein structures in an accurate and efficient zzso Such a method can be used to not only reveal divergent evolution, but also identify circular permutations and further detect zzso Specifically, we define the structure alignment as a zzso zzso problem, zzso maximizing the number of aligned atoms and minimizing their root mean square zzso By controlling a single zzso zzso theoretically we can obtain a variety of optimal alignments corresponding to different optimal matching patterns, zzso from a large matching portion to a small matching zzso The number of variables in our zzso increases with the number of atoms of protein pairs in almost a linear zzso In addition to solid theoretical background, zzso experiments demonstrated significant improvement of our approach over the existing methods in terms of quality and zzso In particular, we show that divergent evolution, circular permutations and zzso (or structural zzso can be identified by our zzso The software zzso is available upon request from the authors, or from zzso and zzso 

A novel zzso is proposed to accurately align protein structures in the framework of zzso zzso based on a sequence zzso zzso A fast and accurate zzso based on the zzso matching zzso is developed by exploiting the special zzso zzso of zzso is shown in experiments and is also theoretically zzso
