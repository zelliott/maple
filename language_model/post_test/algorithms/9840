In zzso zzso zzso concentration changes in zzso and zzso are calculated using an zzso change of the measurement light and by solving a linear equation based on the modified zzso zzso While solving this zzso we need to know the zzso mean optical path lengths of the measurement zzso However, it is very difficult to know these values by a zzso zzso zzso We propose a new method of zzso zzso optical path length ratios of the measurement lights based on the data obtained by a triple wavelength zzso zzso zzso The proposed method does not give a path length itself, but it gives a path length zzso Thus, it is possible to obtain the accurate zzso concentration changes without cross talk, although the method cannot contribute to the zzso of the absolute magnitude of zzso zzso The method is based on the principle that two possible zzso of zzso concentration changes calculated using a zzso measurement system should be zzso The method was applied to the experimental data of human subjects' zzso The estimated path length ratios were very similar to literature values obtained by using zzso laser zzso and a streak camera detector zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
