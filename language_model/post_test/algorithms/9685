The purpose of this research work was to develop zzso zzso and layered zzso zzso using zzso adopting wet zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso were zzso The monolithic zzso were coated with different ratios of zzso cellulose and zzso The in zzso dissolution study was performed in distilled zzso In the layered zzso the middle layer containing drug was covered with barrier layers containing high zzso grade zzso zzso lattice design was used for zzso the layered zzso The dissolution study of the zzso batches and a reference product was carried out in zzso N zzso zzso buffer and zzso zzso zzso drug release was exhibited by the zzso zzso probably due to high zzso zzso of zzso zzso The coated zzso showed sustained drug release without burst zzso The drug release was best explained by zzso zzso A unified zzso equation was evolved to express drug release from the coated zzso The layered zzso also exhibited sustained release without burst effect due to effective area zzso The zzso batches showed identical drug release in zzso N zzso zzso buffer and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may well be adopted by the industry due to the possibility of achieving a high production zzso
