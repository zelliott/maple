zzso are X-ray images of human breast which are normally used to detect breast zzso The presence of zzso muscle in zzso may disturb the detection of breast cancer as the zzso muscle and zzso zzso appear zzso So, the suppression or exclusion of the zzso muscle from the zzso is demanded for zzso analysis which requires the identification of the zzso zzso The main objective of this study is to propose an automated method to efficiently identify the zzso muscle in zzso zzso zzso This method uses a proposed graph zzso image zzso technique for identifying the zzso muscle zzso The identified zzso muscle edge is found to be zzso zzso the zzso muscle is smoothly represented using zzso curve which uses the control points obtained from the zzso muscle zzso The proposed work was tested on a public zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso image analysis society database, and its performance was compared with the state-of-the-art methods reported in the zzso The mean false positive and false negative rates of the proposed method over randomly chosen 84 zzso were zzso respectively, as zzso and zzso Also, with respect to the number of results with small error, the proposed method out performs existing zzso These results indicate that the proposed method can be used to accurately identify the zzso muscle on zzso zzso view zzso
