A novel application of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in zzso drugs using zzso molecular zzso Two series of compounds, one containing zzso and the other containing zzso compounds, were processed by a zzso cluster analysis in order to design training and predicting zzso All clusters had a zzso zzso zzso Afterward, a linear zzso function has been derived toward discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso The model correctly zzso zzso of active and zzso of inactive compounds in the training zzso More specifically, the model showed a global good zzso of zzso zzso 263 cases out of zzso In predicting series, the model has shown overall zzso of 91 and zzso for active and inactive compounds, zzso zzso the model has a global percentage of good zzso of zzso The zzso approach, also, similarly compares with respect to one of the most useful models for zzso selection reported to zzso
