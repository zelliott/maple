Following our work on the study of zzso droplets and film doped with one zzso excited zzso atom zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we focus in this paper on the second excited zzso We present theoretical studies of such droplets and films using quantum zzso Carlo zzso zzso and path integral zzso Carlo zzso combined with a zzso scheme to model the zzso additive potential energy surface are used to investigate the zzso and the structure of zzso zzso zzso films as a model for the limit of large clusters are also zzso As in our work on the first electronic excited state, our present calculations find stable zzso zzso The structures obtained are however different with a zzso zzso core to which more zzso atoms are zzso zzso zzso on one end of the core zzso The electronic zzso spectrum is also presented for increasing cluster sizes as well as for the zzso
