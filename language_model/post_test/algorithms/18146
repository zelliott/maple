Recently proposed zzso active contours introduced a new paradigm for minimizing energies defined on zzso by changing the traditional cost of zzso a curve and thereby redefining their zzso zzso active contours evolve more globally and are less attracted to certain intermediate local zzso than traditional active zzso and it is based on a zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we analyze zzso active contours using zzso analysis in order to understand their evolution across different zzso This analysis shows an extremely important and useful behavior of zzso zzso zzso that they move successively from coarse to increasingly finer scale motions in a continuous zzso This property illustrates that one justification for using the zzso technique is for applications where zzso zzso are preferred over fine scale zzso Along with other properties to be discussed, the zzso observation reveals that zzso active contours are, in particular, zzso suited for tracking zzso that use active zzso We will also justify our assertion that the zzso metric should be used over the traditional metric for active contours in tracking problems by zzso showing how a variety of active zzso based tracking methods can be significantly improved merely by evolving the active zzso according to the zzso zzso
