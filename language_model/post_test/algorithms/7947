We report our theoretical investigation onto the shape dependence of zzso zzso zzso in semiconductor zzso zzso Based on a zzso model under effective mass zzso we have developed a simple zzso theory capable of providing a quantitative explanation of the recent zzso measurement on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso zzso With this theory, we have systematically revealed the characteristics of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with four different zzso sphere, zzso cylinder and zzso Due to the splitting of zzso energy levels caused by the decreased degree of zzso zzso and zzso exhibit greater zzso zzso than zzso and zzso of similar sizes, zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso possess larger zzso zzso than zzso and zzso of similar lateral dimension, zzso Given zzso zzso zzso show stronger size dependence than zzso The size dependence of zzso zzso is more sensitive to the lateral size than the zzso size in the cases of zzso and zzso
