Focusing mechanism was effectively exploited to separate large zzso particles by using new zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that the retention order of zzso particles at high field strength can be explained by the mechanism of zzso exclusion only at lowest flow rates of the carrier zzso A simplistic, purely mechanical model of zzso exclusion is not accurate to describe the retention at higher flow rates where the focusing phenomenon zzso Despite the fact that the thickness of the channel for zzso cannot be reduced without taking into account a possible deterioration of the separation due to the contribution of zzso zzso zzso this paper zzso in agreement with our previous results, that if the operational conditions were zzso zzso namely a low flow rate, a reasonable fit of the experimental retention data with the theory of zzso exclusion mechanism in zzso was found and the separation of zzso particles can be zzso However, high selectivity and resolution and high-speed separation were achieved if the focusing effect has clearly dominated the zzso zzso As a result, it seems that the zzso is the most universal technique which can be applied for the separation of the synthetic and natural zzso within an extended range of zzso masses up to zzso zzso masses and for the particles of various chemical nature and origin in a zzso range as well as for large zzso zzso Until nowadays, only zzso and flow zzso zzso techniques in so called zzso modes were applied for the zzso of large size zzso This application of zzso in focusing mode for the separation of large size particles is the first one described in the zzso
