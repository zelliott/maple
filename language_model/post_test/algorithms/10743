In long zzso syndrome zzso disease severity and response to therapy vary according to the genetic zzso There exists a critical need to devise strategies to zzso genetic zzso 

To perform genetic screening in patients with zzso to determine the yield of genetic testing, as well as the type and the prevalence of zzso 

We investigated whether the detection of a set of frequently zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes may translate in a novel strategy for rapid efficient genetic testing of 430 consecutive patients referred to our center between June 1996 and June zzso The entire coding regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were screened by zzso zzso liquid zzso and DNA zzso The frequency and the type of zzso were defined to identify a set of recurring zzso A separate cohort of 75 consecutive zzso was used as a validation group to zzso zzso the prevalence of the recurring zzso identified in the primary zzso zzso 

Development of a novel approach to zzso zzso 

We identified 235 different zzso 138 of which were novel, in 310 zzso of 430 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso carried zzso zzso in 64 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A similar occurrence of zzso at these zzso zzso was confirmed in the prospective cohort of 75 zzso and in previously published zzso zzso 

We have developed an approach to improve the efficiency of genetic screening for zzso This novel method may facilitate wider access to zzso resulting in better risk zzso and treatment of zzso zzso
