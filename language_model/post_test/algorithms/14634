Bone zzso protein 5 zzso gene was suggested to be a potential zzso candidate gene for zzso trait zzso on zzso Here by comparative sequencing of zzso gene in zzso zzso and Large White zzso zzso one zzso zzso in 3' zzso region was zzso Association analysis results in zzso zzso zzso pigs showed that zzso pigs had thinner back zzso and heavier ham than zzso zzso or zzso and had a higher fat percentage and a lower lean meat percentage zzso than zzso Moreover, this zzso transition was predicted to alter zzso interaction with zzso and zzso by using zzso and zzso The negative expression of zzso gene with zzso and zzso detected from zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicating these 2 zzso might participate in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso might be a good marker for zzso zzso
