The previous studies of zzso expression patterns show that a certain percentage of genes are cell cycle zzso The expression data has been analyzed in a number of different ways to identify cell cycle dependent zzso In this study, we pose the hypothesis that cell cycle dependent genes are considered as zzso systems with a rhythm, zzso systems producing response signals with period and zzso zzso we are motivated to apply the theory of zzso phase synchronization for zzso cell cycle specific zzso expression zzso 

We propose the strategy to find groups of genes according to the specific biological process by analyzing cell cycle specific gene expression zzso To evaluate the propose method, we use the modified zzso model, which is a phase governing equation that provides the long-term dynamics of globally coupled zzso With this zzso we simulate two groups of expression signals, and the simulated signals from each group shares their own common zzso Then, the simulated expression data are mixed with randomly generated expression data to be used as input data set to the zzso Using these simulated expression data, it is shown that the zzso is able to identify expression signals that are involved in the same zzso zzso We also evaluate the method with zzso cell cycle expression zzso It is shown that the output clusters by the proposed zzso include zzso which are closely associated with each other by sharing significant Gene zzso terms of biological process and/or having relatively many known biological zzso zzso the evaluation analysis indicates that the method is able to identify expression signals according to the specific biological zzso Our evaluation analysis also indicates that some portion of output by the proposed zzso is not zzso by the traditional zzso zzso with zzso distance or linear zzso 

Based on the evaluation experiments, we draw the conclusion as zzso 1) Based on the theory of zzso phase zzso it is feasible to find groups of zzso which have relevant biological interactions and/or significantly shared GO slim terms of biological process, using cell cycle specific gene expression zzso 2) Among all the output clusters by the proposed algorithm, the cluster with relatively large size has a tendency to include more known interactions than the one with relatively small zzso 3) It is feasible to understand the cell cycle specific gene expression patterns as the phenomenon of collective zzso 4) The proposed zzso is able to find prominent groups of zzso which are not zzso by traditional zzso zzso
