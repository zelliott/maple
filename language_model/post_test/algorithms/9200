A novel approach for detection of zzso zzso in the zzso system based on zzso analysis is zzso zzso breathing is employed to provide a zzso input to the zzso system in which Heart Rate zzso zzso and Blood zzso Variation zzso are considered as its zzso The presence of new zzso of the main respiratory rate in the zzso and zzso is investigated by using the concept of zzso phase and zzso frequency zzso It is shown that a second order zzso zzso system is actually involved in producing the zzso and zzso The strength of this zzso decreases with increasing the breathing zzso
