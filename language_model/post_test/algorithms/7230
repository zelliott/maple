In this paper, we develop an efficient bit allocation strategy for zzso image coding zzso More specifically, our objective is to design a new zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso To this end, we consider the uniform zzso zzso of a class of mixed distributed sources following a zzso zzso zzso This model appears to be particularly zzso for image data, which have a sparse representation in a zzso zzso In this paper, we propose new approximations of the zzso and the distortion functions using zzso zzso and exponential forms, zzso Because of these zzso bit allocation is reformulated as a convex zzso zzso zzso the resulting problem allows us to derive the optimal zzso step for each zzso Experimental results show the benefits that can be drawn from the proposed bit allocation method in a typical zzso coding zzso
