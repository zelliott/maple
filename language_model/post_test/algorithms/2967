Competing theories seek to account for the therapeutic effects of zzso deep brain stimulation zzso of the internal zzso zzso zzso for medically intractable Parkinson's zzso To investigate this question, we studied the spontaneous activity of 102 zzso zzso during zzso in two zzso rendered zzso by administration of zzso zzso through zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso at 150 zzso for 30 zzso reduced rigidity in one animal and increased spontaneous movement in zzso Novel artifact zzso methods allowed uninterrupted zzso recording during zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso or sustained zzso zzso changes in firing in both zzso zzso A subset of cells responded at short zzso zzso zzso in a manner consistent with zzso zzso Later zzso increases clustered at 3- to zzso zzso zzso decreases were either zzso clustered at 1-3 zzso or zzso showing no zzso zzso Response zzso and magnitude often evolved over 30 s of zzso but responses were relatively stable by the end of that zzso zzso reduced mean firing rates modestly and only in zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso had no net effect on the prevalence or structure of burst zzso zzso did reduce the prevalence of synchronized zzso zzso Some cell pairs became synchronized instead at the frequency of zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not require zzso zzso however, or even the presence of a significant zzso zzso In zzso the therapeutic effects of zzso may be zzso by an abolition of zzso synchronized zzso as a result of zzso zzso
