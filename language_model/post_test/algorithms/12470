The potential of the combined use of zzso and zzso with zzso library search for the identification of therapeutic and illicit drugs has been zzso zzso was used for zzso experimental conditions and for characterization of the performance of the applied mass zzso zzso zzso revealed that because of the mass zzso the stability of zzso and the zzso of zzso the zzso mass zzso is an appropriate platform for establishment of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso substances were used as reference samples to build the spectral zzso For each reference compound, zzso zzso were acquired at ten different zzso values between 5 zzso and 50 zzso For identification of unknown compounds, a library search zzso was zzso The closeness of matching between a measured zzso spectrum and a spectrum stored in the library was characterized by a value called zzso zzso which took into account the number of matched zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso observed in the two zzso and the sum of the intensity differences calculated for matching zzso A large value for the match probability indicated a close match between the measured and the reference zzso A unique feature of the library search zzso implemented spectral zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso With the aid of this software feature, substances zzso only zzso of the total amount of zzso zzso were unequivocally zzso in addition to the zzso main zzso The spectral library was successfully applied to the characterization of 39 forensic zzso zzso
