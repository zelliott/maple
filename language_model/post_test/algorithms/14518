The present study deals with the evaluation of zzso removal of zzso zzso Ni zzso and zzso zzso zzso by both intact and zzso brown marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso shaking zzso experiments were performed in order to examine the effects of zzso contact time, biomass zzso biomass treatment and initial metal concentration on the removal zzso The optimum zzso conditions for each heavy metal are zzso zzso zzso and one sample zzso were performed on experimental data to evaluate the statistical significance of zzso capacities after five cycles of zzso and zzso The equilibrium experimental data were tested using the most common zzso The results are best fitted by the zzso model among zzso models and the zzso Khan and zzso models among zzso zzso models for zzso zzso Ni zzso and zzso zzso zzso The kinetic data were fitted by models including zzso and zzso From the results zzso the zzso kinetic model best describes the zzso of cadmium, zzso and lead zzso
