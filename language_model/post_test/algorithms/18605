We present zzso neural network models with Q zzso or zzso zzso for a system with middle zzso zzso zzso and zzso superior zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso proposed by zzso et zzso we notice that the zzso zzso consists of local learning zzso We first investigate a model with zzso zzso for response properties of the zzso zzso to optical flows as for various types of zzso We next extend the model with zzso zzso to a model with Q zzso or zzso zzso and investigate the response properties of the zzso zzso for various values of Q zzso or zzso We obtain better response properties for the model with Q zzso or zzso zzso than for the one with zzso zzso
