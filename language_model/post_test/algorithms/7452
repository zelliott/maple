For automatic zzso of zzso disc and cup from color zzso zzso we describe a fairly general energy function that can naturally fit into a global zzso framework with graph zzso Distinguished from most previous work, our energy function includes zzso on the shape & location of disc & cup, the rim thickness and the geometric interaction of zzso contains zzso These zzso together with the effective zzso of graph cut enable our zzso to generate reliable and robust zzso Our approach is able to outperform several state-of-the-art zzso methods, as shown by a set of experimental comparisons with manual zzso and a series of results of correlations with the assessments of a zzso software from zzso zzso zzso zzso regarding several cup and disc zzso
