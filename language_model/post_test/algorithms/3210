zzso zzso zzso zzso has been growing significantly in the past two decades as a promising tool for zzso and zzso imaging of zzso using zzso zzso It can improve our ability to probe complex zzso interactions zzso and to study disease and treatment responses over time in near real zzso Recent advances on the transfer of techniques from laboratory to clinics have led to the development of various diagnostic applications such as imaging of the female breast and infant zzso The potential value of the promising zzso however, can be limited by the reconstruction time for zzso imaging tissue optical zzso The current solution procedure in zzso zzso a considerable amount of time due to zzso of the problem domain and zzso nature of tissue optical zzso It is becoming ever more important to develop faster imaging tools as measurement data sets increase in size as a result of the application of newer generation zzso Here we provide a fast solution strategy that significantly reduces imaging effort for zzso The fast imaging strategy adopts advanced zzso reduction zzso techniques for reducing system complexity, while preserving (to the greatest possible zzso system zzso behavior for the forward zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso imaging method can be an order of magnitude faster than the conventional approach while maintaining a relatively small error zzso The goal is to develop zzso zzso imaging system that can run at patient's bedside in real time and produce data continuously over a long period of zzso
