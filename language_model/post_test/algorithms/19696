According to the characteristics of four basic P zzso combining the zzso transform and the zzso and slope of transformed P wave, a new zzso detecting method based on zzso zzso is zzso First search out all zzso maximum pairs to satisfy the threshold after zzso zzso and then applying the zzso and slope criterion exclude the interferes and detect the P peak and its shape, last determine the onset and end of P wave respectively which should be separately calculated for zzso and zzso P wave (or zzso P zzso The approach is applied in experiments of data from zzso database and randomly collected data of clinical zzso The experimental statistical results shows that the correct detecting rate is as high as zzso compared to manual zzso
