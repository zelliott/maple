A challenging practical problem in medicinal chemistry is the transfer of zzso information from one chemical series to zzso Currently, there are no zzso methods available to zzso or support this zzso zzso we present a data mining approach that enables the identification of alternative analog series with different core structures, corresponding substitution patterns, and comparable potency zzso zzso can be exchanged between these series and new zzso suggested that incorporate preferred zzso The methodology can be applied to search for alternative analog series if one series is known or, zzso to systematically assess zzso transfer potential in compound zzso
