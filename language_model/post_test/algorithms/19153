Patient preferences are often cited as a possible explanation for disparities in zzso However, no prior studies have examined whether there are racial and ethnic differences in preferences for health states in a general population zzso 

Data from zzso adult respondents to the 2002 Medical zzso Panel zzso were used to study variations in valuations of health zzso zzso health states were valued based on the zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso and the zzso using the US and UK zzso scoring zzso zzso analyses determined whether valuations in health states varied by race or Hispanic origin, controlling for socioeconomic status and place of zzso 

Race and ethnicity were not associated with differences in valuations of health zzso However, there were systematic differences in characteristics that were controlled, such as health status, age, poverty status, and region of the zzso zzso and Hispanics had slightly higher zzso scores than zzso The negative influence of zzso discomfort on the zzso score was greater for blacks and zzso 

zzso and ethnic differences in treatment preferences probably do not result from differences in health state zzso Future research should explore whether differences in preferences for other attributes of treatment account for differences in treatment zzso zzso researchers using the zzso or zzso need not account for zzso and zzso systematically valuing health states differently than whites zzso However, caution may be warranted when considering interventions designed to manage pain or discomfort, because blacks and Hispanics gave greater weight to that domain of health status in their zzso
