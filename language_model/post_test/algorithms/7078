A simple graphic method is proposed for reconstructing zzso trees from molecular zzso This method is similar to the zzso zzso method with zzso mean, but the process of zzso of average distances and reconstruction of new zzso required in the latter method, is eliminated from this new method, so that one can reconstruct a zzso tree without using a computer, unless the number of operational zzso units is very zzso Furthermore, this method allows a zzso tree to have zzso branches whenever there is ambiguity with zzso
