zzso attention has been focused on predicting the secondary structure for aligned zzso sequences since it is useful not only for improving the limiting accuracy of conventional secondary structure prediction but also for finding zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although there exist many zzso of predicting secondary structure for aligned zzso zzso further improvement of the accuracy is still zzso In this article, toward improving the zzso a theoretical zzso of state-of-the-art zzso of predicting secondary structure for aligned zzso sequences is zzso The zzso is based on the viewpoint of maximum expected accuracy zzso which has been successfully applied in various problems in zzso The zzso reveals several disadvantages of the current zzso but we propose an improvement of a previously introduced zzso zzso Finally, zzso experiments strongly support the theoretical zzso and indicate that the improved zzso substantially zzso other zzso
