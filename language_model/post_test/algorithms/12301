zzso the zzso of complex systems zzso to networks is important for unraveling their functional zzso Many such networks follow the zzso and zzso zzso Several models of artificially growing networks lead to this observed network zzso Most previously proposed models for growing networks, such as zzso and zzso produce realistic network zzso but do not consider the effects of zzso forces such as zzso for adaptation in shaping network zzso It is likely that such forces have shaped complex systems throughout their zzso To develop further insights into possible mechanisms that shape networks, a model that uses several previously proposed network growth zzso was developed to grow networks that adapt under zzso zzso A decision tree problem was used to generate a complex zzso zzso Growing networks were required to adapt to correctly decode this function using an evolutionary selection zzso Under this growth regimen all growing network models are similarly zzso The newly added zzso tend to cluster into pathways emanating from few zzso regardless of the growth zzso Distribution of redundant pathways from zzso to the output follow a zzso function with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar distribution of redundant pathways was observed from zzso in a cell signaling network and an air traffic control zzso A flat distribution of redundant pathways from zzso was observed in growing networks that do not attempt to zzso This analysis provides initial insights into distribution of pathways in naturally evolving complex systems that have defined zzso zzso
