An experimental design involving sequences of m distinct events can be zzso as an zzso transition probability zzso specifying the probabilities with which each of the m distinct events is to follow certain zzso This paper describes a general method for constructing sequences of shortest possible length that satisfy any such zzso and presents a computer program that randomly generates such zzso
