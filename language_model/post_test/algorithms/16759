The zzso change upon zzso binding is largely ignored for a long time in the affinity prediction zzso However, it is widely recognized that zzso effect does play an important role in zzso recognition and zzso In this article, we describe a new quantitative zzso relationship zzso strategy to capture the structural and zzso information relating to not only the direct zzso interactions between protein binding partners, but also the indirect zzso effect associated with zzso This method is then employed to zzso model and predict the zzso binding affinities compiled in a recently published benchmark consisting of 144 functionally diverse protein complexes with their structures available in both bound and zzso states zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With incorporating genetic zzso and partial least squares zzso zzso into this method, a significant linear relationship between structural information zzso and zzso measured affinities is readily emerged and, on this basis, detailed discussions of zzso properties and structural implications underlying protein binding process, as well as the contribution of zzso effect to the binding are zzso We also give an empirical zzso of the prediction limit zzso zzso zzso for zzso method used to determine zzso binding zzso
