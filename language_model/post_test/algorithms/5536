Linear zzso models have often been used to investigate properties of speech zzso However, these models are inaccurate approximations of the speech zzso This study aims at assessing how reliably zzso can be estimated from zzso with these zzso 

zzso movements were collected for 9 speakers of German during the production of zzso zzso words at varying speech zzso zzso peaks, movement zzso and gesture zzso were zzso In the context of an zzso model, 2 zzso zzso were compared that should theoretically yield the same zzso In the context of a zzso model, zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for each zzso 

Numerous cases were found in which zzso zzso based on the zzso model contradicted each zzso Less than zzso of the data were found to be compatible with the properties of the zzso zzso zzso tends to decrease with zzso zzso However, it is associated with a large, unrealistic zzso zzso making zzso zzso from zzso data to a large extent zzso 

Any conclusions about speech control based on zzso zzso using linear zzso models should therefore be considered with zzso
