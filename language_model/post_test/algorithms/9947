zzso zzso remains one of the primary zzso approaches in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso highly zzso and currently the most widely used technique in zzso zzso analysis of complex biological samples typically yields highly congested zzso with severely overlapping signals making zzso zzso identification and zzso almost zzso zzso there is a growing use of zzso zzso methods, in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso which spreads the high signal density into a second zzso One potentially powerful method to zzso these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is via zzso zzso However, the mathematical functions describing the zzso zzso zzso in particular after applying zzso functions and zzso specific processing, including tilting and zzso remain zzso Furthermore, possible zzso errors arising from processing zzso zzso have not been zzso nor have the potentially adverse quantitative effects of overlapping zzso tails of closely spaced signals in the zzso zzso Here we address these issues and evaluate the suitability of the zzso experiment for accurate complex mixture zzso Specifically, we have examined changes in zzso zzso and signal intensity after application of different zzso functions zzso and zzso and zzso specific processing zzso and zzso comparing simulated and experimental zzso We also report a significant zzso error of up to zzso dependent upon zzso due to overlap of the zzso tails of closely spaced zzso Finally, we have validated the use of these mathematical zzso functions for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by comparison to corresponding zzso zzso zzso using both zzso chemically defined zzso as well as biological tissue zzso
