The induction of transient global cerebral zzso by permanent zzso zzso and temporary carotid zzso zzso zzso is widely accepted as a valid tool for the study of zzso and treatment of zzso The neural damage inflicted by this intervention is often assessed by measuring zzso cell loss in the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using this model in rats often fail to control variables that are relevant to the outcome, and/or apply biased methods to zzso zzso zzso We have applied unbiased zzso methods to estimate absolute numbers of surviving zzso in zzso in zzso rats subjected to either 10 or 20 zzso global zzso using the zzso et zzso zzso of the original zzso zzso zzso Animal mortality was high at both times, with zzso losses averaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso mortality was reduced substantially by using zzso zzso and, even more zzso by zzso the rats with low doses of zzso Both maneuvers led to a severely increased zzso zzso loss, which reached zzso after an zzso of 10 zzso This finding strongly supports that mortality biases the zzso Other noteworthy findings that emerged from this study were a linear relationship between zzso blood pressure increments and animal survival, and a negative correlation between cell survival and zzso zzso zzso
