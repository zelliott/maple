Many applications of data zzso zzso have been well studied in zzso zzso for instance, a set N of organisms zzso based on DNA marker zzso A partition divides all elements in N into two or more zzso clusters that cover all zzso where a cluster contains a zzso subset of zzso Different zzso zzso may produce different zzso To zzso the distance and find the consensus partition (also called consensus zzso between two or more partitions are important and interesting problems that arise frequently in zzso and data mining, in which different distance functions may be considered in different partition zzso In this article, we discuss the k zzso zzso Given a set of elements N with k partitions of zzso the k zzso problem is to delete the minimum number of elements from each partition such that all remaining partitions become zzso This problem is zzso for general zzso zzso and no zzso are known at zzso We design the first known zzso and approximation zzso with performance ratios 2 to solve the k zzso problem in zzso time, where zzso is the maximum number of clusters of these k partitions and zzso is the number of elements in zzso We also present the first known exact zzso in zzso time, where zzso is the zzso of the optimal solution for this zzso Performances of our exact and approximation zzso in testing the random data with actual sets of organisms based on DNA markers are compared and zzso Experimental results reveal that our zzso can improve the zzso speed of the exact zzso for the two zzso problem in practice if the maximum number of elements per cluster is less than zzso From both theoretical and zzso points of view, our solutions are at most twice the zzso of the optimal zzso A zzso offering the interactive service of solving the k zzso problem using our and previous zzso is available (see zzso
