In this study, each zzso of a heart sound was modeled by a zzso curve and characterized by zzso timing, and supporting zzso This model was applied to analyze the zzso variations induced by zzso in 12 zzso It was observed that the zzso exhibited regular behaviors with zzso The zzso of the prominent zzso and valleys of zzso (the second heart zzso were commonly attenuated during expiration and were zzso during inspiration whereas no consistent observations were obtained for zzso (the first heart zzso The supporting zzso of zzso commonly decreased with expiration and increased with inspiration whereas the supporting zzso of zzso displayed no significant changes during zzso For all subjects, the delay of zzso increased during inspiration and decreased during zzso However, the delay of the zzso component increased during expiration and decreased during zzso The pulmonary component of zzso was observed in 7 of 12 subjects, and the delay was opposite to that of the zzso zzso The opposing delays yielded a splitting between the two components of zzso that increased during inspiration and decreased during zzso The delay pattern was the most consistent observation in all zzso These results suggest that a quantitative analysis of zzso variations, particularly the delay pattern, could be used as a zzso continuous monitoring method of zzso change during respiratory zzso
