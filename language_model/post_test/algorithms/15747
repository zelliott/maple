The fast identification of quality lead compounds in the pharmaceutical industry through a combination of high zzso synthesis and screening has become more challenging in recent zzso Although the number of available compounds for high zzso screening zzso has dramatically increased, large-scale random zzso libraries have contributed zzso less to identify novel leads for drug discovery zzso zzso the concept of zzso of compound selections has become a focus in recent zzso In zzso the low success rate of converting lead compounds into drugs often due to zzso zzso parameters has sparked a renewed interest in understanding more clearly what makes a compound zzso Various approaches have been devised to address the zzso of molecules employing retrospective analyses of known drug collections as well as attempting to capture zzso zzso in zzso For example, simple property counting schemes, machine learning methods, zzso models, and zzso methods have been employed to distinguish between drugs and zzso Here we review zzso techniques to address the zzso of compound selections and offer an outlook for the further development of the zzso
