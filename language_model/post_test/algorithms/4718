Design and control of zzso fields is critical for many zzso and graphics tasks such as zzso field zzso fluid zzso and texture zzso The fundamental qualitative structures associated with zzso fields are fixed points, periodic zzso and zzso In this paper, we provide a new technique that allows for the systematic creation and cancellation of fixed points and periodic zzso This technique enables zzso field design and editing on the plane and surfaces with desired qualitative zzso The technique is based on zzso theory, which provides a unified framework that supports the cancellation of fixed points and periodic zzso We also introduce a novel periodic orbit extraction and zzso zzso that zzso for the first time, periodic orbits on zzso Furthermore, we describe the application of our periodic orbit detection and zzso field zzso zzso to engine simulation data demonstrating the utility of the zzso We apply our design system to zzso field zzso by creating data sets containing periodic zzso This helps us understand the effectiveness of existing zzso zzso Finally, we propose a new zzso technique that allows zzso field zzso to be easily zzso
