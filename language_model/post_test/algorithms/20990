Expansion is commonly used to reduce microphone noise and low-level environmental noises that can be annoying to hearing aid zzso It may also improve or reduce the perception of low-level zzso This study assessed the impact of two expansion zzso single and multiple channel, on speech reception thresholds zzso with 10 hearing impaired listeners wearing hearing aids with zzso zzso The single-channel zzso suppressed sounds below 45 zzso A, while the zzso zzso suppressed sounds below the long-term average spectrum of speech at either 55 or 45 zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso in quiet were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A without expansion, with single-channel expansion, and with zzso expansion at expansion thresholds of 45 and 55 zzso zzso zzso The difference in mean zzso was only statistically significant between no expansion and zzso expansion at a 55 zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis between the change in individual zzso for each expansion condition and pure tone average hearing loss showed no zzso Our calculations indicate that only those with exceptionally good hearing will find microphone noise zzso The current practice of prescribing expansion zzso based on hearing thresholds alone is questioned, and other rationales are zzso
