Current clinical experience in radiation therapy is based upon dose zzso that report the absorbed dose to water, even though the patient is not made of water but of many different types of zzso While zzso Carlo dose calculation zzso have the potential for higher dose zzso they usually transport particles in and zzso the absorbed dose to the patient media such as soft zzso lung or zzso zzso for dose calculation zzso zzso or to report dose to water or tissue contained within a bone zzso for example, a method to convert dose to the medium to dose to water is zzso This conversion has been developed here by applying zzso cavity zzso The dose ratio for 6 and 18 zzso zzso beams was determined by computing the average stopping power ratio for the primary electron spectrum in the transport zzso For soft zzso the difference between dose to medium and dose to water is approximately zzso while for cortical bone the dose difference exceeds zzso The variation in the dose ratio as a function of depth and position in the field indicates that for zzso beams a single correction factor can be used for each particular material throughout the field for a given zzso beam zzso The only exception to this would be for the clinically zzso dose to zzso zzso energy zzso for zzso to 24 zzso are used to zzso the dose ratios for these zzso beams and to determine an effective energy for evaluation of the dose zzso
