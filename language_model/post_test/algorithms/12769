In this paper, a new efficient zzso is presented for zzso block zzso based on zzso zzso In this algorithm, finding the largest meaningful block that zzso the diversity condition is the main goal as an zzso zzso The zzso can be performed in zzso time complexity with regard to the number of zzso and zzso We apply our zzso on three biological data sets from zzso 21 in three different population data sets from zzso data zzso the obtained results show the efficiency and better performance of our zzso in comparison with three other well known zzso
