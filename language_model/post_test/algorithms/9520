The objective of this study was to compare two different schemes for zzso zzso component suppression in zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim was to increase zzso of zzso zzso components accessible by the zzso zzso 

A zzso and a zzso approach for zzso zzso and fat suppression were implemented on clinical zzso Both techniques were compared in zzso zzso exams on healthy volunteers regarding zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso suppression quality, and scan zzso A quantitative zzso evaluation was performed using ankle scans of six zzso T zzso suppression profiles were simulated for both approaches to facilitate interpretation of the zzso 

At zzso zzso both techniques perform equally well in suppressing zzso zzso components and zzso zzso preparation requires more zzso effort due to the use of zzso zzso while the zzso technique requires a zzso step to form a zzso zzso For scans with a short repetition time zzso the zzso approach is much faster than the zzso preparation, which depends on slow T zzso recovery between preparation zzso The zzso comparison shows slightly higher zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso preparation becomes more challenging due to stronger zzso zzso 

Both techniques are well suited for zzso zzso suppression and offer comparable zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso approach has strong advantages in terms of scan efficiency and zzso zzso
