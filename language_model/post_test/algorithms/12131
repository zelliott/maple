Computer modeling programs that generate three-dimensional zzso data on fine zzso are capable of generating very large amounts of zzso These data sets, as well as 3-D zzso data sets, are prime candidates for the application of data zzso zzso A very flexible and powerful zzso zzso for imagery data is the newly released zzso 2000 zzso zzso 2000 also has the capability to compress zzso data, as described in Part 2 of the standard, by treating the 3-D data as separate zzso As a decoder standard, zzso 2000 does not describe any specific method to allocate bits among the separate zzso This paper proposes two new bit allocation zzso for accomplishing this zzso The first procedure is rate distortion optimal (for mean squared zzso and is zzso similar to zzso rate distortion zzso used for coding zzso within zzso zzso The disadvantage of this approach is its high zzso zzso The second bit allocation algorithm, here called the mixed model zzso approach, zzso models each zzso rate distortion curve using two distinct regions to get more accurate modeling at low bit zzso These two bit allocation zzso are applied to a 3-D Meteorological data zzso Test results show that the zzso approach gives distortion results that are nearly identical to the optimal approach, while significantly reducing zzso zzso
