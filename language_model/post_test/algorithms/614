zzso zzso for zzso sphere ensembles with a dissolved drug, zzso initial drug loading below or equal to the drug zzso in the zzso in a finite external medium was modeled with consideration of zzso among and within zzso zzso solutions were obtained using the finite element method for sphere ensemble with normal or zzso distribution of particle size or initial drug loading among zzso zzso series solutions were derived for ensembles with various initial loading zzso within zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and uniform distribution, using their mean or average zzso zzso solutions retaining only one term of the series for zzso zzso and three terms for uniform distribution were suggested because of their good approximation to the exact zzso The results of finite element analysis showed that the release rate of an ensemble decreased with increasing standard zzso of particle zzso Using zzso zzso in the exact solution gave a prediction of release profile closer to that from the actual size distribution than using mean zzso The three zzso loading patterns within spheres all showed reduced initial burst and release rate, leading to more steady release rates than uniform zzso among which the zzso distribution offered the best zzso order zzso zzso initial loading among spheres seemed to have insignificant influence on the release zzso The volume ratio of liquid to a sphere ensemble played an important role in release zzso The derived zzso solutions are zzso to multiple spheres or a single sphere in a finite medium or in a perfect zzso
