zzso approaches towards functional and evolutionary zzso of unknown sequences have been suggested to be superior to those based only on zzso local zzso zzso software tools making the advantages of zzso zzso available for the ever widening range of zzso uninitiated biologists involved in zzso zzso projects are, however, not zzso We were particularly confronted with this issue in the zzso of sequences from different groups of complex algae originating from secondary zzso where the identification of the zzso origin of genes is often more problematic than in zzso well represented in the databases zzso animals, plants or zzso 

We present a flexible pipeline with a zzso interactive zzso user interface running on zzso computers that automatically performs a basic local alignment search tool zzso search of query zzso selects a representative subset of them, then creates a multiple alignment from the selected zzso and finally zzso a zzso zzso The pipeline, named zzso uses public domain software for all standard zzso tasks zzso search, multiple zzso and zzso zzso As the major technological innovation, selection of a meaningful subset of zzso hits was implemented using logic programming, zzso the selection procedure zzso tables, multiple alignments and zzso trees) are displayed zzso allowing the user to interact with the pipeline and deduce the function and zzso origin of the zzso zzso thus makes zzso zzso available also for those biologists without access to large computing facilities and with little zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is particularly useful when working with composite zzso zzso from complex zzso zzso can be helpful in expressed sequence tag and zzso zzso also in other zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso and Windows zzso as well as source zzso is available by anonymous zzso from zzso
