We present detailed passive cable models of layer 2/3 zzso cells based on zzso zzso zzso in response to brief current zzso at zzso and room temperatures and demonstrate how cooling alters the shape of zzso zzso Whole cell recordings were made from cells in visual cortical slices from zzso to zzso zzso The cells were filled with zzso and zzso were reconstructed from three cells which were representative of the full range of zzso zzso These formed the basis for zzso models with four electrical zzso namely membrane zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso shunt zzso zzso zzso models, with a single value for zzso and no zzso did not fit the data zzso zzso zzso values were derived by simulating the responses to zzso current zzso varying the parameters to give the best match to the experimental zzso zzso and zzso were badly zzso In contrast, the total membrane zzso zzso was well zzso and its zzso correlated closely with the zzso membrane time constant zzso The models showed close agreement for zzso and zzso zzso at 36 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but a larger range for zzso zzso zzso zzso produced consistent effects in all three model zzso zzso remained constant zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso whilst zzso dropped zzso zzso zzso In terms of whole cell zzso the zzso effect of cooling is to dramatically zzso the zzso of transient zzso zzso zzso suggest that this markedly increases the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and we demonstrate this effect in the responses of layer 2/3 cells to zzso zzso stimulation in layer zzso
