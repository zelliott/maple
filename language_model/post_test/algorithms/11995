A simple model of zzso three-dimensional construction is zzso The properties of this model are zzso Based on these properties, a fitness function is defined to characterize the structured patterns that can be generated by the zzso The fitness function assigns a value to each zzso The choice of the fitness function is validated by the fact that human observers tend to view patterns with high zzso zzso fitness as structured zzso zzso A genetic zzso based on this fitness function is used to explore the space of possible zzso The genetic zzso is able to make use of zzso of existing patterns and recombine them to produce novel patterns, but strong zzso interactions among genes make the fitness landscape rugged and prevent more complex patterns from being zzso
