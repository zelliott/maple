To develop a computer zzso simulator that may be used as a pediatric advanced life support zzso cognitive skill assessment tool and to pilot test a zzso scoring system for the zzso 

Development of an evaluation zzso followed by zzso zzso study of tool zzso 

zzso care pediatric zzso 

A total of 100 zzso providers from multiple zzso 

Using a consensus process with a group of six experts in pediatric emergency and critical care medicine, we developed scoring zzso to measure performance on four interactive zzso scenarios zzso zzso zzso electrical activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso providers zzso zzso zzso completed the scenarios on the simulator and the computer assessed their performance using the scoring zzso 

Case management scoring audits agreed zzso with computer scoring during pilot testing, indicating excellent zzso The mean time to complete all four cases was zzso zzso Performance scores were highest for zzso zzso management and lowest for zzso electrical activity zzso Survival was significantly more common than death in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso scenarios, whereas death was more common in the zzso electrical activity scenario zzso zzso zzso zzso status predicted a higher zzso score as well as higher scores in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electrical activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants who completed the zzso course on the same day as their assessment scored higher on the zzso zzso scenario zzso zzso zzso 

Personal computer-based simulation can be used to evaluate performance against consensus criteria in a large number of zzso zzso This technology could supplement traditional zzso by zzso frequent knowledge assessments as part of a zzso competency maintenance zzso
