zzso models are often used to test for zzso relationships from data collected in zzso trials or zzso This practice has deservedly come under heavy zzso because commonly used models such as linear and zzso zzso will often not capture the actual relationships between zzso and incorrectly specified models potentially lead to incorrect zzso In this article, we focus on hypothesis tests of whether the treatment given in a zzso trial has any effect on the mean of the primary outcome, within strata of baseline variables such as age, sex, and health zzso Our primary concern is ensuring that such hypothesis tests have correct type I error for large zzso Our main result is that for a surprisingly large class of commonly used zzso models, standard zzso hypothesis tests (but using robust zzso zzso are guaranteed to have correct type I error for large samples, even when the models are incorrectly zzso To the best of our knowledge, this zzso of such zzso hypothesis tests to incorrectly specified models was previously unknown for zzso zzso models and for other commonly used models we zzso Our results have practical implications for understanding the reliability of commonly used, zzso tests for analyzing zzso zzso
