As zzso projects rapidly increase the database of protein zzso the gap between known sequences and known structures continues to grow zzso increasing the demand to accelerate structure determination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are an attractive source of experimental restraints for zzso structure determination, particularly zzso zzso methods, because they yield both local and long-range zzso information and can be easily measured and assigned once the backbone zzso of a protein have been zzso While very extensive zzso data sets have been used to determine the structure of zzso it is unclear to what extent such methods will zzso to larger proteins with less complete data zzso Here we incorporate experimental zzso restraints into zzso an zzso zzso structure prediction method, and demonstrate that the combined zzso provides a general method for de zzso determination of a variety of protein folds from zzso zzso zzso structures for multiple proteins up to approximately 125 zzso in length and spanning a range of zzso complexities are rapidly and zzso generated using data sets that are insufficient in isolation to uniquely determine the protein fold de zzso although ambiguities and errors are observed for proteins with symmetry about an axis of the alignment zzso The models generated are not high-resolution structures completely defined by experimental data but are sufficiently accurate to accelerate traditional high-resolution zzso structure determination and provide zzso functional zzso
