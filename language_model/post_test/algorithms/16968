zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are valuable diagnostic tools for patients with neuroendocrine zzso zzso To date, a zzso about the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging methods is zzso zzso of our study is to zzso published data about the diagnostic performance of zzso PET or zzso in patients with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso A comprehensive computer literature search of studies published in zzso Scopus and zzso databases through October 2011 and regarding zzso PET or zzso in patients with zzso was carried zzso Only studies in which zzso PET or zzso were performed in patients with zzso and/or zzso zzso were selected zzso zzso zzso and neural crest derived zzso were excluded from the zzso zzso sensitivity, pooled specificity and area under the zzso curve were calculated to measure the diagnostic accuracy of zzso PET and zzso in zzso 

Sixteen studies zzso zzso patients were included in this zzso The pooled sensitivity and specificity of zzso PET or zzso in detecting zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, on a per zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve was zzso In patients with suspicious zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso demonstrated high sensitivity and zzso These accurate techniques should be considered as zzso diagnostic imaging methods in patients with suspicious zzso and/or zzso zzso
