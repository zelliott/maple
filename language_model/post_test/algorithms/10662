In order to improve the accuracy of the tooth zzso zzso zzso method, zzso zzso recording conditions were zzso The uncertainty of dose determination was obtained as the mean square zzso of doses, determined with the use of a zzso zzso program, from the nominal doses for ten zzso samples zzso in the range from 0 to 500 zzso The zzso were recorded at different zzso powers and zzso zzso It was shown that minimal uncertainty is achieved at the zzso power of about 2 zzso for a used zzso zzso zzso It was found that a limit of the zzso time exists beyond which uncertainty reduction is zzso At an established total time of zzso reduced uncertainty is obtained by averaging the experimental doses determined from recorded zzso following intermittent sample shaking and sample tube zzso rather than from one spectrum recorded at longer zzso zzso The effect of sample mass on the zzso sensitivity was investigated in order to find out how to make appropriate zzso
