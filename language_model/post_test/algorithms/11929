zzso infusions are potentially useful in the investigation of zzso zzso However, little information exists to validate this technique or to demonstrate its zzso This investigation was performed to determine whether accelerated infusion regimens reliably estimate the range of zzso zzso for molecules of varying zzso properties, to evaluate the ability of accelerated infusions to identify zzso zzso and to validate the accelerated infusion technique using compounds with known zzso zzso zzso incorporating accelerated infusion as the input function resulted in the anticipated zzso profiles that contained an initial lag phase before reaching a linear zzso This lag phase increased with increasing zzso volume and in some instances was sufficiently great to obscure or prevent the linear portion of the zzso These simulations also revealed that clearance estimated from the apparently linear portion of the zzso profile can be erroneous under some conditions, as for zzso zzso zzso of structured zzso produced the predicted profiles for compounds with low to moderate volumes of distribution while demonstrating that modeling of data derived from compounds with large volumes of distribution may be zzso Finally, experiments using accelerated infusions with various test compounds further demonstrated the usefulness of this technique while presenting limits imposed on the interpretation of the zzso The results of this investigation indicate that the accelerated infusion may be used to determine zzso zzso for compounds within certain zzso zzso but that appropriate caution should be exercised in the extent of interpretation that should be extracted from such zzso
