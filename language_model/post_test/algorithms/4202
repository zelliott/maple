Blind source separation zzso methods have become standard brain imaging tools and are routinely used for noise and artifact zzso as well as for zzso related spatial and zzso components from brain zzso Despite their popularity, zzso methods have rarely been used to explore maps of cortical thickness and zzso folding zzso Our limited knowledge of the relationship between cortical zzso brain development and zzso of the central nervous system makes zzso methods ideal investigative zzso We propose a novel spatial zzso method tailored for application to the cerebral zzso based on the second order blind identification zzso zzso Our method zzso the regular zzso and popular zzso zzso methods on zzso Application to maps of cortical thickness and zzso from normal controls reveals original structural zzso
