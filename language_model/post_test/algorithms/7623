Many zzso in the zzso magnetic resonance spectrum undergo zzso exchange with water, such as those in the downfield region zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso which can be measured to reveal additional information about the molecular zzso In addition, these zzso are attenuated by conventional water suppression techniques complicating detection and zzso To characterize these zzso in human skeletal muscle in zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to conduct a water inversion transfer experiment in both the zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso median zzso zzso times for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso anterior muscles, zzso zzso transfer rates from water to the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso exhibiting faster transfer rates for both zzso allowing speculation about possible influences of either muscle zzso orientation or muscle composition on the zzso transfer zzso These water zzso transfer rates observed without water suppression are in good agreement with earlier reports that used either zzso water suppression in rats, or short zzso sequences in human brain and skeletal zzso
