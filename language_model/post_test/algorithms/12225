Because data on rare species usually are zzso it is important to have efficient ways to sample additional zzso Traditional sampling approaches are of limited value for rare species because a very large proportion of randomly chosen sampling sites are unlikely to shelter the zzso For these species, spatial predictions from zzso distribution models can be used to zzso the sampling and increase sampling zzso New data sampled are then used to improve the initial zzso zzso this approach repeatedly is an zzso process that may allow increasing the number of new zzso zzso We illustrate the approach with a case study of a rare and endangered plant species in Switzerland and a simulation zzso Our field survey confirmed that the method helps in the discovery of new populations of the target species in remote areas where the predicted habitat suitability is zzso In our simulations the zzso approach provided a significant improvement (by a factor of zzso to 4 times, depending on the zzso over simple random zzso In terms of cost this approach may save up to zzso of the time spent in the zzso
