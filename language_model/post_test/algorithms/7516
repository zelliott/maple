zzso learning of medical images plays a potentially important role for modeling anatomical zzso within a population with zzso that include zzso zzso and prediction of clinical zzso This paper describes a novel method for learning the zzso of zzso brain images that, unlike most existing zzso learning methods, does not require the zzso space to be locally zzso and does not require a zzso similarity measure or a zzso proximity zzso Our zzso learning method is based on deep learning, a machine learning approach that uses layered networks (called deep belief networks, or zzso and has received much attention recently in the computer vision field due to their success in object recognition zzso zzso have traditionally been too zzso expensive for application to zzso images due to the large number of zzso zzso Our primary contributions are zzso a much more zzso efficient training method for zzso that makes training on zzso medical images with a resolution of up to 128 zzso 128 zzso 128 practical, and zzso the demonstration that zzso can learn a zzso zzso of brain volumes that detects modes of variations that correlate to demographic and disease zzso
