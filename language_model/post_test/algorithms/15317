zzso structure refinement refers to the process of improving the qualities of protein structures during structure modeling processes to bring them closer to their native zzso zzso refinement has been drawing increasing attention in the zzso Critical Assessment of techniques for zzso zzso prediction zzso experiments since its addition in zzso zzso zzso During the zzso and recently concluded zzso zzso experiments, a consistent growth in number of refinement targets and participating groups has been zzso Yet, protein structure refinement still remains a largely zzso problem with majority of participating groups in zzso refinement category failed to consistently improve the quality of structures issued for zzso In order to alleviate this need, we developed a completely automated and zzso efficient protein zzso structure refinement method, zzso based on an zzso and highly zzso energy zzso zzso with a powerful zzso composite physics and zzso force fields and hydrogen bonding zzso network zzso zzso In the recent zzso blind experiment, zzso zzso (as zzso was ranked as the best method in the server section as per the official assessment of zzso zzso Here we provide the community with free access to zzso software and systematically zzso the performance of zzso in strict blind mode on the refinement targets issued in zzso refinement category and compare with other state-of-the-art refinement methods participating in zzso Our analysis demonstrates that zzso is only zzso server participating in zzso exhibiting consistent improvement over the initial structures in both global and local structural quality zzso zzso version of zzso is freely available at zzso
