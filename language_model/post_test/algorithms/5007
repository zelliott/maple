There is a paucity of relevant experimental information available for the evaluation of the potential health and environmental effects of many man made zzso zzso of the potential pathways for activity provides a rational basis for the extrapolations inherent in the preliminary evaluation of risk and the establishment of priorities for obtaining missing data for environmental zzso The differential step in many mechanisms of toxicity may be generalized as the interaction between a small zzso (a potential zzso and one or more zzso zzso An approach based on zzso of the interaction between a potential molecular zzso and a library of zzso targets of toxicity has been proposed for preliminary chemical zzso In the current study, the interaction between a series of environmentally relevant chemicals and models of the rat zzso receptors zzso was zzso and the results compared to an experimental data set of their relative binding zzso The experimental data set consists of 281 zzso selected from the zzso zzso zzso Substances Control Act zzso zzso that were initially screened using the rat zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Secondary analysis, using zzso plots and slope zzso was applied to confirm that only 15 of these test chemicals were true competitive zzso of zzso binding with experimental zzso zzso zzso less than 100 zzso Two different rapid zzso zzso methods have been zzso Each provides a score that is a surrogate for the strength of the interaction between each zzso zzso Using the score that indicates the strongest interaction for each pair, without consideration of the geometry of binding between the zzso and the target, all of the active molecules were discovered in the first zzso of the zzso When a filter is applied on the basis of the geometry of a simplified zzso for binding to the zzso the results are improved, and all of the active molecules were discovered in the first zzso of the zzso In order to obtain no false zzso in the model that includes the zzso zzso only 8 molecules are false zzso These results indicate that molecular zzso zzso that were designed to find the chemicals that act most strongly at a zzso (and therefore are potential zzso can efficiently separate zzso active chemicals from a library of primarily inactive zzso The advantage of using a zzso filter suggests that the development of filters of this type for other receptors will prove zzso
