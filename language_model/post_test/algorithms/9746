The zzso zzso is a continually renewing structure that provides the interface between the zzso and an innately hostile zzso The zzso is its principal zzso zzso proteins form a physical zzso barrier, protect against microbial damage, and prepare immune responses to zzso zzso immunity is zzso in many common diseases and zzso zzso differentiation zzso many zzso In order to identify the genes that mediate zzso development we used a tissue model of the skin derived from primary human zzso We measured global gene expression in zzso at five times over the ten days that the zzso took to fully zzso We identified zzso gene transcripts that significantly changed during differentiation zzso discovery rate zzso We robustly grouped these transcripts by zzso zzso into zzso with distinct zzso expression patterns, shared regulatory zzso and biological zzso We found a striking cluster of late expressed genes that form the structural and innate immune zzso of the zzso zzso Gene zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso were zzso by genes for zzso and the zzso immune zzso We systematically identified zzso zzso which may operate with the zzso calcium zzso to control zzso division during skin zzso The results provide multiple novel insights into zzso biology, in particular providing a comprehensive list of known and previously zzso major components of the zzso zzso The findings provide a reference for subsequent understanding of how the barrier functions in health and zzso
