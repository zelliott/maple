To zzso evaluate the experience of a single surgeon zzso with zzso zzso 

105 zzso patients were zzso by the same surgeon between 1994 - zzso The patients were classified into three groups according to the surgical technique zzso zzso plate zzso was performed in Group zzso zzso with zzso skin or zzso was carried out in Group II and repair with zzso zzso was performed in Group zzso 

Mean age at operation was zzso years zzso zzso - 23 zzso Mean number of operations performed was 2 (1 - zzso Group I consisted of 33, Group II of 64, Group III of 8 zzso zzso for zzso were complete or partial zzso loss in 71 zzso big and multiple zzso in 29; zzso or zzso zzso in 11 zzso One had zzso Two had partial corpus zzso zzso zzso or secondary zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso and zzso in Group I, II and III, zzso zzso complication rate was zzso zzso 

Severe complications can develop not only in zzso but also after zzso zzso zzso Local supportive zzso can be provided more easily in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso had no complications in our series as it was only used in well selected zzso If zzso plate is present and wide enough, its zzso should lead to better results in zzso If it is absent or narrow, zzso based or zzso island zzso should be zzso Though the zzso island zzso is known to be well zzso zzso our results with zzso based zzso were zzso We preferred using the zzso zzso when zzso plate was absent and penile skin was not zzso We suggest using the zzso technique for large penile defects of the zzso and not in the zzso zzso But its use as local supportive tissue in zzso can be very zzso
