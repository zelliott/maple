We present one-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of a zzso initially uniform, freely evolving zzso zzso zzso particles swap their relative position with a 50% probability allowing for the initial spatial ordering of the particles to evolve in time and zzso forces to zzso Unlike one-dimensional systems of identical zzso zzso one-dimensional systems of zzso particles are zzso and the zzso zzso zzso tend to evolve towards zzso zzso Under such conditions, standard fluid equations with merely an additional sink term in the energy zzso reflecting the zzso of the zzso collisions, provide an excellent means to investigate the system's zzso According to the predictions of fluid theory we find that the zzso instability is dominated by a zzso mode at a wavelength of the order 10 zzso zzso zzso , where N is the total number of zzso L the spatial extent of the system and zzso the zzso zzso The typical fluid zzso at the time of zzso collapse are seen to be zzso unless N zzso 10 zzso zzso Species zzso driven by the zzso force occurs as a result of the strong temperature zzso within clusters which pushes the light particles towards the zzso edges and the heavy particles towards the zzso zzso within clusters is complete at the time of zzso zzso
