We present a unified derivation of the zzso diffusion zzso for both zzso and zzso transport in zzso absorbing zzso The derivation is based on a modal analysis of the zzso zzso transfer zzso This approach confirms that the dynamic diffusion zzso is given by the zzso result D zzso zzso where zzso is the transport mean free path and c is the energy zzso independent of the level of zzso It also shows that the diffusion zzso for zzso zzso often used in biomedical zzso depends on zzso in agreement with recent theoretical and experimental zzso These two results resolve a zzso controversy in light propagation and imaging in scattering zzso
