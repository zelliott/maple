Numerous studies have shown that strange zzso zzso zzso can be observed generally in zzso forced zzso These systems could be one- or zzso zzso zzso systems, or experimental zzso Recently introduced measures of complexity based on recurrence plots can detect the transitions from zzso to chaotic motion via zzso in the previously cited zzso We study here the case of zzso systems and experimental zzso In particular, we show the performance of the recurrence measures in detecting transitions to zzso in zzso forced excitable systems and experimental time zzso
