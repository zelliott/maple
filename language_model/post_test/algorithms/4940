This paper proposes a zzso framework for efficiently aligning zzso Although conventional Active zzso Models zzso approaches have achieved some success, they suffer from the zzso problem, zzso how to align any image with a generic zzso We treat the zzso image alignment problem as a process of maximizing the score of a trained zzso zzso that is able to distinguish correct alignment zzso class) from incorrect alignment zzso zzso During the modeling stage, given a set of images with ground truth landmarks, we train a conventional Point Distribution Model zzso and a zzso zzso which acts as an appearance zzso When tested on an image with the initial landmark locations, the proposed zzso zzso updates the shape parameters of the zzso via the zzso ascent method such that the zzso score of the warped image is zzso We use the term zzso zzso Models zzso to refer to the learned shape and appearance models, as well as our specific alignment zzso The proposed framework is applied to the face alignment zzso Using extensive zzso we show that, compared to the zzso approach, this framework greatly improves the zzso zzso and efficiency of face alignment by a large margin, especially for unseen zzso
