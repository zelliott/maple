We study the effect of zzso additive noise on the sample zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Heart zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso A zzso 158 zzso for analyzing time zzso Using surrogate data tests, we zzso investigate the ability of the zzso index to detect zzso in simulated time series corrupted by increased amounts of zzso zzso and continuous chaotic and zzso systems are included in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso distributed noises are zzso The results indicate that the zzso statistic is a robust index for detecting zzso in time series corrupted by zzso zzso
