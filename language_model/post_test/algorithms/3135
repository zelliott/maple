We have performed an extensive zzso analysis of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of human muscle zzso Our findings indicate that the regions that promote zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are different from those that promote zzso under milder conditions zzso zzso zzso changes in the rate of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso result not only from zzso situated in the regions of the sequence that play a key role in the mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso but also from zzso located in other zzso In order to zzso these results, we have used a modified version of the zzso zzso propensity prediction zzso to take into account structural zzso of the zzso that may be induced by changes in solution zzso Our results suggest that a wider range of zzso contributes to the stability of the zzso in addition to those that play an important kinetic role in the zzso zzso The zzso approach described here is capable of providing zzso information on the structure and dynamics of zzso zzso under conditions close to zzso and should be widely zzso to other zzso
