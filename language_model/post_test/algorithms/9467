Biological systems often transport charges and zzso processes over substantial zzso Traditional models of chemical zzso generally do not describe such extreme zzso zzso In this Review, an zzso model for a zzso transport of information, which was specifically developed for zzso is zzso Chemical zzso is taken as the result of zzso effects based on zzso zzso zzso involving unique, very rapid zzso properties of peptides in the zzso zzso The zzso model suggests highly efficient transport of charge and zzso in an isolated zzso over a substantial distance; conversely, a very low efficiency in a water environment was zzso The model suggests zzso transport of charge and zzso over substantial molecular distances in a zzso zzso Many such zzso can be active in a zzso
