zzso and zzso are often asked to estimate the risk for zzso zzso zzso or cardiac death in patients being considered for zzso zzso zzso this risk in an individual patient is difficult and zzso Although zzso imaging tests are often used for this purpose, a review of the literature reveals that the positive zzso value of zzso imaging tests is zzso low and that they do not provide information beyond that obtained by assessing simple clinical risk zzso Moreover, no evidence exists that zzso imaging tests lead to a therapeutic strategy that reduces the risk for zzso zzso zzso or cardiac zzso Since the publication of guidelines for zzso risk zzso by the American College of zzso Heart Association in 1996 and the American College of Physicians in 1997, three clinical trials have shown that zzso therapy reduces the risk for zzso cardiac zzso This paper focuses on the relationship between risk zzso and subsequent therapy to minimize or eliminate zzso In short, the paradigm is shifting from predicting which patient is at high risk for having a zzso cardiac event to minimizing the likelihood of such an event with specific zzso zzso zzso
