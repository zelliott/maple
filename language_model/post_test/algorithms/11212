Dedicated breast CT has great potential for improving the detection and diagnosis of breast zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso in dedicated breast CT is a promising alternative to traditional filtered zzso zzso One of the difficulties in using zzso is the presence of free parameters in the zzso that control the appearance of the resulting zzso These parameters require tuning in order to achieve high quality zzso In this study, the authors investigated the penalized maximum likelihood zzso method with two commonly used types of zzso penalty zzso zzso potential and zzso total variation zzso zzso zzso images were compared with images obtained using standard zzso zzso parameters for zzso with the zzso prior are reported for the task of detecting zzso embedded in breast zzso 

Computer simulations were used to acquire projections in a zzso beam zzso The modeled setup describes a realistic breast CT zzso system, with an zzso zzso produced by a point source and an zzso zzso flat-panel zzso A zzso zzso breast phantom with 280 zzso zzso spheres embedded in it was used to model zzso properties of the zzso woman's breast in a zzso zzso The reconstruction of zzso images was performed using the zzso zzso surrogates zzso with ordered zzso Task performance was assessed with the ideal observer zzso index to determine optimal zzso zzso 

The zzso findings suggest that there is a preferred range of values of the zzso penalty weight and the edge preservation threshold in the penalized objective function with the zzso potential, which resulted in low noise images with high contrast zzso zzso In terms of zzso observer zzso index, the zzso method with optimal parameters yielded substantially improved performance (by a factor of greater than 10) compared to zzso The zzso prior was also observed to be superior to the TV zzso A few of the best-performing zzso pairs for the zzso method also demonstrated superior performance for various radiation zzso In fact, using zzso with certain zzso values results in better images, acquired using 2 zzso dose, than zzso images acquired using 6 zzso zzso 

A range of optimal free parameters for the zzso zzso with zzso and TV zzso zzso is presented for the zzso detection task, in dedicated breast zzso The reported values can be used as starting values of the free zzso when zzso techniques are used for image zzso zzso improvement in image quality can be achieved by using zzso with optimal combination of zzso as compared to zzso zzso these results suggest improved detection of zzso can be obtained by using zzso with lower radiation dose to the patient, than using zzso with higher zzso
