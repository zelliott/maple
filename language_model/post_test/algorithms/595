zzso zzso 3 zzso 3) is a zzso zzso involved in the zzso of structural proteins required in the assembly of the cell zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso 3, like zzso 2, can zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso despite lacking structural zzso with other zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure determined at zzso A resolution of zzso 3 in complex with zzso to zzso the structural features required for zzso zzso zzso affinities for various zzso were found by zzso displacement to be as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso binds as a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso 3 zzso activity, similar to zzso and zzso A genetic zzso similarity program zzso approach (virtual zzso zzso identified three compounds from the Lead Quest trade mark data base zzso zzso based on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from our crystal structures to generate the minimum align flexible zzso These three were zzso zzso without a zzso group containing the minimal binding motif for zzso 3 that includes a zzso recognition zzso zzso affinities were measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these compounds do not inhibit but instead activate zzso 3 zzso by about zzso These results suggest that the zzso binding pocket in zzso 3 may be exploited to either enhance or inhibit the zzso activity as required for different therapeutic zzso
