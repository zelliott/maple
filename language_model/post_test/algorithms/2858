zzso filtering is frequently used for visual tracking problems since it provides a general framework for zzso and zzso probability density functions for zzso and zzso dynamic zzso However, this zzso is based on a zzso Carlo approach and the cost of sampling and measurement is a problematic issue, especially for zzso zzso We describe an alternative to the classical particle filter in which the underlying density function has an zzso representation for better approximation and effective zzso The techniques of density zzso and density approximation are introduced to represent the likelihood and the zzso zzso with zzso zzso where all relevant parameters are automatically zzso The proposed zzso approach is shown to perform more efficiently in sampling in zzso zzso We apply the zzso to real-time tracking problems and demonstrate its performance on real video sequences as well as synthetic zzso
