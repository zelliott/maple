zzso zzso are zzso areas especially for zzso crashes due to the fact that the diversity of the zzso behaviors of drivers increases during the signal zzso The objective of this article is to improve knowledge of the relationship between zzso crashes occurring at zzso zzso and a series of potential traffic risk factors classified by driver zzso zzso and vehicle zzso 

Based on the 2001 Florida crash database, the zzso tree method and zzso exposure concept were used to perform the statistical zzso Two zzso zzso tree models were developed in this zzso One was used for the crash comparison between zzso and zzso to identify those specific trends of the zzso zzso The other was constructed for the comparison between striking zzso zzso and struck zzso zzso to find more complex crash pattern associated with the traffic attributes of driver, vehicle, and zzso 

The modeling results showed that the zzso crashes are zzso in the higher speed limits zzso zzso the zzso crash propensity for daytime is apparently larger than zzso and the reduction of zzso capacity due to wet and slippery road surface conditions would definitely contribute to zzso crashes, especially at zzso with higher speed zzso The tree model segmented drivers into four homogeneous age groups: zzso 21 years, zzso years, zzso years, and zzso 75 zzso The youngest driver group shows the largest crash zzso in the zzso age group, the male drivers are zzso in zzso crashes under adverse weather conditions and the zzso years drivers driving large size vehicles have a larger crash propensity compared to those driving passenger zzso 

Combined with the zzso exposure concept, the zzso tree method is a proper statistical tool for zzso analysis to investigate crash zzso Compared to the zzso zzso models, tree models have advantages for handling continuous independent variables and easily explaining the complex interaction effect with more than two independent zzso This research recommended that at zzso zzso with higher speed limits, reducing the speed limit to 40 zzso efficiently contribute to a lower accident zzso Drivers involved in alcohol use may increase not only zzso crash risk but also the driver injury zzso Education and enforcement zzso should focus on the driver group younger than 21 zzso Further studies are suggested to compare crash risk zzso of the driver age for other main crash types to seek corresponding traffic zzso
