For the last 2 decades, zzso reconstruction has been an active field of research and has seen the development of a large number of major zzso Because of the growing popularity of the zzso methods, it has become necessary to evaluate the performance of these zzso to determine which are the best options (especially with regard to the zzso approach that is widely zzso In this study, seven of the most commonly used zzso methods are investigated by using a large empirical data set (in terms of number of zzso and molecular zzso from the worldwide flowering plant family zzso zzso methods were evaluated using several criteria: similarity of the zzso with the input trees, similarity between the zzso and the total evidence tree, level of resolution of the zzso and zzso time required by the zzso Additional analyses were also conducted on a reduced data set to test if the performance levels were affected by the zzso searches rather than the zzso zzso Based on our results, two main groups of zzso methods were zzso on one hand, the zzso representation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods performed well according to our criteria, whereas the average consensus, split fit, and most similar zzso methods showed a poorer performance or at least did not behave the same way as the total evidence zzso zzso for the super distance zzso that is, the most recent approach tested here, were promising with at least one derived method performing as well as zzso zzso and zzso The output of each method was only slightly improved when applied to the reduced data set, suggesting a correct behavior of the zzso searches and a relatively low sensitivity of the zzso to data set sizes and missing zzso zzso also showed that the zzso analyses could reach a high level of quality even when using a simple zzso search strategy, with the exception of zzso with zzso coding scheme and zzso zzso The future of zzso lies in the zzso of a standardized zzso search for all methods and the increase in computing power to handle large data zzso The latter would prove to be particularly useful for promising approaches such as the maximum quartet fit method that yet requires substantial computing zzso
