This correspondence proposes a systematic zzso zzso controller design for the robust control of zzso systems with uncertain zzso An adaptation tuning approach without zzso switching is developed to deal with unknown but bounded system zzso Tracking performance is zzso System zzso as well as stability, is proven by using the zzso zzso The upper bounds of uncertainties are not required to be known in zzso zzso the proposed method can be effectively zzso Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control zzso
