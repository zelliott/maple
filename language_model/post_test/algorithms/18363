This paper addresses the problem of constructing a mechanical model for the abdominal zzso and zzso its parameters to in zzso measurable zzso The zzso is modeled as a zzso zzso zzso zzso stressed zzso tube, subjected to an internal zzso The model parameters are determined by stating a zzso problem for the model pressure and computing the optimal solution by a zzso zzso The data used in this study is in zzso zzso data for the abdominal zzso of a 24-year-old zzso The results show that the zzso zzso and zzso stresses have zzso in the span 0 to 180 zzso Furthermore, the results show that it is possible to determine model parameters directly from in zzso measurable zzso In particular, the parameters describing the residual stress distribution can be obtained without zzso zzso
