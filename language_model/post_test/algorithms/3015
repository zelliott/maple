Physical interactions between different cell types are a requirement for the initiation and maintenance of immune zzso The distribution pattern of cells within a tissue may result from specific zzso or random zzso zzso architecture, degree of zzso zzso of cells, number of contact partners, cell type, and size as well as cell movement and contact time determine the distribution of cells within zzso We developed a zzso model to determine the degree of expected random distribution of two cell types (A and zzso and zzso within tissue zzso The model predictions were compared with experimental data derived from zzso zzso We implemented a computer zzso for automatic image analysis to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the number of cells type A zzso the total cell number zzso and the mean number of cells that are in contact with cells type B zzso the ratio of cells type B in contact with cells type A can be described by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso see zzso We applied the model system to investigate the distribution of zzso regulatory T cells with zzso zzso cells within mouse tissue zzso The zzso model provides a tool to describe the expected distribution of two different cell types and their zzso within zzso Comparing the degree of expected random distribution with experimental data might help to propose functional zzso in tissue zzso
