zzso zzso zzso is a method of zzso that reconstructs the elastic properties of tissue using images acquired under different loading conditions and a zzso zzso zzso conditions are a critical input to the zzso and are often determined by time-consuming point correspondence methods requiring manual user zzso This study presents a novel method of automatically generating boundary conditions by zzso registering two image sets with a demons zzso registration zzso The use of this method was successfully performed in zzso using magnetic resonance and zzso zzso image data with known boundary zzso These preliminary results produced boundary conditions with an accuracy of up to zzso compared to the known zzso zzso boundary conditions were zzso within a 3-D zzso reconstruction to determine an elasticity contrast ratio between tumor and normal zzso Two phantom experiments were then conducted to further test the accuracy of the demons boundary conditions and the zzso reconstruction arising from the use of these zzso zzso results show a reasonable characterization of the material properties on this first attempt and a significant improvement in the automation level and viability of the zzso
