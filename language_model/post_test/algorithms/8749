The green zzso zzso zzso accumulates the red zzso zzso accompanied by zzso changes under stress conditions, including zzso zzso continuous light and high zzso To investigate the zzso state of the zzso cells, we developed the digital zzso software called zzso The software automatically zzso 25 zzso zzso of cell zzso and zzso based on color, zzso microscopic zzso Compared with manual inspection, the output values of cell shape were reliable and zzso The estimated zzso content fits the values calculated by conventional zzso Using a random forests zzso we were able to distinguish zzso cells from zzso cells and detect their transient appearance in zzso By performing principal components analysis, we also successfully monitored zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso Thus, combined with zzso statistical techniques, the software proves useful for studying cellular responses to various conditions as well as for monitoring population dynamics in zzso
