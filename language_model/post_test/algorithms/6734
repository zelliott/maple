zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of neural circuits involved in diverse behaviors in a wide variety of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso the zzso pattern of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is also required for zzso of the timing of behavioral events associated with locomotion and for zzso zzso behavior with zzso Using an automated tracking system to record zzso behavior over long time zzso we determined that both the direction and zzso of movement zzso in a zzso pattern in zzso zzso During periods of active zzso the patterns of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso increased zzso before zzso events, while zzso increased in frequency following zzso zzso The zzso coordination between zzso and locomotion was dependent on the zzso HSN zzso zzso as well as the decision-making zzso zzso which receive synaptic input from the zzso zzso zzso also failed to coordinate zzso and locomotion and exhibited an zzso low overall reversal zzso Thus, zzso appears to function specifically to facilitate increased locomotion during periods of active zzso and to function generally to zzso decision-making zzso that promote forward zzso
