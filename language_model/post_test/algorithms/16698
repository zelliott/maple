zzso dosing is affected by clinical and genetic zzso but the contribution of the zzso associated with zzso resistance in zzso zzso has not been well assessed zzso We developed a new dosing zzso including zzso associated both with zzso sensitivity and resistance in the Italian population, and its performance was compared with those of eight previously published zzso 

Clinical and genetic data zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso A, and zzso zzso G zzso zzso were used to elaborate the new zzso zzso and validation groups comprised 55 zzso men, mean age 69 zzso and 40 zzso men, mean age 70 zzso patients, respectively, who were on stable zzso therapy for at least 3 months with different oral zzso therapy zzso zzso 

Performance of the new algorithm, evaluated with mean absolute error zzso defined as the absolute value of the difference between observed daily maintenance dose and predicted daily dose, correlation with the observed dose and zzso value, was comparable with or slightly lower than that obtained using the other zzso The new zzso could correctly assign zzso zzso and zzso of patients to the low zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso and high zzso 45 zzso dosing range, zzso Our data showed a significant increase in zzso accuracy among patients requiring high zzso dose compared with the other zzso zzso from zzso to zzso 

The zzso including zzso zzso G zzso A, associated with zzso resistance, allowed a more accurate identification of resistant patients who require higher zzso zzso
