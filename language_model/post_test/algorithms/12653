zzso the chemical shift prediction programs zzso and zzso to a data base of protein structures with known chemical shifts we show that the averaged chemical shifts predicted from the structural ensembles explain better the experimental data than the lowest energy zzso This is in agreement with the fact that proteins in solution occur in multiple zzso states in fast exchange on the chemical shift time zzso However, in contrast to the real conditions in solution at ambient temperatures, the standard zzso structural calculation methods as well chemical shift prediction methods are zzso to predict the lowest energy ground state structure that is only zzso populated at zzso zzso An analysis of the data shows that a chemical shift prediction can be used as measure to define the minimum size of the structural bundle required for a faithful description of the structural zzso
