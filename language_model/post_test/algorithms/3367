zzso zzso for finding restriction zzso recognition sites use zzso zzso which run in time zzso where N is the number of zzso in the sequence under analysis and M is the total number of zzso in all the different sites being searched zzso This paper presents a deterministic finite state machine zzso which runs in time zzso Memory use can be as high as zzso but a slight modification to the basic zzso can impose a theoretical upper bound of zzso at the cost of some added complexity in the execution of the state zzso The zzso can operate with a single pass through the sequence under analysis, with no need to back up or (for zzso zzso store more than a single input character at a zzso This type of zzso can be adapted to many zzso tasks and is simple enough to implement in hardware that it could, for example, be built into a disk controller as part of a specialized database zzso
