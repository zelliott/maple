In this paper, we propose and study a general array model of coupled delayed neural networks with hybrid zzso which is composed of constant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the zzso functional method and zzso product properties, several sufficient conditions are established to ensure global exponential synchronization based on the design of the zzso zzso the inner linking zzso and/or some free zzso representing the relationships between the system zzso The conditions are expressed within the framework of linear zzso inequalities, which can be easily zzso by the zzso zzso In addition, a typical chaotic cellular neural network is used as the zzso in the array to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical zzso
