Acid yellow 23 zzso is a pervasive zzso dye used in many fields which is potentially harmful to the environment and human zzso This paper studied the toxic effects of zzso on zzso by zzso and molecular zzso zzso The addition of zzso effectively zzso the intrinsic zzso of zzso via zzso zzso with association zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso The calculated zzso parameters zzso that zzso binds to zzso predominantly via zzso forces with one binding zzso zzso investigations indicated the skeletal structure of zzso unfolded and the zzso of zzso changed with the addition of zzso zzso zzso study showed that zzso zzso with the His 57 and zzso 224 zzso of zzso and led to the zzso of zzso zzso This study offers a more comprehensive picture of zzso interaction and indicates their interaction may perform toxic effects within the zzso
