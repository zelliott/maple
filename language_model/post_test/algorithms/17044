We have developed a set of tools, zzso to zzso and zzso mutate a DNA sequence to generate benchmark data sets for testing DNA sequence assembly zzso Data parameters can be systematically and independently varied to explore the range of zzso corresponding performance of assembly zzso on large-scale random, or zzso sequencing zzso
