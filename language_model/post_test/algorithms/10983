This zzso study provides an error analysis of an idealized zzso sequencing method in which zzso current zzso are used to sequence intact zzso DNA in the zzso while an zzso controls DNA zzso Examples of systematic channel errors when more than one zzso affects the current zzso are detailed, which if present will persist regardless of zzso Absent such zzso random errors associated with tracking through zzso regions are shown to zzso reading known sequences zzso coli zzso at least 140 times to achieve zzso accuracy zzso By exploiting the ability to reread each strand at each pore in an zzso arbitrary positioning on an error rate versus zzso zzso curve is possible if systematic errors are zzso with zzso governed by the number of pores in the array and the zzso turnover zzso
