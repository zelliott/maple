zzso zzso zzso 27, zzso zzso reported that absolute efficiency for the detection of static, one-dimensional zzso noise was high and approximately constant for stimulus zzso ranging from 1 to 6 zzso This result implies that human observers integrated information efficiently across a wide range of spatial zzso One interpretation of this zzso similar results obtained with auditory stimuli zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, 121 zzso that human observers, like ideal observers, can detect stimuli using an internal filter that has an adjustable zzso The current experiments replicate zzso findings, extend them to the case where observers are uncertain about stimulus zzso and use the zzso image technique to estimate the filter used to detect noise stimuli that differ in zzso Our results suggest that observers do not adjust channel bandwidth to match the stimulus and that detection thresholds are consistent with the predictions of a zzso zzso
