A zzso Carlo study of the zzso factor of zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso beams relative to zzso gamma rays has been performed using zzso zzso Carlo zzso The sensitive volume of the detector was simulated as a disc of diameter zzso zzso and thickness 1 zzso The phantom material was water and the zzso depth was zzso zzso in zzso zzso beams and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The results show that the zzso of the zzso and zzso is constant within zzso for zzso beam energies in the energy range of zzso gamma rays to 25 zzso X zzso However, both detectors show an enhanced response for zzso zzso beams, which in the case of 50 zzso X rays is zzso times higher than that for zzso gamma zzso The zzso factor was zzso for zzso zzso in 50 zzso X zzso The zzso detector has an zzso that is zzso times higher than that of zzso in 50 zzso X rays decreasing to zzso for 250 zzso X zzso The results show that the addition of zzso or zzso of carbon by weight (as zzso into the zzso does not change the zzso Carlo determined zzso factor by more than zzso
