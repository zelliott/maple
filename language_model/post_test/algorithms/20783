An zzso zzso membrane mirror has been successfully used to zzso the brightness of solid-state zzso zzso zzso laser where the zzso of a zzso zzso mode was zzso and a grazing zzso zzso laser where a brightness increase by an order of magnitude with negligible drop in power was zzso Several search zzso were also implemented in the system and compared with respect to zzso zzso
