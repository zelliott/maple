zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso zzso However to perform zzso requires that an input function is measured, namely a plasma time activity curve zzso zzso input functions zzso are attractive because they are zzso and nearly no blood loss is zzso However, the spatial resolution and the signal to noise ratio zzso of PET images are low, which degrades the accuracy of zzso The objective of this study was to extract accurate input functions from zzso images with zero or one plasma sample using zzso packet based zzso decomposition independent component analysis zzso zzso Two approaches were used in this zzso The first was the use of simulated dynamic rat images with different spatial resolutions and zzso and the second was the use of dynamic images of eight zzso zzso We also used a zzso input function and a fuzzy zzso zzso approach and compared their results with those obtained by our method using zzso root mean square zzso area under curve zzso and correlation zzso Our results showed that the accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso approach was better than the other approaches using both simulated and realistic zzso The errors in the zzso rate, as estimated by zzso zzso zzso were also the smallest using our zzso
