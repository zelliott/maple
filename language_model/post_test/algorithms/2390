The sequences of coiled coils are characterized by a repeating zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which the a and d zzso are generally zzso and form the interface between the two zzso In this study, rat and chicken zzso zzso have been used as models to determine whether the effects of zzso on the stability of zzso coiled coils can be predicted by a simple zzso The zzso zzso of three zzso muscle zzso and nine zzso in which the second and/or sixth or ninth coding zzso of one zzso zzso were replaced with zzso from other zzso zzso with a sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso or a random zzso zzso have been obtained using circular zzso zzso zzso is almost completely zzso along its entire zzso but there is no correlation of the zzso stability of the zzso with the zzso propensity of their component zzso zzso The stability can be predicted zzso zzso zzso however, by assigning a weight to every zzso acid zzso in each zzso depending on its frequency of occurrence at the zzso or g position in a data base of zzso zzso zzso and summing all the zzso The correlation improves if only the zzso at the a and d interface are counted zzso zzso zzso The major factor modulating the zzso stability appears to be the zzso of the zzso at the zzso zzso since there is a high correlation zzso zzso zzso of the TM values with the sum of the zzso moments of the zzso found at the a and d zzso
