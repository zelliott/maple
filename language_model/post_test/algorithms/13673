zzso the sensation of itch, which evokes zzso scratching behavior, has a diverse zzso Because of its clinical significance, mechanisms of zzso are an important zzso In the present work we describe and validate a paw motion detector zzso zzso The system employs a small removable metal band placed on one hind paw that provides a signal indicative of paw movement through zzso of an electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso mice were fitted with a unilateral hind paw band and adapted to testing zzso equipped with zzso signal zzso and zzso The following observations were made: zzso in mice, unilateral zzso injection of zzso into the zzso aspect of the neck evoked periodic high frequency bursts of scratching at the injected site with the zzso zzso but not the zzso (not zzso hind zzso zzso Cross correlation between zzso and human observer counts after zzso zzso using the specified zzso zzso revealed a highly significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso over a zzso zzso produced dose dependent zzso which zzso dose zzso zzso zzso scratching displayed an inverse zzso dose response curve, which was insensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso at intervals over 28 days showed no change in the scratching response within the same cohort of zzso zzso Power analysis showed zzso changes in scratching activity could be detected at the zzso level with groups of 4 zzso These observations indicate that the system described can efficiently define the actions and pharmacology of zzso zzso
