We present an accurate and fast web server, zzso for predicting zzso zzso of proteins based on sequence similarity and weighted Gene zzso zzso zzso A term weighting method in the text categorization process is applied to GO terms for a support zzso machine zzso As a result, zzso zzso the state-of-the-art methods for previously used test zzso zzso supports three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and provides zzso analysis, and covers several sets of cellular zzso In addition, zzso provides zzso multiple possible zzso of input zzso as well as their corresponding probability scores, zzso weights of GO terms representing the contribution of each GO term in the zzso and zzso a zzso zzso for the best hit with GO zzso If the similarity score does not meet a given zzso an zzso acid zzso prediction is applied as a backup zzso
