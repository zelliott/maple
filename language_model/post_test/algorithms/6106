Digital zzso is an emerging technology to protect multimedia content from illegal zzso where each distributed copy is labeled with unique identification zzso In video zzso huge amount of data have to be transmitted to a large number of users under stringent zzso constraints, so the zzso distribution of uniquely zzso copies is zzso This paper investigates the secure zzso of zzso zzso video in streaming applications and analyzes their zzso We first propose a general fingerprint zzso scheme that can be used with most spread spectrum zzso multimedia zzso zzso To further improve the bandwidth efficiency, we explore the special structure of the fingerprint design and propose a joint fingerprint design and distribution zzso From our simulations, the two proposed schemes can reduce the bandwidth requirement by zzso to zzso depending on the number of users, the characteristics of video zzso and the network and zzso zzso We also show that under the constraint that all zzso have the same probability of zzso the embedded fingerprints in the two schemes have approximately the same collusion zzso Finally, we propose a fingerprint drift compensation scheme to improve the quality of the reconstructed sequences at the zzso side without introducing extra communication zzso
