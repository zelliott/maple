Tablet zzso compositions for zzso prolonged release were selected by surface response zzso The extreme zzso experimental design was used to develop a surface response model which zzso defined the release of active component from the tablet zzso as controlled by the percentage of the zzso zzso The model, a statistical zzso equation with a standard error of zzso was validated for accurate prediction of drug release profiles and used to identify optimum zzso This study demonstrated a new application of the extreme zzso experimental design, an efficient method for evaluating a complex mixture system for controlled release, where specific constraints are placed on one or more of the zzso
