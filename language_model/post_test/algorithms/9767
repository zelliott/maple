Many clinical observations have shown that immediate loading is indicated when the stabilization of the zzso is optimal and when the estimated loads are not excessively zzso Nonetheless, more experimental studies are needed to consider the immediate loading protocol as a safe zzso Mechanical analysis using the finite element zzso method analysis has been employed by many authors to understand the zzso behavior around dental zzso 

This study was to evaluate the effect of the diameter and length on the stress and strain distribution of the zzso bone around implants under immediate zzso 

By an ad hoc automatic mesh zzso high-quality zzso models of complete range zzso was constructed from computer zzso with three zzso zzso Institute, zzso zzso implants of various sizes embedded in the anterior zzso The implant diameter ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and length ranged from 6 to 14 zzso resulting in seven zzso The zzso interface was simulated by zzso zzso contact zzso For each design, vertical and zzso zzso of 150 N were applied, respectively, to each zzso and stresses and strains in the surrounding cortical bone were zzso 

The zzso analysis provided results that the zzso loading would induce significantly higher zzso stresses and strains than the vertical zzso while the intergroup stress difference significant levels was evaluated using zzso method and the level of significance zzso that was accepted for zzso Under both zzso the zzso values were recorded in the zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso implant zzso whose mean and peak values were both higher than that of others with significant statistical zzso The second zzso one is zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso and the minimal stresses were recorded in zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso whose strains were also near to zzso 

zzso the diameter and length of the implant decreased the stress and strain on the zzso zzso and the stress and strain values notably increased under zzso loading as compared with vertical zzso but diameter had a more significant effect than length to relieve the zzso stress and strain zzso
