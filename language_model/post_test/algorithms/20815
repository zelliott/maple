Cellular metabolism is one of the most investigated system of biological zzso While the zzso nature of individual reactions and pathways in the network is quite well understood there is still a lack of comprehension regarding the global functional behavior of the zzso In the last few years zzso analysis zzso has been the most successful and widely used technique for studying metabolism at system zzso This method strongly relies on the hypothesis that the zzso zzso an objective zzso However only under very specific biological conditions zzso zzso of biomass for zzso coli in reach zzso zzso the cell seems to obey such zzso zzso A more refined analysis not assuming zzso remains an elusive task for large zzso systems due to zzso zzso 

In this work we propose a novel zzso strategy that provides an efficient characterization of the whole set of stable zzso compatible with the zzso zzso Using a technique derived from the fields of statistical physics and information theory we designed a zzso zzso to estimate the size of the zzso space containing all possible zzso flux zzso of zzso zzso The algorithm, based on the well known zzso zzso can be used to approximately zzso the volume of a non zzso convex zzso in high zzso We first compare the accuracy of the predictions with an exact zzso on small random zzso zzso We also verify that the predictions of the zzso match closely those of zzso Carlo based methods in the case of the Red Blood Cell zzso zzso Then we test the effect of gene zzso on the size of the solution space in the case of zzso coli central zzso Finally we analyze the statistical properties of the average zzso of the reactions in the zzso coli zzso zzso 

We propose a novel efficient distributed zzso strategy to estimate the size and shape of the zzso space of a non zzso convex zzso in high zzso The method is shown to zzso zzso and zzso compatible results with the ones of standard zzso (where this comparison is zzso being still efficient on the analysis of large biological systems, where exact deterministic methods experience an explosion in zzso zzso The zzso we propose can be considered as an alternative to zzso Carlo sampling zzso
