The need for the zzso alignment of gait cycle data is well zzso however, there is little consensus concerning which alignment method to zzso In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of some methods commonly applied to temporally align gait cycle data zzso to percent gait cycle, dynamic time zzso zzso dynamic time zzso and zzso alignment zzso In addition, we zzso evaluate these different zzso abilities to produce successful zzso alignment when mapping a test gait cycle trajectory to a target zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso alignment techniques outperform other commonly used alignment methods zzso to percent gait cycle, dynamic time zzso and zzso dynamic time zzso in typical zzso and clinical alignment zzso Lastly, we present an example of how these zzso alignment techniques make it possible to separately examine intensity and zzso differences between gait cycle data throughout the entire gait cycle, which can provide greater insight into the complexities of movement zzso
