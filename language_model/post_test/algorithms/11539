The zzso of zzso release after acute zzso zzso were zzso Various zzso for calculation of zzso size, based on zzso determination of zzso and cumulative zzso release into the circulation were zzso The cumulative zzso release and zzso serum zzso concentration were compared with various measures of zzso size: cumulative release of zzso zzso zzso changes, and left zzso ejection zzso After acute zzso zzso time to peak for zzso in serum was correlated with time to peak for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, the zzso concentration peaked zzso h earlier than zzso zzso zzso The rate of elimination of zzso showed a large variation zzso zzso and was not correlated with the elimination rate of zzso zzso The elimination rate of zzso after acute zzso zzso was shown to depend on the patient's age and zzso zzso The elimination constant of zzso is preferably estimated on an individual basis in large and complicated zzso zzso zzso release correlated with zzso based on the cumulative release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent with the residual left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso and the sum of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values in serum correlated moderately with the calculated zzso size zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso changes zzso zzso zzso In combination with fast zzso methods for zzso determination, zzso peak height offers the advantage of providing reliable results within 12 h after onset of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
