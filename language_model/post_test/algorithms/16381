zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso is a minimally invasive optical measure of relative changes in blood flow, providing zzso high resolution, two-dimensional maps of vascular zzso Standard zzso imaging uses a zzso geometry that limits the measurement to a thin surface layer of zzso The objective of this study was to test a new zzso instrument geometry with the laser source opposed to the image capture plane zzso zzso zzso light then travels the entire tissue thickness zzso sampling much deeper regions of interest than conventional optical imaging zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso modes were used to measure finger joint blood flow during a timed zzso zzso of the zzso artery in volunteer zzso 

There was greatly increased visibility of vessels underlying the skin in the zzso mode zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to still work in the zzso mode, despite zzso due to finite laser zzso length and the light passing through a tissue thickness of zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to measure blood flow deep zzso into zzso This could be useful for zzso zzso of finger joint zzso blood flow in diagnosing and treating peripheral vascular disorders, such as zzso zzso
