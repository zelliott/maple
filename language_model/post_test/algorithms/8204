A comprehensive method of output factor and dose distribution calculation for electron beams has been zzso It allows one to calculate the output factors and zzso zzso in water of arbitrary shaped electron fields with excellent accuracy even for the cases of zzso small, zzso beams, and extended source to surface distances zzso The method requires two sets of zzso zzso dose distribution per monitor unit for circular cutouts and depth dose zzso per monitor unit for circular blocks zzso both for two zzso one reference of 100 zzso and second extended zzso The method has been extensively tested using a combination of different irregular cutouts and various zzso for the 6 and 9 zzso electron zzso The calculated values agreed with the measured data well within zzso for output factors and below 1 for gamma zzso zzso for zzso zzso The computer program has been developed to facilitate the method for practical zzso The method has been used for almost 8 years considerably cutting workload in the zzso
