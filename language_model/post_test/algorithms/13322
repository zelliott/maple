The colossal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso close to zzso were investigated by using soft zzso magnetic circular zzso zzso and zzso Very good agreement between the values for the average zzso magnetic moments determined with these two methods was achieved by correcting the zzso spin sum rule results by means of charge transfer zzso calculations, which also suggest a charge transfer of zzso for zzso and approximately equal to zzso for zzso The magnetic moment was found to be localized at the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 80 K and for zzso zzso zzso in the temperature range from 80 to 300 zzso We discuss our findings in the light of previously published data, confirming the zzso of our zzso
