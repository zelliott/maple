We have calculated the maximum useful bit density that may be achieved by the zzso of bad bit exclusion and advanced zzso error correcting codes in prospective crossbar zzso zzso as a function of defective memory cell zzso While our calculations are based on a particular zzso memory zzso with naturally segmented zzso and an zzso zzso zzso for realistic parameters our results are also zzso to zzso crossbar memories with peripheral zzso The results indicate that the crossbar memories with a zzso pitch ratio close to 1/3 (which is typical for the zzso initial stage of the zzso zzso may overcome purely semiconductor memories in useful bit density if the fraction of zzso defects zzso is below approximately zzso even under rather tough, 30 zzso upper bound on the total access zzso Moreover, as the technology zzso and the pitch ratio approaches an order of zzso the crossbar memories may be far superior to the densest semiconductor memories by zzso zzso a 1 zzso density even for a plausible zzso fraction of zzso These highly encouraging results are much better than those reported in literature earlier, including our own early work, mostly due to more advanced error correcting zzso
