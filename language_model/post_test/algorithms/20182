The registration of a pair of point sets as well as the zzso of their zzso zzso is a challenging and important task in computer zzso In this paper, we present a method to estimate the zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso between a pair of point zzso Many of the registration problems are zzso solved by zzso the correspondence, locally zzso certain cost zzso over the rigid or similarity or zzso transformation group, then zzso the correspondence again, and so zzso This type of approach, however, is well-known to be susceptible to zzso local zzso In this paper, we first adopt the perspective of treating the registration as a zzso zzso zzso problem and solve it accordingly via a zzso zzso Second, within such a zzso the zzso registration is performed to correct the zzso deformation of the zzso In doing so, we provide a solution less susceptible to local zzso We provide the experimental results, which include challenging medical data sets where the two point sets differ by 180 zzso rotation as well as local zzso to highlight the zzso capability of robustly finding the more globally optimal solution for the registration zzso
