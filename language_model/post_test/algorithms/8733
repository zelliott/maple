zzso variations in drug responses among patients are known to cause serious problems in zzso zzso association study zzso is powerful for examining zzso zzso zzso and their relationships with drug response zzso However, no significant zzso has been identified using zzso due to multiple testing zzso zzso we propose a combination method consisting of zzso algorithm, two stages of zzso and zzso test for identifying zzso in the present zzso We applied this method to a zzso zzso study for which zzso zzso had been zzso using zzso zzso zzso for 119 gastric cancer patients treated with zzso We identified zzso in zzso growth factor zzso zzso is as a candidate zzso related to zzso zzso The p value for the zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso exact test, and the p value was zzso for the zzso test (multiple testing problems are zzso Additionally, zzso was clearly superior to clinical parameters and showed a sensitivity value of zzso and specificity value of zzso in the evaluation by using multiple zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that combination chemotherapy of zzso and zzso agents is effective for gastric cancer patients highly expressing zzso These results suggest that zzso is a potential zzso factor for selecting zzso such as zzso alone or combination zzso
