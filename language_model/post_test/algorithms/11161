zzso acceleration maneuvers encountered in modern agile fighter aircraft can wreak havoc on human zzso thereby significantly influencing cognitive task zzso As oxygen content declines under acceleration stress, the activity of high order cortical tissue reduces to ensure sufficient zzso resources are available for critical zzso zzso zzso zzso cognitive abilities zzso on these affected areas suffer significant performance zzso The goal was to develop and validate a model capable of predicting human cognitive performance under acceleration zzso 

Development began with creation of a zzso control cardiovascular model that produced predictions of several zzso zzso including zzso blood pressure and regional cerebral oxygen zzso zzso An zzso was derived to relate changes in zzso within specific brain structures to performance on cognitive tasks that require engagement of different brain zzso Data from the zzso zzso experiment were then used to validate the model predicting cognitive performance as a function of zzso zzso 

The following are value zzso zzso showed high agreement between the measured and predicted values for the zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso zzso zzso mean percent zzso zzso and cognitive performance models zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso zzso zzso mean percent zzso zzso precision timing zzso zzso zzso linear zzso zzso zzso mean percent zzso zzso 

The evidence suggests that the model is capable of accurately predicting cognitive performance of simplistic tasks under high acceleration zzso
