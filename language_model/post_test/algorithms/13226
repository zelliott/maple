We use optical zzso to capture coherent surface acoustic waves for zzso zzso An inverse method is employed to convert zzso data into an elastic depth zzso Using this method, we image elastic properties over a 55 zzso range with zzso zzso zzso For relevance to breast cancer zzso we employ a tissue phantom with a zzso zzso zzso zzso is also shown to be zzso in ex zzso zzso revealing the subsurface position of a zzso Because digital zzso can assess waves over a wide surface area, this constitutes a flexible new platform for large volume and zzso zzso
