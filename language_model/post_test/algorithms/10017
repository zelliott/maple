The complex zzso equation models pattern formation arising from an zzso instability with a finite wave number at onset and finds applications in zzso optical zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that with real zzso this equation exhibits two classes of localized zzso localized in zzso only or localized in both zzso and zzso The latter are associated with zzso states in which the real and imaginary parts of the order zzso zzso periodically but with a constant phase difference between zzso The localized states take the form of defects connecting zzso states with equal and opposite phase lag, and can be stable over a wide range of zzso The formation of these defects leads to zzso of states with initially zzso uniform zzso Depending on parameters these zzso may either zzso indefinitely, as described by a zzso zzso or the zzso zzso leading to a frozen zzso zzso
