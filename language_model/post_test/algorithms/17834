A simple, sensitive and zzso zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso method for the direct determination of zzso zzso based on the analysis of zzso content, in zzso media was zzso The sample preparation consisted of addition of zzso as the internal standard, and dilution with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso at zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was linear in the concentration range of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The method was precise and accurate with lower limits of zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso accuracy was zzso for both zzso and the zzso of variation zzso was less than zzso The method has successfully been used for dissolution studies of T4 zzso and holds immense promise as a simple, precise and sensitive zzso technique for T4 concentration determination in in zzso zzso
