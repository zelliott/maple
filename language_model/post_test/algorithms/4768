zzso determination of zzso constant zzso for zzso zzso sources emitting low-energy photons zzso 50 zzso has remained a challenge in radiation zzso because of the lack of a suitable absolute dosimeter for accurate measurement of the dose rates near these zzso Indeed, a consensus value of zzso taken as the zzso mean of the zzso zzso determined by different research groups and zzso techniques has to be used at present for each source model in order to minimize the uncertainties associated with individual zzso of zzso Because the zzso properties of a source are fundamentally determined by the characteristics of the photons zzso by the source, a new technique based on zzso zzso was developed in this work for the determination of zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique zzso a high-resolution zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso characteristics zzso by the low-energy sources and determine their zzso zzso based on the measured zzso zzso and known zzso properties of zzso photons in zzso This technique eliminates many of the difficulties arising from detector size, the energy dependence of detector sensitivity, and the use of zzso solid zzso in absolute dose rate zzso It also zzso the uncertainties that might be associated with the source modeling in zzso Carlo simulation zzso It was shown that the estimated overall uncertainty of the zzso zzso technique was less than zzso which is significantly smaller than the reported zzso uncertainty associated with the current zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso technique was found to be stable and quick in zzso determination after initial setup and zzso A zzso constant can be determined in less than two hours for each zzso These features make it ideal to determine the zzso constant of each source model from a larger and more representative sample of actual sources and to use it as a quality assurance resource for periodic monitoring of the constancy of zzso for zzso sources used in patient zzso
