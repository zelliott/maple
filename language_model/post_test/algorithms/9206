It is recommended that duplicate zzso are excluded when reporting resistance zzso The rationale for this is that failing to do so will yield falsely high resistance zzso We zzso a 14 year consecutive database of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso using various zzso zzso to determine the importance of excluding zzso and principal differences between the zzso 

zzso testing was performed according to the Swedish zzso Group for Antibiotics zzso zzso were excluded on the basis of species, individual and time zzso zzso of 7, 14, 30, 45, 90, 180, zzso and 365 zzso from the first zzso 

Although zzso of the zzso were excluded using a 365 day exclusion algorithm, the effects on resistance rates of excluding zzso were zzso zzso of zzso resistance in zzso zzso decreased when zzso were zzso Using zzso days zzso resistance in zzso coli decreased or was not affected, whereas higher resistance rates were obtained when exclusion was based on a 365 day zzso zzso resistance was a clear exception to this zzso 

Although the effect of exclusion of zzso was minor, we suggest that exclusion zzso should match the study zzso The data presented on zzso coli, from urinary tract infections, and zzso zzso from skin and soft tissue infections, suggest that zzso coli infection, zzso days after the first culture, is mainly caused by new zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso continue to be zzso with the same zzso
