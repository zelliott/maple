The total mass zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds are measured at different zzso energies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso source with zzso target, radioactive zzso The zzso intensity is analyzed using a high resolution zzso detector system coupled to zzso under good geometrical zzso The obtained values of mass zzso zzso values are compared with theoretical zzso This study suggests that measured mass zzso zzso values at and near zzso edges differ from the theoretical value by about zzso
