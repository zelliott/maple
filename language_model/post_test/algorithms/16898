To develop a new pulse sequence called zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Dixon for dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The method combines zzso Dixon to generate separated water and fat images with a zzso zzso scheme developed for zzso zzso The performance of zzso Dixon was compared with a volume zzso zzso examination zzso sequence paired with zzso selective zzso inversion Recovery zzso and quick zzso zzso zzso techniques at zzso using quantitative zzso of zzso accuracy and zzso ratio zzso efficiency, as well as qualitative breast image zzso 

The water fraction of a uniform phantom was calculated from the following zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso while the reference value is zzso measured by zzso For zzso with contrast zzso concentration ranging from zzso zzso zzso Dixon also provides consistently higher zzso efficiency zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Breast images acquired with zzso Dixon at zzso show more robust and uniform fat suppression and superior overall image quality compared with zzso 

The results from phantom and volunteer evaluation suggest that zzso Dixon zzso conventional methods in almost every aspect and it is a promising method for zzso and zzso zzso zzso especially at higher field strength where fat suppression is zzso
