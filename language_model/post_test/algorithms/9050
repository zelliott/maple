To investigate the feasibility of combining zzso with zzso sampling approaches for simultaneous abdominal zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were performed in 9 healthy volunteers and zzso using the zzso and the conventional zzso zzso zzso 

Images acquired with the zzso sequence effectively zzso the respiratory motion artifacts, which were clearly evident in the images acquired using the conventional zzso zzso There was no significant difference between zzso and reference zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso based zzso methods significantly overestimated zzso values compared to zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence provided high quality images and accurate abdominal zzso and zzso maps while avoiding the motion artifacts common to the conventional zzso zzso zzso
