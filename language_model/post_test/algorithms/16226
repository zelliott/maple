zzso models, such as hidden zzso models or zzso zzso zzso zzso can fail to return the correct, maximum likelihood solution in the case of semantic zzso This problem arises when the zzso implementing the model zzso the same solution in different zzso It is a difficult problem in the sense that proving semantic zzso has been shown to be zzso zzso while zzso for it (by coalescing scores of equivalent zzso has been shown to be zzso For zzso zzso zzso modeling zzso secondary structure, it has been shown that the distortion of results can be quite zzso Much less is known about the case when zzso zzso zzso model the matching of a query sequence to an implicit consensus structure for an zzso zzso We find that three different, meaningful zzso can be associated with the matching of a query against the zzso zzso an zzso and a trace zzso zzso models correctly implement the alignment zzso and are ambiguous with respect to the other two zzso which are more zzso We show how zzso correct models can be generated for the trace zzso For approaches, where such a proof is not possible, we present an automated pipeline to check post zzso for ambiguity of the generated zzso We propose that both the structure and the trace zzso are zzso concepts for further study, possibly better suited to capture remotely related family zzso
