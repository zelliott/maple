A simple and robust method to suppress zzso zzso zzso in zzso experiments, in a single scan and with very high suppression ratio, is zzso It is an appreciable improvement on a previous technique by zzso and Keeler zzso zzso zzso zzso 42 zzso zzso The method, called a zzso zzso preserves zzso or zzso with high zzso zzso depend mostly on zzso relaxation but not zzso relaxation zzso At the same time, suppression of zzso can be essentially complete in a single zzso The time duration of the zzso cascade scales zzso to representative chemical shift differences between the coupled zzso and is typically a few tens of zzso The high efficiency of the zzso suppression and excellent retention of the desired zzso in a single scan without resort to phase cycling or difference zzso makes the zzso cascade a useful new pulse sequence building block for a whole range of zzso zzso In cases where unwanted residual zzso may have previously contributed to baseline zzso zzso in two-dimensional zzso zzso the zzso cascade can deliver a noteworthy improvement in spectral zzso
