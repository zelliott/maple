zzso optimal power flow solution is a zzso task for any power system zzso The inclusion of FACTS devices in the power system network adds to its zzso The dual objective of zzso with fuel cost zzso along with FACTS device location for zzso 30 bus is considered and solved using proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The conventional zzso zzso Algorithm zzso has the difficulty of optimal zzso zzso zzso in this paper, zzso is enhanced by including zzso zzso zzso for better zzso A zzso code for zzso is developed and the problem of optimal power flow with inclusion of FACTS devices is zzso After several run with different initial values, it is found that the inclusion of FACTS devices such as zzso and zzso in the network reduces the generation cost along with increased zzso stability zzso It is also observed that, the proposed zzso requires lesser zzso time compared to earlier proposed zzso
