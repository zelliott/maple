The use of zzso chemotherapy to treat adults with localized zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The objective of this systematic review was to update the 1997 zzso of zzso controlled trials zzso to reassess the efficacy of zzso chemotherapy with respect to recurrence and zzso 

A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify zzso of zzso chemotherapy for adult patients diagnosed with localized zzso zzso zzso Two zzso independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies using a modified version of the zzso Quality zzso The outcome measures were local, distant, and overall recurrence and survival calculated through the fixed effect or random effect zzso 

Four new eligible trials were identified allowing for a total of 18 trials representing 1953 patients to be included in the zzso The odds ratios zzso for local recurrence was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in favor of zzso For distant and overall recurrence the OR was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in favor of zzso In terms of survival, zzso alone had an OR of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso which as not statistically zzso However, the OR for zzso combined with zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in favor of zzso 

This updated zzso confirms the marginal efficacy of chemotherapy in localized zzso zzso zzso with respect to local zzso distant zzso overall zzso and overall zzso These benefits are further improved with the addition of zzso to zzso regimens, but must be weighed against associated zzso
