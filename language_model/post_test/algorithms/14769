This paper presents a sensor system for detecting defects in ship zzso zzso The sensor was developed to enable a robotic system to perform grit blasting operations on ship zzso To achieve this, the proposed sensor system captures images with the help of a camera and processes them in real time using a new zzso detection method based on zzso zzso What makes this method different is its efficiency in the automatic detection of defects from images recorded in variable lighting zzso The sensor system was tested under real conditions at a Spanish zzso with excellent zzso
