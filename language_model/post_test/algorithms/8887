The analysis of the zzso relationship in zzso molecules is not only essential for evolutionary studies but also for concrete applications such as zzso in next generation sequencing zzso zzso The prohibitive sizes of the zzso and zzso zzso combined with the volume of data to process, require efficient zzso to zzso zzso zzso In this article, we address the correction of zzso errors by calculating which zzso most increase the likelihood of a sequence to a given structure and zzso zzso We introduce zzso an efficient, linear time and space zzso zzso that zzso exact zzso probabilities under secondary structure and evolutionary constraints given as a multiple sequence alignment with a consensus zzso We develop a scoring scheme combining classical stacking zzso energies to novel zzso scores and apply our techniques to correct zzso errors in 5s and zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a promising zzso to complement existing tools in the zzso zzso zzso
