Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso quality assurance zzso passing rates may not predict clinically relevant patient dose zzso This work is to evaluate the effect of dose variations introduced in dynamic zzso zzso zzso modeling and delivery processes on clinically relevant metrics for zzso Ten head and neck zzso zzso plans were randomly selected for this zzso The conventional zzso zzso zzso was performed for each plan by 2 different zzso zzso with zzso angle of 0 zzso pointing zzso for all zzso fields and zzso with zzso at specific angles as designed in the zzso zzso For each patient, a batch analysis was done for each scenario and then imported to the zzso zzso Nuclear zzso for zzso A zzso zzso was generated and compared to the zzso from the treatment zzso Their differences represented errors introduced from the combination of the treatment planning system zzso dose calculation zzso and zzso The dose metrics from the two scenarios were compared with the corresponding calculated doses, and then their differences were zzso Although all zzso zzso zzso zzso had high zzso passing rates zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso criteria, there were significant errors in some of the calculated clinical dose zzso Such as, for all the plans zzso there were as much as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso errors found in max zzso dose, max zzso dose, mean zzso dose, zzso dose, oral cavity dose, and zzso dose, zzso The differences in errors for clinical metrics obtained between the two scenarios zzso zzso angle zzso true zzso zzso can also be zzso max zzso dose zzso zzso zzso max zzso dose zzso zzso zzso mean zzso dose zzso zzso zzso mean zzso dose zzso zzso zzso mean oral cavity dose zzso zzso zzso and zzso dose zzso zzso zzso However, in the two scenarios, a strong and clear correlation between the dose differences for each of the organ structures was zzso This study confirms that conventional zzso zzso performance metrics are not zzso of dose errors in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso has allowed us to predict the patient zzso zzso
