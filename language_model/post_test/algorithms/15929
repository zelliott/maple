The aim of this work was to measure the disintegrating force zzso with tablet zzso in order to evaluate the disintegration propensity of zzso zzso and dissolution were measured on zzso containing two poorly soluble drugs zzso sodium or zzso including different percentages of two zzso zzso or zzso Because of the experimental setup, the disintegrating force measured was the result of the force generated by zzso swelling and dissipated by tablet zzso The disintegrating force versus time zzso had shapes ranging from a skewed distribution curve to a zzso curve, depending on slow or rapid disintegration of zzso zzso Interestingly, the shape of the resulting zzso was very sensitive to the composition of the zzso When the zzso in the formula was increased, the zzso curve approached the zzso zzso The disintegration propensity of the tablet can be evaluated by the disintegrating force development during zzso The disintegration improvement of the formula can be zzso The disintegrating force curve allows for the clear identification of the optimal percentage of zzso to be zzso
