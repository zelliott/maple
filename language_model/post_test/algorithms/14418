zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques for zzso zzso Imaging zzso often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for zzso In the zzso literature, the zzso zzso coordinate system is often used as a standard zzso However, when studying pediatric zzso variation from the adult brain makes the zzso zzso for processing brain images of zzso zzso changes occurring during development render the use of zzso templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric zzso This paper presents the methods used to create zzso zzso zzso zzso templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of zzso years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and zzso The creation of anatomical zzso zzso and zzso zzso templates for specific zzso important zzso used data derived from the largest zzso representative zzso and zzso sample of the zzso population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established zzso and behavioral zzso Use of these zzso templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and zzso fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an zzso zzso zzso zzso study using 66 young zzso zzso participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the zzso zzso The public availability of these zzso will facilitate analysis of pediatric zzso data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric zzso
