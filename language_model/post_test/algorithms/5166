The cell's zzso providing the cell with structure and shape, consists of a complex array of structural zzso including zzso zzso and intermediate zzso Intermediate filaments play a crucial role in zzso and in providing mechanical stability to cells, in particular under large zzso By utilizing molecular zzso here we report a zzso analysis of zzso intermediate filament zzso the basic building blocks of intermediate zzso We describe a detailed analysis of the mechanical properties and associated deformation mechanisms, and find that mechanical stretch zzso a transition from zzso to zzso a phenomenon known as zzso zzso A comparison of the Young's zzso predicted from simulation with experimental zzso is zzso and good agreement is zzso We present an analysis of structural changes during zzso domain unfolding patterns, rate dependence of the zzso force and associated changes in the energy landscape, and conclude with a discussion of potential implications for zzso and the development of de zzso protein zzso
