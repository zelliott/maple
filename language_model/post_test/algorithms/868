To assess the safety and feasibility of a diagnostic zzso which reduces the need for lung zzso and avoids the use of zzso 

zzso patients with a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism were zzso investigated according to an zzso in which the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was excluded after a low clinical probability estimate and a normal zzso test result, a normal zzso zzso result, or a zzso probability zzso result in combination with normal serial zzso of the zzso In these patients zzso treatment was withheld and they were followed up for 3 months to record possible zzso zzso During the study period, zzso consecutive patients were seen, of whom zzso were excluded because of zzso zzso 

Of the zzso included patients, the diagnosis was zzso on the basis of a low clinical probability estimate and a normal zzso test result (95 zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso probability lung zzso followed by normal serial zzso (210 zzso Of these zzso patients, zzso zzso complications during follow-up occurred in six zzso rate zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic protocol was completed in zzso of all included zzso 

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be safely ruled out by a zzso zzso consisting of zzso testing combined with a clinical probability estimate, lung zzso or serial zzso of the legs (in case of zzso lung zzso
