In order to learn grammar from a finite amount of evidence, children must begin with zzso expectations of what is zzso They clearly are not born, however, with fully developed zzso Thus early language development involves refinement of the grammar hypothesis until a target grammar is zzso Here we address the question of how much evidence is required for this refinement process, by considering two standard learning zzso and a third zzso which is presumably as efficient as a child for some value of its memory zzso We zzso this zzso in the context of zzso zzso and zzso and show that it is possible to bound the amount of evidence required to almost certainly speak almost zzso
