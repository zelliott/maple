A method is presented that uses a zzso zzso feature image for wave front propagation between two or more user defined points to retrieve the central axis of zzso objects in digital zzso Its implicit scale selection mechanism makes the method more robust to overlap and to the presence of adjacent structures than conventional techniques that zzso a wave front over a zzso image representing the maximum of a range of zzso The method is shown to retain its potential to cope with severe zzso or imaging artifacts and objects with varying zzso in simulated and actual two-dimensional zzso zzso
