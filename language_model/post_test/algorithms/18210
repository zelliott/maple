A zzso detection zzso system for the identification of small pulmonary zzso in zzso and zzso CT scans has been zzso The automated procedure for selecting the zzso candidates is mainly based on a filter enhancing zzso zzso A neural approach based on the zzso of each single zzso of a zzso candidate has been purposely developed and implemented to reduce the amount of zzso findings per zzso The zzso system has been trained to be sensitive to small internal and zzso pulmonary zzso collected in a database of zzso and zzso CT zzso The system performance has been evaluated on a data set of 39 CT containing 75 internal and 27 zzso zzso The zzso curve obtained on this data set shows high values of sensitivity to lung zzso zzso zzso at an acceptable level of false positive findings per patient zzso zzso
