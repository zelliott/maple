The zzso Uniform Rate zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence was recently introduced as a new method of acquiring zzso solid-state zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we describe the application of the zzso pulse sequence to stationary samples zzso zzso or zzso zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order to examine its effectiveness for acquiring zzso zzso zzso zzso is compared to the zzso and Cross zzso zzso pulse sequences in select cases zzso and zzso respectively), and its usefulness in obtaining zzso zzso zzso in a zzso fashion is zzso In addition, a preliminary investigation of zzso generated using optimal control theory zzso for the purpose of zzso zzso is zzso zzso acquired using these zzso are compared with standard, zzso zzso of similar pulse zzso Both methods show much promise for acquiring high quality zzso patterns dominated by chemical shift zzso with minimal zzso and significantly reduced experimental zzso
