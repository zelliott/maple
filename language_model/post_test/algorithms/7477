This paper presents the results of an in zzso clinical study to accurately characterize prostate cancer using new features of ultrasound zzso time zzso 

The mean central frequency and zzso features of ultrasound zzso time series from seven patients are used along with an elaborate framework of ultrasound to zzso registration to identify and verify cancer in prostate tissue regions as small as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a zzso zzso strategy, an average zzso accuracy of zzso and the area under zzso curve of zzso are achieved using two proposed zzso time series zzso The results statistically significantly outperform those achieved by previously reported features in the zzso The proposed features show the clinical relevance of zzso time series for in zzso characterization of zzso
