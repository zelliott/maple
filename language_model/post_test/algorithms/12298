Recently there has been an outburst of interest in extending zzso maps of zzso data to more general data structures, such as sequences or zzso However, there is no general consensus as to how best to process sequences using zzso zzso and this topic remains an active focus of zzso zzso The zzso capabilities and internal representations of the models are not well zzso Here, we rigorously analyze a zzso of the zzso map zzso for processing sequential data, zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso system consisting of a set of fixed input zzso We argue that zzso zzso maps are likely to produce zzso organizations of receptive fields on the zzso zzso We derive bounds on zzso beta zzso the importance of importing past information when processing zzso under which zzso of the zzso maps is zzso Some zzso of zzso contain a dynamic module responsible for processing zzso contexts as an integral part of the zzso We show that zzso zzso maps of sequential data can be produced using a simple fixed zzso dynamic module zzso feeding a standard zzso model designed to process zzso zzso data of fixed zzso zzso zzso However, by allowing zzso feedback connections, one can obtain zzso maps with superior memory depth and topography zzso We elaborate on the importance of zzso organizations in zzso maps of sequential zzso
