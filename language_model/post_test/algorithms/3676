zzso diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease zzso the most common form of zzso remains zzso In order to assess whether fully automated zzso surface projection zzso presentation contributes to the diagnosis of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of zzso display with and without zzso analysis as well as the correlation between cerebral zzso in different cortical areas and the mini mental score zzso 

zzso patients referred because of cognitive impairment were included in the zzso According to the National Institute of Neurological and zzso Disorders and Stroke zzso and the Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association zzso criteria, 27 patients were diagnosed as having probable zzso while 45 were classified as zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the regional cerebral blood flow zzso acquired from zzso zzso 

Compared with the zzso section presentation alone, zzso presentation improved the area under the receiver operating curve zzso as well as zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Upon zzso of regional to zzso activity, multiple zzso analysis revealed a strong correlation between the zzso and zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to the zzso section display of zzso studies improves the zzso and the diagnostic performance in respect of zzso in patients with cognitive impairment and provides a valid tool for assessment of the severity of cortical zzso abnormalities in such zzso
