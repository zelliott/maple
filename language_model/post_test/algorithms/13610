zzso spectral zzso fits in a constrained zzso framework where the primal problem is expressed in terms of zzso feature maps and the dual problem is expressed in terms of kernel zzso An zzso problem is solved at the training stage and projections onto the zzso constitute the zzso zzso The zzso allows zzso extensions which are useful for model selection in a learning zzso In this work, we propose a methodology to reveal the zzso structure present on the zzso During the model selection stage, several zzso model parameters leading to good zzso can be zzso These results are then combined to display the underlying cluster zzso where the optimal depth of the tree is automatically zzso zzso with toy data and real-life problems show the benefits of the proposed zzso
