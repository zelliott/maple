Registration of ultrasound volumes is a key issue for the reconstruction of zzso ultrasound zzso In this paper, we propose an improved three-dimensional zzso scale zzso feature transform zzso zzso to globally register ultrasound volumes acquired from dedicated ultrasound probe, where local zzso are corrected by zzso zzso zzso Original zzso zzso is extended to zzso and improved by combining the zzso detector with zzso detector to extract complementary features and applying the diffusion distance zzso for robust feature zzso zzso experiments have been performed on both phantom and clinical data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and zzso of our zzso
