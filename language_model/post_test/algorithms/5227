In this study, the potential of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso for zzso delivery of zzso was zzso The size, zzso potential and zzso loading of the zzso zzso were investigated as a function of zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso content in the zzso The zzso were zzso by mean diameter and zzso potential ranging between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and increasing with zzso charge and zzso content in the zzso zzso zzso were up to zzso All zzso were zzso by prolonged release profiles with an initial burst zzso zzso followed by a slow release zzso zzso zzso of zzso was released in zzso The zzso of zzso was investigated using zzso cells as an in zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso suspension prepared with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso weight ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly improved compared to the zzso of zzso from the solution zzso and from all other zzso investigated zzso The results obtained by the cell viability studies zzso and zzso leakage zzso showed that C2 zzso suspension did not induce plasma membrane damage or decrease cell viability and could be safely applied to zzso cells in the concentration range tested zzso zzso
