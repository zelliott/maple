The aims of this study were to develop and validate an automated method to segment the zzso zzso on zzso abdominal zzso zzso images from kidney donors and to track zzso volume change after zzso 

A three-dimensional fully automated zzso zzso zzso method was developed and validated on 37 zzso phase zzso zzso data sets (27 patients, 10 of whom underwent two zzso zzso scans before and after zzso using zzso zzso Two expert interpreters manually segmented the zzso slice by zzso and linear zzso analysis and zzso plots were used to compare automated and manual zzso The zzso and zzso volume zzso were also calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed zzso zzso volume changes in 10 subjects were also zzso 

The linear zzso analysis results showed that the automated and manual zzso methods had strong zzso with zzso correlations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso between zzso variation, zzso variation, automated and user 1, and automated and user 2, respectively zzso zzso zzso for all zzso The zzso plots for zzso zzso also showed that the automated and manual methods had agreeable zzso The mean volume increase of the zzso for the 10 subjects was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by paired zzso zzso The overall zzso and zzso volume zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the proposed automated method, the time for zzso zzso was reduced from 20 minutes for manual zzso to 2 zzso 

The proposed method was accurate and efficient and can replace the current zzso and time-consuming manual zzso The computer measurement confirms the volume of zzso zzso increases after kidney zzso
