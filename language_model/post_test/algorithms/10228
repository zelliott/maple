A frustrating zzso based on an zzso zzso analysis within the zzso and zzso framework of direct methods zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso can on occasion identify large zzso of zzso that have a significantly lower mean phase error than the entire direct methods phase set of otherwise unsuccessful phasing trials for which the overall phase error occasionally dips below 75 or zzso This is the first time, other than for a handful of zzso phase indications in optimal situations, that a zzso phase estimates have been attained for large numbers of E values, prior to solving the zzso Although the a zzso zzso of zzso is a useful tool for identifying such zzso the a zzso phase refinement shifts indicated by its minimum often prevent a successful convergence to the zzso Similar efforts to encourage solution zzso in the realm of real space have also been zzso
