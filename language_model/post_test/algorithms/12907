zzso zzso can demonstrate accurate three-dimensional zzso imaging that recovers the zzso spatial distribution and concentration of the zzso zzso in biological zzso compared with zzso zzso However, the zzso approach is extremely difficult to implement due to the complexity in the reconstruction of zzso surface flux distribution from zzso two zzso zzso zzso on the subject zzso To handle this problem, a novel and effective method is proposed in this paper to determine the surface flux distribution from zzso zzso photographic images acquired by a set of zzso zzso The method is validated with comparison experiments involving both regular and irregular zzso Reconstruction of the inside zzso based on the reconstructed surface flux distribution further demonstrates the potential of the proposed method in its application in optical zzso
