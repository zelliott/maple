zzso control of reaching depends on internal models that associate states in which the limb experienced a force zzso with motor commands that can compensate for zzso zzso state can be sensed via both vision and zzso However, adaptation of reaching in novel dynamics results in zzso in the intrinsic coordinates of the zzso suggesting that the zzso states in which the limb was zzso dominate representation of limb zzso To test this hypothesis, we considered a task where position of the hand during a reach was correlated with patterns of force zzso This correlation could be sensed via vision, zzso or zzso As predicted, when the correlations could be sensed only via zzso learning was significantly better as compared to when the correlations could only be sensed through zzso We found that learning with visual correlations resulted in subjects who could verbally describe the patterns of zzso but this awareness was never observed in subjects who learned the task with only zzso zzso We manipulated the relative values of the visual and zzso parameters and found that the probability of becoming aware strongly depended on the correlations that subjects could visually zzso In all conditions, aware subjects demonstrated a small but significant advantage in their ability to adapt their motor zzso zzso correlations produced an internal model that strongly influenced reaching performance yet did not lead to zzso Visual correlations strongly increased the probability of becoming aware, yet had a much smaller but still significant effect on reaching zzso zzso practice resulted in acquisition of both implicit and explicit internal zzso
