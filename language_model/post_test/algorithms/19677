The difficulties of tuning parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso are well zzso In this paper, a measure is described that is capable of predicting the number of zzso training epochs for achieving optimal performance in an ensemble of zzso zzso The measure is zzso between pairs of patterns on the training data and is based on a spectral representation of a zzso zzso This representation characterizes the mapping from zzso decisions to target label and allows accuracy and diversity to be incorporated within a single zzso zzso on many benchmark problems, including the zzso Research Laboratory zzso face database demonstrate that the measure is well correlated with zzso test error, and may be used to predict the optimal number of training zzso While correlation with ensemble test error is not quite as strong, it is shown in this paper that the measure may be used to predict number of epochs for optimal ensemble zzso Although the technique is only zzso to zzso problems, it is extended here to zzso through output zzso For the zzso technique, a random code zzso is shown to give better performance than zzso code, even when the base zzso is zzso
