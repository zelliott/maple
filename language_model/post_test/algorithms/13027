Reliable control of the specific growth rate zzso in zzso zzso depends on the availability of accurate online zzso of the controlled zzso Due to difficulties in measuring zzso zzso is typically estimated using reference models relating zzso of zzso consumption or oxygen zzso rate to biomass zzso However, as culture conditions vary, these models are adapted zzso resulting in complex zzso that lack the necessary zzso for industrial zzso A simpler approach is presented where biomass is monitored using zzso zzso The zzso are subjected to online balances and zzso in real time against zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso biomass values serve to estimate the growth rate and a simple control scheme is implemented to maintain the desired value of zzso The methodology is developed with the zzso zzso zzso tested for zzso rejection and validated with two other zzso It is zzso to other cellular systems with minor zzso
