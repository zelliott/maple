A methodology for linking vital statistics linked zzso data and hospital discharge data is zzso The resulting data set combines information on a zzso zzso zzso prenatal care, and mortality aspects and connects it to detailed health outcome and resource zzso data, thus establishing an extensive database for zzso zzso In the absence of a universal zzso common to both databases, our linkage strategy relied on using a virtual zzso based on variables common to both data zzso In the case of multiple zzso of the same virtual zzso we used secondary health status information to zzso the likelihood of linking low birth weight or premature infants in one database to infants of similar health status in the other while zzso cases in which no secondary information was zzso zzso our method to the 1992 California birth zzso we could link zzso out of zzso eligible zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso were established on the basis of unique virtual zzso The link was internally consistent and no bias was evident when comparing variable zzso for all single live zzso in the vital statistics linked zzso file and linked zzso in the linked vital statistics linked zzso and hospital discharge zzso Multiple zzso techniques showed that the prediction error incurred by zzso was zzso Even though zzso zzso our method for linking the vital statistics linked zzso file and the hospital discharge file appeared to be zzso However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the resulting data set, in particular the fact that it cannot be used for tracking individual zzso The method provides a database suitable for a variety of zzso zzso zzso such as descriptive studies of disease distribution in zzso studies of the geographic distribution of disease, and studies of the relationship between risk and zzso
