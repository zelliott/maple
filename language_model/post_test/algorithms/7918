The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species are influenced by zzso variation in population zzso Unfortunately, we are usually limited in our ability to investigate the zzso dynamics of natural populations across large spatial scales and over long periods of zzso Here we combine zzso and statistical approaches to reconstruct zzso infection dynamics of an zzso zzso pathogen on the basis of zzso occurrence zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso its host plant, zzso zzso in a zzso setting where the presence of the pathogen has been recorded annually for 6 years in approximately 4,000 host populations across an area of 50 zzso zzso 70 zzso in zzso The dynamics are driven by strong zzso with a high extinction rate during winter and epidemic expansion in summer for local pathogen zzso We are able to identify with our model the regions in the study area where zzso has been most zzso These zzso sites represent zzso that initiate local zzso during the growing zzso There is striking zzso at the regional scale in both the zzso success of the pathogen and the encounter intensity between the host and the zzso Such zzso has profound implications for the zzso dynamics of the zzso
