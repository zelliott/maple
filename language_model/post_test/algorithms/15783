The desire to compare molecular zzso has zzso the design of numerous zzso Most of these tests are formulated in a zzso zzso and it is not known how they compare with zzso zzso I propose here two new zzso tests that either compare pairs of trees zzso hypothesis test, zzso or test each tree against an average of the trees included in the analysis zzso significance test, zzso 

The algorithm, based on a standard zzso zzso zzso nuisance parameters out and estimates the probability of the data under each zzso These quantities are used to estimate zzso factors for composite zzso composite zzso Based on two data sets, the zzso and zzso are shown to construct similar confidence sets to the zzso and the zzso zzso test, zzso This suggests that the known difference among previous tests is mainly due to the zzso hypothesis zzso
