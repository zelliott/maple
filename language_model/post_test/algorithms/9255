The combination of genetic zzso and neural network approach zzso has been developed to improve the calculation accuracy of density functional zzso As a demonstration, this combined quantum mechanical calculation and zzso correction approach has been applied to evaluate the optical zzso energies of 150 organic zzso The neural network approach reduces the zzso zzso zzso of the calculated zzso energies of 150 organic molecules from zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and the newly developed zzso correction approach reduces the zzso zzso to zzso zzso
