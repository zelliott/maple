The zzso domain of zzso statistical analysis of zzso zzso studies with statistical zzso mapping zzso has been investigated by a limited number of theoretical and simulation zzso In this work, an experimental setup is described with an assessment of its zzso detection performance together with the influence of acquisition and processing zzso A zzso sandwich phantom was constructed using a printed high-resolution digital Hoffman phantom with a zzso zzso zzso of 8, 16, and 24 zzso diameter, with an intensity ranging from 5 to zzso were constructed in the right frontal cortex, anterior and zzso cingulate, and left zzso zzso zzso acquisitions were carried out using both zzso and parallel beam zzso The impact of zzso characteristics zzso intensity and zzso study size, physical degradation factors, and reconstruction technique were studied using zzso in a group comparison design with correction for multiple zzso For a 15 zzso 15 design, all zzso zzso of zzso intensity were detected for the zzso zzso zzso focus or study size, lower zzso resolution, absence of zzso and zzso correction resulted in an increase in minimally zzso zzso For a single study referred to 15 control studies, only zzso zzso zzso with a minimal intensity of zzso were detected in the optimal zzso This approach allows experimental zzso zzso of zzso group or zzso zzso zzso studies compared to normal data, as used in clinical zzso In principle, these findings can be extended to zzso zzso studies or PET zzso
