zzso analysis of zzso clinical treatment plans to investigate zzso possible, clinical consequences of the use of zzso versus zzso 

The zzso dose zzso of 80 treatment plans at four different zzso sites, produced using zzso algorithm, were zzso using AAA and the same number of monitor units provided by zzso and clinically delivered to each zzso the consequences of the difference on the zzso relations for normal tissue injury were studied by comparing different zzso zzso extracted from a review of published zzso In this study the AAA dose calculation is considered as benchmark zzso The paired Student zzso was used for statistical comparison of all results obtained from the use of the two zzso 

In the prostate plans, the AAA predicted lower zzso value zzso for the risk of late zzso bleeding for each of the seven combinations of zzso zzso the maximum mean decrease was zzso In the zzso treatments, each combination of parameters used for the risk of zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso involved lower zzso that varied from zzso zzso to zzso zzso while when the zzso zzso was used the zzso ranging was from zzso zzso to zzso zzso according the combination of parameters zzso the differences were statistically zzso Also zzso regarding the risk of radiation zzso in the lung treatments was found to be lower than zzso for each of the eight sets of zzso zzso the maximum mean decrease was zzso A mean increase of zzso was found when the zzso was calculated by the parameters evaluated from dose distribution calculated by a zzso zzso zzso A markedly different pattern was observed for the risk relating to the development of zzso following breast zzso the AAA predicted higher zzso zzso The mean zzso varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso while the mean zzso varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso depending on the chosen parameters zzso 

When the original zzso treatment plans were zzso using AAA with the same number of monitor units provided by zzso the zzso was lower than the zzso except for the breast zzso The zzso is strongly affected by the wide-ranging values of zzso zzso
