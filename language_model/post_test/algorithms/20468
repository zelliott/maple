We propose a method that incorporates the zzso characteristics of neural sources into zzso zzso source zzso The method is based on the zzso zzso zzso and it zzso a zzso zzso in which diagonal and zzso terms are the auto and zzso zzso of zzso zzso recordings, zzso The method averages this zzso zzso over the zzso region of zzso The locations of neural sources are then estimated by checking the zzso between the noise zzso of this averaged zzso and the sensor lead zzso zzso the method allows us to estimate the locations of neural sources from each zzso zzso A computer simulation was performed to test the zzso of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate its zzso
