zzso neural networks zzso are useful tools for learning zzso relationships in time series data with complex zzso zzso In this paper, we explore the ability of a simplified type of zzso one with limited modifications to the internal weights called an zzso network zzso to effectively and continuously decode monkey reaches during a standard zzso reach task using a cortical zzso interface zzso in a closed zzso We demonstrate that the zzso an zzso zzso termed a zzso decoder (from first order reduced and controlled error zzso learns the task quickly and significantly zzso the current state-of-the-art method, the zzso Kalman filter zzso using the measure of target acquire zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso decoder zzso to a more difficult task by successfully operating the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso decoder is also robust as measured by the success rate over extended zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso dynamics are more like zzso hand movements than those of the zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso in general, and the zzso decoder in particular, are powerful tools for zzso decoder zzso
