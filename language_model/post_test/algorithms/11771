We develop a new methodology to design synthetic genetic switch networks with multiple genes and time delays, by using monotone zzso zzso We show that the networks with only positive feedback zzso have no stable zzso except zzso whose stability is also independent of the time zzso Such systems have ideal properties for switch networks and can be designed with out consideration of time delays, because the systems can be reduced from functional spaces to zzso spaces due to the independence to time zzso Specifically, we first prove the basic properties of the genetic networks composed of only positive feedback zzso and then propose a procedure to design the zzso which drastically zzso analysis of the switches and makes theoretical analysis and designing zzso even for large scale zzso Finally, we demonstrate our theoretical results by designing a biologically plausible zzso genetic switch with zzso well investigated zzso zzso and zzso zzso
