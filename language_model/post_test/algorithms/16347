zzso Gene Transfer zzso is beneficial to a cell if the acquired gene zzso a useful function, but is zzso if the gene has no function, if it is incompatible with existing zzso or if it is a zzso replicating mobile zzso If the balance of these effects is beneficial on average, we would expect cells to evolve high rates of acceptance of zzso transferred zzso whereas if it is zzso cells should reduce the rate of zzso as far as zzso It has been proposed that the rate of zzso was very high in the early stages of zzso evolution, and hence there were no separate lineages of zzso Only when the zzso rate began to fall, would lineages begin to emerge with their own distinct sets of zzso Evolution would then become more zzso This phenomenon has been called the zzso zzso 

We study a model for zzso evolution that incorporates both beneficial and zzso effects of zzso We show that if rate of gene loss during zzso replication is high, as was probably the case in the earliest zzso before the time of the last universal common zzso then a high rate of zzso is zzso zzso leads to the rapid spread of new genes and allows the zzso of larger, zzso zzso than could be achieved by purely vertical zzso In contrast, if the gene loss rate is lower, as in modern zzso then zzso is, on average, zzso 

Modern cells should therefore evolve to reduce zzso if they can, although the prevalence of independently replicating mobile elements and viruses may mean that cells cannot avoid zzso in zzso In the model, natural selection leads to gradual improvement of the replication accuracy and gradual decrease in the optimal rate of zzso By zzso zzso based on gene content, we show that there are no separate lineages of organisms when the rate of zzso is high; however, as the rate of zzso zzso a zzso structure emerges with zzso zzso The model therefore passes through a zzso zzso
