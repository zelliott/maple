We report the intriguing dynamics of a zzso zzso interacting with a 16 A carbon zzso The zzso zzso a strong zzso response in the zzso wall that can be described through a zzso zzso zzso The polarization of the zzso was found to play a critical role in the zzso interaction, which exhibits a low access barrier of only zzso zzso and a deep, attractive well with a depth of about 30 zzso An zzso bound in the zzso is predicted to zzso at a frequency of about zzso zzso dragging the electrons of the zzso zzso Besides its appealing nature in zzso physics, such a zzso may serve as a room temperature zzso wave zzso
