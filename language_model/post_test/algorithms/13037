zzso strand melting of zzso during gel zzso typically results in an abrupt reduction of zzso Several DNA analysis technologies are based on this zzso Inspired by the de zzso theory for the zzso of zzso zzso in gels, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1984, 13, zzso proposed a mathematical expression to predict this reduced zzso The latter contains only two zzso the average number of zzso bases p (which can be obtained using a theory for DNA zzso and a constant zzso However, there is confusion in the literature regarding the physical interpretation of zzso and little is known about its dependence upon experimental zzso The purpose of this short communication is to derive an explicit equation for the zzso zzso from the de zzso theory of zzso Our derivation shines light on the meaning of zzso zzso the scope of the underlying zzso and makes predictions about the dependence of zzso upon the gel pore size and the persistence length of zzso
