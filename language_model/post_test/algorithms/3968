zzso controlled trials zzso emphasize the average or overall effect of a treatment zzso on the primary zzso Even though the zzso provides the best summary of treatment zzso it is of critical importance to know whether the treatment is similarly zzso in important, zzso zzso This is why the zzso in addition to the zzso also present the results of zzso analysis for zzso zzso Typically, these are marginal zzso analysis in the sense that treatment effects are estimated in mutually exclusive zzso defined by only one baseline characteristic at a time zzso men versus women, young versus zzso Forest plot is a popular zzso approach for displaying the results of zzso zzso These plots were originally used in zzso for displaying the treatment effects from independent zzso Treatment effect estimates of different marginal zzso are, however, not zzso zzso between the zzso variables should be addressed for proper interpretation of forest zzso especially in large effectiveness trials where one of the goals is to address concerns about the zzso of findings to various zzso Failure to account for the correlation between the zzso variables can result in misleading zzso interpretations of zzso zzso Here we present an approach called zzso a commonly used technique in zzso that allows for valid comparison of zzso effects depicted in a forest zzso We present simulations results and a zzso analysis from zzso zzso zzso trials of antibiotics for acute zzso zzso
