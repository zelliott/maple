The aim of this study was to evaluate a zzso diagnosis zzso zzso with automatic detection of pulmonary zzso at zzso spiral CT in a clinical setting for early detection of lung zzso zzso consecutive zzso examinations were reported by two zzso in zzso All examinations were reviewed using a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso for automatic detection of pulmonary zzso The zzso is designed to detect zzso with diameters of at least 5 zzso A total of 153 zzso were detected with at least one zzso zzso in consensus, zzso 85 zzso with diameter zzso 5 zzso 68 with diameter zzso or zzso 5 zzso The results of automatic zzso detection were compared to zzso detected with any zzso as gold zzso zzso diagnosis correctly identified 26 of 59 zzso zzso with diameters zzso or zzso 5 zzso detected by visual assessment by the zzso of these, zzso detected zzso (24 of zzso zzso without zzso zzso In addition, 12 zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso were detected which were not mentioned in the zzso report but represented real zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso was zzso zzso of zzso for zzso and 38% zzso of zzso for zzso There were zzso zzso results of zzso per CT zzso zzso diagnosis improves detection of pulmonary zzso at spiral CT and is a valuable second opinion in a clinical setting for lung cancer screening despite of its still limited zzso
