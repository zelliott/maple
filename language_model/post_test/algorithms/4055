zzso of a medical image based on the modeling and zzso of the tissue intensity probability density functions via a zzso mixture model has recently received great zzso However, the zzso distribution is zzso and symmetrical around its zzso This study presents a new bounded zzso mixture model for analyzing both zzso and zzso zzso The advantage of the proposed model is that it has the flexibility to fit different shapes of observed data such as zzso zzso and bounded support zzso Another advantage is that each component of the proposed model has the ability to model the observed data with different bounded support regions, which is suitable for application on image zzso Our method is intuitively appealing, simple, and easy to zzso We also propose a new method to estimate the model parameters in order to minimize the higher bound on the data negative zzso zzso zzso experiments are presented where the proposed model is tested in various images from simulated to real 3- D medical zzso
