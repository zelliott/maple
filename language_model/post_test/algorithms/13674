This study was designed to characterize breast cancer resistance protein zzso knockout zzso rats and assess the effect of zzso cassette zzso G member 2 zzso deletion on the zzso and zzso properties of probe zzso zzso of the target gene in the zzso rats was confirmed, whereas gene expression was unaffected for most of the other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and compound A zzso accounted for zzso 48, and zzso of the dose in the zzso rats, respectively, whereas it was decreased by 70 to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a significant elimination pathway, was unaffected in the zzso rats, whereas zzso clearance of zzso a minor elimination pathway, was reduced by zzso zzso zzso of compound A was zzso zzso clearance in the zzso rats decreased 22, 43 zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and compound A administered at 1 zzso and zzso for compound A administered at 5 zzso zzso zzso of zzso a compound with high zzso zzso and good zzso was not limited by zzso In contrast, the absence of zzso led to a zzso and zzso increase in oral exposure of zzso and compound A, zzso These data show that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso of these probe zzso and has differential effects on systemic clearance and oral zzso in rats depending on clearance mechanisms and compound zzso The zzso rat is a useful model for understanding the role of zzso in elimination and oral zzso
