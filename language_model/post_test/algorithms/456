The Atmospheric zzso zzso program zzso zzso was upgraded in 2004 with a new data system that provides simultaneous zzso of both the zzso analog output zzso and zzso zzso We describe recent improvements to the zzso used to merge these two signals into a single signal with improved dynamic zzso The effect of modifications to the zzso are evaluated by comparing profiles of water vapor mixing ratio from the zzso with zzso zzso over a six month zzso The modifications that were implemented resulted in a reduction of the mean bias in the daytime water vapor mixing ratio from a zzso dry bias to well within zzso This improvement was obtained by ignoring the zzso variation of the glue zzso and using only the nighttime average glue zzso throughout the entire zzso zzso
