zzso bacteria interacting with zzso host express zzso on their zzso These zzso aid in bacterial attachment to the host cell receptors during zzso A few zzso such as zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis have been identified using specific experimental interaction models based on the biological knowledge of the zzso In the present work, we carried out zzso screening for zzso of zzso zzso We used an integrated zzso approach using zzso for predicting zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso to human zzso These steps are among the first of reverse zzso Multiple claims and attacks from different zzso were processed through zzso zzso Additional zzso criteria included selection for proteins with low molecular weights and absence of literature zzso We examined binding potential of the selected proteins using an image based zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso binds to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso and zzso We report zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as novel zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso Our results expand the number of known zzso of zzso tuberculosis and suggest their regulated expression in different zzso
