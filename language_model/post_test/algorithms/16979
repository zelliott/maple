In this paper we have evaluated the gene expression programming zzso methodology for modeling the effect of different variables zzso and zzso and their interactions on the properties of direct zzso zzso 

The effect of four variables was zzso variety of zzso type and percentage of drug and maximum zzso force, on the mechanical and drug release properties of direct zzso zzso The generated database zzso zzso was used for mathematical and zzso zzso 

zzso has been shown to have a high accuracy in prediction for four out five zzso studied including zzso which had no replicate zzso Compared to the traditional statistical treatment zzso is less time consuming and gives equations which are extremely helpful in understanding the interactions of the different variables and for establishing the design space in the development of direct zzso zzso 

zzso allows similar conclusions than traditional statistical zzso The zzso of this methodology in establishing the design space has been zzso The knowledge derived from zzso can easily be increased by including additional information or new zzso such as additional drugs or combinations of zzso in the data zzso
