zzso the zzso of complex diseases is aided by precise identification of the genes zzso Many zzso methods have been developed to prioritize candidate disease zzso but coverage of functional zzso may be a limiting factor for most of these zzso Here, we introduce a global candidate gene zzso approach that considers information about network properties in the human protein interaction network and risk transformative contents from known disease zzso Global risk transformative scores were then used to prioritize candidate zzso This method was introduced to prioritize candidate genes for prostate zzso The effectiveness of our global risk transformative zzso for zzso candidate genes was evaluated according to validation zzso Compared with zzso and random zzso methods, our method outperformed the two other candidate gene zzso zzso The zzso of our method was assessed by testing it on prostate cancer and other types of zzso The performance was evaluated using standard zzso zzso
