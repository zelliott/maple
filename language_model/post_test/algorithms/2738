To validate the ability of zzso zzso CT zzso to enable measurement of volume of visible pulmonary vessels on zzso 

In zzso zzso CT zzso was validated in seven zzso that consisted of silicone tubes embedded in a foam zzso With the true volume value as reference standard, the accuracy of CT measurement at various lower thresholds of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The volume zzso obtained when filled with varied concentration of zzso contrast media zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso In zzso validation was performed in zzso patients (9 men, 7 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso and zzso agreement and zzso for pulmonary zzso volume measurement were evaluated with zzso zzso 

In zzso the mean value measured under lower threshold of zzso zzso zzso zzso were the closest to the true values and have no zzso difference zzso There were no zzso differences among the phantom measurement values with different filled concentration zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso of volume zzso was good, with a correlation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso agreement was excellent with a correlation zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso 

The zzso zzso quantitative CT zzso enables accurate and zzso measurement of pulmonary vessels zzso
