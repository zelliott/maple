We unfold the zzso simultaneous occurrence of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso for a general zzso continuous zzso We find that with sufficient zzso conditions, a locus of zzso zzso emanates zzso from a locus of zzso zzso The corresponding zzso solution zzso a zzso zzso along a curve emanating from the zzso point and zzso to the zzso locus zzso In the case that the map is one-dimensional local dynamics is completely zzso in particular, we give conditions that ensure zzso
