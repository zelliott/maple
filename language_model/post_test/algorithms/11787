Dynamic zzso has been used to improve the detection of tumors and to make differential zzso Most zzso zzso show early enhancement and early zzso of contrast media on dynamic zzso but the characterization of the tumor remains zzso zzso analysis of dynamic zzso can provide information about the zzso of contrast media in the tumor that may reflect the oxygen concentration of the zzso This information may be useful in the prediction of a zzso response to radiation zzso
