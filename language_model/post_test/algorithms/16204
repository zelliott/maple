Image reconstruction from its projections is a necessity in many applications such as medical zzso security, inspection, and zzso This paper extends the zzso zzso method in zzso to zzso The algorithm, called Pyramid zzso zzso is based upon the parallel reconstruction zzso in zzso It allows fast capturing of the scanned data, and in zzso the reconstructions are based upon the discrete X-ray transform zzso The zzso zzso are zzso to fit parallel projection zzso The underlying idea is to use the zzso in zzso by zzso the proposed zzso zzso to fit the zzso in zzso The complexity of the zzso is comparable with the 3-D zzso The results show excellent reconstruction qualities while being simple for practical zzso
