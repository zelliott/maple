In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric zzso of an acoustic sensor network that will maximize the zzso information available for underwater target zzso In the zzso adopted, a set of autonomous vehicles carries a network of acoustic units that measure the zzso and zzso angles between a target and each of the receivers on board the zzso It is assumed that the angle zzso are corrupted by white zzso noise, the zzso of which is zzso Using tools from zzso theory, the problem is converted into that of zzso by proper choice of the sensor positions, the trace of the inverse of the Fisher Information zzso (also called the zzso Bound zzso to determine the sensor zzso that yields the minimum possible zzso of any unbiased target zzso It is shown that the optimal zzso of the sensors depends explicitly on the intensity of the measurement noise, the constraints imposed on the sensor zzso the target depth and the zzso distribution that defines the prior uncertainty in the target zzso zzso examples illustrate the key results zzso
