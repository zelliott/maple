Visual tracking of multiple targets is a challenging problem, especially when efficiency is an zzso zzso if not properly handled, are a major source of zzso Solutions supporting zzso zzso reasoning have been proposed but are yet zzso for online zzso This paper presents a new solution which effectively manages the zzso between reliable modeling and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso filter is derived from a joint zzso zzso of the problem, and shown to be efficient while optimal in terms of compact belief zzso zzso efficiency is achieved by employing a zzso random field approximation to joint dynamics and an incremental zzso for zzso update with an appearance likelihood that zzso a zzso model of the zzso zzso A particle filter zzso is proposed which achieves accurate tracking during partial zzso while in cases of complete zzso tracking hypotheses are bound to estimated zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed zzso is efficient, zzso and able to resolve long-term zzso between targets with identical zzso
