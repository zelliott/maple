Identification of the genetic variation underlying complex traits is zzso The wealth of information publicly available about the biology of complex traits and the function of individual genes permits the development of zzso methods for the selection of candidate genes for these zzso 

We have developed a zzso system named zzso that ranks all zzso human genes as candidates for a complex trait by using zzso to zzso map natural language descriptions of the trait with a variety of zzso information zzso In a test of its effectiveness, zzso successfully selected 7 out of 18 zzso complex human trait zzso genes within the top zzso of ranked candidates zzso a subset that represents roughly zzso of genes in the human zzso and provides sufficient enrichment for an association study of several hundred human zzso This approach can be applied to any well-documented zzso or zzso trait in any zzso for which an zzso gene set zzso
