zzso cellular regulation of metabolism is a major challenge in systems zzso Thus far, the main assumption was that zzso levels are key regulators in zzso zzso However, regulation analysis recently showed that metabolism is rarely controlled via zzso levels only, but through zzso combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso regulation zzso action and zzso zzso zzso analyses relating changes in zzso zzso to changes in transcript or protein levels have revealed a remarkable lack of understanding of the regulation of these zzso We study zzso regulation via feasibility analysis zzso Inspired by the zzso approach of zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporates a model describing kinetic interactions between zzso We enlarge the portfolio of objectives for the cell by defining three main zzso relevant objectives for the zzso function, zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that the cell assumes one or a combination of these objectives and search for zzso levels necessary to achieve zzso We call the zzso of feasible zzso levels the feasible zzso zzso Once this space is constructed, we can study how different objectives may (if zzso be combined, or evaluate the conditions at which the cells are faced with a zzso among zzso We apply zzso to the experimental scenario of long-term carbon limited zzso zzso of zzso cells, studying how metabolism zzso zzso zzso employ a mixed strategy composed of increasing zzso levels for zzso zzso and zzso and decreasing levels of the remaining zzso This zzso renders the cells specialized in this zzso flux state to compete for the available zzso and get rid of zzso Overall, we show that zzso is a powerful tool for systems biologists to study regulation of zzso interpret experimental data and evaluate zzso
