We consider the processing of zzso signals that zzso carrier zzso in sensory zzso The tuning of sensory zzso to the carrier frequency results in a high sensitivity to the zzso zzso of the zzso Recent work has revealed how specialized zzso can extract the zzso zzso associated with the slow envelope of a zzso zzso and send it to higher brain along with the full zzso This paper first summarizes the experimental evidence for this processing in the context of zzso where the zzso signals arise in the context of social communication between the zzso It then examines the mechanism of this extraction by single zzso and neural zzso using zzso recordings and new modeling results contrasting envelope extraction and zzso zzso Low noise and zzso stimulation are necessary to obtain a firing pattern that shows high zzso with the envelope of the zzso Further, the output must be fed through a slow zzso zzso networks are then considered for their ability to zzso using additional noise, signals with power in the envelope zzso The zzso that does support envelope extraction beyond the primary receptors is available in many areas of the brain including zzso The mechanism of envelope extraction and its gating by noise and bias currents is thus accessible to zzso coding as well, as long as the input to the circuit is a zzso zzso Novel results are also presented on a more zzso model of the zzso population, showing that it can zzso a zzso zzso but not its zzso as observed zzso The model is modified from previous models by stimulus reducing contrast in order to make it sufficiently linear to agree with the experimental zzso
