To develop and critically evaluate an information theory method for identifying zzso and zzso interactions in count and rate zzso 

The zzso metric zzso interaction information zzso was critically assessed for utility in detecting interactions with count data and zzso count data in three simulation studies of increasing complexity and in zzso from animal models of depression and zzso The results were compared to zzso zzso The power and effect size dependence of the zzso for detecting interactions was also zzso 

The zzso was capable of effectively identifying the genetic and environmental zzso and their interactions in all three simulated zzso The results indicate that the zzso approach may produce more zzso results than zzso In a rat model of depression, we successfully identified a prominent gender effect as well as other published zzso Analysis of severity scores from an animal model of colitis identified markers from zzso 3, as well as unique zzso and zzso associations for the individual sections of the colon and zzso 

The results demonstrate the utility and versatility of our zzso method for zzso interaction analysis of count and rate data with zzso and zzso zzso
