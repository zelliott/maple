zzso zzso thin films have been characterized by zzso with energetic cluster zzso beams of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, zzso The aim of these studies is to acquire information about the molecular sputtering process of the zzso and zzso by measurement of secondary zzso mass zzso during zzso This system is important since uniform thin films of approximately 300 zzso thickness can be zzso prepared on a zzso zzso allowing detailed characterization of the resulting depth profile with different zzso The basic form of the molecular zzso intensity as a function of zzso dose is described by a simple zzso zzso The model includes parameters such as the molecular sputtering yield, the damage cross section of the zzso or the zzso and the thickness of a surface layer altered by the zzso The results show that favorable conditions for successful molecular depth profiling are achieved when the total sputtering yield is high and the altered layer thickness is zzso zzso molecular depth profiles are achieved with all of the cluster zzso although the degree of chemical damage zzso was slightly lower with zzso With zzso zzso the altered layer thickness of about 20 zzso and the damage cross section of about 5 zzso are physically consistent with predictions of molecular dynamics calculations available for similar chemical zzso In general, the model presented should provide guidance in zzso experimental parameters for maximizing the information content of molecular depth profiling experiments with complex molecular thin film zzso
