In this paper, we present a framework for detecting interest points in 3-D zzso and computing their corresponding zzso For that, we propose an intrinsic scale detection scheme per interest point and zzso it to derive two zzso local features for mesh zzso First, we present the zzso spin image local zzso that is a zzso zzso of the spin image zzso Second, we adapt the zzso feature transform feature to mesh data by representing the vicinity of each interest point as a depth map and zzso its dominant angle using the principal component analysis to achieve rotation zzso The proposed features were zzso shown to be robust to scale changes and partial mesh matching, and they were compared favorably with other local mesh features on the zzso and zzso zzso We applied the proposed local features to mesh retrieval using the zzso approach and achieved state-of-the-art retrieval zzso zzso we applied the proposed local features to register models to scanned depth scenes and achieved high registration zzso
