We have designed zzso zzso derivatives zzso with sugar zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso with appropriate zzso zzso using zzso to give zzso zzso 5 zzso 6 zzso 7 zzso and 10 zzso zzso of the zzso groups afforded the zzso having free zzso groups, 11 zzso 12 zzso 13 zzso and 14 zzso We evaluated their zzso activities by an in zzso zzso zzso All free zzso hybrids have lower enhancement ratio zzso values zzso and lower zzso partition zzso zzso values zzso than does 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso hybrids have similar zzso values zzso to 1 zzso and have improved zzso values zzso compared to the hybrids having free zzso zzso Among these, 5 zzso is the most active zzso zzso We found a good correlation zzso between the magnitude of zzso zzso and the zzso value of 5 zzso 6 zzso 7 zzso 10 zzso and 1 zzso suggesting that increasing the zzso is reflected in increased in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have succeeded in producing zzso hypoxic cell zzso that have an increased zzso activity that does not depend on increased zzso
