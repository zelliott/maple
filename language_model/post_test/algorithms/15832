In the zzso mapping and analysis package, zzso we provide a foundation for reverse zzso by organizing information about DNA fragments obtained from an zzso zzso into a physical zzso The user can store information about a particular segment of zzso This information can be both zzso such as any genes contained in a particular DNA fragment, or zzso such as zzso profiles or restriction digest patterns for comparison with other zzso The package can then be instructed to update the physical map or provide information on a DNA zzso within the map, such as its zzso The user interface is designed to minimize the learning curve associated with database zzso while eliminating the possibility of entering data outside the ranges of fields through zzso zzso zzso are currently accomplished by the use of dynamic zzso zzso query zzso which gives the user the ability to build queries based on any combination of the attributes contained within the database without requiring that all possible queries be permanently programmed within the query zzso In order to eliminate the need for knowledge of zzso an interface was designed to allow users to build queries by menu zzso Thus, zzso is a software package supporting a database for both the production and storage of a physical map as well as being the first step toward the production of a physical mapping zzso
