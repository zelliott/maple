Although water vapor is one of the most important and certainly the most variable minor constituent of the atmosphere, accurate zzso of zzso with high time resolution are difficult, particularly in the cold upper zzso zzso This work demonstrates that a zzso zzso zzso zzso water vapor detector is a viable alternative to current water vapor sensors for airborne zzso The PA system was compared with a high-quality frost point zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso in the pressure range of zzso zzso at frost point temperatures between 202 and 216 zzso These conditions were simulated in a large environmental zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso with the three instruments agreed within zzso zzso acid vapor interferes with the zzso zzso at low frost point temperatures but does not affect the other zzso The sensitivity of the PA system is already sufficient for zzso in the upper zzso and straightforward improvements can extend its useful range above the zzso zzso construction, extreme zzso small size, and potential for long-term automatic operation make the PA system potentially suitable for airborne zzso
