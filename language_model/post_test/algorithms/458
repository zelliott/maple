The selection of the most accurate protein model from a set of alternatives is a crucial step in protein structure prediction both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso functions have been developed which can either return a quality estimate for a single model or derive a score from the information contained in the ensemble of models for a given zzso Local structural features occurring more frequently in the ensemble have a greater probability of being zzso Within the context of the zzso experiment, these so called consensus methods have been shown to perform considerably better in selecting good candidate models, but tend to fail if the best models are far from the dominant structural zzso In this paper we show that model selection can be improved if both approaches are combined by zzso the models used during the calculation of the structural zzso 

Our recently published zzso composite scoring function has been improved by including an zzso interaction potential zzso The preliminary model ranking based on the new zzso score is used to select a subset of reliable models against which the structural consensus score is zzso This scoring function called zzso achieves a correlation zzso of predicted quality score and zzso of zzso averaged over the 98 zzso targets and perform significantly better in selecting good models from the ensemble of server models than any other groups participating in the quality zzso category of zzso Both scoring functions are also zzso on the zzso test set consisting of 20 target proteins each with 300 alternatives models generated by zzso zzso zzso all other tested scoring functions operating on individual models, while the consensus method zzso only works properly on decoy sets containing a certain fraction of zzso zzso We also present a local version of zzso for the zzso zzso of model quality zzso and compare it to a new local zzso zzso 

zzso model selection is obtained by using a composite scoring function operating on single models in order to enrich higher quality models which are subsequently used to calculate the structural zzso The performance of zzso methods such as zzso highly depends on the composition and quality of the model ensemble to be zzso zzso performance estimates for consensus methods based on large zzso zzso zzso might zzso their zzso in more realistic zzso situations with smaller sets of models based on individual zzso
