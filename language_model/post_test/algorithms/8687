In this paper, a new zzso for local zzso of biomedical images is zzso First, a relatively small region is selected for zzso on the basis of zzso measurement of local gray zzso This small region is then segmented using a zzso zzso based on zzso zzso While zzso a zzso the range of input signal is divided into a number of zzso All signal values within a segment are assigned a unique reconstruction zzso In zzso of gray level images, the problem is to zzso or code gray values of the zzso into two or more zzso An zzso threshold selection method for zzso thus becomes the design of an zzso optimal zzso This new approach is suitable for a number of biomedical applications where the objects of interest appear as small and localized in the zzso Some experimental results are also provided which illustrate the success of the new zzso
