We investigate the cycles in the zzso network of zzso zzso Unlike a similar network of zzso coli, it contains many zzso We characterize properties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the zzso 

Almost all cycles in the zzso network of zzso zzso are contained in a single strongly connected zzso which we call zzso zzso for zzso except for a single cycle of two zzso zzso The fact that zzso includes almost all cycles is well explained by the properties of a random graph with the same zzso and zzso of the zzso Among different zzso conditions, cell cycle has the most significant relationship with zzso as the set of 64 zzso interactions that are active in all zzso of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions of zzso (of which there are zzso if we remove the interactions that are active in all zzso of the cell cycle zzso of interactions to zzso zzso the zzso would have only three zzso and 5 edges, many fewer than zzso This zzso of the zzso network consists mostly of interactions that are active only in the stress response zzso We also characterize the role of zzso in the zzso of the zzso We show that zzso can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network and that in every zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal zzso 

Apart from those zzso conditions, the zzso network of zzso zzso is devoid of zzso It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have no cycles of their own are zzso zzso shift and DNA repair, while cell cycle and zzso are zzso We claim that in a certain sense zzso zzso stress response is zzso as zzso
