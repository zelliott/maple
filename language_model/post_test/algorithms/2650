This paper proposes a directional design method of zzso zzso zzso zzso filter zzso The proposed method is based on a lattice structure consisting of the zzso zzso zzso block and zzso support extension zzso Because of the zzso the bases are allowed to be directional with the critically fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compact support zzso First, a novel vanishing moment zzso condition is introduced as a suitable directional zzso where the moment is referred to as the trend zzso The condition forces zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Second, some theoretical properties of zzso are discussed for general zzso zzso systems, and then, the properties are applied to the lattice zzso In order to verify the significance, several design examples are zzso the zzso zzso properties are zzso confirmed, and the zzso capability is evaluated for images through zzso It is shown that our proposed zzso yield zzso preferable zzso
