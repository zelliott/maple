zzso transformation for diffusion spectrum imaging zzso is an important step for group analyses of zzso zzso In this study, we developed a transformation method for zzso zzso under the framework of large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso which is termed zzso The proposed method made use of the fact that a zzso zzso is zzso and generalized the original zzso zzso zzso to the zzso case with some modifications made for the zzso zzso In this manner, the conventional zzso problem that arises from transforming zzso zzso was avoided by making the zzso zzso capable of being freely zzso in the zzso The zzso treated the zzso task as a zzso problem under the zzso framework and sought optimal zzso fields from which the generated transformations were zzso and the transformation curve was a zzso The mathematical materials and zzso zzso are detailed in the paper, and experiments were performed to analyze the proposed method on real brain zzso zzso The results showed that the method was capable of registering different zzso zzso in both global structural shapes and local diffusion zzso In conclusion, the proposed method can facilitate group analyses of zzso zzso and the generation of a zzso zzso
