zzso and selection of zzso spiral wave due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated in a regular network of zzso zzso by changing the zzso and imposing spatial forcing currents on the zzso in the zzso The arm number of the zzso spiral wave is dependent on the distribution of spatial forcing currents and zzso diversity in the network, and the selection criterion for supporting zzso spiral waves is zzso A broken spiral segment is measured by a short zzso line connected by three adjacent points zzso zzso and a zzso wave can be developed from the spiral zzso zzso spiral wave is formed when a group of zzso waves rotate in the same direction in the zzso In the zzso studies, a group of controlled zzso are selected and spatial forcing currents are imposed on these zzso and our results show that zzso stable spiral wave zzso 3, zzso can be induced to occupy the network zzso It is also confirmed that low zzso is critical to induce zzso spiral waves while high zzso is important to zzso the zzso spiral wave outside so that distinct zzso spiral wave can occupy the network zzso Our results confirm that symmetry breaking of target wave in the media accounts for emergence of zzso spiral wave, which can be developed from a group of spiral waves with single arm under appropriate condition, thus the potential formation mechanism of zzso spiral wave in the media is zzso
