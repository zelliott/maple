The aim of this work was to compare the quantitative accuracy of zzso reconstructed cardiac zzso PET with that of filtered zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso acquisitions and to establish an optimal procedure for imaging zzso viability with zzso zzso 

Eight patients underwent dynamic cardiac zzso PET using an zzso zzso scan zzso enabling comparison of zzso and zzso acquisitions within the same patient and zzso A zzso transmission scan was followed by a zzso zzso dynamic zzso scan and then by a series of 10 alternating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Images were reconstructed with filtered zzso zzso or zzso zzso expectation zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso for zzso acquisitions, applying all usual zzso zzso of interest zzso were drawn in the zzso left zzso and ascending zzso with the last 2 being used to define zzso input functions zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to compare net zzso zzso in the zzso calculated from either zzso or zzso data, after reconstruction with zzso or zzso Either zzso or zzso sampling was used as the input zzso The same analysis was performed on zzso zzso 

A good correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between net zzso zzso values for a zzso zzso determined using each acquisition and reconstruction method and zzso input zzso A similar result was found for zzso zzso The ascending zzso was the best choice for zzso zzso 

Good correlation and no bias of net zzso zzso in relation to that based on zzso images, combined with less image noise, make zzso acquisition with zzso plus zzso zzso reconstruction the preferred choice for cardiac zzso PET zzso
