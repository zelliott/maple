We describe a framework in which a genetic zzso zzso and a zzso activated sludge zzso treatment plant design model zzso AS zzso are used to identify low cost activated sludge designs that meet specified zzso limits zzso for zzso zzso and zzso Once the user has chosen a particular process zzso zzso zzso or zzso this approach allows the zzso for each AS unit process to be zzso systematically and zzso The approach is demonstrated for a wastewater treatment plant design problem and the zzso performance is compared to that of a classical zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso for zzso problems such as AS design is demonstrated and their application for zzso design and alternative generation is zzso
