To determine the diagnostic accuracy of targeted electrical zzso imaging in characterizing breast zzso and to evaluate whether zzso size, depth and zzso affect the zzso 

A total of 137 women with 145 zzso (79 zzso and 66 zzso found by zzso or zzso were zzso enrolled in this zzso The patients were examined by means of clinical breast examination, zzso zzso and electrical zzso imaging with zzso zzso A level of suspicion zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso Imaging findings were correlated with zzso zzso and zzso diagnoses zzso Patients with benign zzso were followed up for a mean of 36 zzso 

zzso showed a high sensitivity zzso which did not differ significantly from that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The specificity of zzso zzso was significantly lower compared to zzso zzso zzso and US zzso zzso The additive use of zzso to zzso and US yielded no significant increase in sensitivity zzso but the decrease in specificity was significant zzso zzso zzso effectiveness of zzso zzso as measured by the area under the zzso curve, was significantly lower than for zzso zzso zzso and for US zzso zzso When using zzso in addition to zzso and US zzso a significant impairment was found zzso 

The role of targeted electrical zzso imaging as an adjunct to zzso and zzso in the diagnosis of breast zzso is not justified by the result of this zzso
