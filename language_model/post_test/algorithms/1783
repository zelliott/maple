In mass zzso protein zzso peptides that are shared across different protein sequences are often discarded as being zzso with respect to each of the parent zzso We investigate the use of shared peptides which are ubiquitous zzso of zzso in mass zzso zzso for accurate protein identification and zzso Different from existing approaches, we show how shared peptides can help zzso the relative amounts of the proteins that contain zzso Also, proteins with no unique zzso in the sample can still be analyzed for relative zzso Our article uses shared peptides in protein zzso and makes use of zzso zzso to reduce the error in relative abundance zzso We describe the zzso and zzso properties required for robust estimates, and use them to improve our estimates for zzso zzso zzso simulations validate our approach even in the presence of experimental zzso We apply our method to a model of zzso zzso root knot zzso infection, and investigate the differential role of several protein family members in zzso host response to the zzso
