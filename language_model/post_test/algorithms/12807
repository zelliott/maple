The rate at which liquids can be added to a vertical well, the lateral zone of impact of the well, and the liquids volume needed to wet the waste within the zone of impact of the well are the key zzso needed to design a vertical well zzso This paper presents design charts that can be used to estimate these zzso as a function of municipal solid waste properties zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso well dimensions zzso and screen zzso and injection zzso zzso modeling was conducted to estimate the key design zzso for a range of conditions practically encountered for a vertical well installed in zzso zzso The flow rate, lateral zone of impact of a well, liquids volume added, and injection pressure were zzso with the waste properties and well dimensions to formulate zzso zzso A series of design charts were created to present zzso zzso flow rate, lateral zone of impact, and the zzso liquid volume needed to reach a zzso condition, as a function of zzso input zzso By using zzso variables formulated for this work, these charts permit the user to estimate the zzso design variables described above for a wide range of zzso and conditions beyond those simulated without the need for further zzso The results of the study suggest that the lateral extent of the well can be estimated using zzso equation and assuming saturated zzso vertical flow regime below the well zzso An example problem is presented to illustrate the use of the design zzso The scenario described in the example problem was also modeled with zzso and the results were compared with those obtained from the design charts to demonstrate the zzso of design charts for scenarios other than those used for the development of the design zzso The methodology presented in this paper should be thought of as a means to provide a set of bounds that an engineer can use along with their judgment in the design of a system for a specific zzso
