zzso are important zzso motifs for biological recognition of proteins and zzso Organic molecules that sample the side chain positions of zzso have shown broad binding capacity to multiple different zzso for example zzso zzso have traditionally been classified into various types based on the backbone zzso angles zzso zzso zzso and zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso are currently classified into 8 different backbone families zzso I, Type II, Type zzso Type zzso Type VIII, Type zzso Type zzso and Type zzso and Type IV which represents zzso zzso Although this zzso of zzso has been useful, the resulting zzso types are not ideal for the design of zzso zzso as they do not reflect zzso features of the recognition zzso the side zzso To overcome this, we have extracted zzso from a data set of zzso and high-resolution protein crystal zzso The side chain positions, as defined by zzso zzso of these turns have been clustered using the zzso nearest neighbor zzso and filtered nearest zzso sorting zzso Nine clusters were obtained that cluster zzso of the data, and the average zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso is zzso The nine clusters therefore represent the zzso of the side chain scaffold architecture of the vast majority of zzso The mean structures of the nine clusters are useful for the development of zzso zzso and as biological zzso for focusing zzso chemistry towards biologically relevant zzso zzso
