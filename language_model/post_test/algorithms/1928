The general method for constructing coupled dual zzso in liquid zzso zzso is to begin by filling a zzso A with a solution of one mobile phase zzso component at concentration zzso and a second zzso component at concentration zzso followed by filling a zzso B with a solution containing zzso component one at concentration zzso and the second zzso component at concentration zzso In another scenario the reservoirs A and B are filled with solutions of only one zzso component at different zzso zzso and zzso and the two solutions are zzso to a different pH value: pH zzso for the zzso A and pH zzso for the zzso B zzso In either case, mixing of flows from the two reservoirs varies the zzso of the two zzso components zzso zzso or the concentration of one zzso component and pH along a particular compositional curve producing an zzso with two zzso coupled zzso This is a kind of a two zzso zzso utilizing dual simultaneous dependent zzso zzso wherein two parameters affecting the binding free energy of an zzso to a stationary phase zzso are being altered zzso Such a zzso suffers from a significant limitation in that the zzso concentration of the two zzso or the concentration of one zzso component and the pH cannot be varied zzso The only way to attain an optimal zzso zzso system, that promises a remarkable increase in zzso resolution of complex zzso zzso is to zzso the multiple zzso zzso making each independent of the zzso In this paper the theory of zzso of zzso such zzso zzso zzso 2 is zzso It is shown that for zzso zzso zzso reservoirs are required in concert with an zzso zzso delivery system capable of freely zzso the flows among the reservoirs according to equations we develop zzso We go on to predict a substantial increase in zzso resolution when applying dual simultaneous independent zzso zzso of salt and pH to zzso difficult to separate zzso This prediction is naturally explained by the zzso interaction theory of protein binding to an zzso zzso In subsequent experimental papers it will be shown that the zzso presented here properly instruct a zzso pump zzso system to produce well controlled independent simultaneous zzso of pH and zzso zzso with attendant significant gain in zzso resolution of complex zzso of protein zzso
