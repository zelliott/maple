The dynamics and equilibrium structure of a deterministic zzso model of migration and selection acting on multiple zzso zzso is zzso A large population of zzso individuals is distributed over zzso many zzso connected by zzso zzso are discrete and zzso migration is zzso and zzso all zzso zzso rates are positive, and selection may vary across zzso It is proved that, in the absence of selection, all zzso zzso at a geometric rate to a zzso on which global linkage equilibrium holds and zzso zzso are identical across zzso Various limiting cases are derived in which one or more of the three evolutionary forces, selection, migration, and zzso are weak relative to the zzso Two are particularly zzso If migration and zzso are strong relative to selection, the dynamics can be conceived as a zzso of the so-called zzso limit, a simple zzso system for suitably averaged zzso zzso Under zzso assumptions on this zzso limit which are zzso every equilibrium of the full dynamics is a zzso of an equilibrium of the zzso limit and has the same stability zzso The number of zzso is the same in both systems, zzso in the full zzso system are in zzso zzso and differences among zzso zzso across zzso are zzso If migration is weak relative to zzso and zzso is also weak, then every equilibrium is a zzso of an equilibrium of the corresponding system without migration, has the same stability properties, and is in zzso zzso In both cases, every trajectory zzso to an zzso thus no cycling or complicated dynamics can zzso
