We propose a novel zzso based maximum a zzso probability zzso detector in zzso coherent wavelength division zzso zzso systems, and investigate its performance in a zzso zzso keyed zzso system limited by zzso zzso The proposed method zzso each zzso using the signal levels not only of the particular zzso but also of its adjacent zzso and therefore can effectively compensate deterministic zzso zzso as well as zzso interference arising from zzso filtering and chromatic zzso zzso zzso simulation of a zzso zzso zzso system with zzso per channel using either direct or coherent detection shows that the zzso decoder can eliminate the need for phase control of each optical carrier (which is necessarily required in a conventional zzso zzso and greatly zzso the spectral design of the zzso filter at the zzso It also significantly improves back-to-back sensitivity and CD tolerance of the zzso
