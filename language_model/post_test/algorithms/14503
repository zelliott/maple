A method was developed to recover the copper and iron from Printed Circuit zzso zzso manufacturing generated spent acid zzso solution and waste sludge with zzso energy at laboratory zzso It demonstrated that zzso zzso spent zzso solution could be zzso as a leaching solution to leach copper from copper contained zzso waste zzso It also indicated that lime could be used as an alkaline zzso agent in this method to zzso iron from the mixture of zzso zzso spent zzso solution and waste zzso This method provided an effective technique for the recovery of copper and iron through simultaneous use of zzso spent acid solution and waste zzso The leaching rates of copper and iron enhanced with ultrasound energy were reached at zzso and zzso respectively and effectively separated copper from zzso Followed by applying lime to zzso copper from the mixture of zzso and zzso water produced by the copper and iron zzso about zzso and zzso of soluble copper and calcium were settled as the zzso zzso zzso the settled copper could be made as commercial rate zzso The process performance parameters studied were zzso zzso power, and zzso This method provided a simple and reliable technique to recover copper and iron from waste zzso generated by zzso manufacturing, and would significantly reduce the cost of chemicals used in the zzso
