This paper presents a new method to reduce the topographical artifacts in scanning zzso optical zzso zzso zzso The method uses the zzso caused zzso by the zzso in the zzso of the zzso probe even when the probe is working in a normal condition without extra zzso Using these intrinsic zzso the zzso of the received zzso signal with respect to the probe motion is zzso Then, taking advantage of a zzso capable of simultaneously obtaining both the topographical and optical signals, topographical artifacts are calculated from the product of the zzso and the topographical zzso and then removed from the received zzso zzso The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated zzso
