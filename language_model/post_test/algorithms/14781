This paper proposes a high precision zzso zzso zzso novel zzso zzso zzso zzso scheme with reasonable zzso cost for zzso cases by selecting a minimum number of zzso sensor zzso zzso in continuous moving zzso It shows apparent advantages in that two classes of boundary and zzso sensor zzso can be efficiently classified using the model selection techniques for finite mixture zzso zzso the set of sensor readings within each sensor zzso spatial neighbors is formulated using a zzso zzso zzso different from zzso zzso and zzso zzso we also zzso a zzso zzso with an additional own sensor reading to benefit selecting Event zzso zzso and zzso from the observations of zzso In particular, we propose a zzso Section Model zzso to solve the problem of transition between zzso and zzso It is verified by simulations that the zzso zzso model zzso zzso and zzso in terms of average residual energy and the number of zzso selected, while the zzso zzso model demonstrates sound performance even for sensor networks with low zzso especially when the value of the sensor transmission range zzso is larger than the value of Section zzso zzso in zzso We have also rigorously proved its correctness for continuous geometric zzso and full zzso for sensor networks over zzso zzso
