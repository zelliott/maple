One of the goals of systems biology is to reverse engineer in a comprehensive fashion the zzso zzso of signal zzso zzso An important tool for ordering zzso components is genetic zzso analysis, and here we present a strategy termed Alternative zzso zzso to perform systematic zzso zzso An alternative input is defined as any genetic manipulation that can activate the signaling zzso instead of the natural zzso We introduced the concept of an zzso zzso that summarizes the zzso of all combinations of alternative zzso and zzso We developed the theory and zzso to construct a zzso relationship graph from the zzso zzso capturing both functional ordering zzso zzso and logical relationships zzso zzso and then interpreting these relationships into a standard zzso zzso As a zzso we applied this methodology to a subset of genes involved in zzso mating zzso This experimental pilot study highlights the zzso of the approach and important technical zzso In zzso this research zzso and extends classical zzso analysis from linear pathways to more complex networks, zzso zzso analysis and reconstruction of signaling zzso zzso
