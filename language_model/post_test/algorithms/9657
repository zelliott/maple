Image contrast associated with zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer agents can be generated by zzso zzso of zzso water or zzso zzso or zzso zzso of bulk zzso Previously, a zzso model was developed to describe an in zzso zzso The model incorporated the zzso transfer effect from zzso when using zzso zzso In the current study, this zzso model is modified to describe the in zzso system when using zzso zzso The influences of pulse power, pulse zzso the chemical shift of bound water, the zzso exchange rate between bulk water and bound water, and agent concentration on the zzso zzso agent chemical exchange effects were simulated using a zzso pulse train in the absence and presence of the zzso zzso The results demonstrated that while contrast increases with pulse duration in zzso solution, there is an optimal pulse duration that zzso zzso zzso agent chemical exchange effects contrast in zzso This zzso was verified by experimental zzso and imaging results from zzso solution, bovine serum zzso zzso and a tissue phantom containing zzso zzso This model can be used to zzso sequence parameters to maximize in zzso zzso zzso agent chemical exchange effects zzso
