zzso diffuse optical zzso zzso is an emerging technique for visualizing the internal state of biological zzso The large number of overlapping measurement channels due to the use of zzso probe zzso permits the reconstruction of the internal optical properties, even with a zzso zzso However, accurate three-dimensional reconstruction is still a challenging zzso First, the zzso zzso sensitivity causes a systematic zzso zzso Second, the nature of zzso light makes the image zzso In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional reconstruction method that overcomes these two problems by introducing zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso zzso Phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed method under three conditions of probe zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso We found that two zzso with distances shorter than the probe zzso could be zzso under the zzso conditions of zzso and zzso zzso This discrimination ability was possible even if the depths of the two zzso were different from each zzso These results show the high spatial resolution of the proposed method in both depth and horizontal zzso
