We propose a novel technique for zzso heart rate detection based on the zzso zzso force signal from a subject standing on a common electronic weighing zzso The detection relies on sensing force variations related to the blood acceleration in the zzso works even if wearing footwear and does not require any sensors attached to the body because it uses the load cells in the zzso We have devised an approach to estimate the sensitivity and frequency response of three commercial weighing scales to assess their capability to detect the zzso force zzso zzso sensitivities ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to 1670 zzso zzso zzso The frequency response depended on the zzso mass but it was broad enough for heart rate zzso We have designed an electronic pulse detection system based on zzso integrated circuits to sense zzso force variations of about zzso zzso The zzso ratio of the main zzso of the force signal detected was higher than 30 zzso A zzso plot was used to compare the zzso time intervals estimated from the zzso and zzso force signals for 17 zzso The error was zzso zzso which makes the proposed technique suitable for short-term monitoring of the heart zzso
