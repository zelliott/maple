A method, is presented for blind zzso zzso resolved zzso lifetime zzso The method is based on the combined analysis of spectral and lifetime zzso and allows zzso of up to three components without any prior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the individual components can be extracted with this new zzso The reliability and sensitivity are investigated and the possibility of extending the method to zzso more components is zzso The method is evaluated on zzso of fluorescent zzso and labeled zzso
