A zzso zzso model applied to magnetic resonance zzso incorporates zzso behavior zzso related to both elastic and zzso forces, and allows two zzso parameters to be extracted from an zzso motion zzso Under zzso conditions, the model can be implemented by the use of complex zzso zzso and density, whereas zzso zzso models commonly used in zzso consist of only a complex zzso zzso and model only a single zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that the differences between zzso elastic behavior resulting from a purely complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and from a purely complex density zzso zzso become larger as the overall level of zzso present zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A plot of results generated from the finite element zzso model indicate the relative motion differences estimated for a range of zzso ratios and zzso zzso combinations increase with zzso ratio, and can be up to zzso at a zzso ratio of 50% and therefore using the correct model for a zzso zzso material becomes increasingly important as zzso levels zzso zzso effects cause values from this plot to vary by as much as zzso as parameters such as wave speed, frequency, and problem size are zzso These motion differences can be compared to expected noise levels to estimate the zzso resolution achievable by a reconstruction zzso An zzso global property reconstruction zzso was developed, and used for testing zzso zzso zzso reconstructions with zzso noise added to the simulated motion input zzso The coherent motion errors resulting from altering the combination of the two zzso parameters are large enough to allow accurate determination of both of the zzso zzso parameters with incoherent noise levels comparable to MR zzso The accuracy achieved by the global reconstructions was significantly better than would be predicted by examining the motion differences for differing zzso zzso combinations, which is likely to be due to the low ratio between number of reconstructed parameters and number of noisy zzso
