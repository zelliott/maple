The immune system is able to respond more vigorously to the second contact with a given zzso than to the first zzso zzso protocols generally include at least two doses, in order to obtain high zzso zzso We want to analyze the relation between the time elapsed from the first dose zzso and the second dose zzso on the zzso zzso In this paper, we couple in zzso experiments with computer simulations to assess the effect of delaying the second zzso We observe that an zzso of several weeks between the prime and the boost is necessary to obtain optimal zzso zzso
