With a zzso zzso technique for treating zzso cancer, zzso rotation may be needed for the upper lateral fields to avoid zzso shoulders or to avoid unnecessary zzso zzso while maintaining more anterior zzso For patients with unilateral zzso lateral zzso boost fields can be used to zzso the primary tumor and zzso zzso zzso without zzso through gross zzso When initial zzso lateral fields are also rotated with a zzso angle to produce zzso boost fields, however, the resulting zzso with a low anterior neck zzso boost field is no longer zzso This can be corrected by manual adjustment of zzso and zzso angles for the zzso field using zzso treatment planning zzso The goal of this study was to derive mathematical formulas to simplify this zzso We used a transformation zzso to define formulas that could predict the appropriate modifications to the zzso boost zzso zzso from the formulas was zzso visually tested within zzso treatment planning software and zzso verified using a solid water zzso phantom and zzso film zzso to confirm that a zzso zzso was obtained in several clinical zzso When evaluated with zzso treatment planning software, the formulas accurately predicted the appropriate zzso and zzso angles of the zzso boost field for a variety of possible beam zzso When evaluated with film zzso the formulas were shown to accurately predict the appropriate zzso and zzso angles of the zzso boost field to within the zzso 2 zzso degrees tolerance specifications of the linear accelerator and acceptable for routine clinical zzso The presented formulas are simple and zzso zzso They predict the necessary zzso of the zzso boost field to maintain a zzso precise zzso as verified by zzso treatment planning software, phantom zzso and actual patient zzso
