To establish a method for mouse coronary zzso in zzso using zzso radiation, which is essential for zzso and pathological research on coronary zzso 

1) The imaging parameters zzso zzso energy, spatial resolution of the zzso and injection rate of contrast zzso optimal for the quality of acquired images in a simulation were zzso 2) Through animal experiments, the effectiveness of these optimal parameters and the zzso of in zzso coronary zzso were zzso 3) An zzso for background zzso and contrast enhancement was designed and employed to compensate for the effects of interference and the effective information extracted used for diagnosing coronary zzso 

An optimal set of the imaging parameters was finally zzso zzso energy of zzso zzso zzso spatial resolution of 30 zzso or higher, image capture rate of 20 zzso or more, concentration of zzso solution of zzso as contrast agent and a pulse injection of contrast agent at a high zzso
