In this paper we describe results based on the combination of atmospheric pressure zzso zzso with atmospheric pressure chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The main purpose of combining more than one zzso is to extend the range of compounds that can be simultaneously zzso Three modes of operation are zzso use of either zzso simultaneous use of two zzso and rapid switching between zzso during a single zzso zzso The dual zzso zzso only minimally affect the performance of either zzso relative to the standard zzso zzso However, it is observed that the operation of both zzso together does not typically give the sum signal from either source operating zzso For zzso the signal can range from less than that of either source alone to the sum of the two individual zzso For zzso we observed large zzso of the zzso zzso signal of proteins when the zzso source was zzso These behaviors are presumed to be due to the interaction of the initially formed zzso by both sources and zzso to the importance of zzso reactions that occur during and after the primary zzso zzso We give examples of compounds that are zzso zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso and present zzso arguments based on molecular structure and functionality to explain this zzso The dual source is also shown to be able to operate in negative zzso mode opening up the potential to conduct wide ranging chemical zzso
