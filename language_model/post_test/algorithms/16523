zzso zzso technology has been widely applied in biological and medical decision-making research during the past zzso However, the diversity of platforms has made it a challenge to zzso and/or integrate zzso generated in different experiments or labs for constructing zzso diagnostic zzso Using large zzso zzso generated using both zzso and zzso zzso platforms, we carried out a benchmark evaluation of zzso consistency in zzso prediction using three zzso machine learning zzso After an initial assessment of model performance on different platforms, we evaluated whether zzso signature features selected in one platform could be directly used to train a model in the other platform and whether zzso models trained using data from one platform could predict zzso zzso using the other platform with comparable zzso Our results established that it is possible to successfully apply zzso prediction models across different commercial zzso platforms, offering a number of important benefits such as accelerating the possible translation of zzso identified with zzso to zzso zzso However, this investigation focuses on a technical platform comparison and is actually only the beginning of exploring zzso zzso Further studies are needed to confirm the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso especially using independent zzso
