We apply the continuous delayed feedback method of zzso to control chaos in the zzso zzso zzso reaction, using the electric current as the control zzso At each data point in the time series, a time delayed feedback function applies a small zzso zzso to zzso platinum electrodes, which causes zzso processes on the surface of the zzso These zzso are calculated as the difference between the previous zzso zzso signal and the actual zzso zzso periodic zzso zzso and zzso orbits zzso were stabilized in the zzso zzso stirred tank zzso zzso The stabilization is demonstrated by at least three conditions: A minimum in the experimental zzso function, the equality of the delay time with the period of the stabilized zzso and the zzso of the stabilized periodic zzso in the chaotic zzso
