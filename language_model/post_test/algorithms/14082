The zzso of experiments based on zzso resonance energy transfer zzso an imaging technique widely used to measure zzso interactions in living cells, critically depends on the accurate and precise measurement of zzso zzso The use of zzso standards to determine zzso efficiency, and a consideration of such factors as how the abundance of zzso zzso and the zzso of donors and zzso in a molecular complex can affect measured zzso efficiency, will enhance the usefulness with which zzso experiments can be zzso
