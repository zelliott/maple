zzso subjects prevented from taking a deep breath show changes in zzso similar to those of zzso when challenged with zzso zzso To confirm airway narrowing by zzso in this setting and to determine its location, we zzso measured changes in airway zzso area using high resolution zzso zzso zzso and zzso using partial zzso in five normal subjects challenged with increasing doses of zzso under prohibition of deep zzso In an attempt to improve imaging zzso we corrected for the changes in lung volume during zzso At every step of the zzso scanning was performed at approximately the same lung zzso On the zzso images, airway area decreased in response to the increasing doses of zzso to 91 zzso zzso 88 zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso of baseline at the doses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso narrowing showed no zzso for particular airway sizes and occurred in a zzso zzso The changes in the mean airway zzso area as measured by zzso and the mean partial zzso outcomes were highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We conclude that in normal subjects who are prevented from taking a deep breath, the zzso changes occurring with zzso zzso challenge are associated with conducting airway zzso
