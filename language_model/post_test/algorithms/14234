To compare the zzso outcome of infants delivered before 39 zzso gestation following documentation of fetal lung maturity before and after the zzso body count zzso threshold was increased from 30,000 to 50,000 zzso We discuss the zzso employed for testing fetal lung maturity, the cost of testing and potential zzso 

We studied the outcome of infants delivered zzso before 39 zzso gestation after fetal lung maturity was documented by zzso fluid zzso We compared the outcome of zzso born before and after the zzso threshold was zzso 

Our cohort included zzso zzso who were divided into two groups: 264 who underwent fetal lung maturity studies before the change in zzso threshold and 263 who underwent testing after the zzso In the first group, 158 zzso met the criteria of zzso zzso zzso and were delivered without further zzso The second group included 154 zzso who were mature by zzso zzso zzso and were zzso Seven of the zzso born in the first group required admission to the zzso intensive care unit zzso whereas in the second group only two zzso required admission zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 16 zzso in the first group required respiratory assistance compared with six in the second group zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso complication rate was significantly higher in the first group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the zzso threshold resulted in a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso the algorithm, we described for testing fetal lung maturity is cost effective, and more importantly, represents sound evidence-based medical zzso
