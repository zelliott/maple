In this study, cotton zzso was used as an zzso for the aim of removing of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso process was carried out in a batch process and the effects of contact time zzso zzso concentration zzso g zzso initial pH zzso initial metal zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and temperature zzso degrees zzso on the zzso were zzso Experimental results showed that the maximum zzso capacity was determined at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration was increased with increasing zzso concentration and contact zzso The zzso data of cotton zzso could be well described by the zzso equations and the zzso zzso capacity had a mean value of zzso zzso zzso Experimental results indicated that the zzso order reaction model provided the best description of the data with a correlation zzso zzso for different initial metal zzso and therefore it was explained that chemical zzso was the basic mechanism in this zzso zzso results showed that oxygen and nitrogen atoms in structure of cotton zzso were involved in zzso zzso zzso
