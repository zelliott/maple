Using the recently developed zzso theory of zzso zzso coherent structures zzso we introduce a zzso approach that renders attracting and zzso zzso as smooth, zzso zzso in two-dimensional zzso The zzso are obtained as zzso of an autonomous ordinary differential equation for the zzso lines of the zzso strain zzso This approach eliminates false zzso and zzso in zzso detection by separating true exponential stretching from zzso in a zzso zzso Having an explicitly zzso form for zzso zzso also allows for their further in-depth analysis and accurate zzso as material zzso We illustrate these results on a zzso model flow and on a direct zzso simulation of two-dimensional zzso
