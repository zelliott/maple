zzso parameters of zzso cell zzso networks in zzso to zzso Fischer 344 rats were determined after 48 weeks of chronic ethanol zzso zzso included the total number and length of all zzso the total number and length of segments within zzso defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each zzso A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal zzso This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean zzso in that zzso zzso changes in other segment categories were not zzso showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed zzso Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further zzso zzso of these zzso zzso differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both zzso and zzso rats were significantly zzso Only one category of internal segments showed this change during zzso The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in zzso cell networks, was associated with zzso of those networks through zzso zzso This effect was interpreted as zzso growth in surviving networks following zzso zzso loss and/or damage to the surrounding zzso Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal zzso of those networks that was not related specifically to zzso It could be zzso however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the zzso and the zzso zzso
