Conventional visual analysis of brain zzso PET scans is useful for predicting zzso improvement for zzso lobe zzso zzso patients, but zzso value for identifying patients who will achieve zzso status is considerably zzso We aimed to develop an approach with which to zzso assess zzso pertinent aspects of zzso asymmetry in zzso PET scans for forecasting zzso zzso clinical zzso 

zzso brain PET scans of 75 zzso patients were examined using a zzso tool that zzso zzso zzso asymmetry in a specified proportion zzso of the zzso lobe zzso in the most zzso plane, generating a zzso lobe asymmetry index zzso zzso of this analysis were compared with patients' actual zzso outcomes after an average of approximately 4 y of clinical zzso The investigation was divided into 2 main steps: The PET scans examined in the first step, selected by zzso order of scan acquisition dates, comprised just less than two thirds of the patient group studied zzso and were used to look for parameters predicting zzso zzso zzso in the second step, the zzso value of the parameters suggested by the analysis in the first step was independently examined using the set of remaining PET scans zzso to check for wider zzso of the zzso 

Of the 75 patients zzso 42 became seizure free after surgery, whereas 33 continued to seize beyond the immediate zzso period, during a mean zzso follow-up zzso The specified proportion of zzso zzso with which to assess zzso asymmetry that provided the highest zzso value with respect to achieving zzso status was zzso Across the study population, those patients with scans having lower zzso values zzso to zzso difference in zzso zzso between left and right zzso zzso among the zzso most zzso zzso zzso pairs measured in the most zzso zzso were only half as likely to continue to have zzso zzso as those with scans having higher zzso values zzso likelihood ratio for achieving zzso outcome, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Overall, those patients with greater zzso zzso as zzso by higher zzso values, had a significantly decreased chance of achieving zzso status after surgery than those with lower degrees of asymmetry zzso and this same tendency was observed for both the first and second series of PET scans zzso 

A zzso approach to assessing zzso zzso asymmetry over a specified proportion of the zzso lobe may help to predict whether patients will likely be free of zzso during the years after zzso zzso of zzso zzso
