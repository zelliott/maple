zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso has been linked to various diabetic zzso complications zzso zzso zzso and zzso Novel and potent small molecules with preferential selective zzso property of zzso will be helpful in treatment as well as understanding insight of zzso involvement in these zzso zzso zzso hypotheses were developed using both the crystal structure and available zzso zzso and were validated by feature mapping and screening in-house database of reported zzso zzso The best hypothesis from both methods consists of six features zzso one hydrogen bond donor zzso two hydrogen bond zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and one ring aromatic zzso A synergistic approach of virtual screening using both zzso and zzso based zzso model was used for the flexible search of zzso from chemical zzso The hits obtained were screened by molecular zzso and their binding affinity was predicted using zzso zzso The first zzso based query of zzso and new scaffold of its zzso with good estimated activities, favorable binding zzso and high zzso score were zzso
