Our focus is on an appropriate theoretical framework for describing highly zzso zzso In high zzso of zzso proteins behave like zzso in a good zzso and ensembles for zzso proteins can be modeled by ignoring all interactions except excluded volume zzso zzso To zzso zzso preferences of highly zzso zzso we zzso a variety of properties for zzso ensembles of 23 two-state zzso We find that modeled zzso proteins can be best described as zzso Average shapes are consistent with zzso zzso zzso are characterized by large correlated zzso zzso zzso preferences are restricted to local length scales that span five to nine zzso Beyond local length zzso chain properties follow zzso power laws that are expected for generic zzso in the zzso zzso The average available volume is filled zzso and cavities of all sizes are found within the interiors of zzso zzso All properties characterized from simulated ensembles match predictions from rigorous field zzso We use our results to resolve between conflicting proposals for structure in ensembles for highly zzso zzso
