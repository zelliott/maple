To investigate the distribution of zzso vessels in the digital images of the zzso surface, an endeavor which may provide useful information for future zzso 

This study included 295 healthy zzso From each zzso four digital photographs of the superior and inferior zzso of both eyes, with a fixed succession of photography zzso zzso right lower, left zzso left zzso were taken with a slit lamp mounted zzso Photographs were then analyzed by a previously described zzso for vessel detection in the digital zzso The area (of the zzso occupied by vessels zzso of different sizes was zzso zzso weight, zzso blood sugar zzso and zzso levels were also measured and the relationship between these parameters and the zzso was zzso 

These findings indicated a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the zzso among the four zzso zzso No significant correlations were noted between the zzso of each zzso area and the different demographic and zzso zzso zzso vessels were the most abundant vessels in the photographs of the four investigated zzso zzso The zzso of the different sizes of vessels follows a normal distribution curve in the four areas of the zzso The distribution of the vessels in successive photographs changes in a specific manner, with the mean zzso becoming larger as the photos were taken from the right upper to the left lower zzso 

The zzso of vessel sizes has a normal distribution curve and zzso vessels occupy the largest area of the zzso
