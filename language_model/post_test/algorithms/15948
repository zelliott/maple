A modification of the zzso zzso Program zzso combined with a novel automatic method for the definition of structural zzso correctly identified the core folds of a variety of small zzso proteins when compared with a series of ideal zzso This approach opens the possibility of not just determining whether one structure is like another, but given a range of ideal forms, determining what the protein zzso zzso studies have shown it to work equally well on the all zzso and the zzso class of zzso each of which have corresponding ideal zzso Given the speed of the algorithm, it will be possible to compare all of these against the zzso zzso Database and determine the extent to which the current ideal forms can account for the variety of protein zzso Analysis of the remainder should provide a base for the development of further zzso
