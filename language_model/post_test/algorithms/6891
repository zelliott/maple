A mathematical model for zzso production by zzso zzso was established, in which the effects of zzso zzso and product on cell growth, zzso formation and zzso zzso were zzso The model gave a good representation both of the formation of zzso (which are not only attached to cells but also released into the zzso and of the time courses of the production of zzso and zzso in the medium (which are produced and consumed by the zzso Since pH and both zzso and zzso acid zzso differently affected production and growth activity, the model included the effects of pH and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Based on the mathematical model, an optimal pH profile for the maximum production of zzso in batch culture was zzso In this study, a simplified zzso method was developed, in which the optimal pH profile was determined at a particular final zzso zzso This was based on the principle that, at a certain time, switching from the maximum specific growth rate to the critical one (which yields the maximum specific production zzso results in maximum zzso zzso zzso production was zzso which was zzso higher than that obtained in the zzso control zzso A genetic zzso zzso was also applied to obtain the optimal pH zzso and it was found that practically the same solution was obtained using the zzso
