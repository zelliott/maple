We describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to build multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify all members of large, diverse and zzso sets of target zzso The zzso zzso is zzso to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence zzso We applied it to questions in viral zzso and demonstrated that there are no universally zzso zzso sequences among viruses and that it could require an zzso large number of zzso ( approximately zzso zzso or approximately 2000 zzso to generate zzso from all zzso zzso We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as zzso disease virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and zzso We zzso demonstrated the application of the software with a multiplex set of 16 short (10 zzso zzso designed to amplify the zzso family to produce a specific zzso from zzso zzso
