zzso dynamics are recognized as being important to the functioning of the human nose in conditioning and filtering inspired air, yet these dynamics are poorly zzso Despite considerable research on zzso dynamics by zzso respiratory zzso and zzso major disagreements remain about the nature of zzso in the human zzso Specifically, there is little consensus about the character of zzso zzso regimes zzso or zzso and about the major pathways of zzso through the internal zzso Additionally, a number of features in the human nose have been argued to enhance zzso zzso thus increasing the exposure of moving air to the zzso zzso and zzso heat and moisture exchange in cold and/or dry zzso These features include: an inferior orientation of the zzso a zzso zzso that is high relative to the floor of the internal zzso zzso a zzso valve that is small in zzso area relative to that of the internal zzso and large, projecting zzso The claim that these features affect zzso dynamics has never been zzso To clarify the nature of human zzso zzso and to test these claims of functional significance to zzso variation, we studied zzso across zzso flow rates using water and dye flowing through zzso accurate acrylic models of human zzso air zzso (with adjustment of water flow rates to maintain dynamic zzso The models were derived from direct casting of the zzso zzso of 10 Caucasian zzso zzso (six male, four zzso zzso of zzso angle, zzso zzso zzso zzso valve area relative to internal chamber zzso area, and relative projection of the inferior and middle zzso were taken directly on the resulting zzso The relationships between aspects of zzso zzso and turbulent air flow were evaluated by examining the flow regimes zzso zzso or zzso at varying flow rates, with the expectation that the greater the development of the proposed zzso features the slower the flow rate at which flow would shift from one regime to zzso zzso characteristics (both flow regimes and principal zzso were highly variable within our zzso The relative projection of the inferior zzso was the only variable that significantly affected the flow rate at which flow became zzso However, more projecting zzso appear to zzso flow rather than to induce zzso zzso orientation was moderately correlated with flow dynamics (with more zzso directed zzso producing turbulence at slower flow zzso but this correlation was not statistically zzso Relative zzso valve area and zzso zzso height were unrelated to turbulence in our zzso
