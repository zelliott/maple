The authors present an automatic zzso for zzso reconstruction of cerebral blood vessels by digital zzso zzso The patient is localized by a zzso zzso The reconstruction zzso includes two steps: first vessel extraction then zzso matching and zzso zzso vessel skeletons are generated by a combination of mathematical zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reconstruction zzso is based on the reconstruction of vessels center zzso For that purpose, three different projections of the vascular network are zzso Reconstruction is zzso segment by segment (a curved line between two zzso For each segment point, the zzso defines all zzso solutions on the other zzso These zzso solutions are sorted and pooled by zzso continuity and zzso proximity criteria resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso segment is defined by a zzso zzso that looks up the better path in the zzso zzso The zzso have been implemented on a zzso computer in C zzso More than zzso of zzso copper phantom was reconstructed in 5 zzso and with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of arteries (from carotid to the seventh zzso of a true patient zzso network were reconstructed is less than 30 zzso
