This paper reports a preliminary finding associated with an investigation of how zzso respond to mechanical zzso The stress distribution within the tissue may be the result of normal function, for example, joint forces, or it may result from interventions such as tissue zzso during or after zzso We sought to combine electrical and mechanical zzso models in order to better understand the interaction between the zzso For example, if mechanical stress is applied to tissue this may change the cell arrangements within the tissue zzso and hence change the electrical zzso If this interaction could be determined, then it should be possible to use electrical zzso zzso zzso to identify stress patterns in zzso zzso of zzso changes have been made in zzso silicone rubber sheets when subject to a zzso stress of up to zzso Relatively large changes in zzso are produced (up to zzso These changes are far larger than those predicted arising from zzso changes zzso It is suggested that under stress the zzso islands of carbon within the silicone rubber sheet undergo a zzso disassociation from their zzso and that the zzso electrical properties change under zzso If similar zzso relationships occur within biological materials it may be possible to recover the stress fields within zzso from transfer zzso zzso and thereby predict if actions such as inappropriate zzso tension will compromise tissue zzso
