The UK zzso model was evaluated zzso in Polish women assessed 11 years previously for fracture zzso zzso were compared with fracture risk observed during zzso The UK model can be used to zzso risk, but caution is required in interpretation of absolute fracture zzso 

In the absence of a zzso model for Poland, the UK zzso tool has been widely zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso of the surrogate model in a Polish zzso 

We studied a convenience sample of zzso women who had been referred for the assessment of bone mineral density and clinical risk factors 9-12 years zzso zzso fractures in the intervening period were zzso by telephone zzso zzso zzso calculated using the UK zzso zzso were compared to the zzso of new fractures during zzso 

zzso fractures were reported in 106 zzso zzso fractures of the major zzso fractures were reported in 89 zzso The observed zzso of fractures rose progressively in women according to zzso of fracture zzso Between the 10th and 90th zzso hip fracture probability zzso with bone mineral density zzso differed zzso The range was fivefold in the case of a major zzso zzso The zzso ratio for fracture was significantly greater than unity when the expected number was calculated without zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and when zzso was included in the zzso calculation zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

The UK zzso tool zzso fracture risk well in this Polish cohort but significantly overestimated fracture zzso The UK model can be used to zzso risk in the population, but caution is required in interpretation of absolute zzso
