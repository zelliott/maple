zzso interaction networks in proteins are responsible for zzso zzso binding zzso a biologically important, widespread phenomenon in nature zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso gene transcription, or zzso The cooperative binding of two (or more) different zzso to a zzso is the underlying zzso To date, zzso effects have been studied mainly zzso in zzso zzso Until now, approximate approaches have been employed for studying equilibrium zzso zzso binding effects, except in two special cases in which an exact analysis was developed: independent binding (no zzso and competitive binding zzso negative zzso The exact analysis and methodology for characterizing zzso binding zzso interactions in the general case zzso degree of zzso using zzso zzso zzso are presented in this zzso zzso interaction pathways within the zzso zzso can be identified and characterized using this zzso As an example, the zzso characterization of the binding interaction between zzso zzso and its three zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the characterization of their binding zzso interaction, is zzso
