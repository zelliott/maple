Muscle contraction results in structural and zzso changes of the related zzso zzso finger zzso can be monitored from zzso of these zzso zzso We used ultrasound imaging to record muscle activities during finger zzso and extracted features to discriminate different zzso zzso using a support zzso machine zzso Registration of ultrasound images before and after finger zzso was performed to generate a deformation field, from which angle features and zzso features were zzso The zzso was then used to zzso the motions of different zzso The experimental results showed that the overall mean recognition accuracy was zzso zzso zzso with the highest for the thumb zzso and the lowest for the ring finger zzso and the mean F value was zzso zzso zzso indicating high accuracy and reliability of this zzso The results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to be used as an alternative method of surface zzso in zzso the motions of different zzso
