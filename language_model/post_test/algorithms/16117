The zzso correspondence problem was solved by implementing the uniqueness constraint and the continuity zzso as proposed by zzso and zzso zzso D, zzso (1976) Science zzso zzso However, these constraints are not sufficient to define the proper correspondence zzso With these constraints, zzso zzso zzso consisting of the periodic textures in each image, are treated as a correspondence of surfaces composed of patches of alternating values of zzso This is quite different from the surface we perceive through the zzso that is a surface characterized by a single zzso Because these constraints are local, they cannot produce the global optimum of zzso To obtain the global optimum of correspondence, we propose a model of zzso zzso in which a global measure of correspondence is explicitly zzso The model consists of two zzso zzso First, the lower system processes various zzso based on the uniqueness zzso Second, the higher system provides a global measure of correspondence for the disparity in zzso The higher system uniquely determines the global optimum of correspondence in the lower system through the zzso loop between zzso zzso The convergence of the zzso loop is determined by the consistency between the zzso zzso The condition is termed the zzso consistency zzso
