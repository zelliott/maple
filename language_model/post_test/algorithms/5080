Moving zzso boundary zzso is an important foundation to understand and improve zzso However, there are obstacles in theoretical predictions of zzso on zzso strips due to the unknown local zzso of carrier zzso on commercial zzso strips and the zzso boundary zzso We introduce a zzso approach to extend the current zzso theories into the zzso varying zzso zzso The zzso approach emphasizes the zzso of zzso parameters in the discrete time intervals and local positions in zzso zzso such as local zzso of carrier zzso local OH zzso local boundary zzso local judgments, zzso The zzso zzso equation in a complete time sequence was presented to zzso predict the zzso zzso zzso by distinguishing three kinds of zzso cases according to zzso zzso in zzso zzso The theoretical zzso zzso and local relative judgments of boundaries were zzso validated by corresponding images of boundary zzso achieved from the zzso experiments with the some typical zzso zzso zzso buffers on pH zzso zzso zzso The results achieved zzso have evident zzso to the development of moving reaction boundary and zzso
