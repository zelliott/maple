zzso fast zzso imaging zzso zzso is frequently zzso by motion in pediatric zzso MR imaging with periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction zzso employs alternate sampling of zzso to achieve motion zzso 

To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso for: zzso image zzso zzso presence of zzso and zzso ability to detect zzso 

zzso pediatric patients undergoing brain zzso zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three independent zzso rated zzso zzso and zzso zzso assessing image quality, presence of zzso and diagnostic zzso zzso analysis and zzso signed rank test were used to assess the zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated better image quality and reduced motion zzso with the greatest benefit in children younger than 6 zzso Although detection rates were comparable for the two zzso blood products were more conspicuous on zzso zzso zzso confidence was higher using zzso zzso in children younger than 6 zzso Average zzso agreement was zzso 

zzso zzso showed reduced motion zzso and improved diagnostic confidence in children younger than 6 zzso Thus, use of zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso should be considered in routine imaging of this age group, with caution required in identifying blood zzso
