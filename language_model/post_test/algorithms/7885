zzso is a dynamic process in which a cell searches the environment and translates acquired information into zzso zzso In particular, zzso migration during development is accomplished by two distinct zzso the extension of zzso tipped with growth zzso and nucleus zzso termed zzso The primary purpose of our study is to investigate zzso branching and zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is accurately modeled by a zzso system and that zzso branching is independent of the zzso event, and displays the dynamics of a zzso zzso zzso This is in contrast to traditional biological descriptions, which suggest a closer relationship between the two migratory zzso Our models are validated on independent data sets acquired using two different imaging zzso and are shown to be robust to zzso in guidance cues and cellular migratory mechanisms, through treatment with zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso We zzso that the zzso branch dynamics exhibited by zzso undergoing zzso migration permit efficient exploration of the zzso
