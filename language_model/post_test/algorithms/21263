Two mechanisms have been zzso for the formation of bound zzso intermediate during the zzso zzso reductive zzso of zzso one involves the zzso attack of zzso on a zzso bound Schiff base in the zzso complex, and the other involves the reaction of zzso with the zzso group of zzso in the zzso zzso We have measured the rates of zzso oxygen exchange in the complex to zzso distinguish between these two zzso We find that the loss of label in the zzso zzso zzso complex is at least zzso times slower than the rate of the reductive zzso zzso zzso the former mechanism cannot be zzso We also find that zzso the zzso oxygen exchange in free zzso proceeds without any significant zzso by its zzso zzso zzso this exchange reaction has energy parameters which are comparable to those observed for the zzso of simple zzso zzso and zzso the zzso oxygen exchange in bound zzso is slower than that in the free zzso acid over a wide pH zzso We conclude that the oxygen exchange in the free and bound zzso must occur via a zzso zzso The observation that the zzso zzso the reaction of water with zzso while it zzso the reaction of zzso with the same zzso acid points to an extraordinary recognition of zzso by the zzso We interpret this observation by assuming that the zzso complex exists in two forms, a zzso form which is produced rapidly upon mixing the components together and an unstable form which is produced in trace amounts from the zzso form via a zzso zzso These two forms are presumed to differ in the spatial relationship of the zzso group to the zzso functional zzso The zzso group in the unstable form is assumed to be surrounded by the same zzso groups as the zzso zzso is in the bound zzso zzso We ascribe the remarkable zzso of the zzso reaction and the zzso of the water reaction by the zzso to the opposing interactions of the zzso and zzso groups with these surrounding zzso zzso
