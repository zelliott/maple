We describe characterization of zzso from tumor tissue targeted with a zzso ultrasound contrast agent in zzso using zzso of zzso zzso We apply these zzso characteristics to detection of tumor zzso in tumors implanted in zzso nude mice, which were zzso using a research ultrasound scanner over a zzso period after injection of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso Images were constructed from zzso ultrasound using two different zzso fundamental zzso imaging and a signal receiver based on a zzso analog zzso The study shows that the zzso analog is capable of detecting differences in zzso signals that are not apparent with the zzso zzso
