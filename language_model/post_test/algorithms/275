To evaluate and compare the retinal nerve fiber layer zzso measurement zzso diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for glaucoma zzso and strength of the zzso association obtained with a zzso optical zzso zzso zzso device zzso zzso Carl zzso zzso zzso Dublin, zzso and a zzso zzso device zzso zzso Carl zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso normal subjects and 83 glaucoma zzso 

One eye from each subject was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sixteen and 31 normal eyes were selected randomly to evaluate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The agreement of zzso zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was examined with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso The association between average zzso thickness and visual field sensitivity was evaluated with a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso nerve fiber layer measurement zzso zzso and zzso of determination zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and average zzso thicknesses were lower in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso with significant differences at 1, 3, 4, and 8 to 11 o'clock zzso or zzso There were zzso biases of zzso zzso between the 2 zzso zzso The difference of zzso thicknesses increased with the zzso The average zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso thicknesses demonstrated the greatest zzso in both zzso devices with no significant difference detected between the respective zzso zzso or zzso The strength of the zzso association was comparable between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso devices zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Although the diagnostic performance and the strength of the zzso association were comparable between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated lower measurement zzso compared with zzso zzso with significant differences at 1, 3, 4, and 8 to 11 zzso The poor agreement was likely related to the different inherent characteristics of the 2 zzso zzso
