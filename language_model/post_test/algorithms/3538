zzso a highly selective zzso zzso used for short-term sedation of mechanically zzso patients, has minimal effect on zzso 

This study compared the respiratory effect of zzso to that of zzso The authors measured and compared respiratory responses of six healthy male volunteers during zzso a zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso a zzso zzso infusion of zzso and zzso a zzso sleep zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso infusions resulted in respiratory depression as evidenced by a decrease in respiratory rate and minute zzso respiratory zzso and zzso episodes resulting in zzso zzso disturbed the natural pattern of breathing and flattened the distribution of zzso timing zzso zzso cycle zzso The respiratory effects of zzso markedly contrasted with those of zzso When compared with zzso during zzso zzso the respiratory rate significantly increased, and the overall zzso index significantly zzso The distribution of zzso zzso cycle time showed an increased zzso In addition, zzso seemed to mimic some aspect of natural zzso While the subjects were breathing a zzso CO2 mixture, zzso zzso phenomena zzso by the zzso Index, the zzso and sudden increase in the minute zzso were observed during zzso zzso Similar phenomena during natural sleep have been reported in the zzso 

In comparison with zzso zzso infusions zzso did not result in clinically significant respiratory depression, zzso decreased rather than increased the zzso index, and zzso exhibited some similarity with natural zzso
