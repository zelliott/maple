Large artery stiffening and wave reflections are independent zzso of adverse zzso To date, their assessment has been limited to zzso techniques and zzso A new, more practical method allowing assessment of central blood pressure from zzso recorded using a conventional automated zzso monitor has recently been validated in laboratory zzso However, the feasibility of this method in a community based setting has not been zzso 

zzso peripheral and central zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso and pulse zzso and wave reflection parameters zzso pressure (AP) and index, zzso were obtained from zzso volunteers in an Austrian community setting using a zzso like method zzso zzso and from zzso recorded with a regular zzso zzso We assessed these parameters for known differences and associations according to gender and age zzso from zzso years to zzso years in the whole population and a subset with a zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso 

We obtained zzso measures of peripheral and central zzso zzso and zzso zzso Age and gender associations with central zzso and zzso parameters reflected those previously established from reference standard zzso techniques under zzso zzso zzso were the same for patients with a zzso zzso below 140 zzso zzso zzso Lower values for zzso in the current study are possibly due to differences in sampling rates, detection frequency and/or averaging procedures and to lower numbers of volunteers in younger age zzso 

A novel zzso like algorithm, using zzso zzso zzso recordings, provides robust and feasible estimates of central zzso pressure and zzso in community-based zzso
