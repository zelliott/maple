The zzso dynamics of surface electromagnetic waves zzso on aluminum film zzso with zzso zzso of holes was studied in the visible spectral range by the technique of transient zzso with approximately 100 zzso time zzso We observed a pronounced zzso of the resonant transmission band that reveals the important role of plasma zzso in the optical response of zzso zzso The zzso is inconsistent with zzso mechanism of extraordinary transmission and points to the crucial role of interference in the formation of transmission zzso The transient zzso zzso were successfully modeled within the zzso equation approach for the zzso relaxation zzso involving zzso hot electrons and zzso zzso
