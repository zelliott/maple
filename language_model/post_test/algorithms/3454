This study examines various zzso criteria as potential sources of constraints that eliminate (or at least reduce the degree zzso mechanical zzso in zzso A model of zzso grasping mimicking the experimental conditions of zzso et zzso zzso zzso was developed and zzso zzso Several cost functions compared well with experimental data including zzso functions, zzso functions, and a zzso zzso zzso A tissue deformation function failed to predict finger zzso In the zzso literature, the zzso zzso zzso measure has been used to describe grasp zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso is an inappropriate measure for zzso zzso We introduce a new measure, the zzso safety zzso zzso which reduces to the zzso for vertical and zzso zzso It was found that a zzso zzso accounts for many of the finger force patterns that are observed when grasping an object oriented arbitrarily with respect to the gravity zzso It was hypothesized that, when determining finger forces, the zzso assumes that a zzso object is more slippery than it actually zzso An zzso friction zzso of approximately zzso of the actual zzso accounted for the offset between experimental and zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso an zzso strategy when zzso finger forces during zzso
