zzso DNA sequences into functional groups is an important problem in zzso We propose a new zzso algorithm, zzso based on a new distance measure, zzso for zzso gene zzso This method zzso DNA sequences into the feature zzso which contain the zzso location and order relation of zzso in DNA zzso zzso a zzso procedure is applied to zzso DNA sequences based on the feature zzso 

The proposed distance measure and zzso method are evaluated by zzso functionally related genes and by zzso zzso This method is also compared with zzso zzso and some zzso The experimental results show our method is effective in zzso DNA sequences with similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the zzso 

We introduced a novel zzso zzso which is based on a new sequence similarity zzso It is effective in zzso DNA sequences with similar biological characteristics and in discovering the relationship among the zzso
