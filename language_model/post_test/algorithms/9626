In the classic zzso of zzso zzso zzso two distinct descriptions of the imaging model have been employed for developing reconstruction zzso We demonstrate that the zzso and statistical properties of zzso zzso reconstruction zzso associated with each imaging model are generally very zzso Specifically, some zzso reconstruction zzso including many of the zzso zzso previously zzso do not work directly with the raw measured pressure zzso but rather with an integrated data function that is obtained by temporally zzso the zzso zzso The integration zzso the statistical distribution of the data, introducing statistical correlations among zzso This change is highly significant for zzso zzso many of which explicitly or implicitly seek to minimize a statistical cost zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso reconstruction by zzso zzso yields better zzso tradeoffs when working with the raw pressure data than with the integrated data commonly zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the zzso based approach is less sensitive to certain deterministic zzso such as zzso offset zzso
