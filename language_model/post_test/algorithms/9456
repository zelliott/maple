To meet the challenge of modeling the zzso dynamics of biological zzso over long time zzso much recent effort has been devoted to constructing zzso kinetic models, often in the form of zzso zzso models, from short molecular dynamics zzso To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose zzso space into a set of zzso zzso zzso Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of zzso zzso techniques which assume that zzso distinct clusters are also zzso zzso Here, we present a first version of an automatic zzso for the discovery of zzso zzso states that is generally zzso to zzso zzso Given molecular dynamics zzso initiated from a zzso starting distribution, the zzso discovers long lived, zzso zzso states through successive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso space into zzso related zzso The authors apply this method to three peptides in explicit zzso blocked zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the engineered zzso zzso zzso assess its ability to generate physically meaningful states and faithful kinetic zzso
