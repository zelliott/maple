zzso analyses of zzso data yield large data sets, which are zzso and have to be evaluated statistically without a large number of false positive zzso There exist several methods to deal with this problem in multiple zzso Knowing the number of true hypotheses increases the power of some multiple test procedures, however the number of true hypotheses is unknown, in general, and must be zzso In this paper, we derive two new multiple test procedures by using an upper bound for the number of true zzso Our first procedure controls the generalized zzso error rate, and thus is an improvement of the zzso procedure of zzso and Hoffmann zzso zzso Hoffmann zzso Controlled zzso zzso Bauer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The second new procedure controls the false discovery proportion and improves upon the approach of Lehmann and Romano zzso zzso Romano zzso zzso of the zzso error zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso simulations, we show how the gain in power depends upon the accuracy of the estimate of the number of true zzso The gain in power of our procedures is demonstrated in an example using zzso data on the processing of memorized zzso zzso
