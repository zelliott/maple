Now that many hundreds and even thousands of whole zzso have been zzso it is rare to be studying a target protein whose zzso acid sequence is not zzso However, it is still often necessary to obtain large amounts of the target protein for a variety of purposes including structural studies, drug discovery, zzso protein zzso and industrial zzso It would seem that knowing the zzso acid sequences would make it much easier to design an effective zzso of that zzso We examine in this chapter what you can and cannot predict from an zzso acid sequence and conclude that protein zzso is still largely an empirical zzso
