Although the UK cervical screening zzso has reduced mortality associated with invasive disease, advancement from a zzso zzso methodology that is cost-effective and robust could greatly support the current zzso We combined analysis by attenuated total reflection zzso infrared zzso of cervical zzso with zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso can cope with vast amounts of zzso data with variable zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of UK cervical specimens designated as normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or high-grade zzso zzso zzso and one further zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso 30 zzso samples, we set out to determine whether this approach could be robustly zzso zzso extending the training set consisting of set A with set B data produced good zzso rates with three zzso cascade zzso However, a single zzso zzso was equally efficient, producing a zzso zzso methodology with improved zzso zzso better zzso with only one set of fuzzy zzso As data from set B were added zzso to the training set, the model learned and zzso Additionally, monitoring of results of the set B zzso specimens zzso to be zzso cervical zzso zzso provided the opportunity to explore the possibility of distinguishing patients likely to progress towards invasive zzso zzso exhibited a remarkably robust zzso power in a zzso fashion zzso high zzso ease of zzso compared to other zzso zzso zzso support zzso machines, artificial neural zzso Development of zzso to zzso such zzso for applications such as screening exhibits zzso in identifying a zzso marker of invasive disease zzso
