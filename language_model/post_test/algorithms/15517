The calculation of maximum likelihood zzso for related organisms using zzso data is zzso The problem is formulated so that the domain of zzso is a zzso zzso This is a feature shared by the travelling salesman problem, for which simulated zzso is known to be zzso Using this technique it is found that zzso can be reconstructed with minimal error using zzso data of a quality currently zzso In complex zzso accurate reconstruction can be done with no a zzso age or sex zzso For smaller numbers of individuals a method of efficiently enumerating all admissible zzso of zzso likelihood is zzso
