A stirred flow reactor was used to study the influence of zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso of copper in two acid zzso on granite and zzso The presence of P was found to significantly increase zzso zzso in both soils, albeit at different types of sites zzso in slow zzso sites in the soil on granite, and both in fast and slow zzso sites in that on zzso The increased zzso zzso at fast sites in the zzso soil was due to its high content in zzso zzso which bound P and released zzso as a result, thereby raising the pH and leading to a higher zzso capacity during fast zzso On the other hand, the increased zzso zzso at slow zzso sites was due to zzso acting as a bridging element between P and organic zzso
