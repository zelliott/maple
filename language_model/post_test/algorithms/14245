The zzso technique appears appropriate for zzso cardiac stroke volume zzso zzso as the zzso zzso distribution is altered during the cardiac cycle due to the heart contraction and blood zzso In the present work, the feasibility of a zzso electrical zzso zzso zzso for assessing the cardiac zzso was zzso An zzso model of the zzso was constructed from segmented zzso zzso images along 19 zzso of the cardiac zzso The heart was simulated as an zzso with its zzso lengths set as the reconstruction zzso while all other zzso geometry and zzso values were kept zzso A zzso zzso zzso scheme was zzso yielding a correlation between the reconstructed and anatomical left zzso volumes of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso An analysis of noise sensitivity showed that the proposed zzso requires an zzso greater than 65 zzso The simulation results were compared to physical data, collected with a portable zzso system zzso zzso The validation study was employed for a group of N zzso 28 healthy patients, and a comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was made, showing a correlation of r zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso The preliminary results demonstrate that zzso zzso has the potential to measure zzso and may be zzso for both clinical and home environment zzso
