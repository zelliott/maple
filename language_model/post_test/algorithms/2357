The rehabilitation of the knee with a deficient anterior cruciate ligament zzso always presents a great zzso zzso assessment allows muscle performance to be zzso The zzso device, introduced by Johnson, has the distinct advantage of minimizing the anterior translation force during zzso zzso In a previous report, there was a significant difference between the Johnson double pad zzso device and the standard single pad device in knee zzso The main purpose of this study was to define a correlation equation such that data generated in the use of the two different devices can be compared for zzso Ten subjects were tested with the zzso zzso zzso with a randomly selected sequence of test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and paired zzso tests zzso were performed to estimate the correlation and difference between the two zzso It is concluded that a significant difference in the data generated between the two devices indicated that a single device should be selected to carry out a series of comparisons on a particular zzso However, if the two devices are used in a series of zzso a set of correlation equations has been defined to facilitate such zzso The findings in this study will widen the application of comparison of zzso data in the quantitative approach of rehabilitation of the knee with a deficient anterior cruciate zzso
