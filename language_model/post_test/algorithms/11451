We propose an advanced zzso zzso zzso method capable of increasing the number of zzso zzso channels zzso Using only 4 control lines, the proposed advanced zzso zzso utilizing two different levels of control pressure, could address up to 19 zzso channels, which is at least two times larger than previous zzso The difference between the maximum zzso channels in the present and previous methods increases dramatically when the control lines and control pressure levels zzso The present zzso with its high control efficiency and simple structure for channel zzso could be used in the application areas of integrated zzso systems such as zzso zzso and dynamic pressure zzso
