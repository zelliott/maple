zzso are widely found in zzso They are characterized with different behaviors in clinical and molecular profiles, such as survival rates, gene signature and copy number aberrations zzso While cancer is generally believed to have been caused by genetic zzso the number of such events is tremendous in the cancer tissue and only a small subset of them may be zzso On the other hand, gene expression signature of a zzso represents zzso of the zzso cancer zzso Using zzso data to link these factors to define zzso boundaries and identify zzso drivers, is a promising yet largely unexplored zzso 

We report a systematic method to automate the identification of cancer zzso and candidate zzso Specifically, we propose an zzso zzso that zzso between gene expression zzso and gene signature zzso We applied the method to zzso of the pediatric zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso zzso consistently zzso on multiple zzso of zzso and the zzso signatures and copy number landscapes are also found to be highly zzso across the zzso Based on the identified zzso we developed a zzso approach for zzso identification of cancer zzso The top-ranked driver candidates are found to be enriched with known pathways in certain zzso of zzso This might reveal new zzso for these zzso 

Our study indicates that zzso defines the zzso zzso characterizes the zzso processes and can be used to prioritize zzso zzso
