A new methodology describing the effects of zzso and zzso zzso in volume holographic imaging systems zzso is zzso The zzso zzso are treated as an ensemble of localized zzso zzso using coupled wave methods in conjunction with sequential and zzso zzso techniques to accurately predict zzso zzso effects in zzso Our approach can be applied to zzso zzso zzso and used to theoretically predict the performance of zzso volume holographic zzso within a volume zzso for zzso We present simulation and experimental results for the zzso and zzso imaging zzso formed in zzso at zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso wave at zzso zzso zzso results based on our approach that can be easily implemented in zzso packages such as zzso are confirmed with experiments and show proof of consistency and usefulness of the proposed zzso
