We present a very efficient zzso method to calculate the effective optical response of zzso made up of arbitrarily shaped inclusions arranged in periodic zzso zzso We apply it to zzso particles embedded in a metal zzso with a lattice constant much smaller than the wavelength of the incident field, so that we may neglect zzso and factor the geometrical properties from the properties of the zzso If the conducting phase is continuous the low frequency behavior is zzso and if the conducting paths are thin, the high frequency behavior is zzso Thus, zzso bands may develop at intermediate zzso whose properties may be tuned by geometrical zzso
