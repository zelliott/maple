Are current zzso methods capable of building complexes from putative component protein zzso zzso of recent zzso studies, including those of the zzso zzso Assessment of zzso zzso competition, were used to determine the key properties for successful zzso and introduce a zzso of protein complexes based on zzso zzso zzso complexes could be determined with reasonable accuracy - possibly to within a few alternative zzso zzso for zzso pairs are less zzso and data for small signaling complexes are generally zzso However, moderate amounts of experimental data can remove uncertainty and the methodology is rapidly zzso zzso complexes with large interface areas undergo substantial zzso change and are beyond the reach of current zzso zzso The zzso of such complexes might therefore require fundamentally new zzso
