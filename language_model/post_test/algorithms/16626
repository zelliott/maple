Having capabilities for the simulation of the radiation field in suspensions of zzso constitutes a great asset for the analysis, zzso and zzso of zzso In this study, a combined experimental and zzso procedure is zzso specifically devised for the assessment of the zzso of zzso and zzso needed for the simulation of such zzso The experimental procedure consists in measuring the radiant energy transmitted through samples of suspensions of zzso of different biomass zzso as well as the forward and backward scattered zzso At a microscopic level, suspensions of zzso are complex zzso media and due to this complexity, in this study they are modeled as a zzso with centers of zzso and scattering randomly distributed throughout its zzso This model was tested on suspensions of two zzso species of dissimilar cell zzso Chlorella zzso and zzso zzso The zzso Carlo simulation zzso developed in this study, when used as a supporting zzso of a main zzso program based on a genetic algorithm, permits the assessment of the physical parameters of the radiation field zzso The zzso Carlo zzso simulates the experiments, zzso the events that photons can undergo while they zzso through culture samples or at its physical zzso
