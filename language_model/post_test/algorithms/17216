zzso models in zzso are often quite zzso Such models are typically most easily fit using zzso methods, which can often be implemented using simulation zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso methods are an important set of tools for such zzso We give an overview and references of this rapidly emerging technology along with a relatively simple zzso zzso techniques can be viewed as extensions of zzso zzso techniques, but with random jumps rather than zzso at each zzso Special care is needed when implementing zzso zzso procedures rather than zzso methods, and even more care is needed with zzso simulation zzso it is substantially more difficult to monitor convergence to a distribution than to a zzso The most reliable zzso of zzso build upon results from simpler models fit using combinations of zzso zzso and zzso simulations, so that the user has a rough idea of the location and scale of the zzso distribution of the quantities of interest under the more complicated zzso These concerns with zzso however, should not deter the zzso from using zzso methods, but rather help to ensure wise use of these powerful zzso
