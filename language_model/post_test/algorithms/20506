This study examined whether hospital zzso varied among the frail elderly in managed care versus zzso zzso zzso 

Random sample of 450 patients, aged 65 and over, from a large vertically integrated health care system in San Diego, zzso Participants were receiving zzso home health and survived and zzso follow-up zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso analyses were used to conduct comparisons of zzso and preventable zzso by plan zzso Two methods to identify preventable zzso were developed, one based on a computerized zzso of service use patterns, and another based on blind clinical zzso 

The odds of having a preventable hospital zzso within 90 days of an index admission were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso times as high for Medicare zzso zzso compared to Medicare zzso participants, depending on the method used to assess zzso zzso patterns were similar for Medicare zzso zzso and zzso study participants zzso enrolled in Medicare and zzso 

In this group of frail elderly Medicare beneficiaries, those enrolled in an zzso were more likely to have a preventable hospital zzso than those receiving care under zzso These results suggest that policies promoting stringent approaches to zzso control zzso early hospital zzso reduced levels of zzso care, and restricted use of home health zzso may be problematic for the frail zzso
