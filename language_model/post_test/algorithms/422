The aim of this work is to predict zzso if an zzso episode zzso spontaneously or not by analyzing the increase of zzso activity organization prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sample zzso was selected as zzso organization zzso zzso zzso signals were used to evaluate the notable impact of noise in AA organization zzso Three strategies to reduce noise, zzso zzso and enhance the zzso activity main features were zzso The best prediction results were obtained through main zzso wave zzso organization zzso The zzso can be considered as the fundamental zzso associated to the zzso The zzso of the terminating and zzso analyzed zzso episodes were correctly zzso zzso it can be concluded that the zzso zzso analysis from the surface zzso is a reliable and useful tool to predict spontaneous zzso zzso
