We studied the frequency distribution of zzso zzso 10 zzso long in a sample of zzso zzso zzso bases of genes from zzso zzso made of zzso sequences extracted from zzso zzso with the aim of detecting zzso control zzso Among all zzso zzso zzso had a frequency 10 times higher than the mean and were subjected to further statistical zzso For each of the zzso zzso zzso we counted the individual zzso of the 30 zzso differing from the parent by one base zzso zzso and we calculated two zzso zzso squares for the zzso with and without the parent zzso By studying the distribution of the ratio between the two zzso squares we observed that out of zzso zzso that occurred zzso 10 times more frequently than average, zzso had a zzso square ratio of between 1 and zzso in this final set, which zzso to zzso zzso of all possible zzso 75 zzso were found to contain 100 zzso control zzso like zzso and zzso The final set contains a high excess of signals when compared to 100 random sets of zzso zzso Some of the zzso selected with the procedure are members of consensus sequences rather than unique zzso
