A fast zzso lifetime imaging zzso system is developed that can acquire images at a rate of hundreds of frames per zzso The zzso system is based on a zzso microscope equipped with a zzso intensified zzso detector and a zzso zzso The zzso detector acquires the signals from two time gates simultaneously and is therefore insensitive to movements of the zzso and zzso The system is well suited for quantitative biological zzso experiments and its performance is evaluated in calcium imaging experiments on beating zzso rat zzso Several calcium sensitive zzso are characterized and tested for their suitability for fast zzso zzso Oregon Green zzso zzso Oregon Green zzso zzso and Oregon Green zzso zzso zzso the sensitivity range of these zzso is shifted to low calcium zzso when used as lifetime zzso zzso and zzso behave very similarly and can be used for zzso calcium imaging in the range 1 to approximately 500 zzso and zzso can be used up to 3 zzso The fast zzso experiments on the zzso could be carried out at a zzso frame zzso During the beating of the zzso a lifetime change of about zzso is zzso From the lifetime images a rest calcium level of about 65 zzso is zzso
