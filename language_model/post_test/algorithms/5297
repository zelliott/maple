With the advent of the zzso technology, the field of life science has been greatly zzso since this technique allows the simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of thousands of genes in a particular zzso However, the statistical analysis of expression data has its own challenges, primarily because of the huge amount of data that is to be dealt with, and also because of the presence of noise, which is almost an inherent characteristic of zzso zzso zzso is one tool used to mine meaningful patterns from zzso zzso In this paper, we present a novel method of zzso zzso zzso data, which is robust and yet simple to zzso It identifies the best clusters from a given zzso on the basis of the population of the clusters as well as the zzso of the feature values of the members from the zzso It has been found to yield satisfactory results even in the presence of noisy zzso
