The diffusion of molecules through uniform homogeneous materials can readily be described by zzso motion or zzso zzso The further zzso of these models to describe molecular diffusion through zzso and zzso zzso is much less zzso zzso zzso zzso of the generalized zzso equation zzso have earlier been developed satisfying the zzso relationship in zzso limits while exhibiting somewhat complex behavior away from zzso This zzso representation should be capable of describing the diffusion of a particle through a zzso suspension whose average particle size is tuned by an external driving force such as zzso A simple particle model of such a process involves the motion of a zzso particle in an explicit environment of swelling hard zzso The zzso zzso functions observed in a large number of simulations of the particle model under various swelling rates agree precisely with those of a single form of the zzso zzso zzso Though this procedure is not an explicit projection of the mechanical system onto the zzso zzso it does show that the latter correctly describes the dynamics of the projected zzso diffusion of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso models lead to behavior reminiscent of zzso processes at packing zzso substantially below that of the glass zzso
