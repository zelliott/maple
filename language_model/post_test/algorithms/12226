Rival penalized competitive learning zzso has been shown to be a useful tool for zzso on a set of sample data in which the number of clusters is zzso However, the zzso zzso was proposed zzso and is still in lack of a mathematical theory to describe its convergence zzso In order to solve the convergence problem, we investigate it via a zzso zzso By theoretical analysis, we prove that a general form of zzso called zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of a cost function on the weight zzso of a competitive learning zzso As a zzso process decreases the cost to a local zzso a number of weight zzso eventually fall into a zzso surrounding the sample data, while the other weight zzso diverge to zzso Moreover, it is shown by the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments that if the cost reduces into the global zzso a correct number of weight zzso is automatically selected and located around the centers of the actual zzso zzso Finally, we apply the zzso zzso to zzso color image zzso and zzso of the wine zzso
