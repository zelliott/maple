A new Collaborative zzso for zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso is introduced for the processing of zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso zzso is designed to be robust for low zzso ratio zzso conditions typically encountered when imaging deep in scattering biological zzso Based on an zzso zzso means filter involving the comparison of filtered patches, zzso locally adapts the amount of smoothing in order to deal with the noise zzso inherent to laser scanning zzso zzso zzso An extensive validation on synthetic data, images acquired on zzso and in zzso images is zzso These experiments show that the zzso filter obtained competitive results compared to a state-of-the-art method and a locally zzso zzso zzso means zzso especially under low zzso conditions zzso Finally, the deeper imaging capabilities enabled by the proposed filter are demonstrated on deep tissue in zzso images of zzso and fine zzso processes in the zzso zzso zzso
