zzso models allow zzso of the probability zzso that zzso sickness zzso will occur in any particular zzso Our objective is to provide zzso estimates for zzso diving instructions used by the zzso Navy and various other zzso To do so, we develop zzso zzso and zzso zzso models using zzso data from the zzso Navy zzso zzso We give special attention to zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso than 40 zzso with bottom times between 4 zzso and one zzso for which experimental zzso are zzso According to our models, probability of zzso is zzso or less for current zzso Navy zzso air dive schedules and near zzso for the navies of Great Britain, Canada, and zzso also the current zzso Navy prescriptions for zzso zzso seem to be zzso Our zzso models fail for deep zzso they do not avoid observed zzso cases in the zzso zzso and provide longer zzso times than allowed by tables used zzso we advocate prescriptions by our deterministic model for deep zzso zzso
