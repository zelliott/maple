zzso tag zzso gene expression analysis is potent for the identification of candidate genes relevant to the zzso zzso With the public availability of zzso data, the zzso approaches for zzso expressed zzso which are mainly based on zzso or zzso distribution, become practical and important in cancer zzso It remains a permanent need to select a proper statistical model for these zzso In this study, we developed a novel zzso zzso method, Electronic zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso in which a statistical model was determined by geometric averaging of 12 common zzso zzso zzso identified a set of zzso expressed genes in zzso breast and zzso zzso by using zzso available zzso Analysis of Gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene expression zzso analysis and quantitative reverse zzso real-time zzso demonstrated the effectiveness of this zzso We conclude that current zzso of zzso provides a new insight into zzso digital zzso in cancer zzso
