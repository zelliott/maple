A novel theoretical framework for analyzing zzso zzso is zzso This approach, called the method of moments, is an extension of zzso cable theory for zzso It provides zzso investigation of zzso zzso signal zzso and synchronization problems in passive zzso zzso In this method, the various moments of a transient signal are used to characterize the properties of the zzso The strength of the signal is measured by the time integral of the zzso its characteristic time is determined by its zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of the signal is determined by a measure similar to the standard zzso in probability zzso Using these signal properties, the method of moments provides zzso expressions, and efficient zzso for analyzing the zzso response in arbitrary passive zzso The method yields new insights into zzso integration, coincidence detection mechanisms, and the properties of local interactions between synaptic zzso in zzso zzso The method can also be used for matching zzso zzso models to experimental data and for the analysis of synaptic zzso recorded zzso
