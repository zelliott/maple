This paper presents a method for designing zzso suppression systems that achieve a specified reduction in pathological zzso power through controlling the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rate, and acceleration feedback are examined and two techniques for the selection of feedback zzso are zzso Both techniques seek a desired zzso zzso frequency response and require the development of zzso zzso models through system zzso The design techniques were used to develop a zzso suppression system that was subsequently evaluated using human zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso suppression systems that zzso zzso control to achieve a specified reduction in zzso power can be successfully designed when accurate zzso zzso models are zzso
