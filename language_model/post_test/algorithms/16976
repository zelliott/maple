Fetal growth restriction and zzso are both conditions of zzso zzso and associated to increased risk for the long-term development of cardiovascular disease in the zzso At zzso zzso is associated with maternal global zzso dysfunction, which is determined, at least in part, by increased zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that women with zzso fetal zzso zzso also exhibit global zzso zzso This was a prospective zzso study conducted over a zzso period involving 29 zzso fetal zzso zzso 25 zzso with fetal growth restriction zzso and 58 matched control zzso Women were assessed by conventional zzso and tissue zzso imaging at diagnosis of the complication and zzso at 12 weeks zzso Fetal zzso zzso are characterized by a lower cardiac index and higher total vascular resistance index than expected for zzso Compared with controls, fetal zzso pregnancy was associated with significantly increased prevalence zzso of zzso left zzso zzso dysfunction zzso versus zzso and widespread impaired zzso relaxation zzso versus zzso Unlike zzso cardiac geometry and intrinsic zzso zzso were preserved in fetal zzso zzso Fetal zzso zzso are characterized by a low zzso high resistance circulatory state, as well as a higher prevalence of zzso global zzso dysfunction and poor cardiac zzso These findings may explain the increased long-term cardiovascular risk in these women who have had fetal zzso zzso Further studies are needed to clarify the zzso natural history of cardiac dysfunction in these zzso
