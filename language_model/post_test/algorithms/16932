We consider the problem of finding a zzso in a given biological network zzso target zzso that is most similar to a given small query zzso We aim to find the optimal solution zzso the zzso with the largest alignment zzso with a zzso confidence zzso There is no known zzso time solution to this problem in the zzso Alon et zzso has developed a state-of-the-art coloring method that reduces the cost of this zzso This method randomly colors the target network prior to alignment for many zzso until a zzso confidence is zzso Here we develop a novel coloring method, named zzso coloring zzso is a positive zzso that achieves a zzso confidence value in a small number of zzso without sacrificing the zzso Our method considers the color assignments already made in the neighborhood of each target network zzso while assigning a color to a zzso This way, it zzso avoids many color assignments that are guaranteed to fail to produce the optimal zzso We also develop a filtering method that eliminates the zzso that cannot be aligned without reducing the alignment score after each coloring zzso We demonstrate both theoretically and zzso that our coloring method zzso that of Alon et zzso which is also used by a number network alignment methods, including zzso and zzso by a factor of three without reducing the confidence in the zzso of the zzso Our experiments also suggest that the resulting alignment method is capable of identifying functionally enriched regions in the target network zzso
