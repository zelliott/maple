The zzso relationship of many sensory zzso is zzso but fully zzso this relationship by a complex zzso model may require too much data to be zzso zzso Here we present a theoretical study of a general zzso zzso method that may help to significantly reduce the number of stimuli needed to obtain an accurate mathematical description of zzso neural zzso Our method of active data collection first zzso generates stimuli that are optimal for zzso the parameters of competing zzso models and then uses these estimates to generate stimuli online that are optimal for discriminating these zzso We applied our method to simple zzso circuit models, including zzso networks built on the zzso or zzso receptive fields, and confirmed that collecting data using our zzso zzso zzso was far more effective for zzso and comparing competing zzso sensory processing models than standard zzso methods using random zzso
