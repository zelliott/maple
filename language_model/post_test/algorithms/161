We present zzso for zzso zzso of general zzso distorted zzso By this, we understand cameras that have a distortion center and an optical axis such that the projection rays of zzso lying on a circle centered on the distortion center form a right viewing cone centered on the optical zzso The camera is said to have a single viewpoint zzso if all such viewing cones have the same zzso (the optical zzso otherwise, we speak of zzso zzso This model encompasses the classical zzso distortion model zzso zzso and most central or zzso zzso zzso zzso consists in the zzso of the distortion center, the opening angles of all viewing cones, and their optical zzso We present two approaches of computing a full zzso from dense zzso of a single or multiple planes with known zzso zzso The first one is based on a geometric constraint linking viewing cones and their zzso with the zzso plane zzso zzso The second approach is a zzso zzso zzso using simulated and a broad variety of real cameras show great zzso Furthermore, we provide a comparison with zzso zzso zzso which, however, cannot handle such a broad variety of camera zzso showing similar zzso
