zzso processes of zzso and zzso integration link perception and action, forming the basis for human interaction with the zzso zzso perception, the ability to extract object features through action, is based on these zzso To study the development of zzso integration, children judged the zzso of virtual objects after exploring them actively or while guided passively by a zzso zzso acuity reached adult levels only at early zzso Unlike in adults, zzso precision in children was consistently lower during active exploration when compared to passive zzso Thus, the exploratory movements themselves constitute a form of noise for the developing zzso system that younger brains cannot compensate until zzso zzso this is consistent with a noisy zzso copy mechanism producing imprecise predicted sensory feedback, which compromises zzso precision in children, while the mature mechanism aids the adult brain to account for the effect of zzso motion on zzso
