Several investigators have pointed out the possibility of using zzso diagnosis zzso schemes, as second readers, to help zzso in the interpretation of zzso One of the most important aspects to be considered when the diagnostic imaging systems are analyzed is the evaluation of their diagnostic zzso To perform this task, receiver operating characteristic zzso are the method of zzso An important step in nearly all zzso systems is the reduction of false zzso as well as the zzso of zzso using different zzso such as neural networks or feature analysis, and several statistical zzso A statistical model more often employed is linear zzso analysis zzso However, zzso implies several limitations in the type of variables that it can zzso In this work, we have developed a novel approach, based on generalized additive models zzso as an alternative to zzso which can deal with a broad variety of zzso improving the results produced by using the zzso zzso As an application, we have used zzso techniques for reducing the number of false zzso in a computerized method to detect clustered zzso and we have compared this with the results obtained when zzso was zzso zzso zzso the system achieved a sensitivity of zzso at a zzso rate of zzso false zzso per zzso With the zzso the sensitivity increased to zzso and zzso false zzso per zzso
