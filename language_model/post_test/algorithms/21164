zzso zzso measurement has been increasingly used for iron zzso to assess the risk of cardiac complications in zzso zzso In this study the noise effects were evaluated along with different zzso models on an iron overloaded ex zzso heart in order to determine the optimal method of zzso measurement and to help understand issues affecting zzso and zzso zzso zzso short axis images were acquired with differing numbers of zzso to generate varying zzso ratio zzso zzso A noise correction method was zzso linear and zzso zzso zzso were compared and different zzso models zzso zzso baseline zzso and zzso were zzso This study suggests that the zzso zzso curve in an ex zzso heart can be fitted by a zzso model and accurate zzso zzso can be obtained with proper noise zzso With zzso noise, zzso is generally overestimated by including late low zzso data points, but underestimated by the offset or baseline zzso models, which are in fact zzso In this situation the zzso model proves to be zzso and more accurate than the other zzso The study also shows that the zzso zzso is preferred in zzso curve zzso
