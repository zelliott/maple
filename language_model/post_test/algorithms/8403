We describe zzso of lateral diffusion in zzso using resonance energy zzso The donor was a zzso zzso zzso complex zzso which displays a donor zzso time near 3 zzso The long donor lifetime resulted in an ability to measure lateral diffusion zzso below zzso zzso The donor zzso data were analyzed using a new zzso zzso for calculation of resonance energy transfer for donors and zzso randomly distributed in two zzso An zzso solution to the diffusion equation in two dimensions is not known, so the equation was solved by the relaxation method in zzso zzso This zzso allows the donor zzso in the absence of energy transfer to be zzso The simulations show that mutual lateral diffusion zzso of the donor and zzso on the order of zzso zzso are readily recovered from the zzso data with donor zzso times on the zzso zzso zzso the lateral diffusion zzso and zzso zzso can be recovered independently despite correlation between these zzso This zzso was tested and verified using the donor zzso of a long lifetime zzso zzso donor and a Texas zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at 10 degrees C to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at 35 degrees zzso These results demonstrated the possibility of direct zzso of lateral diffusion zzso using zzso zzso time zzso
