zzso zzso imaging zzso has been successfully used to image the human brain and spinal cord, although there is still controversy as to which zzso diffusion zzso produce the greatest contrast and provide the best anatomical representation of gray and white matter within the spinal zzso The aim of this study was to determine the best diffusion zzso for use in the spinal zzso using the zzso index, zzso analysis, and opinion data in the form of a zzso zzso of the entire spinal zzso zzso was performed on five zzso intact human subjects at zzso zzso mean zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso volume ratio zzso relative zzso zzso and measured zzso zzso of zzso with respect to mean zzso were calculated from the diffusion zzso zzso for white matter zzso and gray matter zzso were extracted using zzso zzso The zzso index indicated zzso and zzso provided significant contrast between zzso and zzso Since the zzso was used for zzso results appeared to be biased toward zzso and zzso highly correlated with zzso zzso analysis illustrated similar results, but area under the zzso curve did not show statistical significance between zzso The survey indicated that the zzso of the primary zzso with respect to mean zzso zzso was significantly better than all other zzso at representing underlying spinal zzso zzso This is consistent with previous results showing lack of detail in zzso gray matter regions using the zzso zzso indicate zzso and zzso provide the highest contrast and most accurate representation of underlying zzso zzso
