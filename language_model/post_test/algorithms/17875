In this paper, a new active visual system is developed, which is based on zzso vision and is insensitive to the property of the zzso The system consists of a mechanical platform and two zzso The mechanical platform has two degrees of freedom of motion in pitch and zzso which is equivalent to the neck of a zzso zzso The cameras are mounted on the zzso The directions of the optical axes of the two cameras can be simultaneously adjusted in opposite zzso With these motions, the zzso images can be located at the centers of the image planes of the two zzso The zzso position is determined with the geometry information of the visual zzso A more general model for active visual positioning using two cameras without a neck is also zzso The position of an object can be zzso via the active zzso The presented model is less sensitive to the intrinsic parameters of cameras, which promises more flexibility in many applications such as visual tracking with zzso zzso Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
