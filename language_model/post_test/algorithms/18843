We describe a fast and accurate zzso zzso for the prediction of loop zzso in zzso The procedure includes extensive sampling of backbone zzso side chain addition, the use of a statistical potential to select a subset of these zzso and, finally, an energy zzso and ranking with an zzso force zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso used in the previously developed zzso program is successful in generating an ensemble of zzso that on average are closer to the native zzso than those generated by other zzso An important feature of zzso zzso is that it checks for interactions between the loop and the rest of the protein during the loop closure zzso zzso is found to be a particularly effective statistical potential that can bias zzso space toward zzso that are close to the native zzso Its application as a filter prior to a full molecular mechanics energy zzso both improves prediction accuracy and offers a significant savings in computer zzso Final scoring is based on the zzso force field implemented in the zzso zzso The approach is also shown to be quite successful in predicting loop zzso for cases where the native side chain zzso are assumed to be unknown, suggesting that it will prove effective in real zzso modeling zzso
