zzso narrative guidelines into a zzso zzso is still a bottleneck in the development of zzso zzso Our goal was to support this step by providing zzso templates for representing zzso knowledge using clinical zzso that are appropriate for particular zzso zzso 

We analyzed guidelines taken from the zzso of screening and zzso guidelines to find zzso clinical zzso and structured them as design templates to support zzso of these guidelines in a zzso zzso To find guidelines for analysis and zzso we zzso searched the National zzso zzso for screening guidelines in internal medicine, that have a clinical algorithm, and which were published during zzso and zzso used adult and childhood zzso guidelines developed by Center of Disease Control and Prevention zzso and the Institute for Clinical Systems zzso 

We developed two visual templates that structure screening guidelines as zzso of zzso steps used for screening and data collection and used them to represent the guidelines zzso We validated the zzso of the screening templates by executing a screening zzso in a zzso zzso We validated the zzso of zzso templates by writing code that, based on represented knowledge, zzso zzso due dates and by creating an zzso that translates the knowledge into zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated that our templates could be effectively applied to screening and zzso guidelines to produce zzso representations using zzso zzso
