zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a zzso group, often sharing overlapping zzso and zzso features posing a dilemma in accurate zzso The objective of this study was to correlate zzso zzso and zzso zzso diagnosis to help guide a diagnostic zzso 

zzso analysis of 60 zzso zzso between 1994 and zzso 

The mean age was zzso years with average follow-up of zzso zzso The preliminary zzso diagnosis was zzso in 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso in 5 zzso and OF in 3 zzso zzso The diagnosis was indeterminate in 21 zzso zzso Management consisted of zzso in 29 zzso observation in 17 zzso and biopsy in 14 zzso zzso For patients undergoing zzso or zzso positive zzso value of zzso zzso was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for OF zzso For the indeterminate zzso most common zzso diagnoses for 21 patients included zzso in 4 zzso arrested zzso in 3 zzso OF in 3 zzso and zzso in 2 zzso For zzso vs OF cases, 3 underwent surgery, revealing zzso zzso and OF in 1 patient zzso 

In this series, zzso correlation was high for zzso and zzso and low for OF and OF vs zzso This data suggests that patients with classic zzso characteristics of zzso and zzso may be observed, unless zzso is warranted based on clinical zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso OF vs zzso or indeterminate zzso may warrant a biopsy to establish firm diagnosis to guide definitive management, especially if zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is concerning for an aggressive zzso zzso
