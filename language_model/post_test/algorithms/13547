zzso zzso experiments often generate far more biological information than is required to test the experimental zzso Many zzso analyses are considered finished after differential expression and additional analyses are typically not performed, leaving untapped biological information left zzso This is especially true if the zzso experiment is from an ecological study of multiple zzso Comparisons across populations may also contain important zzso zzso and a subset of these zzso may be identified with zzso using techniques for the detection of single feature zzso zzso zzso are differences in zzso probe level zzso caused by genetic zzso such as zzso zzso and small zzso and not expression zzso In this study, we provide a new zzso for the detection of zzso evaluate the zzso using existing data from two publicly available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data sets and compare them to two previously published zzso detection zzso zzso show that our zzso provides more consistent and sensitive calling of zzso with a lower false discovery zzso zzso analysis of zzso and differential expression is a low-cost method for the enhanced analysis of zzso data, enabling additional biological zzso to be zzso
