The Solid Transportation Problem arises when bounds are given on three item zzso Usually, these properties are source, destination and mode of transport zzso and may be given in an zzso zzso This paper deals with solid transportation problems in which the data in the constraint set are expressed in an zzso form, zzso when sources, destinations and zzso have zzso values instead of point zzso An arbitrary linear or zzso objective function is also zzso To solve the problem, an zzso Algorithm which extends and zzso other approaches considering only point values, is zzso
