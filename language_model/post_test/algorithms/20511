The relationship between the mean pressure in the zzso generated in mechanical ventilation of the lungs zzso and normal zzso zzso is linear in zzso patients with severe bilateral acute zzso damage to the zzso Under conditions of mechanical ventilation of the lungs zzso with regulated volume, constant zzso pressure zzso and zzso pause zzso are effective methods for regulating zzso However, the efficacy of regulating zzso by zzso and IF for each clinical case is zzso The zzso of using zzso and IF for zzso the respiratory pattern in this category of patients is not clear, zzso The results indicate that zzso of zzso with controlled volume should be started with selecting the optimal level of zzso for each zzso The level of zzso should not be increased immediately at by of zzso zzso because the probability of compromising the zzso is higher in such a case than the probability of improving blood zzso Only after selecting the optimal zzso is it permissible to try to improve zzso zzso by zzso zzso because under such conditions the efficacy of prolonged inspiration is notably zzso Our data indicate that zzso no higher than zzso of the respiratory cycle zzso zzso zzso is the zzso A further increase of zzso gives rise to a tendency towards decrease of zzso zzso and oxygen transport to zzso
