The economic evaluation of any human zzso zzso vaccination strategy requires the measurement of clinical benefits zzso zzso zzso gained to reflect both the increase in life expectancy and the economic benefits associated with an effective zzso 

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of a standardized time zzso zzso procedure to zzso utilities loss in health states affected by zzso zzso in zzso 

This zzso retrospective, zzso zzso study was designed to elicit data on utilities in a cohort of women with a zzso confirmed diagnosis of high-grade cervical zzso zzso zzso An zzso for the computerized administration of a zzso questionnaire was developed for the standardized zzso of data on health utilities in zzso zzso zzso and invasive cervical zzso The European Quality of zzso zzso zzso questionnaire was used to assess the zzso baseline perception of their health zzso The correlation between utilities and age, time from zzso to questionnaire administration, and zzso score, was tested using the zzso rank correlation zzso zzso as a measure of zzso 

Of 42 enrolled patients, 36 responded zzso zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso The women's perception of their health state was high zzso zzso zzso score, zzso zzso The mean utility values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and invasive cervical cancer, zzso Based on zzso values, none of the 3 zzso zzso considered was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso was found among utilities zzso for zzso warts zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso this zzso was a limitation of this pilot study and was likely the result of the limited sample zzso 

Based on the findings from this pilot study, a zzso standardized procedure is expected to be feasible and appropriate for assessing utilities in patients affected by zzso diseases and for zzso analyses of cervical cancer prevention in zzso
