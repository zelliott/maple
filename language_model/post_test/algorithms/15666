A novel zzso for fast resolution of zzso overlapping nuclear magnetic resonance zzso spectrum using the zzso zzso and the immune zzso zzso is zzso Taking advantage of the linear property of the zzso transform zzso the overlapping zzso spectrum zzso can be compressed by zzso before it is input into the immune network, the zzso are also compressed to the same zzso After extraction of the compressed information of each zzso the resolved zzso zzso can be restored by the zzso zzso It was proven that the result is almost the same with the result from an zzso but the calculation speed is much zzso
