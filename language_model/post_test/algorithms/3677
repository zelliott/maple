zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising tool for monitoring zzso therapy in zzso Due to the limited data available, a standard imaging protocol for the prediction of zzso response has not yet been zzso The aim of this study was to compare commonly applied imaging protocols and calculations of the zzso zzso value zzso for the early prediction of zzso response to zzso 

zzso zzso PET scans of 43 patients with gastric zzso were zzso zzso All patients received two consecutive scans (one bed position at 40 zzso zzso and four bed positions at 90 zzso zzso at baseline and during the first cycle of zzso zzso Reconstruction of the images was performed by filtered zzso zzso and using an zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated with and without correction for the blood zzso level using zzso by body weight, body surface area and lean body zzso Relative percentage changes between zzso at baseline and follow-up were calculated and zzso for their potential to predict zzso response to chemotherapy zzso zzso Response was defined as less than zzso viable zzso cells in the zzso zzso obtained by surgery zzso weeks after the completion of zzso 

Eight of 43 patients were zzso zzso to zzso The percentage changes in zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for serial scans at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso versus zzso zzso in each zzso According to zzso analysis, neither the scan protocol nor correction for blood zzso significantly influenced the accuracy zzso zzso or the zzso value zzso zzso change in zzso zzso for the prediction of zzso zzso of zzso by body surface area or lean body mass instead of body weight yielded essentially identical zzso 

In gastric zzso the prediction of response to chemotherapy on the basis of relative zzso zzso changes is not essentially influenced by any of the zzso variations investigated zzso delay after zzso administration, acquisition zzso reconstruction algorithm, zzso of zzso This demonstrates the zzso of zzso PET for therapeutic monitoring and zzso the zzso of studies obtained at different institutions and with different zzso However, whichever method is used for therapy monitoring with zzso zzso a highly zzso protocol must be observed to take the dynamics of zzso zzso zzso into zzso
