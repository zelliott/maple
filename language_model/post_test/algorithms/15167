zzso systems based on functional electrical stimulation aim to restore motor function to individuals with paralysis following spinal zzso zzso zzso the optimal zzso set for the zzso is complicated because it depends on the characteristics of the individual (such as injury zzso the force capacities of the muscles, the movements the system aims to zzso and the hardware limitations zzso and type of zzso zzso An zzso method has been developed that uses a customized musculoskeletal zzso zzso zzso sets are created based on desired functional outcomes and the hard zzso limitations of the proposed zzso zzso simulations are performed to determine the proportion of target movements that can be accomplished with each set; the set that allows the most movements to be performed is chosen as the optimal zzso The technique is demonstrated here for a system recently developed by our research group to restore zzso movement to individuals with high-level zzso The optimal set included selective zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso single-channel cuffs for the zzso zzso upper zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the remaining zzso The importance of functional goals, hardware limitations, muscle and nerve zzso and surgical feasibility are zzso
