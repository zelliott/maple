zzso analysis between zzso modeling of zzso networks and data obtained from high zzso technology represents a worthy effort toward a holistic understanding of the link among zzso and zzso zzso Even though the theoretical foundation for modeling zzso network has been extensively treated elsewhere, the lack of kinetic information has limited the analysis in most of the zzso To overcome this zzso we present and illustrate a new statistical approach that has two purposes: integrate high zzso data and survey the general zzso mechanisms emerging for a slightly zzso zzso zzso 

This paper presents a statistic framework capable to study how and how fast the zzso participating in a zzso zzso network reach a zzso Instead of requiring accurate kinetic information, this approach uses high zzso zzso technology to define a feasible kinetic library, which constitutes the base for zzso statistical and zzso properties during the zzso For the sake of illustration we have applied this approach to the human Red blood cell metabolism zzso and its capacity to predict zzso phenomena was zzso zzso the main zzso properties obtained from a detailed kinetic model in zzso were recovered by our statistical zzso Furthermore, robust properties in time scale and zzso organization were identify and one concluded that they are a consequence of the combined performance of redundancies and zzso in zzso zzso 

In this work we present an approach that zzso high zzso zzso data to define the dynamic behavior of a slightly zzso zzso network where kinetic information is zzso Having information of zzso zzso at zzso this method has significant relevance due its potential scope to analyze others zzso scale zzso zzso Thus, I expect this approach will significantly contribute to explore the relationship between dynamic and physiology in other zzso zzso particularly those whose kinetic information is practically zzso For instances, I zzso that this approach can be useful in zzso medicine or zzso where the zzso of time scales and the identification of zzso organization may be crucial to characterize and identify zzso zzso
