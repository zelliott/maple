Recent experimental advances facilitate the collection of time series data that indicate which genes in a cell are zzso This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the zzso Typically, zzso analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of zzso and do not perform well on networks with tight zzso To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better zzso zzso This method first breaks up the data into zzso Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence zzso for each gene based upon the probability of the zzso expression increasing in the next time zzso These zzso are then combined to form new zzso with better zzso Finally, these influence zzso are zzso against each other to determine the final influence zzso for each zzso The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and zzso zzso zzso are reported for several synthetic networks with tight feedback showing significant improvements in recall and zzso over zzso dynamic zzso zzso Promising preliminary results are also reported for an analysis of experimental data for genes involved in the zzso cell zzso
