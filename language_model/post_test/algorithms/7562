In the manual control of a dynamic system, the human controller zzso often follows a visible and predictable reference zzso Compared with a purely feedback control strategy, performance can be improved by making use of this knowledge of the zzso The operator could effectively introduce zzso control in conjunction with a feedback path to compensate for zzso as hypothesized in zzso However, zzso behavior has never been identified from experimental data, nor have the hypothesized models been zzso This paper investigates human control behavior in pursuit tracking of a predictable reference signal while being zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso An experiment was done in which the relative strength of the target and zzso signals were systematically zzso The anticipated changes in control behavior were studied by means of an zzso model analysis and by fitting three zzso HC models: two different feedback models and a combined zzso and feedback zzso The zzso analysis shows that the experiment participants employed control action on both the error and the target zzso The control action on the target was similar to the inverse of the system zzso Model fits show that this behavior can be modeled best by the combined zzso and feedback zzso
