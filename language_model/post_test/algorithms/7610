Arab Americans constitute a large, heterogeneous, and quickly growing zzso in the United zzso Health statistics for this group are difficult to find because US governmental offices do not recognize Arab as separate from zzso The development and validation of an zzso and zzso name database will enhance research efforts in this population zzso 

A previously validated name database was supplemented with newly identified names gathered primarily from vital statistic records and then evaluated using a zzso zzso This process included 1) review by 4 zzso and zzso zzso 2) ethnicity assessment by social media searches, and 3) self-report of ancestry obtained from a telephone zzso 

Our zzso and zzso name zzso has a positive zzso value of 91 percent and a negative zzso value of 100 zzso 

This enhanced name database and zzso can be used to identify Arab Americans in health statistics data, such as cancer and hospital zzso where they are often coded as white, to determine the extent of health disparities in this zzso
