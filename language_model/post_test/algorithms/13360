zzso zzso signals have been frequently used to estimate human muscular zzso In the field of zzso zzso these methods provide valuable information to provide effectively support to the zzso However, their zzso is strongly limited by the necessity of complex zzso and zzso zzso procedures, which zzso their use to the laboratory zzso Nonetheless, an accurate estimate of muscle zzso could be unnecessary to provide effective movement assistance to zzso The natural ability of human central nervous system of adapting to external disturbances could compensate for a lower accuracy of the zzso provided by the robot and maintain the movement accuracy zzso while the effort is zzso In order to explore this possibility, in this paper we study the reaction of ten healthy subjects to the assistance provided through a zzso zzso control applied by an elbow powered zzso This system gives only a rough estimate of the user muscular zzso but does not require any specific zzso Experimental results clearly show that subjects adapt almost zzso to the assistance provided by the robot and can reduce their effort while keeping full control of the movement under different dynamic conditions zzso no zzso of movement accuracy are zzso
