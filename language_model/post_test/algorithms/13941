zzso of power zzso in a zzso oven for a range of zzso properties of relevance to food processing were zzso The governing Maxwell's equations with boundary conditions and a zzso zzso were solved using a finite element zzso Food properties were varied from values at their frozen state to values at high temperatures, as would be typical in a zzso zzso For zzso materials such as frozen foods, the high quality factor makes the heating significantly higher only when the size and shape of the load permit a zzso cavity resonance in the zzso Otherwise, the heating pattern will follow the modal electric field pattern of the zzso For moderate loss materials, the patterns will come from the modes of the zzso zzso The zzso of these modes are larger than the zzso situation and their overlap results in a heating pattern that is somewhat more zzso For zzso materials, the concept of modes is no longer useful as the very large number of modes strongly zzso The rapidly zzso field and power loss in the zzso material can probably be characterized as an exponential zzso
