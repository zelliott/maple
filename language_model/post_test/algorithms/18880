It has been found in in zzso experiments that zzso filaments driven by molecular zzso show finite diffusion in sliding motion even in the long filament limit zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1996, 70, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso 2005, 1, zzso This anomalous fluctuation can be evidence for zzso among the zzso in action because fluctuation should be averaged out for a long filament if the action of each motor is zzso In order to understand the nature of the fluctuation in molecular motors, we perform zzso simulations and analyze zzso correlation in three existing models that are known to show some kind of zzso and/or large diffusion zzso zzso the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, 75, zzso the zzso model zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994, 72, zzso and the Duke model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1999, 96, zzso It is shown that the zzso model and the Duke model do not give a finite diffusion in the long filament limit, in spite of the collective action of zzso On the other hand, the zzso model has been shown to give a diffusion zzso that is independent of filament zzso but it comes from the long time correlation whose time scale is zzso to filament zzso and our simulations show that such a long correlation time conflicts with the experimental time zzso We conclude that none of the three models represent experimental zzso In order to explain the observed anomalous zzso we have to search for a mechanism that will allow both the zzso and the time scale of the zzso correlation to be independent of the filament zzso
