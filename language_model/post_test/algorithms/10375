zzso the ever growing set of activity data for compounds against biological targets represents both a challenge and an opportunity for zzso virtual screening zzso Because zzso coupled receptors zzso represent a rich set of potential drug targets, we sought to develop an appropriate method to examine large sets of zzso zzso information for both screening collection enhancement and hit zzso To this end, we have implemented a modified version of zzso that removes highly correlated zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that a smaller, focused zzso set would improve performance, we have extended zzso by using a genetic zzso zzso to choose zzso zzso appropriate for selecting the set of 100 compounds most likely to be active from a decoy zzso We have called this method zzso zzso active space zzso We compared the zzso of zzso and zzso using a collection of activity data for 252 zzso sets versus two decoy zzso While both methods appear effective in zzso overall zzso performs better than zzso in the early selection of compounds against both decoy zzso
