Online machine learning rules and many biological zzso plasticity zzso learning rules generate jump process zzso chains for the synaptic zzso We give a zzso expansion for the dynamics that, unlike the usual approximation by a zzso equation zzso is well zzso Our approach extends the related system size expansion by giving an expansion for the probability density as well as its zzso We apply the approach to two observed zzso learning rules and show that in regimes where the zzso breaks down, the new zzso expansion agrees well with zzso Carlo zzso The methods are also zzso to the dynamics of zzso neural zzso Like previous ensemble analyses of zzso we focus on equilibrium solutions, although the methods can in principle be applied to zzso as zzso
