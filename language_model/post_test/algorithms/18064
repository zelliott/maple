zzso regulatory networks zzso can be described by differential equations with zzso logic which has been found in many natural zzso Identification of the network components and zzso rates are critical to the output behavior of the zzso Though zzso rates cannot be measured in zzso biologists have shown that they are zzso through artificial factors in zzso 

This study presents the theoretical research work on a novel zzso control and stability analysis of genetic regulatory zzso The proposed control scheme can drive the genetic regulatory network to desired levels by adjusting zzso zzso zzso stability proof is conducted with zzso argument for both zzso and additive noises zzso Computer simulation results show the effectiveness of the control design and zzso of the regulation scheme with additive zzso 

With the knowledge of interaction between zzso factors and gene products, the research results can be applied in the design of zzso experiments to regulate gene expression zzso
