zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso was investigated in a packed bed zzso zzso The experiments were conducted to study the effect of important design parameters such as bed height and flow zzso At a bed height of 20 zzso and flow rate of 5 zzso zzso the zzso capacity of zzso zzso and plain zzso flakes for zzso zzso was found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The bed depth service time zzso model was used to analyze the experimental zzso The zzso zzso capacity per unit bed volume zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g zzso for plain and zzso flakes respectively at zzso breakthrough zzso The rate constant zzso was recorded as zzso and zzso L zzso for plain and zzso zzso zzso In flow rate experiments, the results confirmed that the metal zzso capacity and the metal removal efficiency of plain and zzso zzso decreased with increasing flow zzso The Thomas model was used to fit the column zzso data at different flow rates and model zzso were zzso The column was successfully applied for the removal of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Five hundred bed volumes of zzso wastewater were treated in column experiments using this zzso reducing the zzso of zzso zzso from 10 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
