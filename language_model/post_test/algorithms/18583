Imaging studies and quantitative zzso zzso have often, but not consistently, implicated the left zzso and the prefrontal zzso in zzso To help clarify this picture, a spatial filter shown to be effective for enhancing differences between zzso populations was combined with zzso electromagnetic zzso and used to compare the zzso zzso from a group of 57 male subjects with schizophrenia and a group of 65 matched zzso To elicit differences, comparisons were made during resting conditions and during verbal and spatial cognitive challenges to the zzso Estimates of the zzso density were derived from zzso recordings of the zzso reduced to the zzso alpha and beta frequency zzso The patients were zzso and were selected according to zzso zzso As a group, they were zzso chronic states with both deficit negative and superimposed florid psychotic zzso The results confirm that schizophrenia is a zzso disorder centered in the zzso and frontal zzso They also suggest that, in zzso functions normally performed by these regions in controls are assumed by zzso regions in the opposite zzso
