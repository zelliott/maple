zzso falls which is a major problem in the elderly population, might be linked to declines in the balance control function due to zzso Minimum foot clearance zzso which provides a more sensitive measure of the motor function of the locomotor system, has been identified as a potential gait zzso associated with zzso falls in older zzso This paper proposes zzso indexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso plot zzso of zzso zzso and investigates the relationship of zzso with derived indexes of elderly gait zzso The main aim is to find zzso zzso indexes that well correlate with balance zzso 

zzso data during treadmill walking for 14 healthy elderly and 10 elderly participants with balance problems and a history of falls zzso zzso were zzso using a zzso motion analysis zzso zzso and zzso plot indexes of all zzso data sets were calculated and zzso 

zzso relationships of mean zzso with zzso plot indexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso were found in the zzso elderly zzso On the other hand, such relationships were absent in the healthy elderly zzso In contrast, the zzso values of zzso data series were significantly zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso plot indexes of zzso in the healthy elderly group, whereas correlations were absent in the zzso zzso The zzso values in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso higher than that in the healthy group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The higher zzso values in the zzso group might indicate increased irregularities and randomness in their gait patterns and an indication of loss of gait control zzso zzso values of randomly shuffled zzso data of falls risk subjects did not show any significant relationship with mean zzso 

zzso have implication for zzso gait dynamics in normal and pathological conditions, thus could be useful for the early diagnosis of zzso zzso Further research should provide important information on whether falls prevention intervention can improve the gait performance of falls risk elderly by monitoring the change in zzso zzso zzso
