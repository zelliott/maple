zzso devices that provide zzso and zzso capability currently have limited ability to distinguish among different cardiac zzso We have investigated three methods of zzso analysis: rate, zzso and zzso zzso In 35 episodes in 19 patients, we applied these three zzso to 15 s recorded passages of zzso zzso during zzso zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso (N zzso zzso and zzso zzso (N zzso zzso Each was individually paired with a recording of zzso rhythm from the same zzso All recordings were obtained during standard zzso zzso Each zzso was successful at distinguishing the zzso from zzso rhythm at one or more levels of zzso zzso Rate alone zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso but did not distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso Rate combined with zzso distinguished between zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso distribution zzso was unable to separate perfectly any of the three zzso it provided the best performance in separating zzso and zzso zzso (82 percent sensitivity and zzso We conclude that zzso based on rate, zzso and zzso distribution analysis of zzso zzso may distinguish zzso rhythm from zzso but may not distinguish among zzso
