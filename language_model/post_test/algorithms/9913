The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics of zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso 

A total of 151 zzso were examined for zzso and zzso zzso and clinical and zzso parameters were evaluated and zzso statistically according to zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were detected in 123 zzso and 15 cases zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso were located in the stomach with no zzso and zzso deaths were zzso zzso parameters associated with zzso zzso were zzso and mixed type, low to moderate zzso moderate to severe zzso zzso zzso prominent zzso change, frequent zzso cells and zzso giant cells, increased cellular zzso low zzso count, and lower risk assessment zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso had unique zzso patterns, intermingling of zzso and zzso cells, and/or a zzso zzso arrangement of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso have distinctive zzso patterns that are differentiated from zzso zzso The zzso approach by a combination of several distinguishing zzso and zzso features between zzso and zzso zzso might be helpful in predicting the zzso gene of each zzso on pathological zzso
