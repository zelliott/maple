The increase of the amount of DNA sequences requires efficient zzso zzso for performing sequence comparison and zzso Standard zzso zzso are not able to compress DNA sequences because they do not consider special characteristics of DNA sequences zzso DNA sequences contain several approximate repeats and complimentary zzso Recently, new zzso have been proposed to compress DNA zzso often using detection of long approximate zzso The current work proposes a zzso zzso Algorithm zzso providing a new zzso zzso zzso achieves a better zzso ratio than that of existing zzso zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso and zzso
