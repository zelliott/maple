Although zzso technologies have benefited from statistical measures of data quality, zzso biologically relevant pathways from zzso zzso data remains a zzso Here we develop a quantitative method for evaluating zzso zzso We present a zzso zzso approach that uses statistical and zzso zzso to predict the biological relevance of zzso interactions obtained from zzso screens for zzso Other sources of information, including zzso zzso genetic interactions and database zzso are subsequently used to validate the model predictions without bias or zzso Novel zzso statistics show zzso organization of the network of zzso zzso protein complex interactions extend one to two zzso and genetic interactions represent an even finer scale of zzso zzso of the maximum number of links that indicates a significant correlation between protein pairs zzso distance) enables the integrated analysis of zzso data with data from zzso and gene zzso The type of analysis presented will be essential for analyzing the growing amount of zzso and zzso data in model organisms and zzso
