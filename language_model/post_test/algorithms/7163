In this paper, a digital audio processing chip which uses a wide dynamic range zzso zzso zzso is designed and implemented for zzso hearing aids zzso The designed chip operates at a single zzso of zzso and drives a 16 bit parallel input and output at 32 zzso zzso The designed chip has zzso zzso zzso composed of a zzso filter bank, a level zzso and a zzso zzso To verify the performance of the designed zzso we measured the frequency zzso of bands and zzso gain control to reflect the hearing threshold zzso
