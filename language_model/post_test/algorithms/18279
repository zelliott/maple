The purpose of this paper is to study the special forms of zzso dynamics that one can observe in systems with zzso zzso zzso systems of zzso zzso in which the zzso takes place via the distribution of primary resources that controls the zzso state of the individual zzso With this zzso a zzso zzso state with mixed high and zzso zzso in the individual units can zzso To examine generic phenomena associated with this type of interaction we consider a chain of zzso coupled electronic zzso connected to a common power zzso The zzso system displays zzso zzso and it is interesting to note that zzso zzso continue to exist outside of the zzso range in which zzso occur for the individual zzso At low zzso strengths, the zzso system shows high zzso zzso with little tendency for zzso At higher zzso strengths, one typically observes spatial zzso involving a few zzso zzso We describe three different scenarios according to which the cluster can slide along the chain as the bias zzso zzso
