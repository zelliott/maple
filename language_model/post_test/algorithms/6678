Speech zzso was investigated by varying the number of interfering zzso level, and mean pitch differences between target and interfering speech, and the presence of tactile zzso In a first experiment the zzso threshold zzso for sentences was measured for a male zzso against a background of one to eight interfering male zzso or speech zzso Speech was presented zzso and zzso support was given by presenting the zzso signal zzso zzso to the index zzso The benefit in the zzso resulting from tactile support ranged from 0 to zzso zzso and was largest for one or two interfering zzso A second experiment focused on masking effects of one interfering zzso The interference was the target zzso own voice with an increased mean pitch by 2, 4, 8, or 12 zzso Level differences between target and interfering speech ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso of correctly perceived words in sentences show an zzso increase of up to zzso due to tactile zzso Performance gradually improves with increasing pitch zzso zzso target speech generally helps perception, but results for level differences are considerably dependent on pitch zzso zzso in performance between noise and speech zzso and between speech zzso with various mean pitches are explained by the effect of informational zzso
