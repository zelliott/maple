The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of aromatic compounds and zzso zzso by an zzso enrichment culture grown on zzso and dominated by a unique zzso zzso were zzso The average k and zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in g per g zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in these measured zzso was noted between tests conducted over the zzso period during which the zzso culture with a zzso zzso retention time was zzso the zzso of variation of the k and zzso values ranged from zzso and zzso zzso This variation was significantly greater than the method measurement error on a given zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be described by a basic competitive zzso zzso zzso tests during which the culture was fed individual zzso compounds showed the culture grew poorly on the zzso and had poor subsequent zzso degradation zzso This work indicates the potential to simultaneously treat a mixture of volatile organic compounds using this zzso and the ability to predict the mixture zzso rates on the basis of the individual compound zzso zzso
