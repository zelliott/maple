This paper proposes an zzso image enhancement method for zzso images, which is based on the first zzso and the local zzso The zzso enhancement method consists of three processing zzso The first step is to remove the film artifacts which may be misread as zzso The second step is to zzso the zzso images by using the first zzso zzso The third step is to enhance the important features of the zzso image by adding the zzso weighted zzso zzso Local statistics of the image are zzso for zzso realization of the enhancement, so that image details can be enhanced and image noises can be zzso The objective performances of the proposed method were compared with those by the conventional image enhancement methods for a simulated image and the seven zzso images containing real zzso The performance of the proposed method was also evaluated by means of the receiver zzso zzso analysis for 78 real zzso images with and without zzso
