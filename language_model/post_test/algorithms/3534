CT zzso studies to date have used a standard CT zzso To determine whether zzso zzso may result in better performance of CT zzso we conducted a zzso zzso study of the effect of the reconstruction zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

CT zzso of patients with proven zzso masses, or zzso folds was performed on an zzso zzso and the images were reconstructed using the standard, soft, zzso and detail zzso Two experiments were zzso The first used four patient data sets of a short segment of colon zzso zzso each reconstructed using all four zzso and then viewed on a zzso in a zzso format that allowed all four reconstructions to be viewed zzso The second used six sets of zzso images (four or eight images zzso images within each set differed only in the reconstruction zzso used to generate them zzso sets were prepared with two different level zzso zzso zzso with varying levels of experience who were unaware of the purpose of the study were asked to rank the images within each set according to their value in the detection of either zzso or zzso 

zzso showed statistically significant differences in preference for the four zzso zzso zzso zzso in the computer-based zzso for the zzso experiment, p zzso zzso for the zzso sets and p zzso zzso for the zzso zzso In the computer-based experiment, zzso preferred the detail zzso to the standard zzso with an estimated probability of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and the soft zzso over the standard zzso with an estimated probability of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso with the most experience zzso interpreted at least 250 zzso preferred the soft zzso over the standard zzso by the same zzso margin as observed for the detail zzso In contrast, the standard and detail zzso were ranked similarly in the zzso experiment, with the soft and lung zzso ranked zzso 

To our knowledge, ours is the first observer study on the effect of the reconstruction zzso on zzso of folds and zzso in CT zzso Our results indicate significant differences in the reconstruction zzso with the soft and detail zzso being preferred over the standard zzso by experienced zzso when interpreting images on a zzso These results indicate the need for further research into the effect of reconstruction zzso on CT zzso
