The necessity for using adequate beam zzso in diagnostic zzso is well zzso Although aluminum is the most widely used filter material for diagnostic zzso applications, the possibility that other materials might have superior properties has prompted a number of studies that have attempted to determine both the type and the amount of zzso most appropriate for a given zzso This paper describes a method based on precise matching of spectral shape that permits the absolute ranking of zzso zzso zzso of spectral shape ensures equality of such parameters as image contrast and patient zzso zzso equivalent filters can then be ranked on the basis of the transmission of one relative to zzso Following the development of the theory behind the method and an zzso for implementing it, the method is applied to the evaluation of a variety of materials for use as filters in diagnostic zzso Experimental zzso of a few of the calculated results is also zzso Both calculated and experimental results show that normal aluminum filters are about zzso less efficient than filters of materials such as copper, zzso or zzso Since the approach followed here was the basis for several early investigations of zzso for zzso therapy, a brief comparison of results from these early reports with results calculated using the method developed here is also zzso
