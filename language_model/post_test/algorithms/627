To provide a nontechnical discussion of the development of a zzso care zzso zzso and some policy implications of its zzso 

zzso zzso care patients who, in a three month period, had zzso episodes of care provided by 58 zzso care services in Australia and New zzso 

A detailed clinical and service zzso profile was collected on each patient with staff time and other resources measured on a daily zzso A statistical summary of the clinical variables was compiled as the first stage of the zzso 

zzso care phase was found to be a good predictor of resource use, with patients fairly evenly distributed across the five zzso Clients treated in an zzso setting had poorer function and higher symptom severity scores than those treated in an ambulatory setting, a result that is not surprising in this Australian zzso 

Implementation of the zzso zzso zzso has been proceeding since 1998 in some Australian zzso The development and zzso of a zzso such as zzso provides the possibility of having a consistent approach to collecting zzso care data in Australia as well as a growing body of experience on how to progressively improve the zzso over zzso
