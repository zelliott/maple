We extend the traditional diffusion theory by distinguishing between the energy zzso in the forward and backward directions at each point in zzso This approach leads to a new effective source for the diffusion equation that is zzso for an zzso light zzso It differs significantly from the diffusion theory for short zzso zzso We derive an zzso solution for the two zzso zzso moments of the zzso
