We propose a novel technique for melting and burning solid materials, including the simulation of the resulting liquid and zzso The solid is simulated with traditional zzso techniques zzso or zzso which enable robust handling of both zzso and rigid objects, collision and zzso rolling, friction, zzso zzso The subsequently created liquid or gas is simulated with modern zzso techniques, including zzso confinement and the particle level set zzso The main advantage of our method is that state-of-the-art techniques are used for both the solid and the fluid without compromising simulation quality when zzso them together or converting one into the zzso For example, we avoid modeling zzso as zzso zzso zzso with high zzso or zzso which would zzso the handling of thin shells, zzso rolling, zzso Thus, our method allows one to achieve new effects while still using their favorite zzso (and zzso for simulating both zzso and zzso whereas other zzso zzso require major zzso and zzso zzso and still fail to produce rich zzso effects zzso melting and burning zzso
