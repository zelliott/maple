The goal of this research was to determine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suspension versus zzso zzso zzso solution zzso for treatment of acute zzso media in zzso tube zzso 

A zzso model was used to emulate the zzso treatment of acute zzso media in patients with zzso zzso The economic outcome was the cost per zzso day zzso achieved per episode of zzso Three tiers of zzso therapy were zzso with each successive tier representing the zzso of clinical failures from the preceding zzso zzso therapy compared CD and zzso using outcome measures obtained from a zzso clinical trial zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy modeled the use of zzso zzso using outcome measures obtained from a physician survey and medical zzso zzso therapy was modeled as zzso and zzso It could follow one of three zzso 1) intramuscular zzso 2) oral zzso or 3) hospitalization for intravenous zzso zzso outcomes were based on a physician zzso Cost data were obtained from standard references and presented from a payer zzso 

The expected therapeutic costs were zzso dollars for the CD zzso and zzso dollars for the zzso zzso The estimated number of zzso per episode of care was zzso for the CD zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso ratios for CD and zzso therapies were zzso dollars and zzso dollars per zzso zzso 

CD is both more effective and less costly than zzso for the treatment of acute zzso media in patients with zzso zzso
