The authors discuss the role of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso A mathematical model of the zzso zzso zzso was derived and the zzso theory was used to zzso zzso properties of the zzso The zzso results were zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the nature of zzso emerging under sustained stimulation of the system, depends on the interplay between the zzso zzso zzso stimulation and the zzso action of zzso The authors found a mathematical relation that defines zzso in zzso and zzso levels for which the properties of zzso are zzso and changes in the stimulation can be compensated by modulating zzso zzso On the other hand, the shifting from the current zzso provokes zzso in either the zzso (for stronger zzso or the frequency (for weaker zzso
