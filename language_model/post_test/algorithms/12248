To investigate 57 failed zzso procedures in 30 consecutive knees to determine factors that may have contributed to the zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

Thirty patient records were reviewed by an independent zzso The index zzso operations were done for 13 acute and 17 chronic knee zzso The anterior cruciate ligament was zzso in 17 knees, the zzso cruciate ligament was torn in 5 knees, and both zzso were zzso in 8 zzso In 25 knees, 46 revision zzso procedures had been performed, of which 27 had also failed (in 21 zzso Five knees did not undergo revision of the zzso zzso 

In 22 knees, multiple factors were identified that most likely contributed to the failure of the zzso zzso The most common factors were zzso graft reconstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and failure to successfully reconstruct all zzso knee ligaments, including zzso (27 zzso Thirty-nine anterior cruciate ligament procedures were done in 24 knees, including 24 primary and 15 revision zzso zzso zzso cruciate ligament procedures were done in 13 knees, including 13 primary and 4 revision zzso At the time of writing, 16 of 24 knees had a functional anterior cruciate ligament graft and 5 of 13 had a functional zzso cruciate ligament zzso 

The results suggest greater emphasis during the index operation for anatomical graft reconstruction of one or more of the zzso structures as necessary, restoration of all zzso cruciate ligaments, and correction of zzso zzso
