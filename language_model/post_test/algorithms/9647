zzso observer models developed for studies with the external noise paradigm are strictly zzso only to target detection or zzso of zzso zzso We elaborated the zzso template model zzso to account for contrast thresholds in identifying zzso zzso Full contrast zzso functions were measured in an orientation identification task with four orientation differences across a wide range of external noise zzso We showed that observer performance can be modeled by the elaborated zzso with two templates that zzso to the two stimulus zzso zzso efficiencies of the human observers were also zzso The elaborated zzso provides a theoretical framework for characterizing joint feature and contrast sensitivity of human zzso
