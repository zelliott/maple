The high content of repetitive sequences in the zzso of many higher zzso renders the task of zzso them zzso zzso zzso the only widely accepted method of searching and zzso zzso elements zzso in large zzso sequences is the use of the zzso program, which identifies new copies of zzso by zzso sequence comparisons with a library of known zzso Profile hidden zzso models zzso have been used successfully in discovering distant zzso of known proteins in large protein databases, but this approach has only rarely been applied to known model TE families in zzso zzso 

We used a combination of zzso approaches to zzso the zzso in the finished zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we discuss the strengths and the weaknesses of the zzso methods zzso These approaches zzso the default zzso of zzso using zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso for similarity zzso and the zzso package, used to search for zzso with profile zzso All the results were converted into zzso format and zzso using a set of zzso zzso zzso was used in the case of most TE zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was found to be zzso faster than zzso with only a slight loss in sensitivity and was thus used to obtain the final set of zzso zzso was used in the zzso of the zzso element zzso zzso and the miniature zzso zzso element zzso zzso group of families, for which large libraries of elements were available and which could be divided into zzso zzso The zzso search zzso was extremely slow for models over 1000 zzso in zzso so zzso families with members over 1000 zzso long were processed with zzso zzso The main disadvantage of zzso in this application is that, since it was developed with protein sequences in mind, it does not search the negative DNA zzso With the exception of TE families with essentially zzso zzso reverse complement models had to be created and run to compensate for this zzso We conclude that a modification of zzso to incorporate libraries of profile zzso in searches could improve the ability to detect zzso copies of zzso 

The zzso scripts and TE sequences used in construction of the zzso library and the profile zzso are available upon zzso
