Due to anatomical zzso across subjects many brain mapping experiments have analysis focused on a few particular regions of interest so as to circumvent the problem of zzso statistics resulting from the lack of anatomical correspondence across zzso Since the zzso distribution of experimental effects across the zzso is also often of interest, two separate analyses are often conducted, one on the regions of interest alone, as well as a separate zzso zzso analysis with zzso spatial correspondence across zzso In this paper we present a new group alignment procedure which zzso from each subject, both zzso zzso information and functional information from standard zzso zzso After specifying appropriate parameters to weight anatomical and functional alignment forces, we were able to create a group cortical reconstruction which was well aligned in terms of both anatomical and functional zzso We observed an increase in the overlap of functional areas as well as an improvement in group statistics following this integrated alignment zzso We propose that, using this alignment zzso two separate analyses may not be necessary as both analyses can be integrated into a single zzso After an integrated structural and functional alignment one is able to carry out a whole brain analysis with improved statistical sensitivity due to the reduction in spatial variation in the location of functional regions of interest which zzso zzso Furthermore, regions in the vicinity of zzso and aligned zzso will also benefit from the integrated zzso
