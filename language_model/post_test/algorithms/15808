Because of the differences in the interactions of ultrasound and zzso waves with bone, quantitative ultrasound zzso techniques may yield information about skeletal status not accessible by regular bone zzso zzso zzso However, relatively strong correlations have been reported between zzso ultrasound zzso zzso and several zzso BD zzso We assessed the precision and association of single zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso We examined both zzso and zzso at the zzso using special software for matching the regions of zzso An zzso was derived and applied to correct the observed correlation zzso for the zzso effect caused by the precision errors for zzso and zzso In a group of 33 volunteers covering a wide range of age and zzso bone mineral zzso the zzso and zzso correlation zzso between zzso and zzso was r zzso zzso with a standard error of the estimate zzso of zzso zzso or zzso For the zzso of 25 women the correlation was stronger, with r zzso zzso and SEE zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso precision was zzso for the regular region of interest zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso precision was zzso for the entire subject group and zzso for women of age 40 or zzso The observed correlation zzso between ultrasound and zzso based techniques of the order of zzso is zzso but it leaves about 50% of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
