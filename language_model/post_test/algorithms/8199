In the zzso hospital, zzso zzso treatments are performed with a zzso zzso zzso equipped with a zzso zzso zzso generally using the dynamic zzso arc zzso Patient zzso during the treatment is achieved with a fixation mask supplied by zzso made with two reinforced zzso sheets fitting the patient's zzso With this work the authors propose a method to evaluate treatment geometric accuracy and, consequently, to determine the amount of the margin to keep in the zzso expansion during the treatment zzso The zzso of the zzso position was tested by simulating a complete treatment on the zzso phantom zzso zzso inserting in between two phantom slices a high sensitivity zzso zzso film, properly prepared and zzso and repeating several treatment sessions, each time removing the fixing mask and replacing the film inside the zzso The comparison between the dose zzso measured on films and zzso by zzso after a precise image registration procedure performed by a commercial piece of software zzso zzso LLC zzso of zzso Wayne, zzso allowed the authors to measure the repositioning zzso obtaining about zzso zzso in case of central zzso zzso and about zzso zzso in case of peripheral irregular zzso Moreover, an evaluation of the errors in the registration procedure was performed, giving negligible values with respect to the quantities to be zzso The above intrinsic two-dimensional estimate of treatment accuracy has to be increased for the error in the third dimension, but the 2 zzso margin the authors generally use for the zzso expansion seems adequate zzso Using the same zzso films, a zzso zzso of the treatment planning system was zzso Measured dose values are larger or smaller than the nominal ones depending on geometric zzso conditions, but, in the zzso experimental conditions, always within zzso
