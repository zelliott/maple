zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso have seen increasing use to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests that yield continuous test zzso We can calculate a fully zzso zzso curve from the empirical false positive rate zzso and true positive rate zzso at each possible decision zzso but it may be quite zzso We can obtain a smooth zzso curve by directly fitting a zzso model, for example, zzso or zzso to the actual test results, but substantial zzso may result if the zzso assumptions are not zzso A recently proposed alternative zzso zzso is insensitive to such departures, but is not fully flexible in that the form of the resulting zzso curve is restricted to be zzso We propose a smooth zzso zzso curve derived from kernel density estimates of the two test result zzso We obtain zzso standard errors for the estimated zzso at each zzso and use them to construct zzso confidence intervals for the zzso curve, using a zzso zzso We also obtain standard errors for the estimated zzso and zzso at given thresholds and use them to construct confidence zzso in zzso zzso that zzso to a specific zzso We adapt existing methods for the zzso zzso zzso curve to obtain the area under the zzso curve and its standard error; we also give partial areas and corresponding standard zzso We have created a zzso zzso zzso available upon zzso We compare zzso zzso and areas obtained by applying our methods and its competitors to two data sets, one of which is fit well by zzso methods and zzso the other of which is zzso
