To investigate the significance of zzso quantitative evaluation of zzso fat using ultrasound zzso signal zzso 

Thirty two zzso rats were divided into two groups, with 24 having fatty zzso and 8 serving as normal zzso zzso signals were sampled with a zzso ultrasound probe and digitized at 40 zzso in zzso zzso Four statistical parameters of the zzso envelope zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso were calculated offline, and their ability to diagnose fatty liver was zzso 

The rats with fatty zzso had greater Mean and zzso but lower zzso and zzso than the zzso The areas under the zzso curve of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosing fatty zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for diagnosing fatty zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas conventional ultrasound achieved only zzso in sensitivity and zzso in zzso 

Compared with conventional zzso zzso signal analysis is more accurate in diagnosing fatty zzso
