The first purpose of the study was to zzso zzso the detection of prior inferior zzso zzso zzso and prior anterior zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The second purpose was to compare the diagnostic performances of the new criteria with those of 3 widely used commercial diagnostic zzso zzso 

We analyzed the digital zzso data from zzso subjects with suspected coronary artery disease in whom the presence or absence of prior zzso or zzso was documented by coronary zzso and left zzso We used receiver operating characteristic zzso to develop the new criteria for prior zzso and zzso using a training set of zzso subjects and then tested their diagnostic performances using a separate test set of zzso zzso In both the training and test sets, we used zzso test to compare the performances of the new criteria with those of 3 commercial computerized diagnostic zzso 

The best criterion for prior zzso was the zzso sum of the Q and T zzso in leads III and zzso Its zzso were zzso and zzso in the training and test sets, zzso The best criterion for prior zzso was the zzso sum of the zzso zzso and T zzso minus the Q duration in leads zzso zzso and zzso Its zzso were zzso and zzso in the training and test sets, zzso In both the training and test sets, these diagnostic performances were generally superior to those of the 3 commercial zzso 

Using digital zzso data, we developed and tested new criteria for prior zzso and zzso whose diagnostic performances are generally superior to each of 3 widely used commercial zzso diagnostic zzso
