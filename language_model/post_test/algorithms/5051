zzso hormone zzso is an integral component in the cascade regulating the behaviors culminating in emergence of an insect from its old zzso Little is known regarding the zzso solution zzso consequently, we zzso a zzso approach to generate a hypothetical structure for zzso zzso zzso The de zzso zzso exploited the restricted zzso space of zzso bonds zzso zzso and zzso and predicted secondary structure elements to generate a zzso stable structure characterized by zzso zzso content, an zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso loop containing zzso and zzso Both the strain and zzso energies of the predicted zzso compare favorably with those of known zzso The zzso acid zzso was zzso zzso zzso for activity, and structurally characterized to confirm the zzso of the zzso The zzso content is supported by circular zzso and zzso exchange mass zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso and zzso zzso are consistent with the zzso exposure predicted for zzso which is zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso stable zzso that deviated only slightly from the predicted zzso zzso structure were generated in zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso is not zzso In addition, the biological activities of known zzso and deletion peptides were rationalized with the predicted zzso zzso structure, and we found that, on the basis of sequence zzso functionally important zzso map to two zzso zzso clusters incorporating the zzso and the first zzso
