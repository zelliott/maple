To meet the demands of large-scale sequencing, thousands of clones must be zzso and assembled into zzso To determine the order of zzso a typical experiment is to digest the clones with one or more restriction zzso and measure the resulting zzso The probability of two clones overlapping is based on the similarity of their zzso A zzso contains two or more overlapping clones and a minimal zzso path of clones is selected to be zzso zzso software with zzso support is necessary to assemble the clones into zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is an interactive program for building zzso from restriction zzso zzso zzso uses an zzso to cluster clones into zzso based on their probability of coincidence zzso For each zzso it builds a consensus band zzso map which is similar to a restriction zzso but it does not try to resolve all the zzso The CB map is used to assign coordinates to the clones based on their alignment to the map and to provide a detailed zzso of the clone zzso zzso has editing facilities for the user to refine the coordinates and to remove poorly zzso zzso zzso are available for updating an zzso database with new zzso zzso can easily be zzso split or zzso zzso can be added to clones and are displayed with the appropriate zzso zzso clones can be selected and their sequencing status zzso As such, zzso is an integrated program for the assembly of zzso clones for large-scale sequencing zzso
