Cell zzso in phase contrast zzso images lays a crucial foundation for numerous subsequent zzso cell image analysis, but it encounters many zzso challenges due to image qualities and artifacts caused by phase contrast zzso Addressing the zzso challenges, the authors propose an interactive cell zzso scheme over phase zzso zzso After zzso the images into phase homogeneous zzso human zzso are zzso to zzso atoms over an affinity graph that is learned based on discrimination zzso Then, an active query strategy is proposed for which the most zzso zzso atom is selected for zzso which is also zzso to the other zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso to quality results after several rounds of interactions involving both the user's intentions and characteristics of image zzso Experimental results demonstrate that cells with different optical properties are well segmented via the proposed zzso
