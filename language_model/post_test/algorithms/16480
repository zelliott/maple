zzso zzso ultrasound is increasingly being introduced in the clinic for zzso and zzso zzso Various zzso exist for combining zzso images of regular ultrasound zzso to zzso volumes, being either zzso zzso or zzso Previously, the most commonly used input to zzso ultrasound reconstruction has been digitized analog zzso However, recent scanners that offer access to digital image frames exist, either as processed or zzso zzso To our knowledge, no comparison has been performed to determine which data source gives the best reconstruction zzso In the present study we compared both reconstruction zzso and data sources using novel comparison methods for detecting potential differences in image quality of the reconstructed zzso The ultrasound scanner used in this study was the zzso zzso from zzso Medical Corp zzso zzso a scanner that allow third party access to zzso and processed digital zzso The ultrasound probe used was the zzso linear zzso The assessment is based on a number of image criteria: zzso of wire targets, spatial resolution, zzso of small barely visible structures, zzso tissue image quality, and volume zzso In addition we have also performed the more zzso comparison of reconstructed volumes by removing a percentage of the input zzso By using these evaluation methods and data from the specific zzso the results showed that the processed video performed better than the digital zzso data, digital video being better than analog zzso Furthermore, the results showed that the choice of video source was more important than the choice of tested reconstruction zzso
