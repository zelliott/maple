Two experiments are presented that measure the acuity of zzso processing of modulated zzso level differences zzso using zzso zzso In both experiments, dynamic zzso were created by imposing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal on zzso carriers, which were presented over zzso In the first experiment, the sensitivity to dynamic zzso was measured as a function of the zzso frequency using zzso and zzso correlated and zzso zzso noise zzso The intrinsic zzso level fluctuations of the zzso noise carriers raised the zzso zzso detection thresholds with respect to the zzso zzso The zzso fluctuations of the correlated noise carriers also caused a small increase in the thresholds over the zzso carriers, particularly with low zzso zzso zzso The second experiment investigated the zzso frequency selectivity in dynamic zzso processing by imposing an zzso zzso zzso noise AM zzso in series with the zzso zzso AM signal on a zzso zzso By varying the zzso center zzso relative to the signal zzso frequency, broadly zzso zzso patterns were zzso zzso with an existing zzso model show that a zzso filter to limit the zzso zzso resolution is not sufficient to predict the results of the zzso
