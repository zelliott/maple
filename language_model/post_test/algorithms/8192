To investigate the feasibility of zzso balanced zzso free zzso zzso fast chemical shift mapping zzso zzso zzso The overall goal was to reduce total imaging time and to increase spatial resolution compared to common chemical shift imaging zzso 

A zzso zzso sequence in combination with an zzso reconstruction zzso was zzso zzso experiments were performed on zzso and on a human volunteer in order to investigate the feasibility of the method on a system with zzso maps that are known zzso zzso experiments were performed in zzso on zzso where zzso images were acquired also for zzso 

Chemical shift images of three and four distinct zzso resonance zzso as well as chemical shift images of up to five zzso zzso zzso were successfully zzso 

Fast zzso mapping based on zzso balanced zzso in combination with an zzso reconstruction approach could successfully separate several zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
