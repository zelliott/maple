It is difficult to test zzso zzso instruments in zzso Therefore we constructed a liquid phantom which mimics the zzso zzso It consists of a zzso zzso zzso thick layer of silicone rubber simulating skin and bone and a zzso zzso thick clear layer of zzso imitating zzso zzso It acts as container for a liquid solution with zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso and zzso The solution was zzso using oxygen and then zzso by the zzso From the instrumental zzso zzso algorithm, we found that with increasing scattering zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the reading was increasingly offset from the expected value of 0 zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This reduced the range of the oxygen zzso reading from the expected zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration changes were increasingly underestimated by a factor of two to zzso For a second zzso based on the diffusion approximation the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The range of the oxygen zzso reading was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Concentration changes were underestimated by a factor of six to zzso This study demonstrates the need to develop zzso which take into consideration anatomical zzso
