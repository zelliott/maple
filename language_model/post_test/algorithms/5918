One important technique common throughout surgery is achieving proper exposure of critical zzso structures so that their shapes, which may vary somewhat among patients, can be confidently established and zzso In this paper, we present an zzso for determining which regions of selected structures are properly exposed in the context of a zzso zzso Furthermore, our zzso then finds and displays all other points along the surface of the structure that lie along a sufficiently short and straight path from an exposed portion such that their locations can be safely zzso Finally, we present an zzso for providing realistic visual cues about underlying structures with zzso zzso of the zzso
