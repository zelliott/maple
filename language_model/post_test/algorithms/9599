In bacterial photosynthesis zzso complexes, zzso and zzso absorb sunlight energy and deliver it to reaction centers zzso with extraordinarily high zzso zzso resolution images have revealed that both the zzso ratio, and the architecture of the zzso membrane itself, adapt to light zzso We investigate the functional implications of structural adaptations in the energy transfer performance in natural in zzso low- and zzso membrane zzso of zzso zzso A model is presented to describe zzso migration across the full range of light zzso that cover states from active photosynthesis, where all zzso are available for charge zzso to saturated photosynthesis where all zzso are zzso Our study outlines three key zzso First, there is a critical zzso density, below which the zzso adapted membrane is more efficient at absorbing photons and generating a charge separation at zzso than the zzso zzso Second, connectivity of core complexes is similar in both zzso suggesting that, despite different growth conditions, a preferred transfer zzso is through zzso zzso Third, there may be minimal zzso on the membrane which, containing the same zzso ratio, behave as minimal functional units as far as zzso transfer efficiency is zzso
