zzso in zzso using zzso zzso models have emerged as an important tool in molecular systems zzso zzso zzso software for such applications poses several zzso zzso realistic zzso modeling for biological applications requires a consistent way of handling complex zzso including curved zzso and outer zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations are zzso expensive due to the fast time scales of individual zzso and diffusion events when compared to the biological phenomena of actual zzso We therefore argue that simulation software needs to be both zzso efficient, employing sophisticated zzso yet in the same time flexible in order to meet present and future needs of increasingly complex biological zzso 

We have developed zzso a flexible software framework for general zzso zzso modeling and zzso zzso uses zzso triangular and zzso zzso to resolve general zzso and relies on the zzso Master zzso zzso to model the processes under zzso An interface to a mature geometry and mesh handling external software zzso zzso provides for a stable and interactive environment for model zzso The core simulation routines are logically separated from the model building interface and written in a low-level language for zzso zzso The connection to the geometry handling software is realized via a zzso interface which zzso script zzso data management, and zzso For practitioners, the software therefore behaves much as an interactive zzso zzso At the same time, it is possible to modify and extend zzso with newly developed simulation zzso Since the overall design effectively hides the complexity of managing the geometry and zzso this means that newly developed methods may be tested in a realistic setting already at an early stage of zzso 

In this paper we zzso in a series of examples with high relevance to the molecular systems biology community, that the proposed software framework is a useful tool for both practitioners and developers of spatial zzso simulation zzso Through the combined efforts of zzso development and improved modeling zzso increasingly complex biological models become feasible to study through zzso zzso zzso is freely available at zzso
