In this paper, a model of zzso function is implemented and evaluated in the control of a robot eye zzso by zzso artificial zzso The investigated control problem is stabilization of the visual image in response to zzso This is analogous to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso model is structurally based on the zzso zzso and the learning rule is zzso analogous to zzso squares, where zzso adaptation at the parallel zzso cell zzso is driven by the correlation of the sensory error signal zzso by the climbing zzso and the motor command zzso zzso of the zzso is first analyzed in simulation on a model of the robot and then tested online in both one and two degrees of zzso The results show that this model of neural function successfully works on a real-world problem, providing empirical evidence for zzso 1) the generic zzso learning zzso 2) the function of the zzso in the zzso and 3) the signal transmission between functional neural components of the zzso
