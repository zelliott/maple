The present study evaluated the nutritious potential of 18 zzso all native of the Brazilian zzso zzso zzso contents were determined by zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso acid and zzso contents by a zzso and zzso method, zzso and the potential mineral zzso by the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso nut showed the highest zzso copper, iron, zzso and zzso content, and, together with zzso showed also the highest calcium content and caloric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fruits were classified as a source of zzso The zzso and zzso nut had the highest concentration of zzso acid and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were higher than the critical values zzso and 10, zzso only in the zzso nuts, which suggests that iron and zinc zzso is low in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso ratios were lower than the critical value zzso in all analyzed zzso which suggests that calcium is zzso in the zzso
