zzso zzso zzso zzso with a pulse wave zzso is used to investigate the zzso composite scattering from a zzso infinitely long target with arbitrary cross section located above a zzso randomly rough zzso The zzso calculation is performed with a pulse wave zzso and the zzso representative zzso scattered field in the far zone is obtained directly by zzso the currently calculated data on the output zzso Then the zzso zzso scattering result is acquired by transforming the representative zzso field to the frequency domain with a zzso zzso Taking the composite scattering of an infinitely long cylinder above rough surface as an example, the zzso response in the far zone by zzso with the zzso zzso is zzso and it shows a good agreement with the zzso result by zzso with the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso radar cross section zzso from a zzso target above zzso rough surface versus the incident frequency, and the representative scattered fields in the far zone versus the time are analyzed in zzso
