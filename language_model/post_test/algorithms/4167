One of the main challenges in modern medicine is to zzso different patient groups in terms of underlying disease molecular mechanisms as to develop more personalized approach to zzso Here we propose novel method for disease zzso based on analysis of activated expression regulators on a zzso zzso Our approach relies on zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso which identifies gene zzso with significant zzso changes in expression between two zzso zzso consists of central regulator and downstream genes connected by relations extracted from global zzso regulation zzso Regulators found in each patient separately are clustered together and assigned activity scores which are used for final patients zzso We show that our approach performs well compared to other related methods and at the same time provides researchers with complementary level of understanding of zzso biology behind a disease by identification of significant expression zzso We have observed the reasonable grouping of zzso disorders zzso by structural damage vs triggered by unknown zzso that was not revealed using standard expression profile zzso For another experiment we were able to suggest the clusters of regulators, responsible for zzso zzso vs zzso discrimination and identify frequently genetically changed regulators that could be of specific importance for the individual characteristics of cancer zzso zzso approach can be regarded as biologically meaningful feature selection, reducing tens of thousands of genes down to dozens of clusters of zzso zzso clusters of regulators make possible to generate valuable biological hypotheses about molecular mechanisms related to a clinical outcome for individual zzso
