White blood cell detection is one of the most basic and key steps in the automatic recognition system of white blood cells in microscopic blood zzso Its accuracy and stability greatly affect the operating speed and recognition accuracy of the whole zzso But there are only a few methods available for cell detection or zzso due to the complexity of the microscopic zzso This paper focuses on this zzso Based on the detailed analysis of the existing two zzso zzso followed by mathematical zzso zzso and the fuzzy logic zzso new detection zzso zzso based on fuzzy cellular neural networks is zzso zzso combines the advantages of zzso and the fuzzy logic method, and overcomes their zzso With zzso we can detect almost all white blood cells, and the zzso of each detected cell is nearly zzso Its zzso is strong and the running speed is expected to be comparatively high due to the easy hardware zzso of zzso Experimental results show good zzso
