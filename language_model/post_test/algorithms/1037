The goal of quality assurance zzso for a radiation zzso medical zzso is to maintain an acceptable level of equipment performance and zzso The increasing complexity of zzso Oncology equipment and treatment techniques have led to increased demands on the work load of the medical zzso Regular testing needs to be as efficient as zzso Generally, the zzso tests, as recommended by the zzso Task Group 40 for medical zzso can be grouped into two zzso zzso and mechanical zzso A new zzso device has been developed that zzso many of the daily and monthly mechanical zzso zzso Its efficiency and speed is achieved through a set of zzso tools that are mounted on a single platform, which is designed to fit into the accessory mount of the medical zzso Named zzso zzso it verifies the accuracy of the digital zzso for zzso angles, zzso angles, and field zzso It also tests zzso position, the optical distance indicator zzso and patient setup laser zzso It uses two zzso digital levels for the zzso and zzso angle zzso an electronic tape measure for zzso zzso and a zzso transparent projection scale for the remaining zzso This paper evaluates the stability and accuracy of the device in clinical tests over a period of a zzso zzso show that the zzso is reliable and capable of measuring zzso and zzso angle constancy to zzso degrees, zzso constancy to zzso zzso and field size zzso to zzso zzso
