zzso zzso cells zzso are the only output zzso of the zzso and their zzso after damage to the zzso nerve or in glaucoma is a well established system for studying zzso in the central nervous zzso Frequently used procedures for assessing zzso number in retinal flat mounts suffer from two problems: zzso zzso are not uniform across retinal flat zzso and density measures may therefore not reflect total number, and flat mounts do not allow efficient use of zzso To overcome these problems we developed a zzso method for efficiently assessing zzso number in zzso sections of the zzso We zzso demonstrate that only approximately zzso sections need be assessed to accurately estimate the total number of zzso in the rat zzso providing ample tissue for additional studies in the same zzso and saving considerably on more exhaustive sampling zzso Using this method, we estimate that there are zzso zzso in the normal Brown Norway rat zzso These counts match well with estimates of zzso counts in zzso zzso In a pilot study of experimental glaucoma, we determined a reduction of zzso to zzso zzso The current technique should prove advantageous to assess zzso strategies in these experimental zzso
