Several zzso methods are available for determining the partition zzso of drug compounds in model zzso zzso but such methods provide little information at the molecular level about how the membrane affinity of drugs relates to their interactions with the zzso zzso A new zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso approach has been developed here that zzso the affinity of zzso small molecules for different zzso zzso and, zzso provides information on the mechanism of the zzso zzso In the example given, zzso zzso analysis of a zzso basic zzso pump inhibitor found that the drug zzso zzso into zzso of predominantly zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis also suggested that the membrane specificity of the drug was directly correlated to the ability of its zzso zzso to penetrate into the interior of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso approach could be of value in guiding medicinal chemistry toward or away from structures promoting interactions with specific types of biological zzso
