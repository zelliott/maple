The role of dynamic zzso in the initiation of zzso in diseased zzso hearts remains poorly zzso Using computer simulations, we studied the effects of altered zzso channel and cell zzso properties on the vulnerable window zzso for zzso in simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue with and without dynamic zzso We related the VW for zzso to effects on zzso zzso action potential duration zzso effective zzso period zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found the zzso zzso reduced zzso current density and slowed recovery promoted zzso zzso and enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso which increased the VW for zzso zzso zzso reduced cell zzso had little effect on cellular zzso properties and the VW for zzso However, randomly reduced cell zzso combined with decoupling promoted zzso zzso and zzso which also increased the VW for zzso zzso the combination of decreased zzso channel zzso slowed zzso channel recovery, and cellular zzso zzso increased the VW for zzso and 4) the VW for zzso was greater when zzso zzso slope was steep than when it was zzso In zzso altered zzso channel and cellular zzso properties increase vulnerability to zzso zzso In remodeled hearts with altered zzso channel properties and cellular zzso dynamic zzso arising from electrical zzso exert important influences on the VW for zzso
