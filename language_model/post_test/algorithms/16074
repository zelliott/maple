Several authors have employed finite element analysis for stress and strain analysis in zzso zzso Unfortunately, the definition of three-dimensional models is time consuming zzso because of the manual zzso meshing zzso and consequently the number of analyses to be performed is zzso The authors have investigated a new zzso method allowing automatically zzso mesh generation for structures as complex as bone for zzso This method, called the zzso zzso algorithm, generated automatically customized zzso zzso of anatomical structures from an already existing zzso The zzso zzso has been used to generate zzso models of 10 zzso human zzso from an initial one which had been zzso zzso The automatically generated zzso seemed to demonstrate satisfying zzso
