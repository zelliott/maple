This paper presents an edge enhancement nucleus and zzso zzso zzso detector to enable cutting the nucleus and zzso from a cervical zzso cell zzso To clean up noises from an image, this paper proposes a zzso filter that can effectively remove impulse and zzso noises but still preserves the sharpness of object zzso In addition, a zzso zzso is proposed to make a clear-cut separation of the zzso lying zzso two zzso A mean zzso difference zzso is presented to suppress the zzso of noises and also to brighten the zzso of object zzso What is more, a zzso measure is put forward to evaluate the zzso error between the extracted and target object zzso The experimental results show that all the aforementioned techniques proposed have performed zzso Other than for cervical zzso images, these proposed techniques can also be zzso in object zzso of other zzso
