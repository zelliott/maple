A detailed zzso study of the effect of small zzso white noise on a relaxation zzso undergoing a zzso zzso zzso is zzso The analysis reveals an intricate zzso zzso leading to several kinds of zzso zzso zzso at different levels of zzso of the zzso In the limit of strong zzso zzso five different zzso regimes for the noise zzso are zzso As the noise zzso is zzso the dynamics of the system goes from the limit cycle due to zzso zzso resonance to the zzso resonance limit cycle, then to bursting relaxation zzso followed by rare clusters of several relaxation cycles zzso and finally to zzso zzso (or stable fixed zzso with sporadic single zzso These scenarios are zzso by zzso zzso
